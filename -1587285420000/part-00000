Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The EIC won. The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816, which ceded some Nepalese controlled territory to the EIC.\n\nThe war was led by the EIC (a private company that was closely tied to the [[British Empire]]) with the support from native states; [[Garhwal Kingdom]], [[Patiala State]] and [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] against [[Kingdom of Gorkha]]. The war on the side of [[Kingdom of Gorkha]] was led mostly by the members of the larger Thapa caucus.{{refn|group=note|Bhimsen's nephew [[Ujir Singh Thapa]]{{sfn|Princep|1825|p=115}} commanded over the Butwal-Jitgadhi Axis while his brothers [[Ranbir Singh Thapa]] and [[Bakhtawar Singh Thapa]] commanded over the Makwanpur-Hariharpur Axis and Bijayapur-Sindhuligadhi Axis respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Nepalese Army |publisher=Nepal Army |url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np:80/history.php?page=two |website=nepalarmy.mil.np |accessdate=16 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228014557/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]] who was considered a member of the larger Thapa caucus,{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=26}} led the battle as overall commander against the columns of Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]] and Colonel [[David Ochterlony]]; his son [[Ranjore Thapa]] commanded the Nahan and Jaithak forts;{{sfn|Anon|1816|p=427}} and Ranjor's nephew [[Balbhadra Kunwar]]{{sfn|Acharya|1971b|p=3}} commanded the [[Dehradun|Doon region]] at [[Battle of Nalapani|Nalapani]].{{sfn|Princep|1825|p=93}}}}\n\n==Historical background==\n{{further|Unification of Nepal|Sino-Nepalese War|East India Company}}\nThe [[Shah dynasty|Shah]] era of Nepal began with the [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] king [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] invading [[Kathmandu]] valley, which consisted of the capital of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] confederacy. Until that time only the Kathmandu valley was referred to as Nepal. The confederacy requested help from the [[East India Company]] and an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 was led by Captain Kinlock  in 1767. The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkhali army easily overpowered those who had not succumb  to malaria or desperation . This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhali with a few firearms to arms themselves and make effective use of them.\n\nVictory and occupation of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] by Prithvi Narayan Shah, starting with the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], resulted in the shift of the capital of his kingdom from Gorkha to Kathmandu, and subsequently the empire that he and his descendants built came to be known as Nepal. Also, the invasion of the wealthy Kathmandu Valley provided the Gorkha army with economic support for furthering their martial ambitions throughout the region.\n\nTo the north however, aggressive raids into [[Tibet]] (concerning a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes) triggered Chinese intervention. In 1792 the [[Qianlong Emperor]] sent an army, expelling the Nepalese from Tibet to within {{convert|5|km}} of their capital at Kathmandu. Acting regent Bahadur Shah (Prithvi Naryan's younger son) appealed to the then British [[Governor-General]] of India for help. Anxious to avoid confrontation with the Chinese, the Governor-General did not send troops but sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator. However, before he arrived the war with China had finished. In 1789, Tibetan government stopped the usage of Nepalese coins for trade in Tibet, citing purity concerns over the copper and the silver coins minted by the Nepalese government,<ref>[[Historical money of Tibet]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}} which led to the first [[Nepal-Tibet war]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZD9--xYamkC |title=Britain and Tibet 1765\u20131947: A Select Annotated Bibliography of British Relations with Tibet and the Himalayan States Including Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan |isbn=9780415336475 |last1=Marshall |first1=Julie G. |year=2005}}</ref> A resounding victory of Gorkha forces over Tibetans in the first [[Nepal-Tibet war]] left the [[Potala Palace|Lhasa Durbar]] with no choice but to ask for assistance from the [[Qing Emperor]] in [[Peking]].

He was killed in the struggle in January 1804 and all his land annexed. Further west, general [[Amar Singh Thapa]] overran lands as far as [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] \u2013 the strongest fort in the hill region \u2013 and laid siege to it. However, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], the ruler of the [[Sikh]] state in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], intervened and drove the Nepalese army east of the [[Sutlej]] river by 1809.\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of India in 1805]]\nThe British were also expanding their sphere of influence at an alarming rate. While the Nepalese had been expanding their empire \u2013 into [[Sikkim]] in the east, [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] in the west and into the British sphere of influence in [[Awadh]], or Oudh as the British called it, in the south \u2013 the [[British East India Company]] had consolidated its position in India from its main bases of [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]] and [[Bombay]]. This British expansion had already been resisted in India, culminating in three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]] as well as in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] where [[Ranjit Singh]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] had their own aspirations.\n\n===Trade===\nThe economic cause constituted the major cause of conflict with Nepal. The British had made constant efforts to persuade the Nepalese government to allow them their trade to the fabled Tibet through Nepal. Despite a series of delegations headed by [[William Kirkpatrick (orientalist)|William Kirkpatrick]] (1792), Maulvi Abdul Qader (1795), and later William O. Knox (1801), the Nepalese Durbar refused to budge an inch. The resistance to open up the country to the Europeans could be summed up in a Nepalese precept, \"With the merchants come the musket and with the Bible comes the bayonet.\"\n\nLord Hasting was not averse to exploiting any commercial opportunities that access to the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was at this time in the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366</ref>\n\nSo when Hastings told the directors of the Company about an alternative means of remittance, a rare and precious raw material that could easily and profitably be shipped from India directly to London, they were at once interested. The raw material in question was a [[Cashmere wool|superior-quality wool]]: the exquisitely soft and durable animal down that had been used since time immemorial to make the famous wraps, or shawls, of Kashmir. This down was found only on the shawl-wool goat, and the shawl-wool goat was found only in certain areas of western Tibet. It refused to breed anywhere else. This all explains why, under the terms of the treaty of 1816, Nepal was required to surrender its far western provinces. Hastings hoped that this territory, partly annexed by the Company and partly restored to its previous rulers, would give British merchants direct access to the wool-growing areas.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366 \"/>\n\nSimilarly David Ochterlony, then an agent at Ludhiana, on 24 August 1814 noted of Dehra Dun as a \"potentially thriving entrepot for Trans-Himalayan trade.\" He contemplated annexing Garhwal not so much with the view to revenue, but for security of commercial communications with the country where the shawl wool is produced. The British soon got to know that Kumaon provided a better facility for trade with Tibet. Therefore, the annexation of these two areas became part of their strategic objectives.\n\n===Political safety===\nWhile trade was indeed a major objective of the Company, out of it grew a concept of \"political safety,\" which essentially meant a strategy of dissuasion and larger areas of occupation. The evidence does not support the claim that Hastings invaded Nepal only for commercial reasons. It was a strategic decision. He was wary of the Hindu revival and solidarity among the Marathas, the Sikhs, and the Gurkhas amid the decaying Mughal empire. He was hatching pre-emptive schemes of conquest against the Marathas in central India, and he needed to cripple Nepal first, in order to avoid having to fight on two fronts.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366 \"/>\n\nThat it was a flawed strategy is explained by [[Peter James Marshall|P.J. Marshal]]: \"Political safety meant military preparedness. The military expenditure for 1761\u201362 to 1770\u201371 was 44 percent of the total spending of 22 million pounds. War and diplomacy rather than trade and improvement; most of the soldiers-would-be politicians and Governor Generals rarely understood. The political safety of Bengal was their first priority and they interpreted safety as requiring the subjugation of Mysore, the Marathas, the Pindaris, the Nepalese and the Burmese.\"\n\n===Border dispute===\nThe acquisition of the [[Nawab of Awadh]]'s lands by the British East India Company brought the region of [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]] into the close proximity of the raja(king) of Palpa \u2013 the last remaining independent town within the Nepalese heartlands. Palpa and [[Butwal]] were originally two separate principalities; they were afterwards united under one independent Rajput prince, who, having conquered Butwal, added it to his hereditary possessions of Palpa. The lands of Butwal, though conquered and annexed, were yet held in fief, or paid an annual sum, first to Awadh, and afterwards, by transfer, to the British.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 425\">Anon (1816), p.425.</ref><ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\">Oldfield, p. 40.</ref> During the regency of Rani Rajendra Laxmi, towards the close of the 18th century, the hill country of Palpa was conquered and annexed to Nepal. The rajah retreated to Butwal, but was subsequently induced, under false promises of redress, to visit Kathmandu, where he was put to death, and his territories in Butwal seized and occupied by the Nepalese.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\">Oldfield, p. 40.</ref> [[Bhimsen Thapa]], the Nepalese prime minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. The occupation of Terai of Butwal from 1804 till 1812 by the Nepalese, which was under British protection, was the immediate reason which led to the Anglo-Nepalese war in 1814.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\"/><ref name=\"Smith, p. 172\">Smith, ''Warlike Preliminaries'', Ch. 8, p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"Prinsep, Ch. 2, ''Causes of Nipal War'', p. 54-80.\">Prinsep, Ch. 2, ''Causes of Nipal War'', p. 54-80.</ref>\n\nIn October 1813, the ambitious [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings]], the Earl of Moira, assumed the office of the Governor-General, and his first act was to re-examine the border dispute between Nepal and British East India Company. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Nepalese and the British. A struggle with the former was unpromising as the British were ignorant of the country or its resources and, despite their technological superiority, it was a received persuasion that the nature of the mountainous tract, which they would have to penetrate, would be as baffling to them as it had been to all the efforts of many successive Mahomedan sovereigns.<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\">Hastings, p. 9.</ref> A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. The Nepalese Commissioners had remarked to the British the futility of debating about a few square miles of territory since there never could be real peace between the two States, until the British should yield to the Nepalese all the British provinces north of the Ganges, making that river the boundary between the two, \"as heaven had evidently designed it to be.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\"/> However, Nepalese Historian [[Baburam Acharya]] contends that the British were striving to annex the hill regions of Nepal and were the ones responsible for creating border disputes. At the border demarcation, the British representative Major Bradshaw disrespected the Nepalese representatives \u2013 Rajguru [[Ranganath Poudyal]] and [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] [[Dalabhanjan Pande]], with a view of invoking a war against the Nepalese.{{sfn|Acharya|1971|p=3}} In the meantime, the British found that the Nepalese were preparing for war; that they had for some time been laying up large stores of saltpetre; purchasing and fabricating arms, and organizing and disciplining their troops under some European deserters in this service, after the model of the companies of East India's sepoy battalions.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 425\">Anon (1816), p.425.</ref> The conviction that the Nepalese raids into the flatlands of the [[Terai]], a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\"/> \u2013 the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between [[Calcutta]] and the northwest were under threat. Since there was no clear border, confrontation between the two powers was \"necessary and unavoidable\".<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 426\">Anon (1816), p.426.</ref> Britain formally declared war with the Nepal on 1 Nov 1814.<ref name=\"Smith, p. 187-212\">Smith, ''Britain's Declaration of War'', p. 187-212.</ref>\n\n==War preparation==\n[[File:Bhimsen-thapa-painting.jpg|upright|thumb|Bhimsen Thapa, prime minister of Nepal from 1806 to 1837.]]\n\n===Pre-war opinions===\nWhen the Kathmandu Durbar solicited Nepalese chiefs' opinions about a possible war with the British, Amar Singh Thapa was not alone in his opposition, declaring that \u2013 \"They will not rest satisfied without establishing their own power and authority, and will unite with the hill [[rajas]], whom we have dispossessed. We have hitherto but hunted deer; if we engage in this war, we must prepare to fight tigers.\"<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 460\">Prinsep, p. 460.</ref> He was against the measures adopted in Butwal and Sheeoraj, which he declared to have originated in the selfish views of persons, who scrupled not to involve the nation in war to gratify their personal avarice.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 460\">Prinsep, p. 460.</ref><ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 79-80\">Prinsep, p. 79-80.</ref>\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the prime minister of Nepal, Bhimsen Thapa \u2013 \" ... our hills and fastness are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable.\"<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 458\">Prinsep, p. 458: The entire letter by Bhimsen Thapa is as follows: \"Through the influence of your good fortune, and that of your ancestors, no one has yet been able to cope with the state of Nipal. The Chinese once made war upon us, but were reduced to seek peace. How then will the English be able to penetrate into the hills? Under your auspices, we shall by our own exertions be able to oppose to them a force of fifty-two lakhs of men, with which we will expel them. The small fort of Bhurtpoor was the work of man, yet the English being worsted before it, desisted from the attempt to conquer it; our hills and fastnesses are formed by the hand of God, and are impregnable. I therefore recommend the prosecution of hostilities. We can make peace afterwards on such terms as may suit our convenience.\"</ref><ref name=\"Hunter, p. 100\">Hunter, p. 100.</ref> This stance by Bhimsen Thapa is not surprising, as insinuated by Amar Singh, considering Amar Singh had made the usurpations in Butwal and Sheoraj, and whose family derived most of the advantages.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 79-80\">Prinsep, p. 79-80.</ref> Prinsep estimates that the revenue of the usurped lands could not have been less than a lakh of rupees a year to the Nepalese, in the manner they collected it: the retention of this income was therefore an object of no small importance to the ambitious views of Bhimsen Thapa and the preservation of the influence he had contrived to establish for his family.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 79-80\">Prinsep, p. 79-80.</ref> The Nepalese prime minister realized the Nepalese had several advantages over the British including knowledge of the region and recent experience fighting in the mountainous terrain. However, the British had numerical superiority and far more modern weapons.\n\nIn the meantime, the Governor-General also naively believed that \"the difficulties of mountain warfare were greater on the defensive side than on that of a well conducted offensive operation.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\"/> Soldiers like [[Rollo Gillespie]] saw the Nepalese as a challenge to British supremacy \u2014 \"Opinion is everything in such a country as India: and whenever the natives shall begin to lose their reverence for the English arms, our superiority in other respects will quickly sink into contempt.\"\n\n[[File:Francis Edward Rawdon, Marquess of Hastings.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Francis Edward Rawdon, Marquess of Hastings, Governor-General of India from 1813 to 1823.]]\n\n===Finance===\nThe Governor-General looked towards the Nawab of Awadh to finance the impending warfare with Nepal: two [[crore]] (20 million) rupees were solicited. Of this matter he writes:\n<blockquote>\n\"...Saadut Ali<ref>[[Saadat Ali Khan II]]</ref> unexpectedly died. I found, however, that what had been provisionally agitated with him was perfectly understood by his successor,<ref>[[Ghazi-ud-Din Haider]]</ref> so that the latter came forward with a spontaneous offer of a crore of rupees, which I declined as a peishcush or tribute on his accession to the sovereignty of Oude, but accepted as a loan for the Honourable Company. Eight lacs were afterwards added to this sum, in order that the interest of the whole, at six per cent, might equal the allowances to different branches of the Nawab Vizier's family, for which guarantee of the British Government had been pledged, and the payment of which, without vexatious retardments, was secured, by the appropriation of the interest to the specific purpose. The sum thus obtained was thrown into the general treasury, whence I looked to draw such portions of it as the demands of the approaching service might require. My surprise is not to be expressed, when I was shortly after informed from Calcutta, that it had been deemed expedient to employ fifty four lacs of the sum obtained by me in discharging an eight per cent loan, that the remainder was indispensable for current purposes, and it was hoped I should be able to procure from the Nawab Vizier a further aid for the objects of the war. This took place early in autumn, and operations against Nepaul could not commence till the middle of November, on which account the Council did not apprehend my being subjected to any sudden inconvenience through its disposal of the first sum. Luckily I was upon such frank terms with the Nawab Vizier, as that I could explain to him fairly my circumstances. He agreed to furnish another crore; so that the Honourable Company was accommodated with above two millions and a half sterling on my simple receipt.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9-10.\">Hasting, p. 9-10.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, he writes:\n<blockquote>\n\"The richest portion of the territory conquered by us bordered on the dominions the Nawab Vizier. I arranged the transfer of that tract to him in extinction of the second crore which I had borrowed. Of that crore the charges of the war absorbed fifty two lacs: forty eight lacs (\u20a4600,000) were consequently left in the treasury, a clear gain to the Honourable Company, in addition to the benefit of precluding future annoyance from an insolent neighbour.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9-10.\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis was in contrast with the Nepalese who had spent huge amount of resources on the first and second wars against the Tibetans, which had led to the gradual exhaustion of their treasury.\n\n===Terrain===\n[[File:1st Foot Guards.jpg|thumb|upright|1st Foot Guards]]\n\nTo the British, who were used to fighting in the plains, but were unacquainted with the terrain of the hills, the formidability of the topology is expressed by one anonymous British soldier as such:\n<blockquote>\n\"...The territory subject to Nepal consists of a mountainous tract of country, lying between Tibet and the valley of the Ganges, in breadth not exceeding one hundred miles, but in length stretching nearly along the whole extent of the north-west frontier of the British dominions. Below the hills they held possession of a portion of the plain of irregular width, distinguished by the name of the Nepal Turrye,<ref>Terai</ref> but the period at which the acquisition was made is not ascertained.\n<br><br>\nThe general military character of the country is that of extreme difficulty. Immediately at the front of the hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest,<ref>''[[Shorea robusta]]'', also known as ''sal'' or ''shala'' tree, is a species of tree belonging to the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]].</ref> for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than any thing that deserves the name of a valley. The roads are very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.\n<br><br>\nOne of the largest and most fertile of these constitutes the valley of Nepal Proper.<ref>\"Nepal Proper\" refers to the Kathmandu Valley. Before the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley by Prithvi Narayan Shah, only this valley was originally referred to as Nepal.</ref> To the westward of Nepal, there is a difficult tract, till the country again opens in the valley of Gorkah, the original possession of the present dynasty. \u2013 Westward of this the country is again difficult, till it somewhat improves in the district of Kemaoon.<ref>Kumaon</ref> Further to the westward lies the valley of the Dhoon,<ref>Dehradun</ref> and the territory of Sue-na-Ghur;<ref>[[Srinagar, Uttarakhand]]</ref> and further still, the more recent conquests, stretching to the village, in which Umar Sing,<ref>Amar Singh Thapa</ref> a chief of uncommon talents, commanded, and indeed, exercised an authority almost independent.\"<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 426\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First campaign==\n===British plan of operation===\n[[File:Officer and Private, 40th Foot, 1815.jpg|thumb|upright|Officer and Private, 40th Regiment of Foot, 1815]]\n[[File:Gurkha soldier 1815.jpg|thumb|upright|A Gorkhali warrior.]]\n\nThe initial British campaign was an attack on two fronts across a frontier of more than {{convert|1,500|km}}, from the Sutlej to the Koshi. In the eastern front, Major-General Bennet Marley and Major-General John Sullivan Wood led their respective columns across the [[Tarai]] towards the heart of the valley of Kathmandu. Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]] and Colonel [[David Ochterlony]] commanded columns in the western front. These columns were faced with the Nepalese army under the command of [[Amar Singh Thapa]].<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 427\">Anon (1816), p.427.</ref> About the beginning of October, 1814, the British troops began to move towards different depots; and the army was soon after formed into four divisions, one at Benares, one at Meeruth, one at Dinapur, and one at Ludhiana.\n\n''The first division'', at [[Dinapur]], being the largest, was commanded by Major-General Marley, and was intended to seize the pass at [[Makwanpur District|Makwanpur]], between Gunduk and Bagmati, the key to Nepal, and to push forward to [[Kathmandu]]: thus at once carrying the war into the heart of the enemy's country.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 427\"/><ref name=\"Fraser, p. 13.\">Fraser, p. 13.</ref> This force consisted of 8,000 men, including his Majesty's 24th foot of 907 strong; there was a train attached to it of four 18-pounders, eight 6- and 3-pounders, and fourteen mortars and howitzers.<ref name=\"Smith, p. 215-219.\">Smith, ''Plan of Operation'', p. 215-219.</ref><ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 85.\">Prinsep, p. 85.</ref>\n\n''The second division'', at [[Benares]], under command of Major-General Wood, having subsequently removed to [[Gorakhpur]], was meant to enter the hills by the Bhootnuill pass, and, turning to the eastward, to penetrate the hilly districts, towards Kathmandu, and cooperate with the first division, while its success would have divided the enemy's country and force into two parts, cutting off all the troops in [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]] from communication with the capital.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 427\"/><ref name=\"Fraser, p. 13.\"/> Its force consisted of his Majesty's 17th foot, 950 strong, and about 3000 infantry, totaling 4,494 men; it had a train of seven 6- and 3-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers.<ref name=\"Smith, p. 215-219.\"/><ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 84.\"/>\n\n''The third division'', was formed at [[Meerut]], under Major-General Gillespie; and it was purposed to march directly to the [[Dehra Dun]]; and having reduced the forts in that valley, to move, as might be deemed expedient, to the eastward, to recover [[Srinagar, Uttarakhand|Srinagar]] from the troops of Amar Singh Thapa; or to the westward, to gain the post of [[Nahan]], the chief town of [[Sirmaur district|Sirmaur]], where Ranjore Singh Thapa held the government for his father, Amar Singh; and so sweep on towards the [[Sutlej]], in order to cut off that chief from the rest, and thus to reduce him to terms.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 427\"/><ref name=\"Fraser, p. 13.\"/> This division originally consisted of his Majesty's 53d, which with artillery and a few dismounted dragoons, made up about one thousand Europeans, and two thousand five hundred native infantry, totaling 3,513 men.<ref name=\"Smith, p. 215-219.\"/><ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 84.\">Prinsep, p. 84.</ref>\n\n''The fourth, or north-western division'', at [[Ludhiana]], was to operate in the hilly country lying near the Sutlej: it assembled under Brigadier-General Ochterlony, and was destined to advance against the strong and extensive cluster of posts held by Amar Singh and the troops under his immediate orders at and surrounding Irkee, a considerable town of [[Kahlur]], and to cooperate with the forces under Major-General Gillespie, moving downwards among the hills, when these positions should be forced, surrounding Amar Singh, and driving him upon that army.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 427\"/><ref name=\"Fraser, p. 13.\"/> The force consisted exclusively of native infantry and artillery, and amounted to 5,993 men; it had a train of two 18-pounder, ten 6-pounders, and four mortars and howitzers.<ref name=\"Smith, p. 215-219.\"/><ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 83.\">Prinsep, p. 83.</ref>\n\nLastly, beyond the [[Koshi River]] eastward, Major Latter was furnished with two thousand men, including his district battalion, for the defence of the [[Purnia division|Poornea]] frontier.

All four divisions composed mostly of Indian Sepoys. Ochterlony's army was the only division without a single British battalion. In conclusion, the Gorkhali Army defeated the British on three fronts consisting the middle and the east whereas lost the remaining two fronts in the west.\n\n===Battle of Makwanpur Gadhi===\nMajor General Marley was tasked to occupy Hetauda and capture the fortresses of Hariharpur and Makawanpur before proceeding to Kathmandu. His frontage of advance lay between Rapati river and Bagmati river. After additional reinforcements, he had 12,000 troops for his offensive against the Makawanpur and Hariharpur axis. A big attack base was established but Major General Marley showed reluctance to take risks against the Nepalese. Some skirmishes had already started taking place. Similarly, Major General George Wood, sometimes known as the Tiger of the British Indian Army, proved exceedingly cautious against the hard charging Nepalese.\n\nColonel<ref>The use of English terms for their grades of command was common in the Nepalese army, but the powers of the different ranks did not correspond with those of the British system. The title of General was assumed by Bhimsen Thapa, as Commander-in-chief, and enjoyed by himself alone; of Colonels there were three or four only; all principal officers of the court, commanding more than one battalion. The title of Major was held by the adjutant of a battalion or independent company; and Captain was the next grade to colonel, implying the command of a corps. Luftun, or Lieutenant, was the style of the officers commanding companies under the Captain; and then followed the subaltern ranks of Soobadar, Jemadar, and Havildar, without any Ensigns. (Prinsep, p. 86-87)</ref> [[Ranabir Singh Thapa]], brother of Bhimsen Thapa, was to be the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large fortress and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a few pieces of cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.\n\n===Battle of Jitgadh===\nWith the help of an ousted Palpali king, Major General Wood planned to march on Siuraj, Jit Gadhi and Nuwakot with a view to bypass the Butwal defenses, flushing out minor opposition on the axis, and assault Palpa from a less guarded flank. Nepalese Colonel [[Ujir Singh Thapa]] had deployed his 1200 troops in many defensive positions including Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi and Kathe Gadhi. The troops under Colonel Ujir were very disciplined and he himself was a dedicated and able commander. He was famous for exploiting advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. The British advance took place on 22nd Poush1871 BS (January 1814 AD) to Jit Gadh. While they were advancing to this fortress, crossing the Tinau River, the Nepalese troops opened fire from the fortress. Another of the attackers' columns was advancing to capture Tansen Bazar. Here too, Nepalese spoiling attacks forced the General to fall back to Gorakhpur. About 70 Nepalese lost their lives in Nuwakot pakhe Gadhi. Meanwhile, more than 300 of the enemy perished.\n\n===Battle of Hariharpur Gadhi===\nNo special military action had taken place in Hariharpur Gadhi fortress in the first campaign. Major General Bannet Marley and Major General George Wood had not been able to advance for an offensive against Makawanpur and Hariharpur Gadhi fortresses.\n\n===Battle of Nalapani===\n{{further|Battle of Nalapani}}\nThe [[Battle of Nalapani]] was the first battle of Anglo-Nepalese War. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near [[Dehradun]], which was placed under siege by the British between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain [[Balbhadra Kunwar]], while Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]], who had previously fought at the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Battle of Java]], was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison, which also consisted of brave women who reportedly shielded the bullets and cannonballs with their bodies, successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month.\nFraser recorded the situation in the following terms:\n\n{{block quote|The determined resolution of the small party which held this small post for more than a month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.{{pb}}Whatever the nature of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no cruelty to wounded or to prisoners; no poisoned arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit of revenge seemed to animate them: they fought us in fair conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy worthy of a more enlightened people.{{pb}}So far from insulting the bodies of the dead and wounded, they permitted them to lie untouched, till carried away; and none were stripped, as is too universally the case.<ref>W. Shackell, p.590</ref>}}\n\nAfter two costly and unsuccessful attempts to seize the fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. The battle set the tone for the rest of the Anglo-Nepalese War, and a number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way.\n\nThe experience at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his plan of operations as to forego the detachment of a part of this division to occupy Gurhwal.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\">Prinsep, p. 94.</ref> He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh's son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\"/> It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\"/> In the meantime Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 95.\">Prinsep, p. 95.</ref> This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 95.\"/>\n\n===Battle of Jaithak===\n{{further|Battle of Jaithak}}\n[[File:Battle of Jaithak.JPG|thumb|Stockaded position of the Nepalese at Jaithak]]\nMajor General Martindale now joined the force and took over command. He occupied the town of Nahan on 27 December, and started his attack on the fort of Jaithak. The fort had a garrison of 2000 men under the command of [[Ranajor Singh Thapa]], the son of the [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. The first assault ended in disaster, with the Nepalese successfully warding off the British offensive. The second managed to cut off the water supply to the fort, but could not capture it mainly because of the exhausted state of the troops and shortage of ammunition. Martindale lost heart and ordered a withdrawal. Jaithak was eventually captured much later in the war, when Ochterlony had taken over the command.<ref name=\"Navarne, p. 190.\">Navarne, p. 190.</ref>\n\nA single day of battle at Jaithak cost the British over three hundred men dead and wounded and cooled Martindell's ardour for battle. For over a month and a half, he refused to take any further initiative against the Nepalese army. Thus by mid-February, of the four British commanders the Nepalese army had faced till that time, Gillespie was dead, Marley had deserted, Wood was harassed into inactivity, and Martindell was practically incapacitated by over-cautiousness. It set the scene for Octorloney to soon show his mettle and change the course of the war.\n\n===Trying times for Nepalese troops===\nOut West, the Nepalese were hopelessly overextended. Kumaun, a key link in Nepalese army communications with the Far West, was defended by a small force, numbering about seven hundred and fifty men, with an equal number of Kumaoni irregulars, altogether about fifteen hundred men to defend a whole province. In addition, Doti which was to the East of Kumaun, had been practically stripped of troops. [[Bam Shah]], as governor of Kumaun, had final responsibility for the defence of the province.\n\nThe British force, numbering initially over forty five hundred men, was easily able to outmanoeuvre the Nepalese army defenders and force them to abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey's force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army was unable to stem the tide of the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help.\n\nMeanwhile, Hastings sent Colonel Nicolls, Quartermaster-General for the British troops in India, to take charge of the Almora campaign and assigned two thousand regular troops to this front in addition to the very large number of irregulars already assigned to the area \u2013 all of this against fewer than one thousand Nepalese army soldiers.\n\n[[Hasti Dal Shah]] and some five hundred Nepalese Army men had set out from Almora to secure Almora's Northern line of communications with Kathmandu. This party was intercepted. Hasti Dal Shah, the ablest Nepalese commander in this sector, was killed in the first moments of the battle. The Nepalese suffered terrible losses. When word of this disaster reached the defenders at Almora, they were stunned. The British closed in on Almora and the Nepalese was unable to prevent the British advance. On April 25, 1815, 2,000 British regulars under Col. Nicholls and a force of irregular troops under Col. Gardiner assaulted and captured the heights of the town of Almorah. Subsequently, the British managed to establish gun positions within seventy yards of the gate of the fort at Almora and the British artillery demolished the walls of the fort at point blank range. Bam Shah surrendered Almora on 27 April 1815. The result of this British victory was the capitulation of the province of Kumaon and all of its fortresses.\n\n===Second Battle of Malaon and Jaithak===\nThe second battle of Malaon and Jaithak cut the Nepalese lines of communication between Central Nepal and the Far West. It also sealed the fate of Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at Malaon and Ranajor Singh Thapa at Jaithak. At Malaon, Major-General Ochterlony had moved with extreme care summoning reinforcements and heavy guns from Delhi until his total attack force consisted of over ten thousand men well-equipped with heavy cannon.\n\nKazi Amar Singh Thapa's position in the Malaon Hills depended on Bilaspur in the lowlands for his food supplies, and the nature of the hills forced him to spread his forces very thinly in an attempt to defend every vantage point. Ochterlony cut off the supply of food from Bilaspur and then turned his attention to the intricate network of defensive posts that were designed to withstand any frontal assault. Although rear fortifications supported these posts, none could withstand a long cannonade by heavy guns. Because Ochterlony had sufficient troops to attack and overwhelm several positions simultaneously, the thinly spread Nepalese defences could be dangerously divided.\n\nOchterlony chose his target, a point on the ridge, and then proceeded to move slowly, consolidating each position that he took, and allowing the pioneers time to build roads so that the heavy guns could be moved forward to support each attack. After a series of carefully planned and executed moves, he succeeded in establishing a position on the crest of Deothal, not even over a thousand yards from Kazi Amar Singh Thapa's main fort at Malaon. The old warrior [[Bhakti Thapa]] valiantly led assault after assault on this position, but he died during battle and the position did not fall. Immensely impressed by Bhakti's sustained courage against impossible odds, the British made the well appreciated and honourable gesture of returning his body with full military honours. The British superiority in numbers made it inevitable that they would be able to establish themselves and their heavy guns on a vantage point within range of Ranajor Singh's fortifications, sooner or later.\n\nBoth Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa were thus hemmed in and looking down the barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah's letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old commander was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West lost control to the British on 15 May 1815.\n\n==Second campaign==\n[[File:Eight Gurkha men depicted in a British Indian painting, 1815.jpg|thumb|right|Gorkhali soldiers in 1815.]]\n\nThe outstretched Nepalese army was defeated on the Western front i.e. [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] area. Ochterlony had finally outfoxed Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. He was the only successful British Commander in the first Nepal-Company campaign. Not surprisingly [[Lord Moira]] appointed him as the Main Operational Commander in the second offensive on the Bharatpur-Makawanpur-Hariharpur front with 17,000 strong invasion force, but again, most of them were Indian sepoys.<ref name=\"Naravane, p. 191\">{{harvp|Naravane|2006|p=191}}</ref>\n\nThe British had given a 15-day ultimatum to Nepal to ratify a treaty on 28 November. But the points of the treaty were very difficult for the Nepalese to ratify quickly. The delay provided the excuse for the British to commence the second military campaign against the kingdom. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa, another brother of [[Bhimsen Thapa]], had been appointed as Sector Commander for defensive battles for the area from [[Bijayapur]] to [[Sindhuli Gadhi]] in the first campaign. In this second campaign, Bada Kaji Amarsingh Thapa{{refn|group=note|Not to be confused with the better known commander of Gorkhali forces in the [[Gurkha War]] with the same name. The two Amar Singhs are differentiated by the qualifier Bada (greater) and Sanu (lesser).}}was detailed as Sector Commander for [[Sindhuli Gadhi]] and the eastern front. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa was manning his headquarters at [[Makwanpur Gadhi]]. Major General [[David Ochterlony]], was the overall commander against Nepal with a massive 17,000 British troops to assault the fronts including Upardang Gadhi, Sinchyang Gadhi, Kandrang Gadhi, Makawanpur Gadhi and [[Hariharpur Gadhi]].\n\nDuring the campaign in February 1816, Ochterlony decided to take a very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure there would have been a disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow British to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O\u2019Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach [[Hariharpur Gadhi]]. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if they were able to get only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade's strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O\u2019Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to [[Makawanpur]] by the end of March 1816.\n\nThe situation became very critical for Nepal and the British which eventually led to a treaty. Major General [[David Ochterlony]] settled down to receive the treaty, signed by Kathmandu Durbar through Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya, Pandit Gajaraj Mishra and finally though Bhaktawar Singh Thapa. Two days later the ratified treaty was handed over to the British in [[Makawanpur]]. The war ended with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which has been considered as an unequal treaty which led to Nepal losing its one-third territory. The river Mechi became the new Eastern border and the Mahakali the Western boundary of Nepal.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===The Treaty of Sugauli===\n[[File:Sugauli treaty.jpg|thumb|right|Bhimsen Thapa's troops, right, at Segauli, 1816, with India Pattern Brown Bess muskets and chupi bayonets.]]\n[[File:Sugauli Treaty2.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] 4 March 1816. It suited Ochterlony to bring the campaign to a speedy conclusion because of the approach of the dreaded aul-fever season but also because a number of his European troops were suffering from [[dysentery]].]]\n\n{{main|Sugauli Treaty}}\n\nThe [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] was ratified on 4 March 1816. As per the treaty, Nepal lost all Sikkim (including [[Darjeeling district|Darjeeling]]), the territories of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] and Western Terai. The [[Mechi River]] became the new eastern border and the [[Mahakali river]] the western boundary of the kingdom. The [[British East India Company]] would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region. The British set up [[Resident (title)|Resident]].<ref>India-Board (8 November 1816) in Kathmandu.</ref> The fear of having a British Resident in Kathmandu ultimately proved to be unfounded, as the rulers of Nepal managed to isolate the Resident to such an extent as to be in virtual house arrest.\n\nThe Terai lands, however, proved difficult for the British to govern and some of them were returned to the kingdom later in 1816 and the annual payments accordingly abolished.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 304-305.\">Oldfield, p. 304-305.</ref> However even after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War, the border issue between the two states was not yet settled. The boundary between Nepal and Oudh was not finally adjusted until 1830; and that between Nepal and the British territories remained as a matter of discussion between the two Governments for several years later.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 306.\">Oldfield, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe British never had the intention to destroy either the existence or the independence of a state which was usefully interposed between them and the dependencies of China.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 428.\">Anon (1816), p. 428.</ref> Lord Hastings had given up his plan to dismember Nepal from fear of antagonising China \u2013 whose vassal Nepal in theory was. In 1815, while British forces were campaigning in far western Nepal, a high-ranking Manchu official advanced with a large\nmilitary force from China to Lhasa; and the following year, after the Anglo-Nepalese treaty had been signed, the Chinese army moved south again, right up to Nepal's frontier. The Nepalese panicked, because memories were still vivid of the Chinese invasion of 1792, and there was a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity. Hastings sent mollifying assurances to the imperial authorities, and ordered the British Resident, newly arrived in Kathmandu, to pack his bags and be ready to leave at once if the Chinese invaded again.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', pp.367.\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.367.</ref>\nDue to the forced treaty under compulsion and duress, experts on international treaty view that Nepal might not have had the capability to recognize the Sugauli as a sound treaty.\n\n===Cost of war===\nDespite the boast of Lord Moira to the British parliament on having increased the state coffers, the Gurkha War had in reality cost more than the combined cost of the campaigns against the [[Marathas]] and the [[Pindaris]] for which Lord Moira's administration is better known: Sicca Rs. {{formatnum:5156961}} as against Sicca Rs. {{formatnum:3753789}}.<ref name=\"Lamb, p. 41.\">Lamb, p. 41.</ref> This was the kind of fact which greatly influenced the policy of the Company government in subsequent years. Thus, while the Company Government, in theory, thoroughly approved of the development of trade, especially in shawl wool, between Western Tibet and its territories, it was unprepared to take any decisive step to bring this about. It preferred to leave the Chinese in Tibet to their own devices, and hoped to avoid the risk, however slight, of another expensive hill war.<ref name=\"Lamb, p. 41.\"/>\n\nFurthermore, despite the British merchants' direct access to the wool growing areas after the war, the hopes of shawl wool trade were never realised. The British merchants found that they were too late. The shawl wool market was strictly closed and closely guarded. It was monopolised by traders from Kashmir and Ladakh, and the only outsider with whom they dealt was Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the powerful Sikh ruler of Lahore. Ranjit was very zealous of his privilege, and he was the last person the British could afford to offend at this time of crisis and uncertainty. So the East India Company never did get its shawl wool. When it finally acquired the Punjab and Kashmir, after the Sikh Wars of the 1840s, it had long since given up trade, and Kashmir was so little valued that it was quickly discarded \u2013 sold for a knock-down price to the Raja of Jammu.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', pp.366-367.\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366-367.</ref>\n\n===Gorkha recruitment===\n{{main|Brigade of Gurkhas|Gorkha regiments (India)}}\n[[File:Ilngurkhas1858.jpg|thumb|right|Gurkahs of 66th Regiment in their national costume.]]\n[[File:Kukri.jpg|thumb|The [[Khukuri]] is the traditional weapon and tool of the [[Gurkhas]].]]\n\nDavid Ochterlony and the political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were quick to recognize the potential of Nepalese soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Nepalese army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lieutenant Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lieutenant Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\".\n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not 'real' Gorkhali but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony's Gorkhali battalions, William Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lieutenant Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion, the Kumaon battalion was also raised eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\n===Fate of protagonists===\n====Bhimsen Thapa====\n{{main|Bhimsen Thapa}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Bhimsen Thapa]], with the support of the queen regent [[Queen Tripurasundari|Tripura Sundari]], remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal. Other ruling families, particularly the Pandes, decried what they saw as Bhimsen Thapa's submissive attitude towards the British. The prime minister however had been able to retain power by maintaining a large, modernized army and politically dominating the court during the minority of King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]], (reigned 1816\u20131847). Additionally, he was able to freeze out the Pandes from power by appointing members of his own family into positions of authority.\n\nWhen queen Tripura Sundari died in 1832, [[Bhimsen Thapa]] began to lose influence. In 1833, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Brian Hodgson]] became British resident, openly favouring Bhimsen Thapa's opponents, and in 1837 the king announced his intention to rule independently, depriving the prime minister and his nephew of their military powers. After the eldest son of the queen died, Bhimsen Thapa was falsely accused of attempting to poison the prince. Although acquitted, the Thapas were in turmoil. When the head of the Pande family, Rana Jang Pande, became prime minister, he had Bhimsen Thapa re-imprisoned; Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide in August 1839.\n\n====David Ochterlony====\n{{main|David Ochterlony}}\n\nFor his part, [[David Ochterlony]] received thanks from both [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] and became the first officer in the [[British East India Company]] to be awarded the [[Order of the Bath|GCB]]. [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Moira]] also reinstated him as Resident at [[Delhi]] and he lived in the style appropriate to a very senior figure of the Company. However, after Lord Moira left India \u2013 succeeded by [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]] as Governor-General in 1823 \u2013 Ochterlony fell out of favor.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Raja]] of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] died and the six-year-old heir to the throne, whom Ochterlony supported, was usurped by his cousin Durjan Sal. When Durjan Sal failed to submit to Ochterlony's demands to vacate the throne, the British general prepared to march on Bharatpur. He did not receive the backing of the new Governor-General however, and after Amherst countermanded his orders, Ochterlony resigned, as Amherst had anticipated. This episode badly affected the ailing general who died shortly after on 14 July 1825. A 165-foot-high memorial was later erected in [[Calcutta]] in his memory; however, Sir David Ochterlony's greatest legacy is the continuing recruitment of [[Gurkha|Gorkhas]] into the British and Indian armies.\n\nSoon after Ochterlony's resignation Amherst was himself obliged to do what Ochterlony had prepared to do, and laid siege to Bharatpur.<ref name=\"Naravane, p. 191\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Gurkha]]\n* [[History of Nepal]]\n* [[Kingdom of Nepal]]\n* [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]\n* [[Sino-Nepalese War]]\n* [[Gurkha\u2013Sikh War]]\n* [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]]\n* [[East India Company]]\n* [[Company rule in India]]\n* [[Nawab of Awadh]]\n*[[Garhwali people]]\n*[[Kumauni people]]\n* [[Awadh]]\n* [[Battle of Nalapani]]\n* [[Treaty of Thapathali]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\nThere's an inaccuracy in the troops size, especially from the British East India Company.

Both sides had ambitious expansion plans for the mountainous north of the Indian subcontinent. The EIC won. The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] in 1816, which ceded some Nepalese controlled territory to the EIC.\n\nThe war was led by the EIC (a private company that was closely tied to the [[British Empire]]) with the support from native states; [[Garhwal Kingdom]], [[Patiala State]] and [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] against [[Kingdom of Gorkha]]. The war on the side of [[Kingdom of Gorkha]] was led mostly by the members of the larger Thapa caucus.{{refn|group=note|Bhimsen's nephew [[Ujir Singh Thapa]]{{sfn|Princep|1825|p=115}} commanded over the Butwal-Jitgadhi Axis while his brothers [[Ranbir Singh Thapa]] and [[Bakhtawar Singh Thapa]] commanded over the Makwanpur-Hariharpur Axis and Bijayapur-Sindhuligadhi Axis respectively.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the Nepalese Army |publisher=Nepal Army |url=http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np:80/history.php?page=two |website=nepalarmy.mil.np |accessdate=16 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228014557/http://www.nepalarmy.mil.np/history.php?page=two |archive-date=28 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]] who was considered a member of the larger Thapa caucus,{{sfn|Pradhan|2012|p=26}} led the battle as overall commander against the columns of Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]] and Colonel [[David Ochterlony]]; his son [[Ranjore Thapa]] commanded the Nahan and Jaithak forts;{{sfn|Anon|1816|p=427}} and Ranjor's nephew [[Balbhadra Kunwar]]{{sfn|Acharya|1971b|p=3}} commanded the [[Dehradun|Doon region]] at [[Battle of Nalapani|Nalapani]].{{sfn|Princep|1825|p=93}}}}\n\n==Historical background==\n{{further|Unification of Nepal|Sino-Nepalese War|East India Company}}\nThe [[Shah dynasty|Shah]] era of Nepal began with the [[Gorkha Kingdom|Gorkha]] king [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] invading [[Kathmandu]] valley, which consisted of the capital of the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] confederacy. Until that time only the Kathmandu valley was referred to as Nepal. The confederacy requested help from the [[East India Company]] and an ill-equipped and ill-prepared expedition numbering 2,500 was led by Captain Kinlock  in 1767. The expedition was a disaster; the Gorkhali army easily overpowered those who had not succumb  to malaria or desperation . This ineffectual British force provided the Gorkhali with a few firearms to arms themselves and make effective use of them.\n\nVictory and occupation of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] by Prithvi Narayan Shah, starting with the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], resulted in the shift of the capital of his kingdom from Gorkha to Kathmandu, and subsequently the empire that he and his descendants built came to be known as Nepal. Also, the invasion of the wealthy Kathmandu Valley provided the Gorkha army with economic support for furthering their martial ambitions throughout the region.\n\nTo the north however, aggressive raids into [[Tibet]] (concerning a long-standing dispute over trade and control of the mountain passes) triggered Chinese intervention. In 1792 the [[Qianlong Emperor]] sent an army, expelling the Nepalese from Tibet to within {{convert|5|km}} of their capital at Kathmandu. Acting regent Bahadur Shah (Prithvi Naryan's younger son) appealed to the then British [[Governor-General]] of India for help. Anxious to avoid confrontation with the Chinese, the Governor-General did not send troops but sent Captain Kirkpatrick as mediator. However, before he arrived the war with China had finished. In 1789, Tibetan government stopped the usage of Nepalese coins for trade in Tibet, citing purity concerns over the copper and the silver coins minted by the Nepalese government,<ref>[[Historical money of Tibet]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2017}} which led to the first [[Nepal-Tibet war]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZD9--xYamkC |title=Britain and Tibet 1765\u20131947: A Select Annotated Bibliography of British Relations with Tibet and the Himalayan States Including Nepal, Sikkim and Bhutan |isbn=9780415336475 |last1=Marshall |first1=Julie G. |year=2005}}</ref> A resounding victory of Gorkha forces over Tibetans in the first [[Nepal-Tibet war]] left the [[Potala Palace|Lhasa Durbar]] with no choice but to ask for assistance from the [[Qing Emperor]] in [[Peking]].

He was killed in the struggle in January 1804 and all his land annexed. Further west, general [[Amar Singh Thapa]] overran lands as far as [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] \u2013 the strongest fort in the hill region \u2013 and laid siege to it. However, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]], the ruler of the [[Sikh]] state in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], intervened and drove the Nepalese army east of the [[Sutlej]] river by 1809.\n\n==Causes==\n[[Image:Joppen1907India1805a.jpg|thumbnail|left|Map of India in 1805]]\nThe British were also expanding their sphere of influence at an alarming rate. While the Nepalese had been expanding their empire \u2013 into [[Sikkim]] in the east, [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] in the west and into the British sphere of influence in [[Awadh]], or Oudh as the British called it, in the south \u2013 the [[British East India Company]] had consolidated its position in India from its main bases of [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]] and [[Bombay]]. This British expansion had already been resisted in India, culminating in three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]] as well as in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] where [[Ranjit Singh]] and the [[Sikh Empire]] had their own aspirations.\n\n===Trade===\nThe economic cause constituted the major cause of conflict with Nepal. The British had made constant efforts to persuade the Nepalese government to allow them their trade to the fabled Tibet through Nepal. Despite a series of delegations headed by [[William Kirkpatrick (orientalist)|William Kirkpatrick]] (1792), Maulvi Abdul Qader (1795), and later William O. Knox (1801), the Nepalese Durbar refused to budge an inch. The resistance to open up the country to the Europeans could be summed up in a Nepalese precept, \"With the merchants come the musket and with the Bible comes the bayonet.\"\n\nLord Hasting was not averse to exploiting any commercial opportunities that access to the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was at this time in the throes of a cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366</ref>\n\nSo when Hastings told the directors of the Company about an alternative means of remittance, a rare and precious raw material that could easily and profitably be shipped from India directly to London, they were at once interested. The raw material in question was a [[Cashmere wool|superior-quality wool]]: the exquisitely soft and durable animal down that had been used since time immemorial to make the famous wraps, or shawls, of Kashmir. This down was found only on the shawl-wool goat, and the shawl-wool goat was found only in certain areas of western Tibet. It refused to breed anywhere else. This all explains why, under the terms of the treaty of 1816, Nepal was required to surrender its far western provinces. Hastings hoped that this territory, partly annexed by the Company and partly restored to its previous rulers, would give British merchants direct access to the wool-growing areas.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366 \"/>\n\nSimilarly David Ochterlony, then an agent at Ludhiana, on 24 August 1814 noted of Dehra Dun as a \"potentially thriving entrepot for Trans-Himalayan trade.\" He contemplated annexing Garhwal not so much with the view to revenue, but for security of commercial communications with the country where the shawl wool is produced. The British soon got to know that Kumaon provided a better facility for trade with Tibet. Therefore, the annexation of these two areas became part of their strategic objectives.\n\n===Political safety===\nWhile trade was indeed a major objective of the Company, out of it grew a concept of \"political safety,\" which essentially meant a strategy of dissuasion and larger areas of occupation. The evidence does not support the claim that Hastings invaded Nepal only for commercial reasons. It was a strategic decision. He was wary of the Hindu revival and solidarity among the Marathas, the Sikhs, and the Gurkhas amid the decaying Mughal empire. He was hatching pre-emptive schemes of conquest against the Marathas in central India, and he needed to cripple Nepal first, in order to avoid having to fight on two fronts.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366 \"/>\n\nThat it was a flawed strategy is explained by [[Peter James Marshall|P.J. Marshal]]: \"Political safety meant military preparedness. The military expenditure for 1761\u201362 to 1770\u201371 was 44 percent of the total spending of 22 million pounds. War and diplomacy rather than trade and improvement; most of the soldiers-would-be politicians and Governor Generals rarely understood. The political safety of Bengal was their first priority and they interpreted safety as requiring the subjugation of Mysore, the Marathas, the Pindaris, the Nepalese and the Burmese.\"\n\n===Border dispute===\nThe acquisition of the [[Nawab of Awadh]]'s lands by the British East India Company brought the region of [[Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh|Gorakhpur]] into the close proximity of the raja(king) of Palpa \u2013 the last remaining independent town within the Nepalese heartlands. Palpa and [[Butwal]] were originally two separate principalities; they were afterwards united under one independent Rajput prince, who, having conquered Butwal, added it to his hereditary possessions of Palpa. The lands of Butwal, though conquered and annexed, were yet held in fief, or paid an annual sum, first to Awadh, and afterwards, by transfer, to the British.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 425\">Anon (1816), p.425.</ref><ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\">Oldfield, p. 40.</ref> During the regency of Rani Rajendra Laxmi, towards the close of the 18th century, the hill country of Palpa was conquered and annexed to Nepal. The rajah retreated to Butwal, but was subsequently induced, under false promises of redress, to visit Kathmandu, where he was put to death, and his territories in Butwal seized and occupied by the Nepalese.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\">Oldfield, p. 40.</ref> [[Bhimsen Thapa]], the Nepalese prime minister from 1806 to 1837, installed his own father as governor of Palpa, leading to serious border disputes between the two powers. The occupation of Terai of Butwal from 1804 till 1812 by the Nepalese, which was under British protection, was the immediate reason which led to the Anglo-Nepalese war in 1814.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 40\"/><ref name=\"Smith, p. 172\">Smith, ''Warlike Preliminaries'', Ch. 8, p. 172.</ref><ref name=\"Prinsep, Ch. 2, ''Causes of Nipal War'', p. 54-80.\">Prinsep, Ch. 2, ''Causes of Nipal War'', p. 54-80.</ref>\n\nIn October 1813, the ambitious [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Francis Edward Rawdon-Hastings]], the Earl of Moira, assumed the office of the Governor-General, and his first act was to re-examine the border dispute between Nepal and British East India Company. These disputes arose because there was no fixed boundary separating the Nepalese and the British. A struggle with the former was unpromising as the British were ignorant of the country or its resources and, despite their technological superiority, it was a received persuasion that the nature of the mountainous tract, which they would have to penetrate, would be as baffling to them as it had been to all the efforts of many successive Mahomedan sovereigns.<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\">Hastings, p. 9.</ref> A border commission imposed on Nepal by the Governor-General failed to solve the problem. The Nepalese Commissioners had remarked to the British the futility of debating about a few square miles of territory since there never could be real peace between the two States, until the British should yield to the Nepalese all the British provinces north of the Ganges, making that river the boundary between the two, \"as heaven had evidently designed it to be.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\"/> However, Nepalese Historian [[Baburam Acharya]] contends that the British were striving to annex the hill regions of Nepal and were the ones responsible for creating border disputes. At the border demarcation, the British representative Major Bradshaw disrespected the Nepalese representatives \u2013 Rajguru [[Ranganath Poudyal]] and [[Kaji (Nepal)|Kaji]] [[Dalabhanjan Pande]], with a view of invoking a war against the Nepalese.{{sfn|Acharya|1971|p=3}} In the meantime, the British found that the Nepalese were preparing for war; that they had for some time been laying up large stores of saltpetre; purchasing and fabricating arms, and organizing and disciplining their troops under some European deserters in this service, after the model of the companies of East India's sepoy battalions.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 425\">Anon (1816), p.425.</ref> The conviction that the Nepalese raids into the flatlands of the [[Terai]], a much prized strip of fertile ground separating the Nepalese hill country from India, increased tensions<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9\"/> \u2013 the British felt their power in the region and their tenuous lines of communication between [[Calcutta]] and the northwest were under threat.

Of this matter he writes:\n<blockquote>\n\"...Saadut Ali<ref>[[Saadat Ali Khan II]]</ref> unexpectedly died. I found, however, that what had been provisionally agitated with him was perfectly understood by his successor,<ref>[[Ghazi-ud-Din Haider]]</ref> so that the latter came forward with a spontaneous offer of a crore of rupees, which I declined as a peishcush or tribute on his accession to the sovereignty of Oude, but accepted as a loan for the Honourable Company. Eight lacs were afterwards added to this sum, in order that the interest of the whole, at six per cent, might equal the allowances to different branches of the Nawab Vizier's family, for which guarantee of the British Government had been pledged, and the payment of which, without vexatious retardments, was secured, by the appropriation of the interest to the specific purpose. The sum thus obtained was thrown into the general treasury, whence I looked to draw such portions of it as the demands of the approaching service might require. My surprise is not to be expressed, when I was shortly after informed from Calcutta, that it had been deemed expedient to employ fifty four lacs of the sum obtained by me in discharging an eight per cent loan, that the remainder was indispensable for current purposes, and it was hoped I should be able to procure from the Nawab Vizier a further aid for the objects of the war. This took place early in autumn, and operations against Nepaul could not commence till the middle of November, on which account the Council did not apprehend my being subjected to any sudden inconvenience through its disposal of the first sum. Luckily I was upon such frank terms with the Nawab Vizier, as that I could explain to him fairly my circumstances. He agreed to furnish another crore; so that the Honourable Company was accommodated with above two millions and a half sterling on my simple receipt.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9-10.\">Hasting, p. 9-10.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the aftermath of the war, he writes:\n<blockquote>\n\"The richest portion of the territory conquered by us bordered on the dominions the Nawab Vizier. I arranged the transfer of that tract to him in extinction of the second crore which I had borrowed. Of that crore the charges of the war absorbed fifty two lacs: forty eight lacs (\u20a4600,000) were consequently left in the treasury, a clear gain to the Honourable Company, in addition to the benefit of precluding future annoyance from an insolent neighbour.\"<ref name=\"Hastings, p. 9-10.\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis was in contrast with the Nepalese who had spent huge amount of resources on the first and second wars against the Tibetans, which had led to the gradual exhaustion of their treasury.\n\n===Terrain===\n[[File:1st Foot Guards.jpg|thumb|upright|1st Foot Guards]]\n\nTo the British, who were used to fighting in the plains, but were unacquainted with the terrain of the hills, the formidability of the topology is expressed by one anonymous British soldier as such:\n<blockquote>\n\"...The territory subject to Nepal consists of a mountainous tract of country, lying between Tibet and the valley of the Ganges, in breadth not exceeding one hundred miles, but in length stretching nearly along the whole extent of the north-west frontier of the British dominions. Below the hills they held possession of a portion of the plain of irregular width, distinguished by the name of the Nepal Turrye,<ref>Terai</ref> but the period at which the acquisition was made is not ascertained.\n<br><br>\nThe general military character of the country is that of extreme difficulty. Immediately at the front of the hills the plain is covered with the Great Saul Forest,<ref>''[[Shorea robusta]]'', also known as ''sal'' or ''shala'' tree, is a species of tree belonging to the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]].</ref> for an average width of ten or twelve miles; the masses of the mountains are immense, their sides steep, and covered with impenetrable jungle. The trenches in these ridges are generally water-courses, and rather chasms or gulfs than any thing that deserves the name of a valley. The roads are very insecure, and invariably pathways over mountains, or the beds of rivers, the usual means of transport throughout the country being by hill porters. Notwithstanding this general description, spaces comparatively open and hollow, and elevated tracts of tolerably level land, are to be met with, but so completely detached as to contribute but little to facilitate intercourse.\n<br><br>\nOne of the largest and most fertile of these constitutes the valley of Nepal Proper.<ref>\"Nepal Proper\" refers to the Kathmandu Valley. Before the conquest of the Kathmandu Valley by Prithvi Narayan Shah, only this valley was originally referred to as Nepal.</ref> To the westward of Nepal, there is a difficult tract, till the country again opens in the valley of Gorkah, the original possession of the present dynasty. \u2013 Westward of this the country is again difficult, till it somewhat improves in the district of Kemaoon.<ref>Kumaon</ref> Further to the westward lies the valley of the Dhoon,<ref>Dehradun</ref> and the territory of Sue-na-Ghur;<ref>[[Srinagar, Uttarakhand]]</ref> and further still, the more recent conquests, stretching to the village, in which Umar Sing,<ref>Amar Singh Thapa</ref> a chief of uncommon talents, commanded, and indeed, exercised an authority almost independent.\"<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 426\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First campaign==\n===British plan of operation===\n[[File:Officer and Private, 40th Foot, 1815.jpg|thumb|upright|Officer and Private, 40th Regiment of Foot, 1815]]\n[[File:Gurkha soldier 1815.jpg|thumb|upright|A Gorkhali warrior.]]\n\nThe initial British campaign was an attack on two fronts across a frontier of more than {{convert|1,500|km}}, from the Sutlej to the Koshi. In the eastern front, Major-General Bennet Marley and Major-General John Sullivan Wood led their respective columns across the [[Tarai]] towards the heart of the valley of Kathmandu. Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]] and Colonel [[David Ochterlony]] commanded columns in the western front.

All four divisions composed mostly of Indian Sepoys. Ochterlony's army was the only division without a single British battalion. In conclusion, the Gorkhali Army defeated the British on three fronts consisting the middle and the east whereas lost the remaining two fronts in the west.\n\n===Battle of Makwanpur Gadhi===\nMajor General Marley was tasked to occupy Hetauda and capture the fortresses of Hariharpur and Makawanpur before proceeding to Kathmandu. His frontage of advance lay between Rapati river and Bagmati river. After additional reinforcements, he had 12,000 troops for his offensive against the Makawanpur and Hariharpur axis. A big attack base was established but Major General Marley showed reluctance to take risks against the Nepalese. Some skirmishes had already started taking place. Similarly, Major General George Wood, sometimes known as the Tiger of the British Indian Army, proved exceedingly cautious against the hard charging Nepalese.\n\nColonel<ref>The use of English terms for their grades of command was common in the Nepalese army, but the powers of the different ranks did not correspond with those of the British system. The title of General was assumed by Bhimsen Thapa, as Commander-in-chief, and enjoyed by himself alone; of Colonels there were three or four only; all principal officers of the court, commanding more than one battalion. The title of Major was held by the adjutant of a battalion or independent company; and Captain was the next grade to colonel, implying the command of a corps. Luftun, or Lieutenant, was the style of the officers commanding companies under the Captain; and then followed the subaltern ranks of Soobadar, Jemadar, and Havildar, without any Ensigns. (Prinsep, p. 86-87)</ref> [[Ranabir Singh Thapa]], brother of Bhimsen Thapa, was to be the Sector Commander of Makawanpur-Hariharpur axis. He was given a very large fortress and about 4,000 troops with old rifles and a few pieces of cannons. But the British could not move forward from the border. Colonel Ranabir Singh Thapa had been trying to lure the enemies to his selected killing area. But Major General Wood would not venture forward from Bara Gadhi and he eventually fell back to Betiya.\n\n===Battle of Jitgadh===\nWith the help of an ousted Palpali king, Major General Wood planned to march on Siuraj, Jit Gadhi and Nuwakot with a view to bypass the Butwal defenses, flushing out minor opposition on the axis, and assault Palpa from a less guarded flank. Nepalese Colonel [[Ujir Singh Thapa]] had deployed his 1200 troops in many defensive positions including Jit Gadhi, Nuwakot Gadhi and Kathe Gadhi. The troops under Colonel Ujir were very disciplined and he himself was a dedicated and able commander. He was famous for exploiting advantage in men, material, natural resources and well versed in mountain tactics. The British advance took place on 22nd Poush1871 BS (January 1814 AD) to Jit Gadh. While they were advancing to this fortress, crossing the Tinau River, the Nepalese troops opened fire from the fortress. Another of the attackers' columns was advancing to capture Tansen Bazar. Here too, Nepalese spoiling attacks forced the General to fall back to Gorakhpur. About 70 Nepalese lost their lives in Nuwakot pakhe Gadhi. Meanwhile, more than 300 of the enemy perished.\n\n===Battle of Hariharpur Gadhi===\nNo special military action had taken place in Hariharpur Gadhi fortress in the first campaign. Major General Bannet Marley and Major General George Wood had not been able to advance for an offensive against Makawanpur and Hariharpur Gadhi fortresses.\n\n===Battle of Nalapani===\n{{further|Battle of Nalapani}}\nThe [[Battle of Nalapani]] was the first battle of Anglo-Nepalese War. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near [[Dehradun]], which was placed under siege by the British between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain [[Balbhadra Kunwar]], while Major-General [[Rollo Gillespie]], who had previously fought at the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Battle of Java]], was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison, which also consisted of brave women who reportedly shielded the bullets and cannonballs with their bodies, successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month.\nFraser recorded the situation in the following terms:\n\n{{block quote|The determined resolution of the small party which held this small post for more than a month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, and a generous spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.{{pb}}Whatever the nature of the Ghoorkhas may have been found in other quarters, there was here no cruelty to wounded or to prisoners; no poisoned arrows were used; no wells or waters were poisoned; no rancorous spirit of revenge seemed to animate them: they fought us in fair conflict, like men; and, in intervals of actual combat, showed us a liberal courtesy worthy of a more enlightened people.{{pb}}So far from insulting the bodies of the dead and wounded, they permitted them to lie untouched, till carried away; and none were stripped, as is too universally the case.<ref>W. Shackell, p.590</ref>}}\n\nAfter two costly and unsuccessful attempts to seize the fort by direct attack, the British changed their approach and sought to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's external water supply. Having suffered three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra, refusing to surrender, led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. The battle set the tone for the rest of the Anglo-Nepalese War, and a number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way.\n\nThe experience at Nalapani so discomforted the British that Lord Hastings so far varied his plan of operations as to forego the detachment of a part of this division to occupy Gurhwal.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\">Prinsep, p. 94.</ref> He accordingly instructed Colonel Mawbey to leave a few men in a strong position for the occupation of the Doon and to carry his undivided army against Amar Singh's son, Colonel Ranajor Singh Thapa, who was with about 2300 elite of the Gurkha army, at Nahan.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\"/> It was further intended to reinforce the division considerably; and the command was handed over to Major-General Martindell.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 94.\"/> In the meantime Colonel Mawbey had led back the division through the Keree pass, leaving Colonel Carpenter posted at Kalsee, at the north western extremity of the Doon.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 95.\">Prinsep, p. 95.</ref> This station commanded the passes of the Jumna on the main line of communication between the western and eastern portions of the Gurkha territory, and thus was well chosen for procuring intelligence.<ref name=\"Prinsep, p. 95.\"/>\n\n===Battle of Jaithak===\n{{further|Battle of Jaithak}}\n[[File:Battle of Jaithak.JPG|thumb|Stockaded position of the Nepalese at Jaithak]]\nMajor General Martindale now joined the force and took over command. He occupied the town of Nahan on 27 December, and started his attack on the fort of Jaithak. The fort had a garrison of 2000 men under the command of [[Ranajor Singh Thapa]], the son of the [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. The first assault ended in disaster, with the Nepalese successfully warding off the British offensive. The second managed to cut off the water supply to the fort, but could not capture it mainly because of the exhausted state of the troops and shortage of ammunition. Martindale lost heart and ordered a withdrawal. Jaithak was eventually captured much later in the war, when Ochterlony had taken over the command.<ref name=\"Navarne, p. 190.\">Navarne, p. 190.</ref>\n\nA single day of battle at Jaithak cost the British over three hundred men dead and wounded and cooled Martindell's ardour for battle. For over a month and a half, he refused to take any further initiative against the Nepalese army. Thus by mid-February, of the four British commanders the Nepalese army had faced till that time, Gillespie was dead, Marley had deserted, Wood was harassed into inactivity, and Martindell was practically incapacitated by over-cautiousness. It set the scene for Octorloney to soon show his mettle and change the course of the war.\n\n===Trying times for Nepalese troops===\nOut West, the Nepalese were hopelessly overextended. Kumaun, a key link in Nepalese army communications with the Far West, was defended by a small force, numbering about seven hundred and fifty men, with an equal number of Kumaoni irregulars, altogether about fifteen hundred men to defend a whole province. In addition, Doti which was to the East of Kumaun, had been practically stripped of troops. [[Bam Shah]], as governor of Kumaun, had final responsibility for the defence of the province.\n\nThe British force, numbering initially over forty five hundred men, was easily able to outmanoeuvre the Nepalese army defenders and force them to abandon one post after another. Despite a significant victory over Captain Hearsey's force, which had been sent on a flanking movement though Eastern Kumaun, and the capture of the captain himself, the Nepalese army was unable to stem the tide of the British advance. Hasti Dal Shah arrived in Almora with a small body of reinforcement troops. A further reinforcement of four companies was sent from Kathmandu to aid the beleaguered defences of Kumaun, but the difficulties of communication through the hills prevented them from arriving in time to be of any help.\n\nMeanwhile, Hastings sent Colonel Nicolls, Quartermaster-General for the British troops in India, to take charge of the Almora campaign and assigned two thousand regular troops to this front in addition to the very large number of irregulars already assigned to the area \u2013 all of this against fewer than one thousand Nepalese army soldiers.\n\n[[Hasti Dal Shah]] and some five hundred Nepalese Army men had set out from Almora to secure Almora's Northern line of communications with Kathmandu. This party was intercepted. Hasti Dal Shah, the ablest Nepalese commander in this sector, was killed in the first moments of the battle. The Nepalese suffered terrible losses. When word of this disaster reached the defenders at Almora, they were stunned. The British closed in on Almora and the Nepalese was unable to prevent the British advance. On April 25, 1815, 2,000 British regulars under Col. Nicholls and a force of irregular troops under Col. Gardiner assaulted and captured the heights of the town of Almorah. Subsequently, the British managed to establish gun positions within seventy yards of the gate of the fort at Almora and the British artillery demolished the walls of the fort at point blank range. Bam Shah surrendered Almora on 27 April 1815. The result of this British victory was the capitulation of the province of Kumaon and all of its fortresses.\n\n===Second Battle of Malaon and Jaithak===\nThe second battle of Malaon and Jaithak cut the Nepalese lines of communication between Central Nepal and the Far West. It also sealed the fate of Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at Malaon and Ranajor Singh Thapa at Jaithak. At Malaon, Major-General Ochterlony had moved with extreme care summoning reinforcements and heavy guns from Delhi until his total attack force consisted of over ten thousand men well-equipped with heavy cannon.\n\nKazi Amar Singh Thapa's position in the Malaon Hills depended on Bilaspur in the lowlands for his food supplies, and the nature of the hills forced him to spread his forces very thinly in an attempt to defend every vantage point. Ochterlony cut off the supply of food from Bilaspur and then turned his attention to the intricate network of defensive posts that were designed to withstand any frontal assault. Although rear fortifications supported these posts, none could withstand a long cannonade by heavy guns. Because Ochterlony had sufficient troops to attack and overwhelm several positions simultaneously, the thinly spread Nepalese defences could be dangerously divided.\n\nOchterlony chose his target, a point on the ridge, and then proceeded to move slowly, consolidating each position that he took, and allowing the pioneers time to build roads so that the heavy guns could be moved forward to support each attack. After a series of carefully planned and executed moves, he succeeded in establishing a position on the crest of Deothal, not even over a thousand yards from Kazi Amar Singh Thapa's main fort at Malaon. The old warrior [[Bhakti Thapa]] valiantly led assault after assault on this position, but he died during battle and the position did not fall. Immensely impressed by Bhakti's sustained courage against impossible odds, the British made the well appreciated and honourable gesture of returning his body with full military honours. The British superiority in numbers made it inevitable that they would be able to establish themselves and their heavy guns on a vantage point within range of Ranajor Singh's fortifications, sooner or later.\n\nBoth Kazi Amar Singh Thapa and Ranajor Singh Thapa were thus hemmed in and looking down the barrels of the British guns when Bam Shah's letter arrived, announcing the fall of Almora. Although the old commander was still reluctant to surrender, Kazi Amar Singh Thapa at last saw the hopelessness of the situation and, compelled by circumstances and the British guns, surrendered with honour for both himself and Ranajor Singh. The Nepalese positions in the Far West lost control to the British on 15 May 1815.\n\n==Second campaign==\n[[File:Eight Gurkha men depicted in a British Indian painting, 1815.jpg|thumb|right|Gorkhali soldiers in 1815.]]\n\nThe outstretched Nepalese army was defeated on the Western front i.e. [[Garhwal District|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] area. Ochterlony had finally outfoxed Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. He was the only successful British Commander in the first Nepal-Company campaign. Not surprisingly [[Lord Moira]] appointed him as the Main Operational Commander in the second offensive on the Bharatpur-Makawanpur-Hariharpur front with 17,000 strong invasion force, but again, most of them were Indian sepoys.<ref name=\"Naravane, p. 191\">{{harvp|Naravane|2006|p=191}}</ref>\n\nThe British had given a 15-day ultimatum to Nepal to ratify a treaty on 28 November. But the points of the treaty were very difficult for the Nepalese to ratify quickly. The delay provided the excuse for the British to commence the second military campaign against the kingdom. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa, another brother of [[Bhimsen Thapa]], had been appointed as Sector Commander for defensive battles for the area from [[Bijayapur]] to [[Sindhuli Gadhi]] in the first campaign. In this second campaign, Bada Kaji Amarsingh Thapa{{refn|group=note|Not to be confused with the better known commander of Gorkhali forces in the [[Gurkha War]] with the same name. The two Amar Singhs are differentiated by the qualifier Bada (greater) and Sanu (lesser).}}was detailed as Sector Commander for [[Sindhuli Gadhi]] and the eastern front. Colonel Bhaktawar Singh Thapa was manning his headquarters at [[Makwanpur Gadhi]]. Major General [[David Ochterlony]], was the overall commander against Nepal with a massive 17,000 British troops to assault the fronts including Upardang Gadhi, Sinchyang Gadhi, Kandrang Gadhi, Makawanpur Gadhi and [[Hariharpur Gadhi]].\n\nDuring the campaign in February 1816, Ochterlony decided to take a very infrequently used pass through the mountains. The failure there would have been a disaster for British. But the successful passage would allow British to directly emerge and attack the Nepalese's rear. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O\u2019Hollorah followed the river Bagmati to reach [[Hariharpur Gadhi]]. Some of the heads of villagers were bribed for sensitive information about the defensive positions in the area of Hariharpur Gadhi. The information seriously compromised the Nepalese defences. Secret routes would have given the enemy advantage even if they were able to get only a battalion through. But the British were able to advance with more than a brigade's strength. Colonel Kelly and Colonel O\u2019Hollorah launched their attack from two different directions on 29 February. The Nepalese troops were eventually driven back from Hariharpur Gadhi after a big battle. Kaji Ranjore Singh Thapa withdrew to Sindhuli Gadhi to link up with Bada Kaji [[Amar Singh Thapa]]. The British troops did not approach Sindhuli Gadhi and fell back to [[Makawanpur]] by the end of March 1816.\n\nThe situation became very critical for Nepal and the British which eventually led to a treaty. Major General [[David Ochterlony]] settled down to receive the treaty, signed by Kathmandu Durbar through Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya, Pandit Gajaraj Mishra and finally though Bhaktawar Singh Thapa. Two days later the ratified treaty was handed over to the British in [[Makawanpur]]. The war ended with the [[Treaty of Sugauli]], which has been considered as an unequal treaty which led to Nepal losing its one-third territory. The river Mechi became the new Eastern border and the Mahakali the Western boundary of Nepal.\n\n==Aftermath==\n===The Treaty of Sugauli===\n[[File:Sugauli treaty.jpg|thumb|right|Bhimsen Thapa's troops, right, at Segauli, 1816, with India Pattern Brown Bess muskets and chupi bayonets.]]\n[[File:Sugauli Treaty2.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] 4 March 1816. It suited Ochterlony to bring the campaign to a speedy conclusion because of the approach of the dreaded aul-fever season but also because a number of his European troops were suffering from [[dysentery]].]]\n\n{{main|Sugauli Treaty}}\n\nThe [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugauli]] was ratified on 4 March 1816. As per the treaty, Nepal lost all Sikkim (including [[Darjeeling district|Darjeeling]]), the territories of [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] and Western Terai. The [[Mechi River]] became the new eastern border and the [[Mahakali river]] the western boundary of the kingdom. The [[British East India Company]] would pay 200,000 rupees annually to compensate for the loss of income from the Terai region. The British set up [[Resident (title)|Resident]].<ref>India-Board (8 November 1816) in Kathmandu.</ref> The fear of having a British Resident in Kathmandu ultimately proved to be unfounded, as the rulers of Nepal managed to isolate the Resident to such an extent as to be in virtual house arrest.\n\nThe Terai lands, however, proved difficult for the British to govern and some of them were returned to the kingdom later in 1816 and the annual payments accordingly abolished.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 304-305.\">Oldfield, p. 304-305.</ref> However even after the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War, the border issue between the two states was not yet settled. The boundary between Nepal and Oudh was not finally adjusted until 1830; and that between Nepal and the British territories remained as a matter of discussion between the two Governments for several years later.<ref name=\"Oldfield, p. 306.\">Oldfield, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe British never had the intention to destroy either the existence or the independence of a state which was usefully interposed between them and the dependencies of China.<ref name=\"Anon (1816), p. 428.\">Anon (1816), p. 428.</ref> Lord Hastings had given up his plan to dismember Nepal from fear of antagonising China \u2013 whose vassal Nepal in theory was. In 1815, while British forces were campaigning in far western Nepal, a high-ranking Manchu official advanced with a large\nmilitary force from China to Lhasa; and the following year, after the Anglo-Nepalese treaty had been signed, the Chinese army moved south again, right up to Nepal's frontier. The Nepalese panicked, because memories were still vivid of the Chinese invasion of 1792, and there was a flurry of urgent diplomatic activity. Hastings sent mollifying assurances to the imperial authorities, and ordered the British Resident, newly arrived in Kathmandu, to pack his bags and be ready to leave at once if the Chinese invaded again.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', pp.367.\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.367.</ref>\nDue to the forced treaty under compulsion and duress, experts on international treaty view that Nepal might not have had the capability to recognize the Sugauli as a sound treaty.\n\n===Cost of war===\nDespite the boast of Lord Moira to the British parliament on having increased the state coffers, the Gurkha War had in reality cost more than the combined cost of the campaigns against the [[Marathas]] and the [[Pindaris]] for which Lord Moira's administration is better known: Sicca Rs. {{formatnum:5156961}} as against Sicca Rs. {{formatnum:3753789}}.<ref name=\"Lamb, p. 41.\">Lamb, p. 41.</ref> This was the kind of fact which greatly influenced the policy of the Company government in subsequent years. Thus, while the Company Government, in theory, thoroughly approved of the development of trade, especially in shawl wool, between Western Tibet and its territories, it was unprepared to take any decisive step to bring this about. It preferred to leave the Chinese in Tibet to their own devices, and hoped to avoid the risk, however slight, of another expensive hill war.<ref name=\"Lamb, p. 41.\"/>\n\nFurthermore, despite the British merchants' direct access to the wool growing areas after the war, the hopes of shawl wool trade were never realised. The British merchants found that they were too late. The shawl wool market was strictly closed and closely guarded. It was monopolised by traders from Kashmir and Ladakh, and the only outsider with whom they dealt was Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the powerful Sikh ruler of Lahore. Ranjit was very zealous of his privilege, and he was the last person the British could afford to offend at this time of crisis and uncertainty. So the East India Company never did get its shawl wool. When it finally acquired the Punjab and Kashmir, after the Sikh Wars of the 1840s, it had long since given up trade, and Kashmir was so little valued that it was quickly discarded \u2013 sold for a knock-down price to the Raja of Jammu.<ref name=\"Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', pp.366-367.\">Pemble, ''Forgetting and remembering Britain's Gurkha War'', p.366-367.</ref>\n\n===Gorkha recruitment===\n{{main|Brigade of Gurkhas|Gorkha regiments (India)}}\n[[File:Ilngurkhas1858.jpg|thumb|right|Gurkahs of 66th Regiment in their national costume.]]\n[[File:Kukri.jpg|thumb|The [[Khukuri]] is the traditional weapon and tool of the [[Gurkhas]].]]\n\nDavid Ochterlony and the political agent [[William Fraser (British administrator)|William Fraser]] were quick to recognize the potential of Nepalese soldiers in British service. During the war the British were keen to use defectors from the Nepalese army and employ them as irregular forces. His confidence in their loyalty was such that in April 1815 he proposed forming them into a battalion under Lieutenant Ross called the Nasiri regiment. This regiment, which later became the [[1GR|1st King George's Own Gurkha Rifles]], saw action at the Malaun fort under the leadership of Lieutenant Lawtie, who reported to Ochterlony that he \"had the greatest reason to be satisfied with their exertions\".\n\nAbout 5,000 men entered British service in 1815, most of whom were not 'real' Gorkhali but Kumaonis, Garhwalis and other Himalayan hill men. These groups, eventually lumped together under the term ''Gurkha'', became the backbone of British Indian forces.\n\nAs well as Ochterlony's Gorkhali battalions, William Fraser and [[Frederick Young (soldier)|Lieutenant Frederick Young]] raised the Sirmoor battalion, later to become the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles]]; an additional battalion, the Kumaon battalion was also raised eventually becoming the [[3rd Queen Alexandra's Own Gurkha Rifles]]. None of these men fought in the second campaign.\n\n===Fate of protagonists===\n====Bhimsen Thapa====\n{{main|Bhimsen Thapa}}\n\nPrime Minister [[Bhimsen Thapa]], with the support of the queen regent [[Queen Tripurasundari|Tripura Sundari]], remained in power despite the defeat of Nepal. Other ruling families, particularly the Pandes, decried what they saw as Bhimsen Thapa's submissive attitude towards the British. The prime minister however had been able to retain power by maintaining a large, modernized army and politically dominating the court during the minority of King [[Rajendra of Nepal|Rajendra Bikram Shah]], (reigned 1816\u20131847). Additionally, he was able to freeze out the Pandes from power by appointing members of his own family into positions of authority.\n\nWhen queen Tripura Sundari died in 1832, [[Bhimsen Thapa]] began to lose influence. In 1833, [[Brian Houghton Hodgson|Brian Hodgson]] became British resident, openly favouring Bhimsen Thapa's opponents, and in 1837 the king announced his intention to rule independently, depriving the prime minister and his nephew of their military powers. After the eldest son of the queen died, Bhimsen Thapa was falsely accused of attempting to poison the prince. Although acquitted, the Thapas were in turmoil. When the head of the Pande family, Rana Jang Pande, became prime minister, he had Bhimsen Thapa re-imprisoned; Bhimsen Thapa committed suicide in August 1839.\n\n====David Ochterlony====\n{{main|David Ochterlony}}\n\nFor his part, [[David Ochterlony]] received thanks from both [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] and became the first officer in the [[British East India Company]] to be awarded the [[Order of the Bath|GCB]]. [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Lord Moira]] also reinstated him as Resident at [[Delhi]] and he lived in the style appropriate to a very senior figure of the Company. However, after Lord Moira left India \u2013 succeeded by [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord Amherst]] as Governor-General in 1823 \u2013 Ochterlony fell out of favor.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Raja]] of [[Bharatpur, India|Bharatpur]] died and the six-year-old heir to the throne, whom Ochterlony supported, was usurped by his cousin Durjan Sal. When Durjan Sal failed to submit to Ochterlony's demands to vacate the throne, the British general prepared to march on Bharatpur. He did not receive the backing of the new Governor-General however, and after Amherst countermanded his orders, Ochterlony resigned, as Amherst had anticipated. This episode badly affected the ailing general who died shortly after on 14 July 1825. A 165-foot-high memorial was later erected in [[Calcutta]] in his memory; however, Sir David Ochterlony's greatest legacy is the continuing recruitment of [[Gurkha|Gorkhas]] into the British and Indian armies.\n\nSoon after Ochterlony's resignation Amherst was himself obliged to do what Ochterlony had prepared to do, and laid siege to Bharatpur.<ref name=\"Naravane, p. 191\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Gurkha]]\n* [[History of Nepal]]\n* [[Kingdom of Nepal]]\n* [[Brigade of Gurkhas]]\n* [[Sino-Nepalese War]]\n* [[Gurkha\u2013Sikh War]]\n* [[Nepalese-Tibetan War]]\n* [[East India Company]]\n* [[Company rule in India]]\n* [[Nawab of Awadh]]\n*[[Garhwali people]]\n*[[Kumauni people]]\n* [[Awadh]]\n* [[Battle of Nalapani]]\n* [[Treaty of Thapathali]]\n{{col div end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\nThere's an inaccuracy in the troops size, especially from the British East India Company.

The stated goals were to help the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], to secure supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports, and to re-establish the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Overthrow of the new [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] regime was an additional, covert motivation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RUHn9nCC9EoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=foglesong,+bolsheviks#v=onepage&q=they%20in%20fact%20fought%20a%20long%20undeclared%20war&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136|location=|pages=4\u20136|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uwi9dqQ-L80C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Trani,+first+cold+war#v=onepage&q=Kaledin,%20the%20hetman%20of%20the%20Don%20Cossacks&f=false|title=The First Cold War: The Legacy of Woodrow Wilson in U.S.{{Snd}} Soviet Relations|last=Davis|first=Donald E.|last2=Trani|first2=Eugene P.|date=2002-08-26|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=9780826263452|location=|pages=92\u201395|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bolshevik government withdrew from [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] openly backed the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[White Movement|White forces]] in [[Russia]]. Allied efforts were hampered by divided objectives, [[war-weariness]] from the overall global conflict, and a lack of [[home front|domestic support]]. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion, compelled the Allied powers to end the [[North Russia intervention|North Russia]] and [[Siberian intervention]]s in 1920, though the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia]] continued until 1922 and the [[Empire of Japan]] continued to occupy the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] until 1925.<ref name=\"beyer\">Beyer, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Prologue to the Allied intervention==\n\n===Revolution===\n{{Main|Russian Revolution}}\nIn 1917, the [[Russian Empire]] was in a state of political strife, and public support for World War I and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] was dwindling. The country was on the brink of revolution. The [[February Revolution]] changed the course of the war; under intense political pressure, the Tsar abdicated and the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was formed, led initially by [[Georgy Lvov]] and later by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. The Provisional Government pledged to continue fighting the [[German Empire|Germans]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nThe Allied Powers had been shipping supplies to Russia since the beginning of the war in 1914 through the ports of [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Murmansk]], and [[Vladivostok]]. In 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side. [[United States|US]] President [[Woodrow Wilson]] dropped his reservations about joining the war with the despotic Tsar as an ally, and the United States began providing economic and technical support to Kerensky's government.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nThe war became unpopular with the Russian populace. Political and social unrest increased, with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] anti-war [[Bolshevik]] Party under [[Vladimir Lenin]] gaining widespread support. Large numbers of common soldiers either mutinied or deserted the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. In the offensive of 18 June 1917, the Russian Army was defeated by the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces as a result of a counter-attack. This led to the collapse of the Eastern Front. The demoralised Russian Army was on the verge of mutiny and most soldiers had deserted the front lines. Kerensky replaced [[Aleksei Brusilov]] with [[Lavr Kornilov]] as Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\n\nKornilov attempted to set up a military dictatorship by staging a coup in late August 1917. He had the support of the British [[military attach\u00e9]], Brigadier-General [[Alfred Knox]], and Kerensky accused Knox of producing pro-Kornilov [[propaganda]]. Kerensky also claimed Lord [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]], member of the British War Cabinet, wrote him a letter expressing support for Kornilov. A British armoured car squadron commanded by [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]] and dressed in Russian uniforms participated in the [[Kornilov affair|failed coup]].<ref>''Intervention and the War'' by Richard Ullman, [[Princeton University Press]], 1961, pp. 11\u201313</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wbxwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&dq=general+buchanan,+moscow,+kornilov&source=bl&ots=T2fRfbn0qd&sig=rSD01en5KTp5dY3VOgAMnrZ5FF4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM4PPY0qjXAhWN2YMKHcLsBXIQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=general%20buchanan%2C%20moscow%2C%20kornilov&f=false Keith Neilson, ''Strategy and Supply (RLE The First World War): The Anglo-Russian Alliance'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 282-290]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4SGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=barter,+moscow,+kornilov&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX2JDOqLjXAhUL5yYKHS6hD_YQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&q=barter%2C%20moscow%2C%20kornilov&f=false Michael Hughes, INSIDE THE ENIGMA: British Officials in Russia, 1900\u201339 (Bloomsbury, 2006), p. 111-114]</ref> In 1917, the [[October Revolution]] led to the overthrow of Kerensky's provisional government, and the Bolsheviks assuming power.\n\n===Russia exits the war===\n{{Main|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk}}\n\nGerman troops invaded the Russian Empire and threatened to capture Moscow and impose its own regime in early 1918. Lenin wanted to cut a deal with Germany but was unable to get approval from his council until late February. Bolshevik Russia then switched sides and supported the German position. The [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The Allied Powers felt betrayed and turned against the new regime, aiding its \"[[White movement|White]]\" enemies and landing troops to prevent Russian supplies from reaching Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Service|title=Lenin: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9mbl_xbWpkC&pg=PT412|year=2000|page=342|isbn=9780330476331}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe betrayal removed whatever reservations the Allied Powers had about overthrowing the Bolsheviks. According to [[William Henry Chamberlin]], even before Brest-Litovsk, \"[[Downing Street]] contemplated a protectorate over the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Quai d'Orsay]] over [[Crimea]], [[Bessarabia]] and [[Ukraine]]\", and began negotiating deals for funding White generals to bring them into being. [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart]] and another British agent and a French official in Moscow tried to organize a coup that would overthrow the Bolshevik regime. They were dealing with double agents and were exposed and arrested.<ref>John W. Long, \"Plot and counter\u2010plot in revolutionary Russia: Chronicling the Bruce Lockhart conspiracy, 1918.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 10#1 (1995): 122\u2013143.</ref>\n\n=== Czechoslovak Legions ===\n{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}\n[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb|250px|Czechoslovak troops in Vladivostok (1918)]]\nThe Czechoslovak Legion was at times in control of most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and all major cities in Siberia.  Austro-Hungarian prisoners were of a number of various nationalities; some Czechoslovak POWs deserted to the Russian Army.  Czechoslovaks had long desired to create their own independent state, and the Russians aided in establishing special Czechoslovak units (the [[Czechoslovak Legions]]) to fight the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ensured that [[prisoner-of-war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW) would be repatriated.    In 1917, the Bolsheviks stated that if the Czechoslovak Legions remained neutral and agreed to leave Russia, they would be granted safe passage through Siberia en route to [[French Third Republic|France]] via [[Vladivostok]] to fight with the Allied forces on the Western Front.  The Czechoslovak Legions travelled via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to Vladivostok.  However, fighting between the Legions and the Bolsheviks erupted in May 1918.\n\n=== Allied concerns ===\n[[File:Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force in Vladivostok 1919.jpg|thumb|Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force, 1919]]\n\nThe Allied Powers became concerned at the collapse of the Eastern Front and the loss of their Tsarist ally to [[communism]], and there was also the question of the large quantities of supplies and equipment in Russian ports, which the Allied Powers feared might be seized by the Germans. Also worrisome to the Allied Powers was the April 1918 landing of a division of German troops in [[Finland]], increasing speculation they might attempt to capture the [[Murmansk railway|Murmansk-Petrograd railway]], and subsequently the strategic port of [[Murmansk]] and possibly [[Arkhangelsk]]. Other concerns regarded the potential destruction of the Czechoslovak Legions and the threat of [[Bolshevism]], the nature of which worried many Allied governments. Meanwhile, Allied materiel in transit quickly accumulated in the warehouses in Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. [[Estonia]] had [[Estonian War of Independence|established]] a national army with the support of [[heimosodat|Finnish]] volunteers and were defending against the [[7th Army (RSFSR)|7th Red Army]]'s attack.<ref name=maide />\n\nFaced with these events, the British and French governments decided upon an Allied military intervention in Russia. \n[[File:American troops in Vladivostok 1918 HD-SN-99-02013.JPEG|thumb|American troops parading in Vladivostok, August 1918]]\nSeverely short of troops to spare, the British and French requested that President Wilson provide American soldiers for the campaign.  In July 1918, against the advice of the [[United States Department of War]], Wilson [[United States and the Russian Revolution|agreed to the limited participation]] of 5,000 [[United States Army]] troops in the campaign. This force, which became known as the \"American North Russia Expeditionary Force\"<ref name=\"E.M. Halliday, 2000 p. 44\">E.M. Halliday, ''When Hell Froze Over'' (New York City, NY, ibooks, inc., 2000), p. 44</ref> (a.k.a. the [[Polar Bear Expedition]]) were sent to Arkhangelsk while another 8,000 soldiers, organised as the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]],<ref name=\"Robert L. Willett pp. 166\">Robert L. Willett, ''Russian Sideshow'', pp. 166\u2013167, 170</ref> were shipped to [[Vladivostok]] from the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]] and from [[Camp Fremont]] in California.\n\nThat same month, the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] agreed to the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]'s request to command and provide most of the soldiers for a combined [[British Empire]] force, which also included Australian and [[British Raj|Indian]] troops. Some of this force was the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]]; another part was the [[North Russia Intervention]]. A [[Royal Navy]] squadron was sent to the [[British campaign in the Baltic (1918\u201319)|Baltic]] under [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair]]. This force consisted of modern {{sclass2-|C|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass2-|V and W|destroyer|1}}s. In December 1918, Sinclair sailed into Estonian and Latvian ports, sending in troops and supplies, and promising to attack the Bolsheviks \"as far as my guns can reach\". In January 1919, he was succeeded in command by Rear-Admiral [[Walter Cowan]].\n\nThe [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], concerned about their northern border, sent the largest military force, numbering about 70,000. They desired the establishment of a [[buffer state]] in Siberia,<ref name= Humphreys25>Humphreys, ''The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s'', p. 25</ref> and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff|General Staff]] viewed the situation in Russia as an opportunity for settling Japan's \"northern problem\". The Japanese government was also intensely hostile to communism.\n\n[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|Allied troops parading in [[Vladivostok]], 1918]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] created the special \"''Corpo di Spedizione''\" with [[Alpini]] troops sent from Italy and ex-POWs of [[Italia irredenta|Italian ethnicity]] from the former Austro-Hungarian army who were recruited to the ''[[Italian Legione Redenta]]''. They were initially based in the [[Concessions of Tianjin|Italian Concession in Tientsin]] and numbered about 2,500.\n\n[[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] also sent contingents in support of the intervention.\n\nHowever, while Soviet propaganda often portrayed Allied intervention as an alliance dedicated to crushing a nascent, worldwide communist revolution in the cradle, in reality the Allies were not particularly interested in intervention. While there were some loud voices in favour, such as Winston Churchill, these were very much in the minority. The main concern for the Allies was to defeat the German Empire on the Western Front. While the Bolshevik's repudiation of Russia's national debt and seizure of foreign-owned industries did cause tension, the main concern for the Allies was the Bolshevik's desire to get Russia out of the First World War. The Allies disliked the Whites, who were seen as nothing more than a small group of conservative nationalists who showed no signs of planning reform. Government ministers were also influenced by anti-White public opinion, which was being mobilised by trade unions. The low casualties suffered by the Allies is indicative of the low-level of their combat involvement. However, the Soviets were able to exploit the Allied intervention for propaganda purposes.<ref>Lee, Stephen J. European Dictatorships 1918\u20131945.

The force was initially delayed by 3,000 Russian Bolshevik troops at [[Bandar-e Anzali|Enzeli]] but then proceeded by ship to the port of Baku on the [[Caspian Sea]]. This was the primary target for the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces and Dunsterforce endured a [[Battle of Baku|short, brutal siege in September 1918]] before being forced to withdraw.\n\nHowever, having been defeated in World War I, the Ottoman Empire had to withdraw its forces from the borders of Azerbaijan in the middle of November 1918. Headed by General [[William Montgomery Thomson|William Thomson]], the British troops of 5,000 soldiers arrived in Baku on 17 November, and martial law was implemented on the capital of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] until \"the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order\".\n\n=== Trans-Caspian Campaign ===\nAllied military action began on 11 August 1918, when General [[Wilfrid Malleson|Malleson]] intervened in support of the [[Transcaspian Government|Ashkhabad Executive Committee]], who had ousted the [[Tashkent Soviet]] Bolsheviks from the western end of the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] in July 1918.  Malleson had been authorised to intervene with Empire and British troops, in what would be referred to as the [[Malleson Mission]]. He sent the Machine Gun Section of the [[19th Punjabi Rifles]] to [[Ba\u00fdramaly]] located on the [[Trans-Caspian railway]]. After combat at [[Merv]], they were joined by the rest of the regiment. There was further action at [[Kaka, Turkmenistan|Kaka]] on 28 August 11 and 18 September. They were reinforced on 25 September by two squadrons of the [[28th Light Cavalry]]. Fighting alongside Trans-Caspian troops, they subsequently fought at [[Arman Sagad]] (between 9 and 11 October) and [[Dushak]] (14 October).\n\nBy 1 November, they had re-occupied Merv and on instructions of the British government, halted their advance and took up defensive positions at Bairam Ali. The Trans-Caspian forces continued to attack the Bolsheviks to the north. After the Trans-Caspian forces were routed at [[Uch Aji]], their commander Colonel Knollys sent the 28th Cavalry to their support at [[Annenkovo]]. In January 1919, one company of the 19th Punjabi Rifles was sent to reinforce the position at Annenkovo, where a second battle took place on 16 January. The British Government decided on 21 January to withdraw the force, and the last troops left for [[Persia]] on 5 April.<ref>[http://members.fortunecity.com/behindthelines/transcas.htm Operations in Trans-Caspia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402050131/http://members.fortunecity.com/behindthelines/transcas.htm |date=2 April 2009 }}, Behind the Lines.

[[Frederick L.

The stated goals were to help the [[Czechoslovak Legion]], to secure supplies of munitions and armaments in Russian ports, and to re-establish the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Overthrow of the new [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] regime was an additional, covert motivation.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RUHn9nCC9EoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=foglesong,+bolsheviks#v=onepage&q=they%20in%20fact%20fought%20a%20long%20undeclared%20war&f=false|title=America's Secret War against Bolshevism: U.S. Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1917-1920|last=Foglesong|first=David S.|date=2014-02-01|publisher=UNC Press Books|isbn=9781469611136|location=|pages=4\u20136|language=en|chapter=Introduction}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uwi9dqQ-L80C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Trani,+first+cold+war#v=onepage&q=Kaledin,%20the%20hetman%20of%20the%20Don%20Cossacks&f=false|title=The First Cold War: The Legacy of Woodrow Wilson in U.S.{{Snd}} Soviet Relations|last=Davis|first=Donald E.|last2=Trani|first2=Eugene P.|date=2002-08-26|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=9780826263452|location=|pages=92\u201395|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Bolshevik government withdrew from [[World War I]], the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] openly backed the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[White Movement|White forces]] in [[Russia]]. Allied efforts were hampered by divided objectives, [[war-weariness]] from the overall global conflict, and a lack of [[home front|domestic support]]. These factors, together with the evacuation of the Czechoslovak Legion, compelled the Allied powers to end the [[North Russia intervention|North Russia]] and [[Siberian intervention]]s in 1920, though the [[Japanese intervention in Siberia]] continued until 1922 and the [[Empire of Japan]] continued to occupy the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] until 1925.<ref name=\"beyer\">Beyer, pp. 152\u201353.</ref>\n\n==Prologue to the Allied intervention==\n\n===Revolution===\n{{Main|Russian Revolution}}\nIn 1917, the [[Russian Empire]] was in a state of political strife, and public support for World War I and [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] was dwindling. The country was on the brink of revolution. The [[February Revolution]] changed the course of the war; under intense political pressure, the Tsar abdicated and the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was formed, led initially by [[Georgy Lvov]] and later by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. The Provisional Government pledged to continue fighting the [[German Empire|Germans]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nThe Allied Powers had been shipping supplies to Russia since the beginning of the war in 1914 through the ports of [[Arkhangelsk]], [[Murmansk]], and [[Vladivostok]]. In 1917, the United States entered the war on the Allied side. [[United States|US]] President [[Woodrow Wilson]] dropped his reservations about joining the war with the despotic Tsar as an ally, and the United States began providing economic and technical support to Kerensky's government.<ref name=\"beyer\"/>\n\nThe war became unpopular with the Russian populace. Political and social unrest increased, with the [[Marxism|Marxist]] anti-war [[Bolshevik]] Party under [[Vladimir Lenin]] gaining widespread support. Large numbers of common soldiers either mutinied or deserted the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. In the offensive of 18 June 1917, the Russian Army was defeated by the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] forces as a result of a counter-attack. This led to the collapse of the Eastern Front. The demoralised Russian Army was on the verge of mutiny and most soldiers had deserted the front lines. Kerensky replaced [[Aleksei Brusilov]] with [[Lavr Kornilov]] as Commander-in-Chief of the Army.\n\nKornilov attempted to set up a military dictatorship by staging a coup in late August 1917. He had the support of the British [[military attach\u00e9]], Brigadier-General [[Alfred Knox]], and Kerensky accused Knox of producing pro-Kornilov [[propaganda]]. Kerensky also claimed Lord [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]], member of the British War Cabinet, wrote him a letter expressing support for Kornilov. A British armoured car squadron commanded by [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]] and dressed in Russian uniforms participated in the [[Kornilov affair|failed coup]].<ref>''Intervention and the War'' by Richard Ullman, [[Princeton University Press]], 1961, pp. 11\u201313</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wbxwAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA285&lpg=PA285&dq=general+buchanan,+moscow,+kornilov&source=bl&ots=T2fRfbn0qd&sig=rSD01en5KTp5dY3VOgAMnrZ5FF4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiM4PPY0qjXAhWN2YMKHcLsBXIQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&q=general%20buchanan%2C%20moscow%2C%20kornilov&f=false Keith Neilson, ''Strategy and Supply (RLE The First World War): The Anglo-Russian Alliance'' (Routledge, 2014), p. 282-290]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_4SGDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA113&dq=barter,+moscow,+kornilov&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjX2JDOqLjXAhUL5yYKHS6hD_YQ6AEITzAI#v=onepage&q=barter%2C%20moscow%2C%20kornilov&f=false Michael Hughes, INSIDE THE ENIGMA: British Officials in Russia, 1900\u201339 (Bloomsbury, 2006), p. 111-114]</ref> In 1917, the [[October Revolution]] led to the overthrow of Kerensky's provisional government, and the Bolsheviks assuming power.\n\n===Russia exits the war===\n{{Main|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk}}\n\nGerman troops invaded the Russian Empire and threatened to capture Moscow and impose its own regime in early 1918. Lenin wanted to cut a deal with Germany but was unable to get approval from his council until late February. Bolshevik Russia then switched sides and supported the German position. The [[Russian SFSR|Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. The Allied Powers felt betrayed and turned against the new regime, aiding its \"[[White movement|White]]\" enemies and landing troops to prevent Russian supplies from reaching Germany.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert Service|title=Lenin: A Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9mbl_xbWpkC&pg=PT412|year=2000|page=342|isbn=9780330476331}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe betrayal removed whatever reservations the Allied Powers had about overthrowing the Bolsheviks. According to [[William Henry Chamberlin]], even before Brest-Litovsk, \"[[Downing Street]] contemplated a protectorate over the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Quai d'Orsay]] over [[Crimea]], [[Bessarabia]] and [[Ukraine]]\", and began negotiating deals for funding White generals to bring them into being. [[R. H. Bruce Lockhart]] and another British agent and a French official in Moscow tried to organize a coup that would overthrow the Bolshevik regime. They were dealing with double agents and were exposed and arrested.<ref>John W. Long, \"Plot and counter\u2010plot in revolutionary Russia: Chronicling the Bruce Lockhart conspiracy, 1918.\" ''Intelligence and National Security'' 10#1 (1995): 122\u2013143.</ref>\n\n=== Czechoslovak Legions ===\n{{Main|Czechoslovak Legion}}\n[[File:Czech Troops.jpg|thumb|250px|Czechoslovak troops in Vladivostok (1918)]]\nThe Czechoslovak Legion was at times in control of most of the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] and all major cities in Siberia.  Austro-Hungarian prisoners were of a number of various nationalities; some Czechoslovak POWs deserted to the Russian Army.  Czechoslovaks had long desired to create their own independent state, and the Russians aided in establishing special Czechoslovak units (the [[Czechoslovak Legions]]) to fight the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ensured that [[prisoner-of-war|prisoners-of-war]] (POW) would be repatriated.    In 1917, the Bolsheviks stated that if the Czechoslovak Legions remained neutral and agreed to leave Russia, they would be granted safe passage through Siberia en route to [[French Third Republic|France]] via [[Vladivostok]] to fight with the Allied forces on the Western Front.  The Czechoslovak Legions travelled via the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to Vladivostok.  However, fighting between the Legions and the Bolsheviks erupted in May 1918.\n\n=== Allied concerns ===\n[[File:Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force in Vladivostok 1919.jpg|thumb|Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force, 1919]]\n\nThe Allied Powers became concerned at the collapse of the Eastern Front and the loss of their Tsarist ally to [[communism]], and there was also the question of the large quantities of supplies and equipment in Russian ports, which the Allied Powers feared might be seized by the Germans. Also worrisome to the Allied Powers was the April 1918 landing of a division of German troops in [[Finland]], increasing speculation they might attempt to capture the [[Murmansk railway|Murmansk-Petrograd railway]], and subsequently the strategic port of [[Murmansk]] and possibly [[Arkhangelsk]]. Other concerns regarded the potential destruction of the Czechoslovak Legions and the threat of [[Bolshevism]], the nature of which worried many Allied governments. Meanwhile, Allied materiel in transit quickly accumulated in the warehouses in Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. [[Estonia]] had [[Estonian War of Independence|established]] a national army with the support of [[heimosodat|Finnish]] volunteers and were defending against the [[7th Army (RSFSR)|7th Red Army]]'s attack.<ref name=maide />\n\nFaced with these events, the British and French governments decided upon an Allied military intervention in Russia. \n[[File:American troops in Vladivostok 1918 HD-SN-99-02013.JPEG|thumb|American troops parading in Vladivostok, August 1918]]\nSeverely short of troops to spare, the British and French requested that President Wilson provide American soldiers for the campaign.  In July 1918, against the advice of the [[United States Department of War]], Wilson [[United States and the Russian Revolution|agreed to the limited participation]] of 5,000 [[United States Army]] troops in the campaign. This force, which became known as the \"American North Russia Expeditionary Force\"<ref name=\"E.M. Halliday, 2000 p. 44\">E.M. Halliday, ''When Hell Froze Over'' (New York City, NY, ibooks, inc., 2000), p. 44</ref> (a.k.a. the [[Polar Bear Expedition]]) were sent to Arkhangelsk while another 8,000 soldiers, organised as the [[American Expeditionary Force Siberia]],<ref name=\"Robert L. Willett pp. 166\">Robert L. Willett, ''Russian Sideshow'', pp. 166\u2013167, 170</ref> were shipped to [[Vladivostok]] from the [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippines]] and from [[Camp Fremont]] in California.\n\nThat same month, the [[Government of Canada|Canadian government]] agreed to the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]]'s request to command and provide most of the soldiers for a combined [[British Empire]] force, which also included Australian and [[British Raj|Indian]] troops. Some of this force was the [[Canadian Siberian Expeditionary Force]]; another part was the [[North Russia Intervention]]. A [[Royal Navy]] squadron was sent to the [[British campaign in the Baltic (1918\u201319)|Baltic]] under [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Edwyn Alexander-Sinclair]]. This force consisted of modern {{sclass2-|C|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass2-|V and W|destroyer|1}}s. In December 1918, Sinclair sailed into Estonian and Latvian ports, sending in troops and supplies, and promising to attack the Bolsheviks \"as far as my guns can reach\". In January 1919, he was succeeded in command by Rear-Admiral [[Walter Cowan]].\n\nThe [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]], concerned about their northern border, sent the largest military force, numbering about 70,000. They desired the establishment of a [[buffer state]] in Siberia,<ref name= Humphreys25>Humphreys, ''The Way of the Heavenly Sword: The Japanese Army in the 1920s'', p. 25</ref> and the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff|General Staff]] viewed the situation in Russia as an opportunity for settling Japan's \"northern problem\". The Japanese government was also intensely hostile to communism.\n\n[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|300px|Allied troops parading in [[Vladivostok]], 1918]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] created the special \"''Corpo di Spedizione''\" with [[Alpini]] troops sent from Italy and ex-POWs of [[Italia irredenta|Italian ethnicity]] from the former Austro-Hungarian army who were recruited to the ''[[Italian Legione Redenta]]''. They were initially based in the [[Concessions of Tianjin|Italian Concession in Tientsin]] and numbered about 2,500.\n\n[[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] also sent contingents in support of the intervention.\n\nHowever, while Soviet propaganda often portrayed Allied intervention as an alliance dedicated to crushing a nascent, worldwide communist revolution in the cradle, in reality the Allies were not particularly interested in intervention. While there were some loud voices in favour, such as Winston Churchill, these were very much in the minority. The main concern for the Allies was to defeat the German Empire on the Western Front. While the Bolshevik's repudiation of Russia's national debt and seizure of foreign-owned industries did cause tension, the main concern for the Allies was the Bolshevik's desire to get Russia out of the First World War. The Allies disliked the Whites, who were seen as nothing more than a small group of conservative nationalists who showed no signs of planning reform. Government ministers were also influenced by anti-White public opinion, which was being mobilised by trade unions. The low casualties suffered by the Allies is indicative of the low-level of their combat involvement. However, the Soviets were able to exploit the Allied intervention for propaganda purposes.<ref>Lee, Stephen J. European Dictatorships 1918\u20131945.

This was the primary target for the advancing [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces and Dunsterforce endured a [[Battle of Baku|short, brutal siege in September 1918]] before being forced to withdraw.\n\nHowever, having been defeated in World War I, the Ottoman Empire had to withdraw its forces from the borders of Azerbaijan in the middle of November 1918. Headed by General [[William Montgomery Thomson|William Thomson]], the British troops of 5,000 soldiers arrived in Baku on 17 November, and martial law was implemented on the capital of [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] until \"the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order\".\n\n=== Trans-Caspian Campaign ===\nAllied military action began on 11 August 1918, when General [[Wilfrid Malleson|Malleson]] intervened in support of the [[Transcaspian Government|Ashkhabad Executive Committee]], who had ousted the [[Tashkent Soviet]] Bolsheviks from the western end of the [[Trans-Caspian Railway]] in July 1918.  Malleson had been authorised to intervene with Empire and British troops, in what would be referred to as the [[Malleson Mission]]. He sent the Machine Gun Section of the [[19th Punjabi Rifles]] to [[Ba\u00fdramaly]] located on the [[Trans-Caspian railway]]. After combat at [[Merv]], they were joined by the rest of the regiment. There was further action at [[Kaka, Turkmenistan|Kaka]] on 28 August 11 and 18 September. They were reinforced on 25 September by two squadrons of the [[28th Light Cavalry]]. Fighting alongside Trans-Caspian troops, they subsequently fought at [[Arman Sagad]] (between 9 and 11 October) and [[Dushak]] (14 October).\n\nBy 1 November, they had re-occupied Merv and on instructions of the British government, halted their advance and took up defensive positions at Bairam Ali. The Trans-Caspian forces continued to attack the Bolsheviks to the north. After the Trans-Caspian forces were routed at [[Uch Aji]], their commander Colonel Knollys sent the 28th Cavalry to their support at [[Annenkovo]]. In January 1919, one company of the 19th Punjabi Rifles was sent to reinforce the position at Annenkovo, where a second battle took place on 16 January.

[[Lalitaditya Muktapida]] (724\u201360 CE), the Raja (ruler) of Kashmir, defeated Junaid and overran his kingdom. However, this victory was not decisive as further attempts to invade were made by the Arabs, but Lalitaditya was able to stem the tide of these advances.<ref name=\"History-A\"/> A last attempt at the invasion of the Kashmir Kingdom was made by Hisham ibn 'Amr al-Taghlibi, the Governor of Sindh, appointed by [[Al-Mansur|Caliph Mansur]] (754-75 C.E).

Anandpal's son Trilochanpala, whose power of influence was now confined only to the [[Salt Range]], appealed to Samgramaraja (1003-28 C.E), the king of Kashmir, for help against Mahmud. A large army contingent was sent by Samgramaraja, who joined Trilochanpala's forces, and won a battle against a reconnaissance party of Sultan Mahmud. Seeing this, Mahmud personally advanced for battle and defeated Trilochanpala in 1014 C.E. Provoked by Samgramaraja's conduct, Mahmud decided to invade Kashmir, and punish him. Mahmud advanced towards Kashmir and tried entering the kingdom via the Toshamaidan Pass. His progress was checked by the strong Loharkot Fort, which he besieged for a month. Owing to the heavy snowfall, which cut off Mahmud's communications, he was compelled to retreat.<ref name=\"Spread of Islam in Kashmir\"/><ref name=\"History-A\"/> However, the Sultan again set out to invade Kashmir in September\u2013October, 1021 C.E, but was again compelled to retreat due to bad weather conditions.<ref name=\"History-A\"/>\n\n===Establishment of Muslim rule and conversion to Islam===\nAfter Sultan Mahmud's attempted conquests to invade Kashmir, Kashmir remained generally unaffected and unchanged by invasions that were aimed at the plains of India, up until 1320 C.E. The [[Lohara dynasty|Loharas]] (1003-1320 C.E.) ruled during this period, and was the last of the Hindu dynasties of Kashmir. In the spring of 1320, a Turkistani chieftain by the name of Zulqadar Khan Turk(Zulcha Khan), invaded Kashmir via the Jehlum Valley route. Suhadeva (1301\u201320 C.E), last ruler of the Loharas, tried to organize resistance, but failed due to his unpopularity among the masses. The reason for this unpopularity was financial exaction and general misrule that prevailed during the end period of the Lohara Dynasty.<ref name=\"History-A\"/> Zulcha Khan's invasion created havoc and Suhadeva fled to [[Kistwar]]. [[Rinchan]]a, son of a Ladakhi chief, who was employed by Ramacandra (Prime Minister of Kashmir) to establish law and order, took advantage of the chaos. He got Ramacandra murdered, occupied the Kashmir throne by the end of the year 1320, and ruled until his death in 1323 C.E. In order to gain acceptance of Kashmiris, he married [[Kota Rani]], the daughter of Ramacandra, and made Rawancandra (Ramacandra's son) his commander in chief.<ref name=\"History-A\"/><ref name=\" History-D\">{{cite book | author=Kaw, M.

He changed his name to Sultan Sardarudin Shah after converting to Islam, and thus became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir.<ref name=\"History-A\"/> Following the conversion of Rinchan, his commander in chief also became Muslim. The royal patronage for Islam won it new converts, and according to one source, many Kashmiris embraced the creed of Bulbul Shah.<ref name=\"Spread of Islam in Kashmir\"/><ref name=\"History-A\"/>\n\nThe period after Sultan Sardarudin's death was marked by chaos and power tussle. Udayanadeva, the brother of Suhadeva, was made the ruler after an agreement among the nobles. However, he proved to be incompetent, and it was Kota Rani who was the virtual ruler. Soon after Udayanadeva's accession, a foreign chieftain attacked Kashmir, but the invaders were successfully repelled and defeated. However, the administration again fell into chaos. Udayanadeva had fled the country in sight of the attack, and lost his prestige in the eyes of the nobles. He died in the year 1338 C.E, and Kota Rani ascended the throne.<ref name=\"History-A\"/><ref name=\" History-D\"/> But, [[Shah Mir]], a nobleman employed earlier by Suhadeva, had other ambitions.

A large army contingent was sent by Samgramaraja, who joined Trilochanpala's forces, and won a battle against a reconnaissance party of Sultan Mahmud. Seeing this, Mahmud personally advanced for battle and defeated Trilochanpala in 1014 C.E. Provoked by Samgramaraja's conduct, Mahmud decided to invade Kashmir, and punish him.

The [[Lohara dynasty|Loharas]] (1003-1320 C.E.) ruled during this period, and was the last of the Hindu dynasties of Kashmir. In the spring of 1320, a Turkistani chieftain by the name of Zulqadar Khan Turk(Zulcha Khan), invaded Kashmir via the Jehlum Valley route. Suhadeva (1301\u201320 C.E), last ruler of the Loharas, tried to organize resistance, but failed due to his unpopularity among the masses. The reason for this unpopularity was financial exaction and general misrule that prevailed during the end period of the Lohara Dynasty.<ref name=\"History-A\"/> Zulcha Khan's invasion created havoc and Suhadeva fled to [[Kistwar]]. [[Rinchan]]a, son of a Ladakhi chief, who was employed by Ramacandra (Prime Minister of Kashmir) to establish law and order, took advantage of the chaos. He got Ramacandra murdered, occupied the Kashmir throne by the end of the year 1320, and ruled until his death in 1323 C.E.

Udayanadeva, the brother of Suhadeva, was made the ruler after an agreement among the nobles. However, he proved to be incompetent, and it was Kota Rani who was the virtual ruler. Soon after Udayanadeva's accession, a foreign chieftain attacked Kashmir, but the invaders were successfully repelled and defeated. However, the administration again fell into chaos. Udayanadeva had fled the country in sight of the attack, and lost his prestige in the eyes of the nobles.

He was credited with 34 aerial victories. The emblem he wore side by side on his plane of a black horse prancing on its two rear hooves inspired [[Enzo Ferrari]] to use it on his racing car and later in his [[Ferrari|automotive company]].\n\n==Biography==\nBaracca was born in [[Lugo, Emilia-Romagna|Lugo di Romagna]]. He was the son of a wealthy landowner. The younger Baracca initially studied at a private school in [[Florence]] before entering the [[Military Academy of Modena]] in October 1907. As he had become a passionate equestrian as an antidote to classroom boredom, he became a cavalryman with the prestigious ''[[Piemonte Reale Cavalleria]]'' Regiment upon his commissioning in 1910. His first duty station allowed him to attend concerts and opera in Rome, as well as pursuing hunting and equestrian competitions; he gained some fame in the latter. This little idyll was spoiled by orders to a small town in central Italy. Baracca then became interested in aviation and learned to fly at [[Reims]], France, receiving his pilot's license on 9 July 1912.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 18 }}</ref> He then served with the ''Battaglione Aviatori'' and in 1914 with the 5th and 6th ''Squadriglie''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===World War I===\nDuring the months between the outbreak of World War I and Italy's entry into the war, there was intense political controversy in Italy between pro-war and pro-peace factions. Baracca remained aloofly neutral, but ready to serve his nation. After Italy's entry into the war on the [[Triple Entente|Entente side]] in May 1915, he was sent to Paris to convert to Nieuport two-seaters. Upon his return in July, he was assigned to the ''8a Squadriglia Nieuport''. The [[Nieuport 10]]s that equipped this squadron were almost useless against [[Austro-Hungarian]] raids; they were too slow, with too slow a rate of climb, to bring the intruders to battle with any regularity. The frustrated Italian pilots even resorted to leaving their observers ground-bound in attempts to improve performance, to little avail. On those rare occasions when battle was joined, the Nieuports' guns usually jammed. Renaming the unit to ''1a Squadriglia Caccia'' on 1 December 1915 did nothing to solve the problems.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |pages= 18\u201319, 7 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nieuport 11]] single-seat fighter with [[Lewis gun]]s entered service in April 1916, and on 7 April, flying this new fighter, Baracca scored his first victory, holing the fuel tank of an Austrian [[Hansa-Brandenburg C.I]] and wounding its two-man crew. This was also Italy's first aerial victory in the war.<ref>Above the War Fronts, Franks, Guest & Alegi grub street, 1997</ref><ref name=\"Nieuport Aces of World War 1\">{{cite book |title=''Nieuport Aces of World War 1'' |page= 76 }}</ref> This first victory featured his favorite manoeuvre, which was to zoom in unseen behind and below an enemy and fire his machine gun from pistol range.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\">{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 19 }}</ref>\n\nIt was around this time that Baracca adopted as a personal emblem a black prancing horse on his Nieuport 17, in tribute to his former cavalry regiment.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/> This prompted some to call him, \"The Cavalier of the Skies\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Flying the [[Nieuport 17]] and then, from March 1917, the [[SPAD VII]], he scored both individually, and in combination with other Italian aces.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/italy/baracca.php Retrieved on 31 March 2010.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 22 }}</ref>\n\nBaracca's second victory was an Austrian [[Jakob Lohner AG|Lohner]] over [[Gorizia]] on 23 April 1916. After his third victory, he transferred to 70a Squadriglia.<ref name=\"Nieuport Aces of World War 1\"/> Promoted to ''Capitano'', Baracca remained with the unit until, with 9 victories, he transferred to the newly formed 91st ''Squadriglia'', known as the \"Squadron of the Aces\", on 1 May 1917. By that time, his ever-increasing list of victories had made him nationally famous. While he initially dodged the responsibilities and paperwork that went with command, he finally settled into heading the squadron.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/>\n\nBaracca's friend [[Fulco Ruffo di Calabria]] nearly ended Baracca's career\u2014and life\u2014in June 1917. Ruffo di Calabria burst out of a cloud firing in a head-on pass at an enemy airplane, and barely missed Baracca. Later, on the ground, Baracca assured his companion, \"Dear Fulco, next time, if you want to shoot me down, aim a couple of meters to the right. Now let's go for a drink and not talk of it any more!\"<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 21 }}</ref>\n \nBaracca temporarily upgraded to a [[Spad XIII]] in October 1917, using it to achieve a couple of victories on 22 October, and on a win scored on a joint sortie with Pier Piccio on the 25 October. That night he wrote: \"I had my SPAD shot up and its [[longeron]] broken into pieces by enemy machine gun fire in an aerial dogfight.\" As a result, Baracca returned to the more manoeuvrable Spad VII, remarking, \"It doesn't matter if the VII is equipped with a single gun. Provided you are a good fighter, a single gun is just enough.\" Nevertheless, after repair, he sometimes returned to the Spad XIII.<ref>{{cite book |title=''SPAD XII/XIII aces of World War I'' |page= 24 }}</ref>\n\nA dedicated fighter pilot, Baracca found life away from the front unbearable and remained as much as possible with the 91st ''Squadriglia'', even after being promoted to ''Maggiore'' in November 1917.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Baracca remained a modest, sensitive man conscious of his duty and compassionate to both his squadron comrades and to his defeated enemies. He would try to visit his victims in hospital afterwards, to pay his respects, or he would place a wreath on the grave of those he killed.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/> He had raised his score to 30 by the end of 1917.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSoon afterwards, Baracca, Piccio, and Ruffo di Calabria were tasked with evaluating the new [[Ansaldo A.1 Balilla]] fighter. Baracca was personally decorated by King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] at [[La Scala]] at this time. It was March 1918 before Baracca convinced his superiors that he belonged back at the front. He was not long back before he found himself in a situation similar to the previous late October: his squadron was forced to withdraw by enemy advances on 27 April.

He was credited with 34 aerial victories. The emblem he wore side by side on his plane of a black horse prancing on its two rear hooves inspired [[Enzo Ferrari]] to use it on his racing car and later in his [[Ferrari|automotive company]].\n\n==Biography==\nBaracca was born in [[Lugo, Emilia-Romagna|Lugo di Romagna]]. He was the son of a wealthy landowner. The younger Baracca initially studied at a private school in [[Florence]] before entering the [[Military Academy of Modena]] in October 1907. As he had become a passionate equestrian as an antidote to classroom boredom, he became a cavalryman with the prestigious ''[[Piemonte Reale Cavalleria]]'' Regiment upon his commissioning in 1910. His first duty station allowed him to attend concerts and opera in Rome, as well as pursuing hunting and equestrian competitions; he gained some fame in the latter. This little idyll was spoiled by orders to a small town in central Italy. Baracca then became interested in aviation and learned to fly at [[Reims]], France, receiving his pilot's license on 9 July 1912.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 18 }}</ref> He then served with the ''Battaglione Aviatori'' and in 1914 with the 5th and 6th ''Squadriglie''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===World War I===\nDuring the months between the outbreak of World War I and Italy's entry into the war, there was intense political controversy in Italy between pro-war and pro-peace factions. Baracca remained aloofly neutral, but ready to serve his nation. After Italy's entry into the war on the [[Triple Entente|Entente side]] in May 1915, he was sent to Paris to convert to Nieuport two-seaters. Upon his return in July, he was assigned to the ''8a Squadriglia Nieuport''. The [[Nieuport 10]]s that equipped this squadron were almost useless against [[Austro-Hungarian]] raids; they were too slow, with too slow a rate of climb, to bring the intruders to battle with any regularity. The frustrated Italian pilots even resorted to leaving their observers ground-bound in attempts to improve performance, to little avail. On those rare occasions when battle was joined, the Nieuports' guns usually jammed. Renaming the unit to ''1a Squadriglia Caccia'' on 1 December 1915 did nothing to solve the problems.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |pages= 18\u201319, 7 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nieuport 11]] single-seat fighter with [[Lewis gun]]s entered service in April 1916, and on 7 April, flying this new fighter, Baracca scored his first victory, holing the fuel tank of an Austrian [[Hansa-Brandenburg C.I]] and wounding its two-man crew. This was also Italy's first aerial victory in the war.<ref>Above the War Fronts, Franks, Guest & Alegi grub street, 1997</ref><ref name=\"Nieuport Aces of World War 1\">{{cite book |title=''Nieuport Aces of World War 1'' |page= 76 }}</ref> This first victory featured his favorite manoeuvre, which was to zoom in unseen behind and below an enemy and fire his machine gun from pistol range.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\">{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 19 }}</ref>\n\nIt was around this time that Baracca adopted as a personal emblem a black prancing horse on his Nieuport 17, in tribute to his former cavalry regiment.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/> This prompted some to call him, \"The Cavalier of the Skies\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Flying the [[Nieuport 17]] and then, from March 1917, the [[SPAD VII]], he scored both individually, and in combination with other Italian aces.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/italy/baracca.php Retrieved on 31 March 2010.</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 22 }}</ref>\n\nBaracca's second victory was an Austrian [[Jakob Lohner AG|Lohner]] over [[Gorizia]] on 23 April 1916. After his third victory, he transferred to 70a Squadriglia.<ref name=\"Nieuport Aces of World War 1\"/> Promoted to ''Capitano'', Baracca remained with the unit until, with 9 victories, he transferred to the newly formed 91st ''Squadriglia'', known as the \"Squadron of the Aces\", on 1 May 1917. By that time, his ever-increasing list of victories had made him nationally famous. While he initially dodged the responsibilities and paperwork that went with command, he finally settled into heading the squadron.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/>\n\nBaracca's friend [[Fulco Ruffo di Calabria]] nearly ended Baracca's career\u2014and life\u2014in June 1917. Ruffo di Calabria burst out of a cloud firing in a head-on pass at an enemy airplane, and barely missed Baracca. Later, on the ground, Baracca assured his companion, \"Dear Fulco, next time, if you want to shoot me down, aim a couple of meters to the right. Now let's go for a drink and not talk of it any more!\"<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Italian Aces of World War 1'' |page= 21 }}</ref>\n \nBaracca temporarily upgraded to a [[Spad XIII]] in October 1917, using it to achieve a couple of victories on the 22nd, and on a win scored on a joint sortie with Pier Piccio on the 25th. That night he wrote: \"I had my SPAD shot up and its [[longeron]] broken into pieces by enemy machine gun fire in an aerial dogfight.\" As a result, Baracca returned to the more manoeuvrable Spad VII, remarking, \"It doesn't matter if the VII is equipped with a single gun. Provided you are a good fighter, a single gun is just enough.\" Nevertheless, after repair, he sometimes returned to the Spad XIII.<ref>{{cite book |title=''SPAD XII/XIII aces of World War I'' |page= 24 }}</ref>\n\nA dedicated fighter pilot, Baracca found life away from the front unbearable and remained as much as possible with the 91st ''Squadriglia'', even after being promoted to ''Maggiore'' in November 1917.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Baracca remained a modest, sensitive man conscious of his duty and compassionate to both his squadron comrades and to his defeated enemies. He would try to visit his victims in hospital afterwards, to pay his respects, or he would place a wreath on the grave of those he killed.<ref name=\"Italian Aces of World War 1\"/> He had raised his score to 30 by the end of 1917.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nSoon afterwards, Baracca, Piccio, and Ruffo di Calabria were tasked with evaluating the new [[Ansaldo A.1 Balilla]] fighter. Baracca was personally decorated by King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] at [[La Scala]] at this time. It was March 1918 before Baracca convinced his superiors that he belonged back at the front. He was not long back before he found himself in a situation similar to the previous late October: his squadron was forced to withdraw by enemy advances on 27 April. It was about this time that he adopted the [[griffin]] as an insignia for the planes in his unit. Most of his pilots adopted it, though some still flaunted the prancing stallion as a gesture of respect for their commander.<ref>{{cite book |title=''SPAD XII/XIII aces of World War I'' |pages= 24\u201325 }}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBaracca saw little action in 1918, but he added more victories, for a total of 34, before failing to return from a strafing mission on the [[Montello (hill)]] area on 19 June.<ref name=\"Nieuport Aces of World War 1\"/> \nThe Italians were taking advantage of their air supremacy to fly treetop ground attack missions into a storm of small arms fire.

Pythias was accused of plotting against the tyrant and sentenced to death.\n\nAccepting his sentence, Pythias asked to be allowed to return home one last time to settle his affairs and bid his family farewell.  Not wanting to be taken for a fool, the king refused, believing that, once released, Pythias would flee and never return. Damon offered himself as a hostage in Pythias' absence, and when the king insisted that, should Pythias not return by an appointed time, Damon would be executed in his stead, Damon agreed and Pythias was released.\n\nDionysius was convinced that Pythias would never return, and as the day Pythias promised to return came and went, he called for Damon's execution\u2014but just as the executioner was about to kill Damon, Pythias returned.\n\nApologizing to his friend for the delay, Pythias explained that on the passage back to Syracuse pirates had captured his ship and thrown him overboard, but that he swam to shore and made his way back to Syracuse as quickly as possible, arriving just in time to save his friend. \n\nSo astonished by and pleased with their friendship, Dionysius pardoned both men. It was also said that the tyrant then sought to become their third friend, but was denied.\n\nAnother version says that it was a test planned by Dionysius and his courtiers. The Pythagoreans were renowned for their moral strength and superiority, but some Syracusan courtiers argued the claim was false, and others disagreed, so with their king they devised a test\u2014a crisis that would show whether two Pythagoreans lived up to that reputation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Kitty |title=Pythagoras His Lives and the Legacy of a Rational Universe |publisher=Walker |year=2008 |page=119 |isbn= }}</ref>\n\n== Works based on the legend==\n[[File:Damon and Pythias (1914) - 1.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Still from the film ''Damon and Pythias'' (1914)]]\n*In 1564, the material was made into a [[tragicomedy|tragicomic]] play by the English poet [[Richard Edwardes]] (''[[Damon and Pythias (play)|Damon and Pythias]]'').\n*The best-known modern treatment of the legend is the [[German language|German]] ballad ''[[Die B\u00fcrgschaft]]'',<ref>{{in lang|de}} [http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Die_B%C3%BCrgschaft Die B\u00fcrgschaft \u2013 Wikisource].
