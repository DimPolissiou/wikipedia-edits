The railroad operates vintage steam and diesel powered locomotives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bdrry.com/ |title=Belvidere & Delaware River |accessdate=30 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625055736/http://www.bdrry.com/ |archivedate=25 June 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.njskylands.com/atbrwrr.htm |title=Black River and Western Railroad |work=New Jersey's Great Northwestern Skylands}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Black River & Western Railroad (BR&W) was started by William Whitehead in [[Oldwick, New Jersey]], in the late 1950s. A portion of the defunct\n[[Rockaway Valley Railroad]] went through his back yard. He and his sons started collecting rolling stock and an engine (Lackawanna #565). They started laying tracks but then the expansion of [[Interstate 78|I-78]] halted their dream of building a railroad at that location. They moved their equipment to the Chester Hill Branch of the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (CNJ) with the hope of starting a railroad there. The section of railroad they were scouting soon became landlocked by the construction of [[Interstate 80|I-80]].\n\nBR&W was officially incorporated in 1961. The railroad's name is derived from the [[Black River (New Jersey)|Black River]], a river in Chester, and the direction that the river flows. The cars were moved to [[Flemington, New Jersey]] and the search for a place to start their tourist train was continued. A leasing arrangement was created the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) that allowed a tourist train to operate from Flemington to [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] on the original [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] (PRR Belvidere Division) Flemington Branch (originally the Flemington Railroad & Transportation Company). BR&W paid $5,000 a year and rehabilitated the railroad (PRR operated freight service on the line during this period). Steam engine #60 pulled the first trip out of Flemington on May 16, 1965. Weekend and holiday schedules were devised.\n\nBR&W assumed ownership and operations of the Flemington Branch from the CNJ connection in Flemington to Flemington Branch Junction in Lambertville on March 16, 1970, purchasing it from PRR successor [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] (PC). With the acquisition of the rail line and its freight operations, on top of the existing tourist passenger service, a true shortline railroad was born. Base operations were established in Ringoes, New Jersey, and remain so today. Freight interchange after the 1970 purchase was made with PC at Lambertville and CNJ in Flemington. PC filed for bankruptcy that June.\n\nPC continued to operate freight under bankruptcy protection until April 1, 1976 when [[Conrail]] (CR) assumed operations (the last PC freight train to operate on the Belvidere Division was on March 28, 1976). BR&W then purchased three miles of trackage in the Lambertville area that was part of the Belvidere Division mainline on March 31, 1976 before Conrail took over.) BR&W also purchased the Flemington-Three Bridges portion from the bankrupt CNJ. Although coal, iron ore and general freights were rerouted to other lines such as the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad|North Penn Branch]], CR continued operating smaller interchange freight trains to Lambertville. In March 1977, a new interchange was built at Three Bridges, New Jersey with the former [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] (LV) mainline.\n\nFreight service to ended by 1995 with tourist operations ceasing by 1998, when the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) prohibited operations due to poor track conditions. There was talk in 1997 of Trap Rock Industries Quarry using the stub-ended section north of Lambertville, resulting in a frenzy of track repairs taking place on the Ringoes-Lambertville segment to accommodate the anticipated traffic. The quarry ultimately backed out with the final work train operating in June 2002 to retrieve all remaining rolling stock.\n\nIn 2001, a separate non-profit entity known as the Black River Railroad Historic Trust (BRRHT), was formed to take over the tourist trains on the line. BRRHT does not own most of the passenger cars and until 2011, fees had to be paid to the BR&W for their use. BRRHT owns one diesel locomotive switcher, an SW9 numbered 438. It currently leases some coaches from the railroad and has use of several locomotives.\n\nIn 2014 the BRRHT started to clear the line between Ringos and Lambertville for passenger trains. In 2016 the first passenger train went down the first mile down of the newly restored line in almost 20 years. In 2017 the BRRHT restored the first 2.5 miles of the line which is where Bone Station is and Black River have been doing special events. In 2019 the BRRHT opened a further 1 mile towards Mount Airy Road. The BRRHT is looking to get into Lambertville within the next several years.\n\n==Recent history==\nIn 2014, BRRHT announced that it was looking to reinstate service along the dormant Ringoes-Lambertville section (now called the Alexauken Division).  In May 2017, the first two and a half miles was re-introduced to passenger service. The in-service track currently reaches Bowne Station, just over 4 miles north of Lambertville. Bowne Station includes a picnic grove co-constructed with Woodsedge Farm and the railroad. Special picnic and farm trains are scheduled year for this new portion of the line, along with an evening departure from Ringoes every Saturday and Sunday that special events do not operate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackriverrailroad.com/alexauken-division|title=blackriverrailroad|website=blackriverrailroad|access-date=2017-07-31}}</ref>\n\n==Stations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Station\n!Status\n!History\n|-\n|Three Bridges\n|Freight Only Station\n|Three Bridges was a former station on the Central Railroad of New Jersey's South Branch in Flemington, New Jersey. The South Branch ran from a wye west of Manville\u2013Finderne station to Flemington. While there isn't an actual station and passenger service doesn't go this far, Three Bridges is where the BR&W interchanges with Norfolk Southern. Today a small shed stands where the station did. Last BRW passenger train on the line was in 2015.\n|-\n|Flemington (Main Street)\n|Station building utilized by local bank.\n|Flemington was the former terminus station of the Central Railroad of New Jersey's South Branch in Flemington, New Jersey. The South Branch ran from a wye west of Manville\u2013Finderne station to Flemington. Service at the station began on July 1, 1864 and passenger service was discontinued on April 25, 1953.\n|-\n|Flemington (PRR)\n|Station building currently part of Outlets.\n|Originally used by the Pennsylvania Railroad, then when the BR&W came, they put a small shack not to far from the PRR Station. Then in the 1970s the shack was removed and replaced by wooden car #101; and was used until it was burned in 1991. The Station on the line, marked the terminus to the Flemington Branch. Here Pennsylvania Railroad interchanged with the Central Railroad of New Jersey.\n|-\n|Flemington (Liberty Village)\n|Served by BRW\n|When nearby Liberty Village was being remodeled, Black River & Western sold off the original PRR station and per agreement, Liberty Village built them a new station closer to route 12.\n|-\n|Copper Hill\n|Originally small station. Only siding remains.\n|Copper Hill was a small combination freight and passenger station, with a siding for loading produce from local farms. The area was named Copper Hill due to the copperhead snakes that were found in the area, which are still present at the bottom of Copper Hill Trestle. Siding holds heritage freight equipment.\n|-\n|Hog Town\n|Abandoned\n|Hog Town is a small shack and was built around 1970 by the BR&W as part of their Great Train Robberies. In the off-season, the station was occupied by \"The Mayor of Hogtown\", who used to persuade passengers to vote for him as mayor (as part of a gag). The area got its name due to the nearby, and now demolished, home that raised hogs. The station is located next to the former Hunterdon Concrete facility.\n|-\n|Farmstead (formerly Muirhead)\n|Originally flagstop. \n|Once part of the village of Muirhead (now gone), Muirhead was an early station for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The station closed in the 1920s. The station was moved a few hundred yards east and has been converted to a shed, it is now owned by the Farmstead at Ringoes. The original site is used as a stop for the farm which works with the railroad to host weddings and other private events, and has been renamed \"Farmstead\".\n|-\n|Pumpkin Junction\n|Served by BRW\n|Pumpkin Junction is a farm station along the line constructed in 2008. The stop is used in October as part of the railroad's Pumpkin Trains.\n|-\n|Ringoes\n|Served by BRW\n|Ringoes was a former Pennsylvania Railroad station on their Flemington branch. Ringoes is the main yard of the Black River and Western Railroad.\n|-\n|Boss Rd.\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone.\n|-\n|Bowne\n|Served by BRW\n|The original Bowne Station was located south of the Bowne Station Rd. bridge. It was moved in the early 1930s north of the bridge near a home and has been converted into a shed. Today, the BRW has created a picnic grove where the station originally sat south of the bridge. This station can only be accessed by rail. \n|-\n|Mount Airy\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone. In the area where current active track ends. \n|-\n|Alexauken\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone. \n|-\n|Lambertville\n|Out-Of-Service. Building currently Lambertville Station Inn & Restaurant.\n|Just South of the interchange between the ''Bel-Del'' mainline and the Flemington Branch, Lambertville serves as the Southern-most station along the BR&W. The last train to depart the station was in December in 1998. Black River & Western plans to be back in Lambertville around 2021, as part of their Alexauken Division project.\n|}\n\n==Roster==\nThe Black River & Western's fleet of locomotives are divided up into two categories: Locomotives used on the Flemington Branch, and locomotives used by the Black River Railroad System (a primarily freight but also leasing company).\nEquipment in italics are owned by the BRRHT.\n\n''Black River & Western Locomotives (engines that are on the flemington branch almost all the time)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Heritage\n!Model\n!Location\n|-\n|1\n|Crucible Steel\n|Mack 15ton\n|Owned by BRRHT, static display at the Ringoes Station parking lot.\n|-\n|[[Great Western 60|60]]\n|[[Great Western Railway of Colorado]]\n|2-8-0\n|In service on the Flemington Branch.

A portion of the defunct\n[[Rockaway Valley Railroad]] went through his back yard. He and his sons started collecting rolling stock and an engine (Lackawanna #565). They started laying tracks but then the expansion of [[Interstate 78|I-78]] halted their dream of building a railroad at that location. They moved their equipment to the Chester Hill Branch of the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (CNJ) with the hope of starting a railroad there. The section of railroad they were scouting soon became landlocked by the construction of [[Interstate 80|I-80]].\n\nBR&W was officially incorporated in 1961. The railroad's name is derived from the [[Black River (New Jersey)|Black River]], a river in Chester, and the direction that the river flows. The cars were moved to [[Flemington, New Jersey]] and the search for a place to start their tourist train was continued. A leasing arrangement was created the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] (PRR) that allowed a tourist train to operate from Flemington to [[Lambertville, New Jersey|Lambertville]] on the original [[Belvidere-Delaware Railroad]] (PRR Belvidere Division) Flemington Branch (originally the Flemington Railroad & Transportation Company). BR&W paid $5,000 a year and rehabilitated the railroad (PRR operated freight service on the line during this period). Steam engine #60 pulled the first trip out of Flemington on May 16, 1965. Weekend and holiday schedules were devised.\n\nBR&W assumed ownership and operations of the Flemington Branch from the CNJ connection in Flemington to Flemington Branch Junction in Lambertville on March 16, 1970, purchasing it from PRR successor [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]] (PC). With the acquisition of the rail line and its freight operations, on top of the existing tourist passenger service, a true shortline railroad was born. Base operations were established in Ringoes, New Jersey, and remain so today. Freight interchange after the 1970 purchase was made with PC at Lambertville and CNJ in Flemington. PC filed for bankruptcy that June.\n\nPC continued to operate freight under bankruptcy protection until April 1, 1976 when [[Conrail]] (CR) assumed operations (the last PC freight train to operate on the Belvidere Division was on March 28, 1976). BR&W then purchased three miles of trackage in the Lambertville area that was part of the Belvidere Division mainline on March 31, 1976 before Conrail took over.) BR&W also purchased the Flemington-Three Bridges portion from the bankrupt CNJ. Although coal, iron ore and general freights were rerouted to other lines such as the [[North Pennsylvania Railroad|North Penn Branch]], CR continued operating smaller interchange freight trains to Lambertville. In March 1977, a new interchange was built at Three Bridges, New Jersey with the former [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]] (LV) mainline.\n\nFreight service to ended by 1995 with tourist operations ceasing by 1998, when the [[Federal Railroad Administration]] (FRA) prohibited operations due to poor track conditions. There was talk in 1997 of Trap Rock Industries Quarry using the stub-ended section north of Lambertville, resulting in a frenzy of track repairs taking place on the Ringoes-Lambertville segment to accommodate the anticipated traffic. The quarry ultimately backed out with the final work train operating in June 2002 to retrieve all remaining rolling stock.\n\nIn 2001, a separate non-profit entity known as the Black River Railroad Historic Trust (BRRHT), was formed to take over the tourist trains on the line. BRRHT does not own most of the passenger cars and until 2011, fees had to be paid to the BR&W for their use. BRRHT owns one diesel locomotive switcher, an SW9 numbered 438. It currently leases some coaches from the railroad and has use of several locomotives.\n\nIn 2014 the BRRHT started to clear the line between Ringos and Lambertville for passenger trains. In 2016 the first passenger train went down the first mile down of the newly restored line in almost 20 years. In 2017 the BRRHT restored the first 2.5 miles of the line which is where Bone Station is and Black River have been doing special events. In 2019 the BRRHT opened a further 1 mile towards Mount Airy Road. The BRRHT is looking to get into Lambertville within the next several years.\n\n==Recent history==\nIn 2014, BRRHT announced that it was looking to reinstate service along the dormant Ringoes-Lambertville section (now called the Alexauken Division).  In May 2017, the first two and a half miles was re-introduced to passenger service. The in-service track currently reaches Bowne Station, just over 4 miles north of Lambertville. Bowne Station includes a picnic grove co-constructed with Woodsedge Farm and the railroad. Special picnic and farm trains are scheduled year for this new portion of the line, along with an evening departure from Ringoes every Saturday and Sunday that special events do not operate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackriverrailroad.com/alexauken-division|title=blackriverrailroad|website=blackriverrailroad|access-date=2017-07-31}}</ref>\n\n==Stations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Station\n!Status\n!History\n|-\n|Three Bridges\n|Freight Only Station\n|Three Bridges was a former station on the Central Railroad of New Jersey's South Branch in Flemington, New Jersey. The South Branch ran from a wye west of Manville\u2013Finderne station to Flemington. While there isn't an actual station and passenger service doesn't go this far, Three Bridges is where the BR&W interchanges with Norfolk Southern. Today a small shed stands where the station did. Last BRW passenger train on the line was in 2015.\n|-\n|Flemington (Main Street)\n|Station building utilized by local bank.\n|Flemington was the former terminus station of the Central Railroad of New Jersey's South Branch in Flemington, New Jersey. The South Branch ran from a wye west of Manville\u2013Finderne station to Flemington. Service at the station began on July 1, 1864 and passenger service was discontinued on April 25, 1953.\n|-\n|Flemington (PRR)\n|Station building currently part of Outlets.\n|Originally used by the Pennsylvania Railroad, then when the BR&W came, they put a small shack not to far from the PRR Station. Then in the 1970s the shack was removed and replaced by wooden car #101; and was used until it was burned in 1991. The Station on the line, marked the terminus to the Flemington Branch. Here Pennsylvania Railroad interchanged with the Central Railroad of New Jersey.\n|-\n|Flemington (Liberty Village)\n|Served by BRW\n|When nearby Liberty Village was being remodeled, Black River & Western sold off the original PRR station and per agreement, Liberty Village built them a new station closer to route 12.\n|-\n|Copper Hill\n|Originally small station. Only siding remains.\n|Copper Hill was a small combination freight and passenger station, with a siding for loading produce from local farms. The area was named Copper Hill due to the copperhead snakes that were found in the area, which are still present at the bottom of Copper Hill Trestle. Siding holds heritage freight equipment.\n|-\n|Hog Town\n|Abandoned\n|Hog Town is a small shack and was built around 1970 by the BR&W as part of their Great Train Robberies. In the off-season, the station was occupied by \"The Mayor of Hogtown\", who used to persuade passengers to vote for him as mayor (as part of a gag). The area got its name due to the nearby, and now demolished, home that raised hogs. The station is located next to the former Hunterdon Concrete facility.\n|-\n|Farmstead (formerly Muirhead)\n|Originally flagstop. \n|Once part of the village of Muirhead (now gone), Muirhead was an early station for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The station closed in the 1920's. The station was moved a few hundred yards east and has been converted to a shed, it is now owned by the Farmstead at Ringoes. The original site is used as a stop for the farm which works with the railroad to host weddings and other private events, and has been renamed \"Farmstead\".\n|-\n|Pumpkin Junction\n|Served by BRW\n|Pumpkin Junction is a farm station along the line constructed in 2008. The stop is used in October as part of the railroad's Pumpkin Trains.\n|-\n|Ringoes\n|Served by BRW\n|Ringoes was a former Pennsylvania Railroad station on their Flemington branch. Ringoes is the main yard of the Black River and Western Railroad.\n|-\n|Boss Rd.\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone.\n|-\n|Bowne\n|Served by BRW\n|The original Bowne Station was located south of the Bowne Station Rd. bridge. It was moved in the early 1930s north of the bridge near a home and has been converted into a shed. Today, the BRW has created a picnic grove where the station originally sat south of the bridge. This station can only be accessed by rail. \n|-\n|Mount Airy\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone. In the area where current active track ends. \n|-\n|Alexauken\n|Originally flagstop.\n|A flagstop during the PRR era of the branchline. Closed 1931, gone. \n|-\n|Lambertville\n|Out-Of-Service. Building currently Lambertville Station Inn & Restaurant.\n|Just South of the interchange between the ''Bel-Del'' mainline and the Flemington Branch, Lambertville serves as the Southern-most station along the BR&W. The last train to depart the station was in December in 1998. Black River & Western plans to be back in Lambertville around 2021, as part of their Alexauken Division project.\n|}\n\n==Roster==\nThe Black River & Western's fleet of locomotives are divided up into two categories: Locomotives used on the Flemington Branch, and locomotives used by the Black River Railroad System (a primarily freight but also leasing company).\nEquipment in italics are owned by the BRRHT.\n\n''Black River & Western Locomotives (engines that are on the flemington branch almost all the time)''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Number\n!Heritage\n!Model\n!Location\n|-\n|1\n|Crucible Steel\n|Mack 15ton\n|Owned by BRRHT, static display at the Ringoes Station parking lot.\n|-\n|[[Great Western 60|60]]\n|[[Great Western Railway of Colorado]]\n|2-8-0\n|In service on the Flemington Branch.

The show was developed for television by Cal Coons and Alexandra Zarowny based on the characters in the Detective Murdoch series of novels written by [[Maureen Jennings]].\n\nPrior to the television series, Shaftesbury Films and [[CHUM Television]] produced three [[made for TV movie]]s which were shown on the Canadian cable channel [[Bravo!]] in 2004 and 2005. The original three movies, filmed in [[Winnipeg]] and Toronto, were collectively titled ''The Murdoch Mysteries''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B001FBPSW8 |title=Murdoch Mysteries: Movie Collection |publisher=[[amazon.com|amazon.ca]] |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Main characters ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! colspan=\"11\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|5\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|6\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|9\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|10\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|11\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Yannick Bisson]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Detective William Murdoch\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Inspector Thomas Brackenreid\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Dr. Julia Ogden\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Jonny Harris]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Constable George Crabtree\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Georgina Reilly]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Dr. Emily Grace\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|absent}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| '''recurring'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|absent}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Rebecca James\n| colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|absent}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|absent}}\n|}\n\n=== William Henry Murdoch ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = William Henry Murdoch\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Peter Outerbridge]] (TV movies)<br>[[Yannick Bisson]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| spouse             = [[#Dr. Julia Ogden|Dr. Julia Ogden]]\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Detective\n| relatives          = [[#Harry Murdoch|Harry Murdoch]] (father)<br>Mary Murdoch (mother)<br>Susannah Murdoch (younger sister)<br>Sergeant Jasper Linney (older halfbrother)\n| religion           = [[Roman Catholic]]\n}}\n[[File:Yannick Bisson at the Canadian Film Centre (CFC) Annual BBQ (detail).jpg|thumb|left|100px|Yannick Bisson, the actor who plays Murdoch]]\nDetective Murdoch, who is portrayed by [[Peter Outerbridge]] in the TV movies and by [[Yannick Bisson]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Yannick Bisson on the staying power of 'Murdoch Mysteries'|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/20/yannick-bisson-on-murdoch-mysteries-staying-power|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> in the series, is an intelligent, observant detective who uses unusual (for the time) techniques such as blood testing and fingerprinting. It is revealed he comes from [[Nova Scotia]], is a devout [[Roman Catholic]] who was educated by the [[Jesuits]] and is fluent in [[French language|French]]. In one episode, it is revealed that he believes that his father beat his mother and may have indirectly caused her death, although this was proven incorrect. Following that incident, he was taken to live in an [[orphanage]].\n\nAlthough very logical, sceptical, observant, scientific and clear-headed with a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] (possibly [[Hyperthymesia]]) and [[working memory]], these become an issue when he needs to connect with people on an emotional level, something he finds difficult. Often his unusual techniques and unbiased opinions of people lead him to clash with Brackenreid (even though they work together well). He is also a [[polymath]].\n\nMurdoch often consults on cases with Dr. Julia Ogden, with whom he is infatuated, although he did not attempt a relationship with her until the first half of season 2. As the season progressed, an argument over beliefs and past decisions made by Ogden split up the couple for a time, during which time Murdoch pursued a relationship with Enid Jones. However, he and Ogden rekindled their relationship during the season 2 finale on the advice of his half-brother ''(see below)'', and it becomes \"public\" (despite everyone already knowing about it) in the first episode of season 3. Ogden and Murdoch become engaged in the finale of season 7 and are married in episode 4 of season 8.\n\nIn the season 2 finale, it is revealed his father had another son, Jasper Linney (of whom Murdoch knew nothing), before marrying Murdoch's mother. Jasper is a sergeant in the [[North-West Mounted Police]] and his mannerisms, interests and investigative techniques are similar to those of Murdoch's own, and the two prove successful in working together to solve a gold mining [[scam]] case. In the season 4 episode ''Voices'', it is revealed that Murdoch has a younger sister, Susanna, who is a nun living in Toronto briefly before returning to her convent in [[Montreal]] when it is revealed she is terminally ill. Their conversations reveal that they had an Aunt, whose home he left at seventeen, to work at a logging camp. This episode also mentions that Murdoch's father was still alive two years prior and lives in Western Canada.\n\nIn season 1, episode 4, it is revealed that Murdoch once had a fianc\u00e9e, Liza Milner; she died a year prior of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]].\n\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 10, ''Raised on Robbery'', he and Julia have adopted a son, Roland, the orphaned son of the bank-robber couple; however, in episode 14, ''Wild Child'', when they find out that the couple were not Roland's biological parents, Murdoch and Julia make the heart-breaking decision to give up Roland and reunite him with his real father (the mother having died in childbirth.)\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Inspector Thomas Charles Brackenreid ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Thomas Charles Brackenreid\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Colm Meaney]] (TV movies)<br>[[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| spouse             = [[#Margaret Brackenreid|Margaret Brackenreid]]\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Inspector\n}}\nInspector Brackenreid, who is portrayed by [[Colm Meaney]] in the TV movies and in the TV series by [[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=By Clive|title=Interview: Thomas Craig on Murdoch Mysteries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4579979/Interview-Thomas-Craig-on-Murdoch-Mysteries.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> is a middle-aged married man, fond of the theatre and a good drink. He is the head of the stationhouse and does most of the interrogating, often forming opinions of a suspect because of personal impressions or their social standing. Quick to anger and tenacious, with a sarcastic sense of humour, he is better at traditional \"[[Police officer|coppering]]\" and is very proud of his job and what he feels is his duty to protect the city.\n\nWhile he often disagrees with Murdoch's methods, he uses them when he feels they have merit. He has little time for Crabtree until the second half of the fifth season where he takes him directly under his wing and actually seems to care deeply for him. He is shown to care for Murdoch and knows his mannerisms well enough to know when he is pining and advises him to do something about it.\n\nThroughout the second season Brackenreid is forced to hide his drinking habits from his wife, who has joined the [[temperance movement]].\n\nIn the third season, it is revealed that Brackenreid is a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], as is Constable Crabtree, who happens to be of higher rank.\n\nAt the end of the seventh season Brackenreid suffered a severe beating from a gang of thugs that was controlling the harbour. The first two episodes of season eight detailed that, although he had physically recovered, he was initially adamant about leaving his job, fearing that his family might be endangered. After being convinced by his wife that being a policeman was his life, he began a lone and almost maniacal search for the person responsible for the attack and other crimes, proving willing to eschew the \"rules\" to achieve his objective. Although he came close to killing the culprit, in the end he abided by the law he had served for years and returned to his job as Inspector.\n\nBrackenreid paints as a hobby. Although his colleagues and family don't always appreciate his work. His style greatly resembles Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nBrackenreid is from [[Yorkshire]], England and has two young sons with his wife Margaret, John and Bobby. John, the elder son, would become a Constable under his father at station house four in season 11. Before he became a policeman, Brackenreid served in the British Army and fought in Afghanistan. He is a supporter of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday Football Club]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Dr. Julia Ogden ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Julia Ogden\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Keeley Hawes]] (TV movies)<br>[[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = [[Pathologist]], [[general practitioner]], [[psychiatrist]]\n| gender             = Female\n| title              = Doctor\n| relatives          = Dr. Lionel Ogden (father)<br>Ruby Ogden (sister)\n}}\nDoctor Ogden, who is portrayed by [[Keeley Hawes]] in the TV movies and by [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mohan|first1=Keerthi|title=Interview: 'Murdoch Mysteries' star Helene Joy is rooting for a baby for William and Julia in Season 10|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/interview-murdoch-mysteries-star-helene-joy-rooting-baby-william-julia-season-10-684650|website=ibtimes.co.in|accessdate=September 30, 2016|language=en}}</ref> in the TV series, attended [[Bishop's University]] and is a skilled [[pathologist]] and [[medical examiner]]. (In 1894, a woman did graduate from [[Bishop's University]] and become a skilled pathologist: Dr. [[Maude Abbott]].) However, it is later (episode 11.05) said that she studied under Dr. [[William Osler]] at [[McGill University]] (McGill University did not admit women to the Faculty of Medicine until 1918<ref>https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/features/mcgill-women</ref>). The first of two sisters, Dr. Ogden was a tomboy in her youth and has a criminal record for skinny dipping with some university colleagues (episode 2.04). Her mother is dead, and she has a strained relationship with her father. She enjoys tennis, reading, cycling and attending the theatre. Through her family connections, she is quite well known in Toronto's upper class society (episode 1.08). Dr. Ogden is often consulted on cases by Murdoch and is able to provide valuable insights into many cases. They, along with [[Constable]] Crabtree, enjoy the intellectual puzzles that many murder mysteries present.\n\nIn the first season, she and Murdoch begin a tentative romantic relationship. In episode 2.06, Dr. Ogden tells Murdoch that she became pregnant when in university and terminated it. ([[Abortion in Canada]] was illegal during 1869-1969.) As Murdoch struggles to come to terms with this knowledge, Ogden decides to end their relationship, believing that, due to his [[Catholicism]], he will never accept what she did or that she still feels it was the right decision. Their relationship is awkward until the end of the final episode of season 2 when Dr. Ogden agrees to discuss restarting the relationship.\n\nAt the end of Season 3, she leaves the [[Constabulary]] to go work in a children's hospital in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It is revealed that she cannot give birth to a child due to the previous abortion, and for this reason she decides to terminate her relationship with Murdoch. Murdoch tries to stop her leaving and intends to propose to her despite knowing about her condition, but arrives late at the train station. (In a daydream that he has about proposing, he intends to tell her that he does want a family, but that they can adopt. However, he never has this conversation with her in real life, and she leaves Toronto not knowing about his intentions for either marriage or family.) Dr. Ogden does not return to work in the morgue at the start of season 4, but Murdoch writes to her to help solve a case. She does not appear in episode 2, but does appear in episode 3 (Buffalo Shuffle), where [[Yannick Bisson]] makes his directing debut. Murdoch brings the engagement ring with the intention of proposing, but Dr. Ogden reveals that she is already engaged to a doctor working at the children's hospital in Buffalo. She returns to her old position in Toronto several episodes later. Her fianc\u00e9 takes a position at a Toronto hospital to be with her. In the last episode Julia marries [[Characters of Murdoch Mysteries#Major Recurring Characters|Dr. Darcy Garland]], despite her affection for Murdoch.\n\nAt the beginning of the season 5 ([[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Back and to the Left]]), however, she terminates her employment in the City Morgue and starts her own private practice in Toronto, leaving the work to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Dr. Emily Grace. Julia states that with her feelings towards Murdoch maintaining their professional relationship would jeopardize her marriage. Later on in the series she actively participates in a birth-control campaign, which complicates her husband's social position and even leads to her arrest. At the end of the season, she and Darcy separate.  In season 6, Julia is working as a psychiatrist, often assisting Murdoch with his cases. She is actively trying to divorce Darcy and is framed for his murder at the end of the season, though Murdoch uncovers the real killer and clears her name barely in time to prevent her execution by hanging. The trauma of her experience and guilt feelings cause her to withdraw from Murdoch at the season 6 finale; but, in season 7, their relationship seems to be back on track, and they become engaged in the finale. They are married in the fourth episode of season 8.\n\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 10, ''Raised on Robbery'', she and William briefly adopted a son, Roland, the orphaned son of the bank-robber couple.  When Julia discovers the child's actual father is still alive, they reluctantly return Roland to his father.  However, the experience with Roland encourages William and Julia to seriously consider adopting a child of their own .\n\nIn season 11, episode 4 (The Canadian Patient), Julia meets a woman conducting research into fertility treatments, and offers herself as a potential test subject. In episode 11 (\"Biffers and Blockers\"), Julia reveals to William that the treatments have worked and she is pregnant. Julia suffers a miscarriage in the fourth month of her pregnancy (season 11, episode 17, \"Shadows are Falling\").\n\nJulia's father, Dr. Lionel Ogden, died in the season 7 finale. She has a younger sister, Ruby Ogden, who is a minor character in the series and a journalist, who often travels the world.\n\n=== Constable George Crabtree ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = George Crabtree\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Matthew MacFadzean]] (TV movies)<br>[[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Constable\n}}[[File:Jonny Harris at the 2013 CFC Annual Gala & Auction.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Jonny Harris]]\nMurdoch's assistant, Constable Crabtree, is portrayed by [[Matthew MacFadzean]] in the TV movies and by [[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Bill|last2=Network|first2=Postmedia|title='Murdoch' character gets zanier|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/05/30/murdoch-character-gets-zanier|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> in the TV series. Although inexperienced at first and often comically naive, Crabtree frequently provides useful insights into cases and does much of the forensic legwork collecting evidence.\n\nIn early seasons, Crabtree is eager, but has yet to master Murdoch's more advanced scientific skills. He is very loyal to Murdoch, willing to threaten one of Ogden's suitors when Murdoch asked him to investigate him; he also knows Murdoch's mannerisms rather well. While Brackenreid initially regards him as an idiot, over time, Crabtree proves adept at learning Murdoch's methods and eventually gains Brackenreid's respect and the possibility of promotion to detective.\n\nCrabtree dates a number of women over the years, but the relationships tend to be doomed by circumstances.  At the end of season 8 and the start of season 9, he proposes to Edna Brooks, but she learns she is not a widow\u2014and then her husband is murdered.  Fearing that Edna is guilty, Crabtree protects her by allowing himself to be prosecuted and convicted.  Consequently, he is not promoted, but demoted to Constable Third Class, after Murdoch finds the real killer.\n\nCrabtree often has ideas for commercial uses for Murdoch's inventions. Murdoch usually dismisses them as absurd, but they often prefigure real successful products. Crabtree also aspires to be a mystery novelist. His first novel, ''The Curse of the Pharaohs'', is published in season 5. (Concurrently with that season, ''Curse of the Lost Pharaohs'' also aired on Citytv.com as a mixed live action/animation [[web series]] dramatizing the plot of Crabtree's manuscript.)\n\nCrabtree revealed in one episode (\"Big Murderer on Campus\") that he did not know who his biological mother was and was left on the doorstep of a church and taken in by the family there. He was later re-united with his mother at the end of the episode after taking part in a plan to uncover the murderer of a professor. Crabtree also frequently refers to his many Aunts, each of whom seems to be named after a variety of flower. In the season 7 episode \"Republic of Murdoch\", it is revealed that these Aunts are, or at one time have been, prostitutes who live in a large house rented to them by the Reverend who became Crabtree's guardian after he was abandoned. Crabtree was raised in Newfoundland.\n\nIn season 3, it is revealed that Crabtree is a [[Freemasons|Freemason]], along with Brackenreid and turns out to be of higher rank than the inspector.\n{{Clear}}\n\nCrabtree also has a difficult time with a flighty socialite named Roger Newsome, whom he has numerous dealings with, to his irritation. His deepest cause for this enmity was when Newsome was assisting Crabtree on a case and at one point Crabtree was being attacked with deadly intent by a criminal. Rather than do anything to assist his police companion in mortal peril, Newsome abandoned him in blatant cowardice, and Crabtree required assistance from others. Newsome never adequately apologized for his failure and would meet the unforgiving Crabtree on numerous other occasions. However, when Newsome was murdered by a sniper to silence his testimony for a murder trial in the episode, \"Weekend at Murdoch's\", Crabtree was able to spare a bit of politeness for him under the circumstances.\n\n=== Dr. Emily Grace ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Emily Grace\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Murdoch of the Klondike]]\n| last               = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Double Life]]\n| portrayer          = [[Georgina Reilly]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Coroner\n| gender             = Female\n| title              = Doctor\n}}[[File:Georgina Reilly.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Georgina Reilly]]\nPortrayed by [[Georgina Reilly]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgina Reilly: Why I left Murdoch Mysteries|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2015/10/26/georgina-reilly-why-i-left-murdoch-mysteries/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> Emily Grace is the new coroner who joins the morgue in season 5 as Dr. Ogden leaves to set up her private practice. Initially described as Dr. Ogden's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]], Dr. Grace is a trained medical doctor but admits she prefers [[pathology]] because she has little patience to maintain a good bedside manner. She is interested in [[spiritualism]], believing that it is compatible with scientific study. Though eager and impatient, she quickly learns the rules of the station house and proves to be a highly competent coroner to Murdoch in his investigations.\n\nEmily later becomes a love interest for Constable Crabtree; they become good friends and she often enjoys his company and entertains his far-fetched theories with some enthusiasm. A tentative romance develops between them in season 6, but George breaks off their relationship after she kisses Leslie Garland, the brother of Julia Ogden's first husband Dr. Darcy Garland. After she ends things with Leslie, George is still quite distant with her, though they gradually become friends again. Emily joins the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement in season 8, becoming a strong advocate and encouraging Dr. Ogden to support them. Through the suffrage movement, Emily becomes acquainted with Lillian Moss and they eventually enter a romance. In season 8, Lillian Moss proposes to her to move to London and fight there for the women's suffrage. Though Lillian is murdered by the husband of her ex-lover, Emily still chooses to follow through with moving to London and finally leaves Toronto for London alone at the end of the episode 3, season 9 \"Double Life\".\n\n=== Rebecca James ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Rebecca James\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Barenaked Ladies]]\n| portrayer          = [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Morgue Assistant\n| gender             = Female\n}}\nPortrayed by [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries' new kid on the block: Mouna Traor\u00e9|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2015/11/15/murdoch-mysteries-new-kid-on-the-block-mouna-traore/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Rebecca is a young woman of humble origins who has recently arrived in Toronto, living at the Junction, and working as an overnight cleaner for the city [[morgue]]. Dr. Ogden meets Rebecca on her first day back as the Chief Coroner, where Rebecca exhibits a genuine interest in anatomy that Dr. Ogden appreciates. Because she is [[African Canadian]], a number of people are unhappy with the attention that Dr. Ogden gives her. When Rebecca is dismissed from her position for removing evidence from the morgue for an experiment that provided evidence, Dr. Ogden hires her back as Morgue Assistant. It is revealed that Rebecca attended a year at the [[New York Medical College for Women]]. When her patron died, his son was less inclined to support her schooling so she had to leave. She eventually resumes her medical studies at the [[Women's College Hospital|Ontario Medical College for Women]] while working at the morgue, and her application to work at the City Morgue is officially granted at the end of Summer of '03.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Major recurring characters ==\n\n=== James Gillies ===\n\nJames Gillies, portrayed by [[Michael Seater]], is Detective William Murdoch's [[wiktionary:nemesis|nemesis]]. He is a cold, calculating, murderous criminal mastermind who hides behind a facade of cordiality. Gillies views his nefarious schemes as high-stakes games in which he and Murdoch match wits and, for which, there must be a clear winner and a loser. Priding himself on always being one step ahead of the detective, he often employs people as dispensable pawns to aid in his machinations, not hesitating to kill them when they no longer prove useful, to ensure their silence. During his first appearance, Gillies is shown to be a gifted student and teacher's assistant along with his friend and fellow teacher's assistant, Robert Perry. Murdoch eventually discovers that Gillies and Perry had murdered their [[physics]] professor, supposedly to test their knowledge of physics. Under pressure, Perry confesses to his involvement in the crime and implicates Gillies, after being tricked into believing that Gillies intended to kill him as well.\n\nGillies is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for his crimes; but he escapes from his execution and seeks revenge against Murdoch. Gillies kidnaps and buries Dr. Julia Ogden alive. Though Dr. Ogden is saved, Gillies escapes again. In his next act of revenge, Gillies frames Julia for the murder of her estranged husband, Dr. Darcy Garland. After capturing Murdoch, Gillies sets an elaborate trap to pressure Murdoch into choosing either his own life or that of the convicted Julia's. Though Murdoch chooses to save Julia, he is rescued, and Gillies is apprehended. Gillies is boarded on a train headed to Kingston where he is to be hanged for his crimes. While Gillies manages to escape from the train, Murdoch pursues him. After pinning Gillies down, Gillies distracts Murdoch with a kiss and jumps off a bridge, to escape. Despite an extensive [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] undertaken by the Toronto Constabulary, Gillies is nowhere to be found, and it seems likely he perished from his fall.\n\nAfter Gillies' fall, Julia begins receiving letters from someone claiming to be Gillies. The author of the letters threatens to kill Murdoch should Julia accept Murdoch's proposal for marriage or reveal the existence of the letters. Murdoch, Ogden, and Brackenreid begin investigating whether Gillies is alive, which results in finding what appears to be Gillies' body downriver from where he threw himself off the bridge. After Dr. Ogden and Dr. Emily Grace examine the badly decomposed body and perform a facial approximation on the skull, they and Murdoch believe the body to be Gillies'. The key piece of evidence suggesting the corpse is Gillies' is a bullet found embedded in its shoulder. Constable George Crabtree had shot Gillies in the shoulder, and the bullet was never removed. After careful examination, Murdoch ascertained the bullet to be the same that Crabtree shot Gillies with.\n\nYears later, a murderer is caught who claims to be possessed by the spirit of James Gillies. Murdoch and Dr. Ogden interrogate the man and coax information from him that leads them to realize that Gillies is alive, having faked his death by killing someone of similar appearance, embedding the bullet George Crabtree shot him with into the corpse's shoulder, and throwing the corpse in the river he jumped into. After giving a clue to the whereabouts of Gillies, the murderer kills himself. Ogden's autopsy of the murderer reveals a small wireless radio transceiver hidden in his body as well as an even smaller wireless electroacoustic transducer embedded in his skull\u2014both of which are soon after discovered to have been commissioned and implanted by Gillies. After following the clues to the address of a girl Gillies once kidnapped, he finds a talking doll whose message seems to suggest that Gillies has once again kidnapped Julia. Murdoch rushes to his home only to find Gillies instead holding Murdoch's young son hostage with a syringe filled with heroin. Gillies, who, as a result of his fall suffers from chronic pain and has a severely disfigured face, wants Murdoch, the man he most loves and respects, to kill him. Murdoch hesitates at first, desiring Gillies to receive punishment by the state, but then fires his gun at Gillies after Gillies threatens his son with the syringe. The gun, however, had been surreptitiously emptied of all but one bullet by Gillies sometime earlier, and doesn't fire. Gillies, given a renewed sense of purpose by his brush with death at the hands of his greatest adversary, still hovering over Murdoch's son with a [[syringe]], and seemingly back in control, taunts Murdoch, telling him that he looks forward to the fun they will have together. However, Murdoch slides out a [[sleeve gun]] and shoots Gillies with a rubber bullet, incapacitating him. Gillies is captured and finally hanged for his crimes. Dr. Ogden performs Gillies' autopsy and removes his brain so that it may be studied, as she promised him she'd do years before on the train.\n\n=== Dr. Llewellyn Francis ===\n\nDr. Francis, portrayed by [[Paul Rhys]], is a bad tempered pathologist from [[Scotland Yard]], who replaces Dr. Ogden who left for a job in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"doc\">{{cite web |url=http://tvguide.ca/TVNews/articles/100728_murdoch_mysteries_spoilers_GD.htm |title='Murdoch' mysteries revealed |last=David |first=Greg |work=tvguide.ca |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205827/http://tvguide.ca/TVNews/articles/100728_murdoch_mysteries_spoilers_GD.htm |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is portrayed as cold and often dismissive in his manner. His character always clashes with Murdoch.<ref name=\"alibi\">{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/alibi/homepage/sid/8089|title=Murdoch Mysteries|publisher=UKTV|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is revealed that Dr. Francis accepted the position in Toronto only because his wife's family resided in Canada and after a great deal of persuasion from Inspector Brackenreid.  Though he is a highly capable pathologist, the lack of trust between him and Murdoch result in frequent frustration.  When Murdoch goes behind Francis' back to approach Dr. Ogden for an analysis, Francis reluctantly confirms that Ogden's analysis is correct but is furious with how Murdoch continues to interfere and doubt Francis' professional abilities.  He eventually quits and returns to England.\n\n=== Constable Henry Higgins ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Lachlan Murdoch (actor)|Lachlan Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Murdoch Mysteries\u2019 sealed with a kiss|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2014/12/09/interview-murdoch-mysteries-sealed-with-a-kiss/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> Constable Henry Higgins is a police constable at Toronto's station house four. He frequently assists George Crabtree in investigations.\n\nHiggins is best known for doing his own thing when it comes to any sort of case or off duty business, ranging from locating a new kind of ice cream with George (Season 9 Episode 15, House of Industry) or watching boxing fights with Jackson (Season 8 Episode 3, Glory Days). It appears that he and George are best friends, and that he is somewhat of an assistant to him. Higgins has appeared in almost all the episodes.  Higgins was amongst the sceptical constables to whom Murdoch presented his Pneumograph (Season 1 Episode 8, Still Waters\").  Henry was also one of the three who contributed to the purchase of the motor car between himself, George and Jackson in Murdoch Takes Manhattan.\n\nHenry is prone to making frequent mistakes in episodes, but usually has a redeeming moment towards the end. Detective Murdoch has taught Henry how to correctly make shoe impressions in the mud in Child's Play after Henry messes up three footprints beforehand, having no clue how to do them exactly.  When Prince Alfred visited Toronto and Constable George Crabtree was assigned to his security, Higgins assisted Detective William Murdoch with an investigation into the murder of Maggie Gilpatrick. Murdoch taught Higgins about fingermarks and how to trace a person's next of kin. When it was determined there was a plot to kidnap Prince Alfred, Higgins was selected to impersonate the prince to help safeguard His Highness (Season 1, Episode 12, The Prince and the Rebel).  However, Higgins also tends to let words slip out of his mouth before thinking about them, but means no harm. Such an example of this is during Unlucky in Love (Season 9 Episode 12) when Higgins accidentally insults Baby Roland Connor when Detective Murdoch is worried about Roland not walking yet and suggest that 'Maybe he's just slow.'which annoys Murdoch. Higgins later apologizes sincerely for this though, never meaning to speak ill of Murdoch's son. Nevertheless, Henry has proven himself to be good with young children, during this episode as well as \"Raised on Robbery\" (Season 9 Episode 9).\n\nGrowing up, Higgins family owned a piano shop. He did not enjoy playing, but he loved all of the parts. (Season 7 Episode 17, \"Blast of Silence\") It's also known that Henry's mother is from the Gasp\u00e9 in Quebec, and he knows how to speak a bit of French as shown in \"Convalescence and Monsieur Murdoch\". Higgins has a homosexual cousin and so was aware of the secret gay club where homosexual men gathered in Toronto (Season 1 Episode 5, \"'Til Death Do Us Part\").\n\nIn \"War on Terror\" (Season 5 Episode 4), Henry is caught in an explosion along with George and is rendered unconscious, resulting in George attempting to find the culprit behind the bombing of Milne's store. The bomber is caught, and Higgins returns to the station house having been hospitalized for the majority of the episode. In the beginning of Season 10, (Season 10 Episode 1, Great Balls of Fire, Part 1) Higgins picks up smoking cigars, but whether this was just to impress the Inspector or not is unknown, as we're never shown him smoking again after.\n\nAt the end of the Season 10 finale (Season 10 Episode 18, Hell to Pay), along with Constable George Crabtree and Constable Slugger Jackson, Henry is caught in an ambush; all are shot and possibly murdered.\n\nIn Season 11, Higgins begins courting Ruth Newsome (of the Mimico Newsomes), sister of Roger Newsome, who was involved in several of Murdoch's investigations. In Episode 11 (\"Biffers and Blockers\"), Higgins has taken up cricket and also engaged a butler, at Ruth's suggestion, part of his transformation to join the upper class. In Episode 12 (\"Mary Wept\"), Henry attempts to propose to Ruth but is interrupted when a body falls from a bell tower and lands just behind him, traumatizing Ruth. Ruth later proposes to Henry herself and is accepted.\n\n=== Margaret Brackenreid ===\n\nMargaret, portrayed by [[Arwen Humphreys]], is married to Inspector Thomas Brackenreid and together they have two young boys. Margaret is a very passionate woman, who is always very determined in everything she does. Thomas Brackenreid had just come out of the army when Margaret's father asked him to join the family's plumbing business. Margaret thought he'd have been a good plumber, but his heart was set on the police force. Married to a policeman, she knew what she was getting into, no point in complaining about the long hours \u2013 and the worry. But still... after they had two sons, Margaret does worry about her husband's safety due to his career as a police officer. Margaret does not like the opera but instead enjoys classical music on their gramophone. She is a good cook, bakes her own bread, and is noted for her excellent plum pudding at Christmas by Murdoch.\nShe is involved in the [[temperance movement]] for a period, and once becomes suspicious of her husband's relationship with an opera singer, but is typically portrayed as a loyal and loving partner. Brackenreid has stated he met Margaret when he was a beat cop and he arrested her for causing a disturbance. She and Thomas have two children, John and Bobby. John, the elder son, would go on to become a Constable under his father at station house four much to his mother's chagrin.<ref name=\"alibi\"/>\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 13, ''Unlucky in Love'', Margaret Brackenreid has started a [[Wedding planner]] business.\n\n=== Nina Bloom ===\n\nNina, portrayed by [[Erin Agostino]], is the most popular burlesque dancer at the infamous Star Room. Nina doesn't much care what people think of her because her reputation is not who she is. She doesn't dance at the burlesque to snag a husband. She enjoys it and won't deny herself the things that bring her pleasure, and that includes George. George and Nina's relationship continues to be both challenging and challenged in Season 10 and by the end of Season 11, Nina leaves Toronto for her dream job in Paris.\n\n=== Louise Cherry ===\n\nLouise, portrayed by [[Bea Santos]], is a journalist for the Toronto Gazette. She is tenacious and very clever. Louise is a woman who doesn't take 'no' for an answer. In season 11, Louise Cherry taken to the Station House No. 4 cells for impersonating the Mercy Killer by fabricating letters from the murderer published the Toronto Gazette. Later, she has been hired by another paper, ''The Toronto Telegraph''. She received a visit from the editor of the Toronto Telegraph while locked up in jail. His offer is quite generous, her title and wages significantly more substantial than at the Gazette. She'll team up with the Detective Watts in a criminal investigation.\n\n=== James and Sally Pendrick ===\n\n[[File:Peter Stebbings.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Peter Stebbings]]\nJames Pendrick (portrayed by [[Peter Stebbings]])<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reserved.|first1=.

The Pendricks are advocates of [[eugenics]]. James is an engineer and inventor. They own Rembrandt's painting ''[[Bathsheba at Her Bath]]'', valued around $40 000, which is stolen in an episode in Season 3. Sally is an advocate of modern art, and gives Murdoch an avant-garde nude portrait of herself. The Pendrick family played a big part in the plot over the 2nd part of season 3.<ref name=\"alibi\"/> Indeed, James Pendrick was suspected by Murdoch of murder, or of being an accomplice to various crimes, in 4 of the 5 cases in which he was involved, much to Pendrick's annoyance. In the last episode of Season 3, Sally Pendrick is revealed to be a criminal from upstate New York, stealing her husband's fortune, and investing in the development of a doomsday weapon.\n\nJames Pendrick reappears in later seasons with various new inventions. Sally escaped justice at the end of Season 3, and her whereabouts are unknown.\n\n=== Dr. Darcy Garland ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jonathan Watton]],<ref>{{cite web|title='Murdoch Mysteries' Next Season: Everything You Need To Know|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/27/murdoch-mysteries-season-7-preview_n_4004130.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> the husband of Dr. Julia Ogden. He does, in fact, get along just fine with Detective William Murdoch. At the end of Season 5, Julia and Darcy part ways because she realizes she is with the wrong person. However, part way into Season 6, Darcy has second thoughts on separating from Julia and tears up their divorce papers. In episode \"Lovers in a Murderous Time\", Murdoch spots Darcy with his own mistress. Initially confronting him, Murdoch is goaded into punching him. In episode \"Crime and Punishment\", Darcy is murdered and Julia is implicated in his death.\n\n=== Leslie Garland ===\n\n[[File:Giacomo Gianniotti 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|100px|right|Giacomo Gianniotti]]\nPortrayed by [[Giacomo Gianniotti]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rideout|first1=T.

Despite appearing cordial towards both Julia and Murdoch, he actually blames them for his brother's death and resents them.  Previously a law student, Murdoch learns that Leslie was expelled from university.  He remains in Toronto, working as a gardener.  During his stay, he is formally introduced to Emily Grace and they form a connection over shared interests.  He briefly competes with George over the affections for Dr. Grace, eventually winning her over after George breaks up with her due to a misunderstanding.  However, Dr. Grace later learns that Leslie is behind a series of threatening letters addressed to Julia from the long-dead James Gillies as a form of revenge on Dr. Ogden and Murdoch.  Emily breaks up with him soon afterward and reveals the truth to Dr. Ogden, who furiously expels Leslie from Darcy's home and states her intention to sell Darcy's estate.\n\n=== Lillian Moss ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Sara Mitich]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rising Star: Exclusive Interview with The Expanse\u2019s Sara Mitich|url=https://talknerdywithus.com/2016/01/07/rising-star-exclusive-interview-with-the-expanses-sara-mitich/|website=talknerdywithus.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> Lillian Moss is a [[suffragist]], whom Emily Grace comes to know through their mutual support of women's rights. Because she refused to marry a man chosen by her family, she was disowned. It is revealed early on that Lillian is a [[lesbian]] and is extremely attracted to Dr. Grace. Emily's feelings towards Lillian remained ambiguous until \"Toronto's Girl Problem\", when Emily and Lillian begin a passionate romance. However, soon after Lillian convinces Emily to join her in London to pursue the suffragist cause, Lillian is murdered.\n\nAfter her death, Lillian's true identity is revealed to be Helen Walker. When Helen's affair with a married woman, Gladys, was discovered by Gladys' husband, Joe, the women were lured onto a boat, where Joe attempted to kill Helen. With the attempt was thwarted by Gladys, the women tossed Joe overboard, leaving him for dead, and staged a boating accident that left Helen the sole survivor because they knew the police would not believe their version of what had occurred. Despite Helen's insistence that they separate, Gladys pursued her to Toronto, where Helen had become Lillian Moss and had fallen in love with Emily Grace. When Joe, having secretly survived the attempt on his life, confronted Lillian to learn Gladys' whereabouts, he killed Lillian when she refused to reveal where Gladys had gone.\n\n=== Eva Pearce ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Daiva Johnston]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries' Season 9 end and what's to come in Season 10|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2016/03/21/murdoch-mysteries-season-9-end-and-whats-to-come-in-season-10/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Eva Pearce becomes Murdoch's nemesis, a white collar thief, kidnapper, and killer. She was deadly, manipulative, and cautious, making her a dangerous opponent of William Murdoch.\n\nIn her first appearance, Eva is introduced as a shop girl in the prestigious T. Eaton Co. department store where someone has been murdered. She flirts with Murdoch, who is unaware of her attentions until Dr. Ogden points it out to him. She is revealed to be responsible for causing murders by manipulating men that she seduces. Though Murdoch thwarts her plans to court a wealthy man, she gets away and manages to attract another suitor. She subsequently takes on the identity of [[Cassie Chadwick]], claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of [[Andrew Carnegie]], and manages to become the fianc\u00e9e of Ian Worthington, president of the Canadian Bank. Her scheme to marry Worthington and force him to take on her debts fails when Murdoch exposes her true identity and she is arrested. Eva is later sent to an insane asylum, where she and other female \"lunatics\" such as Mrs. Lynd, Rose Maxwell, and Charlotte, as well as a murderess named Hannah, concoct an escape plan. Eva is the only one who manages to escape, securing her freedom by tricking a man into giving her a cab ride.  Presumably she will continue to con men into getting what she wants. In her final appearance, the mentally unstable Eva attempts to kill Julia and kidnaps Murdoch, with the intention of forcing herself on him to \"give him the child he has always wanted\" as she has become obsessed and delusional with him. She is ultimately unsuccessful, and while in a confrontation with Julia, bleeds to death after Julia manages to stab her in the throat.\n\n=== Detective Llewellyn Watts ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Daniel Maslany]], Llewellyn Watts is a detective from station house 1 who is brought to station house 4 to re-examine a case where new evidence has arisen where a man sent to prison by Murdoch could be exonerated.  When Inspector Brackenreid leaves station house four to accompany James Pendrick to Panama, Watts is brought back to station house four as the station detective while Murdoch serves as the acting inspector. While working at station house four, Detective Watts becomes involved in an ongoing missing persons cases, assisted by Constable Slugger Jackson, which eventually leads Watts to his long-missing older sister, who abandoned him when he was a child (their parents were dead, and she just saw him as a burden).  After Inspector Brackenreid's return, Watts remains working with station house 4.  In \"Murdoch Schmurdoch\" (season 11, episode 15), while investigating the murder of a Jewish man, Watts recognises a [[Jewish]] lullaby as the same one as the one his late mother used to sing to him; he's told that, if his mother was Jewish, then he's Jewish, too (apparently, his family's original name was 'Wattsenburg', but his parents changed it when they [[Immigration|immigrated]] to Canada).\n\nCompared to Murdoch, Watts prefers performing his investigations outdoors and on the streets.  He is extremely well-read and philosophical, approaching his cases with objective analytical logic in the vein of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. He can be difficult to work with because he tends to speak with little regards to social graces and voices his thought processes aloud and unfiltered.\n\nHe shouldn't be gay.\n\nWatts' eccentric body language and speech patterns are reminiscent of famous Canadian pianist and personality [[Glenn Gould]].\n\n== Minor recurring characters ==\n\n=== Harry Murdoch (Harry Smith) ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Stephen McHattie]], he is the father of Detective William Murdoch. When Murdoch meets his father for the first time after a long estrangement (episode: 1.06 - Let Loose The Dogs), for most of the case, he believes his father to be a killer and primary suspect based on his own prejudice that Harry had indirectly caused his mother's death by hitting her; after his innocence was proven, at William's request his father tells him that, as flawed and a drunk as he may have been, he never hit either his mother or him. Harry leaves Toronto, telling his son that he has plans to settle in the West. Murdoch later goes to [[British Columbia]] to investigate a case with a fellow Mounted Policeman (episode: 2.13 - Anything I Can Do), where he meets up with his father. His father reveals to William that he has a half-brother. Harry only found out about this son in the past five years. Harry also explained why his other son believes his name is \"Smith\". In season 12 Harry Murdoch was killed due to his involvement in the kidnapping of an infant child 30 years earlier.\n\n=== Terrance Meyers ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Peter Keleghan]],<ref>{{cite web|title=What I'm watching: Peter Keleghan|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/what-im-watching-peter-keleghan/article566626/|website=theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> he appears in twelve episodes, once in each of the series' twelve seasons. He worked for [[Rouge Valley]] Lands Ltd. in the final episode of Season 1. The company planned to dam the Rouge River and create an electrical station. He also worked for the government in a high-level position, forcing Murdoch to pull off a case, making it Murdoch's third unsolved case. Terrance appeared in episode 7 of Season 4. like '''his''' boss Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]], he is very much disliked by station house four and always shows up at the most suspicious times. Most of his projects revolve around ensuring Canada receives air superiority. In Season 5, he and Murdoch infiltrate a visiting [[anarchist]] organization, following a bombing that took place in the streets of Toronto. In Season 6, Meyers attempted to appropriate an airplane before its inventor, James Pendrick, pushed it into [[Niagara Falls]]. Meyers also appeared in Season 7, where he first claimed to be assigned to assisting the U.S. in tracking down an anarchist cell.  In season 8, episode 17, Meyers adds to the confusion over a corpse's identity by claiming that the man was one of his secret agents.\n\n=== Constable Augustus Jackson ===\n\n[[File:Kristian Bruun by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Kristian Bruun]]\nPortrayed by [[Kristian Bruun]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries: A Merry Murdoch Christmas - Holiday Guide|url=http://www.cbc.ca/holidayguide/schedule/view/murdoch-mysteries-a-merry-murdoch-christmas|website=www.cbc.ca|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> Constable Augustus \"Gus\" Jackson first appeared in season 5 as a baseball player for station house five and was nicknamed \"Slugger\" for his impressive athletic abilities.

During Detective Watts' missing women investigation for station house four, Jackson reveals that he had a wife who died in his arms from [[dropsy]] and encourages Watts not to give up for the sake of other women. In the finale of season 10, Jackson, Higgins, and Crabtree walk into a trap set by Chief Inspector Davis, at the orders of the ruthless businessman Robert Graham; the three constables are all shot by Graham's men. When they are found by Detective Watts, Jackson is taken to the hospital with Higgins, though Jackson succumbs to his wounds. His funeral occurs at the beginning of season 11; when the constables attempt to place his portrait at the station house to honour him, corrupt councilman Franklin Williams takes it down.

He refers to Murdoch and himself as \"similar people\", because of their fathers both being alcoholics. He appeared in season 6 to help with the matter of a man with a personality disorder that led him to believe he was Sherlock Holmes. Because [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] is the creator and authority on Sherlock Holmes he was brought to assist the detectives in tricking the man into revealing his true self. However, to Doyle's surprise, the man was an impeccable likeness to his character, offering all logical answers to his questions. Doyle even asked him how \"Sherlock Holmes\" could've survived his death at the Reichenbach Falls, as there was no footprints leading away from the cliff, but the man replies he retraced his own footprints. Doyle is startled and admits that's a good idea. It is suggested that the man gave the ideas that made it possible for Doyle to bring his character back to life.\n\n=== Sarah Pensell ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Maria del Mar (actress)|Maria del Mar]], a spiritualist medium who helps Murdoch with his case (Season One, episode 4, ''Elementary, My Dear Murdoch'').

Murdoch later finds out that her fianc\u00e9 was a member of the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]], a criminal organization and forerunner of the Mafia, who chose to elope with Anna with the counterfeit money he was smuggling. This forced the Black Hand to kill him and put a hit on Anna, assuming she was complicit. This causes Anna to change her name. Murdoch later finds her working in a library where one of Anna's colleagues was murdered. Murdoch fears for her safety because the Black Hand still has a price on her head.

She first met Murdoch when they were children as Governor General Young Scholars, where they were rivals.

Freddie and Murdoch meet again as adults years later, when Murdoch is investigating a murder in Montreal and Freddie is investigating a divorce case.  Realizing the common denominator between the cases was their attendance at the same camp, they work together to solve the murder.  She later establishes her private detective business in Toronto, where Julia approaches her to investigate the actual parentage of the Murdochs' adopted son, Roland.\n\n=== Dr. Roberts ===\n\nDr. Roberts is a practicing psychiatrist who assists William Murdoch on a number of cases, first introduced in Season 2, played by [[Paul Amos]]. Dr. Roberts, who was recently removed from his position at the Provincial Lunatic Asylum because his research on the workings of the criminal mind ruffled too many feathers. He is quite forward-thinking and is practicing at a private hospital in Etobicoke, the Toronto Hospital for the Incurables.\n\nIn \"Twentieth Century Murdoch\", Murdoch and the station were baffled by a supposed time machine and he consulted with Dr. Roberts on the psychiatric nature of those holding it. Dr. Roberts dropped his glass, cutting himself, and his hand trembles.\n\nLater, George discovered it was Dr. Roberts who planted the fake Santa suit with the finger mark to prove it. Leaving to arrest him, they instead discover that Dr. Roberts was frozen by his stepbrother as he had been dying from a genetic disease. He hypnotized Murdoch into believing he had travelled in time, along with the other people who entered the \"time machine\".

He believed that Murdoch set a prisoner free in season 4 episode 13, \"Murdoch in Wonderland\"; in the season 5 episode 1, \"Murdoch of the Klondike\", Brackenreid covered for Murdoch with the story of a faulty lock. Chief Constable Giles did not believe this story but because he did not have any evidence, he could not arrest Murdoch. However, because of that, in a number of episodes in season 5, Chief Constable Giles seemed to have something personally against Murdoch and was always against anything that Murdoch said in any episode that had both Chief Constable Giles and Murdoch. The storyline with Chief Constable Giles personally hating Murdoch was dropped from the program, and because of that in season 6 episode 6, \"Murdoch and the Cloud of Doom\", when somebody threatened Toronto with a deadly toxic gas, Chief Constable Giles personally asked Murdoch to find the person. In season 6 episode 12, \"Crime & Punishment\" he arrested Dr. Ogden for the murder of her husband Dr. Darcy Garland and suspended both Murdoch and Brackenreid, but when they secretly continued their investigation, he reinstated them. In season 8, episode 7, Giles admits to being homosexual, regarding which another constable years prior had tried to blackmail him. Constable Hodge (see below) killed the attempted blackmailer; Hodge and Giles covered up the killing but Murdoch unravelled the story when a body was found in the basement of station house four, ending the careers of both and sending them to prison.  In season 9, episode 1, Giles, now behind bars at the Don Jail, assists Crabtree and Murdoch in finding the killer of another inmate and thereby helping clear Crabtree of his own charge of murder.\n\n=== Constable John Hodge ===\n\nA constable seen around District 4 Department but who was not given a name until season 4 episode 1, \"All Tattered and Torn\", when Detective Malcolm Lamb returns to the station. Constable Hodge was discovered to have accidentally killed a constable to prevent Chief Constable Giles, a detective at the time, from being blackmailed. He was tried for manslaughter and imprisoned. Eventually released from prison.\n\n== Historical figures ==\n\nSeveral additional historical figures have been presented in the series.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n\n* [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (John Tench)\n* [[Joseph-Elz\u00e9ar Bernier]] ([[R\u00e9my Girard]])\n* [[Andrew Carnegie]] ([[Philip Craig (actor)|Philip Craig]])\n* [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Thomas Howes (actor)|Thomas Howes]])\n* [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] ([[Nicholas Campbell]])\n* [[Leon Czolgosz]] (Goran Stjepanovic)\n* [[Thomas Edison]] ([[David Storch]])\n* [[Reginald Fessenden]] (William Matthews)\n* [[W.C.

It was picked up by CBC for its sixth and seventh seasons. The show follows the titular [[character (arts)|character]] William Murdoch, a police detective working in [[Old Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], through the turn of the 19th century into the 20th, who makes use of what was, in the late [[Victorian era]], the latest in [[forensic science]] to solve crimes. The show was developed for television by Cal Coons and Alexandra Zarowny based on the characters in the Detective Murdoch series of novels written by [[Maureen Jennings]].\n\nPrior to the television series, Shaftesbury Films and [[CHUM Television]] produced three [[made for TV movie]]s which were shown on the Canadian cable channel [[Bravo!]] in 2004 and 2005. The original three movies, filmed in [[Winnipeg]] and Toronto, were collectively titled ''The Murdoch Mysteries''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B001FBPSW8 |title=Murdoch Mysteries: Movie Collection |publisher=[[amazon.com|amazon.ca]] |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Main characters ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Character\n! colspan=\"11\"|Seasons\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 1)|1]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 2)|2]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 3)|3]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 4)|4]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|5\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|6\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 7)|7]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|[[Murdoch Mysteries (season 8)|8]]\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|9\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|10\n! style=\"width:5%;\"|11\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Yannick Bisson]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Detective William Murdoch\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Inspector Thomas Brackenreid\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Dr. Julia Ogden\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Jonny Harris]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Constable George Crabtree\n| colspan=\"11\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Georgina Reilly]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Dr. Emily Grace\n| colspan=\"4\" {{n/a|absent}}\n| style=\"background:#fdd; text-align:center;\"| '''recurring'''\n| colspan=\"4\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{n/a|absent}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Rebecca James\n| colspan=\"8\" {{n/a|absent}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{yes2|'''main'''}}\n| colspan=\"1\" {{n/a|absent}}\n|}\n\n=== William Henry Murdoch ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = William Henry Murdoch\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Peter Outerbridge]] (TV movies)<br>[[Yannick Bisson]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| spouse             = [[#Dr. Julia Ogden|Dr. Julia Ogden]]\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Detective\n| relatives          = [[#Harry Murdoch|Harry Murdoch]] (father)<br>Mary Murdoch (mother)<br>Susannah Murdoch (younger sister)<br>Sergeant Jasper Linney (older halfbrother)\n| religion           = [[Roman Catholic]]\n}}\n[[File:Yannick Bisson at the Canadian Film Centre (CFC) Annual BBQ (detail).jpg|thumb|left|100px|Yannick Bisson, the actor who plays Murdoch]]\nDetective Murdoch, who is portrayed by [[Peter Outerbridge]] in the TV movies and by [[Yannick Bisson]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Yannick Bisson on the staying power of 'Murdoch Mysteries'|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2016/03/20/yannick-bisson-on-murdoch-mysteries-staying-power|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> in the series, is an intelligent, observant detective who uses unusual (for the time) techniques such as blood testing and fingerprinting. It is revealed he comes from [[Nova Scotia]], is a devout [[Roman Catholic]] who was educated by the [[Jesuits]] and is fluent in [[French language|French]]. In one episode, it is revealed that he believes that his father beat his mother and may have indirectly caused her death, although this was proven incorrect. Following that incident, he was taken to live in an [[orphanage]].\n\nAlthough very logical, sceptical, observant, scientific and clear-headed with a [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] (possibly [[Hyperthymesia]]) and [[working memory]], these become an issue when he needs to connect with people on an emotional level, something he finds difficult. Often his unusual techniques and unbiased opinions of people lead him to clash with Brackenreid (even though they work together well). He is also a [[polymath]].\n\nMurdoch often consults on cases with Dr. Julia Ogden, with whom he is infatuated, although he did not attempt a relationship with her until the first half of season 2. As the season progressed, an argument over beliefs and past decisions made by Ogden split up the couple for a time, during which time Murdoch pursued a relationship with Enid Jones. However, he and Ogden rekindled their relationship during the season 2 finale on the advice of his half-brother ''(see below)'', and it becomes \"public\" (despite everyone already knowing about it) in the first episode of season 3. Ogden and Murdoch become engaged in the finale of season 7 and are married in episode 4 of season 8.\n\nIn the season 2 finale, it is revealed his father had another son, Jasper Linney (of whom Murdoch knew nothing), before marrying Murdoch's mother. Jasper is a sergeant in the [[North-West Mounted Police]] and his mannerisms, interests and investigative techniques are similar to those of Murdoch's own, and the two prove successful in working together to solve a gold mining [[scam]] case. In the season 4 episode ''Voices'', it is revealed that Murdoch has a younger sister, Susanna, who is a nun living in Toronto briefly before returning to her convent in [[Montreal]] when it is revealed she is terminally ill. Their conversations reveal that they had an Aunt, whose home he left at seventeen, to work at a logging camp. This episode also mentions that Murdoch's father was still alive two years prior and lives in Western Canada.\n\nIn season 1, episode 4, it is revealed that Murdoch once had a fianc\u00e9e, Liza Milner; she died a year prior of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]].\n\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 10, ''Raised on Robbery'', he and Julia have adopted a son, Roland, the orphaned son of the bank-robber couple; however, in episode 14, ''Wild Child'', when they find out that the couple were not Roland's biological parents, Murdoch and Julia make the heart-breaking decision to give up Roland and reunite him with his real father (the mother having died in childbirth.)\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Inspector Thomas Charles Brackenreid ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Thomas Charles Brackenreid\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Colm Meaney]] (TV movies)<br>[[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| spouse             = [[#Margaret Brackenreid|Margaret Brackenreid]]\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Inspector\n}}\nInspector Brackenreid, who is portrayed by [[Colm Meaney]] in the TV movies and in the TV series by [[Thomas Craig (actor)|Thomas Craig]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morgan|first1=By Clive|title=Interview: Thomas Craig on Murdoch Mysteries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4579979/Interview-Thomas-Craig-on-Murdoch-Mysteries.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> is a middle-aged married man, fond of the theatre and a good drink. He is the head of the stationhouse and does most of the interrogating, often forming opinions of a suspect because of personal impressions or their social standing. Quick to anger and tenacious, with a sarcastic sense of humour, he is better at traditional \"[[Police officer|coppering]]\" and is very proud of his job and what he feels is his duty to protect the city.\n\nWhile he often disagrees with Murdoch's methods, he uses them when he feels they have merit. He has little time for Crabtree until the second half of the fifth season where he takes him directly under his wing and actually seems to care deeply for him. He is shown to care for Murdoch and knows his mannerisms well enough to know when he is pining and advises him to do something about it.\n\nThroughout the second season Brackenreid is forced to hide his drinking habits from his wife, who has joined the [[temperance movement]].\n\nIn the third season, it is revealed that Brackenreid is a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], as is Constable Crabtree, who happens to be of higher rank.\n\nAt the end of the seventh season Brackenreid suffered a severe beating from a gang of thugs that was controlling the harbour. The first two episodes of season eight detailed that, although he had physically recovered, he was initially adamant about leaving his job, fearing that his family might be endangered. After being convinced by his wife that being a policeman was his life, he began a lone and almost maniacal search for the person responsible for the attack and other crimes, proving willing to eschew the \"rules\" to achieve his objective. Although he came close to killing the culprit, in the end he abided by the law he had served for years and returned to his job as Inspector.\n\nBrackenreid paints as a hobby. Although his colleagues and family don't always appreciate his work. His style greatly resembles Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].\n\nBrackenreid is from [[Yorkshire]], England and has two young sons with his wife Margaret, John and Bobby. John, the elder son, would become a Constable under his father at station house four in season 11. Before he became a policeman, Brackenreid served in the British Army and fought in Afghanistan. He is a supporter of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday Football Club]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Dr. Julia Ogden ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Julia Ogden\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Keeley Hawes]] (TV movies)<br>[[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = [[Pathologist]], [[general practitioner]], [[psychiatrist]]\n| gender             = Female\n| title              = Doctor\n| relatives          = Dr. Lionel Ogden (father)<br>Ruby Ogden (sister)\n}}\nDoctor Ogden, who is portrayed by [[Keeley Hawes]] in the TV movies and by [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Joy]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mohan|first1=Keerthi|title=Interview: 'Murdoch Mysteries' star Helene Joy is rooting for a baby for William and Julia in Season 10|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/interview-murdoch-mysteries-star-helene-joy-rooting-baby-william-julia-season-10-684650|website=ibtimes.co.in|accessdate=September 30, 2016|language=en}}</ref> in the TV series, attended [[Bishop's University]] and is a skilled [[pathologist]] and [[medical examiner]]. (In 1894, a woman did graduate from [[Bishop's University]] and become a skilled pathologist: Dr. [[Maude Abbott]].) However, it is later (episode 11.05) said that she studied under Dr. [[William Osler]] at [[McGill University]] (McGill University did not admit women to the Faculty of Medicine until 1918<ref>https://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/features/mcgill-women</ref>). The first of two sisters, Dr. Ogden was a tomboy in her youth and has a criminal record for skinny dipping with some university colleagues (episode 2.04). Her mother is dead, and she has a strained relationship with her father. She enjoys tennis, reading, cycling and attending the theatre. Through her family connections, she is quite well known in Toronto's upper class society (episode 1.08). Dr. Ogden is often consulted on cases by Murdoch and is able to provide valuable insights into many cases. They, along with [[Constable]] Crabtree, enjoy the intellectual puzzles that many murder mysteries present.\n\nIn the first season, she and Murdoch begin a tentative romantic relationship. In episode 2.06, Dr. Ogden tells Murdoch that she became pregnant when in university and terminated it. ([[Abortion in Canada]] was illegal during 1869-1969.) As Murdoch struggles to come to terms with this knowledge, Ogden decides to end their relationship, believing that, due to his [[Catholicism]], he will never accept what she did or that she still feels it was the right decision. Their relationship is awkward until the end of the final episode of season 2 when Dr. Ogden agrees to discuss restarting the relationship.\n\nAt the end of Season 3, she leaves the [[Constabulary]] to go work in a children's hospital in [[Buffalo, New York]]. It is revealed that she cannot give birth to a child due to the previous abortion, and for this reason she decides to terminate her relationship with Murdoch. Murdoch tries to stop her leaving and intends to propose to her despite knowing about her condition, but arrives late at the train station. (In a daydream that he has about proposing, he intends to tell her that he does want a family, but that they can adopt. However, he never has this conversation with her in real life, and she leaves Toronto not knowing about his intentions for either marriage or family.) Dr. Ogden does not return to work in the morgue at the start of season 4, but Murdoch writes to her to help solve a case. She does not appear in episode 2, but does appear in episode 3 (Buffalo Shuffle), where [[Yannick Bisson]] makes his directing debut. Murdoch brings the engagement ring with the intention of proposing, but Dr. Ogden reveals that she is already engaged to a doctor working at the children's hospital in Buffalo. She returns to her old position in Toronto several episodes later. Her fianc\u00e9 takes a position at a Toronto hospital to be with her. In the last episode Julia marries [[Characters of Murdoch Mysteries#Major Recurring Characters|Dr. Darcy Garland]], despite her affection for Murdoch.\n\nAt the beginning of the season 5 ([[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Back and to the Left]]), however, she terminates her employment in the City Morgue and starts her own private practice in Toronto, leaving the work to her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Dr. Emily Grace. Julia states that with her feelings towards Murdoch maintaining their professional relationship would jeopardize her marriage. Later on in the series she actively participates in a birth-control campaign, which complicates her husband's social position and even leads to her arrest. At the end of the season, she and Darcy separate.  In season 6, Julia is working as a psychiatrist, often assisting Murdoch with his cases. She is actively trying to divorce Darcy and is framed for his murder at the end of the season, though Murdoch uncovers the real killer and clears her name barely in time to prevent her execution by hanging. The trauma of her experience and guilt feelings cause her to withdraw from Murdoch at the season 6 finale; but, in season 7, their relationship seems to be back on track, and they become engaged in the finale. They are married in the fourth episode of season 8.\n\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 10, ''Raised on Robbery'', she and William briefly adopted a son, Roland, the orphaned son of the bank-robber couple.  When Julia discovers the child's actual father is still alive, they reluctantly return Roland to his father.  However, the experience with Roland encourages William and Julia to seriously consider adopting a child of their own .\n\nIn season 11, episode 4 (The Canadian Patient), Julia meets a woman conducting research into fertility treatments, and offers herself as a potential test subject. In episode 11 (\"Biffers and Blockers\"), Julia reveals to William that the treatments have worked and she is pregnant. Julia suffers a miscarriage in the fourth month of her pregnancy (season 11, episode 17, \"Shadows are Falling\").\n\nJulia's father, Dr. Lionel Ogden, died in the season 7 finale. She has a younger sister, Ruby Ogden, who is a minor character in the series and a journalist, who often travels the world.\n\n=== Constable George Crabtree ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = George Crabtree\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV movies|Except The Dying]]\n| creator            = [[Maureen Jennings]]\n| portrayer          = [[Matthew MacFadzean]] (TV movies)<br>[[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Police officer\n| gender             = Male\n| title              = Constable\n}}[[File:Jonny Harris at the 2013 CFC Annual Gala & Auction.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Jonny Harris]]\nMurdoch's assistant, Constable Crabtree, is portrayed by [[Matthew MacFadzean]] in the TV movies and by [[Jonny Harris (actor)|Jonny Harris]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Bill|last2=Network|first2=Postmedia|title='Murdoch' character gets zanier|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/05/30/murdoch-character-gets-zanier|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> in the TV series. Although inexperienced at first and often comically naive, Crabtree frequently provides useful insights into cases and does much of the forensic legwork collecting evidence.\n\nIn early seasons, Crabtree is eager, but has yet to master Murdoch's more advanced scientific skills. He is very loyal to Murdoch, willing to threaten one of Ogden's suitors when Murdoch asked him to investigate him; he also knows Murdoch's mannerisms rather well. While Brackenreid initially regards him as an idiot, over time, Crabtree proves adept at learning Murdoch's methods and eventually gains Brackenreid's respect and the possibility of promotion to detective.\n\nCrabtree dates a number of women over the years, but the relationships tend to be doomed by circumstances.  At the end of season 8 and the start of season 9, he proposes to Edna Brooks, but she learns she is not a widow\u2014and then her husband is murdered.  Fearing that Edna is guilty, Crabtree protects her by allowing himself to be prosecuted and convicted.  Consequently, he is not promoted, but demoted to Constable Third Class, after Murdoch finds the real killer.\n\nCrabtree often has ideas for commercial uses for Murdoch's inventions. Murdoch usually dismisses them as absurd, but they often prefigure real successful products. Crabtree also aspires to be a mystery novelist. His first novel, ''The Curse of the Pharaohs'', is published in season 5. (Concurrently with that season, ''Curse of the Lost Pharaohs'' also aired on Citytv.com as a mixed live action/animation [[web series]] dramatizing the plot of Crabtree's manuscript.)\n\nCrabtree revealed in one episode (\"Big Murderer on Campus\") that he did not know who his biological mother was and was left on the doorstep of a church and taken in by the family there. He was later re-united with his mother at the end of the episode after taking part in a plan to uncover the murderer of a professor. Crabtree also frequently refers to his many Aunts, each of whom seems to be named after a variety of flower. In the season 7 episode \"Republic of Murdoch\", it is revealed that these Aunts are, or at one time have been, prostitutes who live in a large house rented to them by the Reverend who became Crabtree's guardian after he was abandoned. Crabtree was raised in Newfoundland.\n\nIn season 3, it is revealed that Crabtree is a [[Freemasons|Freemason]], along with Brackenreid and turns out to be of higher rank than the inspector.\n{{Clear}}\n\nCrabtree also has a difficult time with a flighty socialite named Roger Newsome, whom he has numerous dealings with, to his irritation. His deepest cause for this enmity was when Newsome was assisting Crabtree on a case and at one point Crabtree was being attacked with deadly intent by a criminal. Rather than do anything to assist his police companion in mortal peril, Newsome abandoned him in blatant cowardice, and Crabtree required assistance from others. Newsome never adequately apologized for his failure and would meet the unforgiving Crabtree on numerous other occasions. However, when Newsome was murdered by a sniper to silence his testimony for a murder trial in the episode, \"Weekend at Murdoch's\", Crabtree was able to spare a bit of politeness for him under the circumstances.\n\n=== Dr. Emily Grace ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Emily Grace\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Murdoch of the Klondike]]\n| last               = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Double Life]]\n| portrayer          = [[Georgina Reilly]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Coroner\n| gender             = Female\n| title              = Doctor\n}}[[File:Georgina Reilly.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Georgina Reilly]]\nPortrayed by [[Georgina Reilly]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Georgina Reilly: Why I left Murdoch Mysteries|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2015/10/26/georgina-reilly-why-i-left-murdoch-mysteries/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> Emily Grace is the new coroner who joins the morgue in season 5 as Dr. Ogden leaves to set up her private practice. Initially described as Dr. Ogden's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9e]], Dr. Grace is a trained medical doctor but admits she prefers [[pathology]] because she has little patience to maintain a good bedside manner. She is interested in [[spiritualism]], believing that it is compatible with scientific study. Though eager and impatient, she quickly learns the rules of the station house and proves to be a highly competent coroner to Murdoch in his investigations.\n\nEmily later becomes a love interest for Constable Crabtree; they become good friends and she often enjoys his company and entertains his far-fetched theories with some enthusiasm. A tentative romance develops between them in season 6, but George breaks off their relationship after she kisses Leslie Garland, the brother of Julia Ogden's first husband Dr. Darcy Garland. After she ends things with Leslie, George is still quite distant with her, though they gradually become friends again. Emily joins the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement in season 8, becoming a strong advocate and encouraging Dr. Ogden to support them. Through the suffrage movement, Emily becomes acquainted with Lillian Moss and they eventually enter a romance. In season 8, Lillian Moss proposes to her to move to London and fight there for the women's suffrage. Though Lillian is murdered by the husband of her ex-lover, Emily still chooses to follow through with moving to London and finally leaves Toronto for London alone at the end of the episode 3, season 9 \"Double Life\".\n\n=== Rebecca James ===\n\n{{Infobox character\n| colour             = #DEDEE2\n| name               = Rebecca James\n| series             = [[Murdoch Mysteries]]\n| first              = [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#TV series|Barenaked Ladies]]\n| portrayer          = [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]] (TV series)\n| occupation         = Morgue Assistant\n| gender             = Female\n}}\nPortrayed by [[Mouna Traor\u00e9]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries' new kid on the block: Mouna Traor\u00e9|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2015/11/15/murdoch-mysteries-new-kid-on-the-block-mouna-traore/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Rebecca is a young woman of humble origins who has recently arrived in Toronto, living at the Junction, and working as an overnight cleaner for the city [[morgue]]. Dr. Ogden meets Rebecca on her first day back as the Chief Coroner, where Rebecca exhibits a genuine interest in anatomy that Dr. Ogden appreciates. Because she is [[African Canadian]], a number of people are unhappy with the attention that Dr. Ogden gives her. When Rebecca is dismissed from her position for removing evidence from the morgue for an experiment that provided evidence, Dr. Ogden hires her back as Morgue Assistant. It is revealed that Rebecca attended a year at the [[New York Medical College for Women]]. When her patron died, his son was less inclined to support her schooling so she had to leave. She eventually resumes her medical studies at the [[Women's College Hospital|Ontario Medical College for Women]] while working at the morgue, and her application to work at the City Morgue is officially granted at the end of Summer of '03.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Major recurring characters ==\n\n=== James Gillies ===\n\nJames Gillies, portrayed by [[Michael Seater]], is Detective William Murdoch's [[wiktionary:nemesis|nemesis]]. He is a cold, calculating, murderous criminal mastermind who hides behind a facade of cordiality. Gillies views his nefarious schemes as high-stakes games in which he and Murdoch match wits and, for which, there must be a clear winner and a loser. Priding himself on always being one step ahead of the detective, he often employs people as dispensable pawns to aid in his machinations, not hesitating to kill them when they no longer prove useful, to ensure their silence. During his first appearance, Gillies is shown to be a gifted student and teacher's assistant along with his friend and fellow teacher's assistant, Robert Perry. Murdoch eventually discovers that Gillies and Perry had murdered their [[physics]] professor, supposedly to test their knowledge of physics. Under pressure, Perry confesses to his involvement in the crime and implicates Gillies, after being tricked into believing that Gillies intended to kill him as well.\n\nGillies is arrested, convicted, and sentenced to death for his crimes; but he escapes from his execution and seeks revenge against Murdoch. Gillies kidnaps and buries Dr. Julia Ogden alive. Though Dr. Ogden is saved, Gillies escapes again. In his next act of revenge, Gillies frames Julia for the murder of her estranged husband, Dr. Darcy Garland. After capturing Murdoch, Gillies sets an elaborate trap to pressure Murdoch into choosing either his own life or that of the convicted Julia's. Though Murdoch chooses to save Julia, he is rescued, and Gillies is apprehended. Gillies is boarded on a train headed to Kingston where he is to be hanged for his crimes. While Gillies manages to escape from the train, Murdoch pursues him. After pinning Gillies down, Gillies distracts Murdoch with a kiss and jumps off a bridge, to escape. Despite an extensive [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] undertaken by the Toronto Constabulary, Gillies is nowhere to be found, and it seems likely he perished from his fall.\n\nAfter Gillies' fall, Julia begins receiving letters from someone claiming to be Gillies. The author of the letters threatens to kill Murdoch should Julia accept Murdoch's proposal for marriage or reveal the existence of the letters. Murdoch, Ogden, and Brackenreid begin investigating whether Gillies is alive, which results in finding what appears to be Gillies' body downriver from where he threw himself off the bridge. After Dr. Ogden and Dr. Emily Grace examine the badly decomposed body and perform a facial approximation on the skull, they and Murdoch believe the body to be Gillies'. The key piece of evidence suggesting the corpse is Gillies' is a bullet found embedded in its shoulder. Constable George Crabtree had shot Gillies in the shoulder, and the bullet was never removed. After careful examination, Murdoch ascertained the bullet to be the same that Crabtree shot Gillies with.\n\nYears later, a murderer is caught who claims to be possessed by the spirit of James Gillies. Murdoch and Dr. Ogden interrogate the man and coax information from him that leads them to realize that Gillies is alive, having faked his death by killing someone of similar appearance, embedding the bullet George Crabtree shot him with into the corpse's shoulder, and throwing the corpse in the river he jumped into. After giving a clue to the whereabouts of Gillies, the murderer kills himself. Ogden's autopsy of the murderer reveals a small wireless radio transceiver hidden in his body as well as an even smaller wireless electroacoustic transducer embedded in his skull\u2014both of which are soon after discovered to have been commissioned and implanted by Gillies. After following the clues to the address of a girl Gillies once kidnapped, he finds a talking doll whose message seems to suggest that Gillies has once again kidnapped Julia. Murdoch rushes to his home only to find Gillies instead holding Murdoch's young son hostage with a syringe filled with heroin. Gillies, who, as a result of his fall suffers from chronic pain and has a severely disfigured face, wants Murdoch, the man he most loves and respects, to kill him. Murdoch hesitates at first, desiring Gillies to receive punishment by the state, but then fires his gun at Gillies after Gillies threatens his son with the syringe. The gun, however, had been surreptitiously emptied of all but one bullet by Gillies sometime earlier, and doesn't fire. Gillies, given a renewed sense of purpose by his brush with death at the hands of his greatest adversary, still hovering over Murdoch's son with a [[syringe]], and seemingly back in control, taunts Murdoch, telling him that he looks forward to the fun they will have together. However, Murdoch slides out a [[sleeve gun]] and shoots Gillies with a rubber bullet, incapacitating him. Gillies is captured and finally hanged for his crimes. Dr. Ogden performs Gillies' autopsy and removes his brain so that it may be studied, as she promised him she'd do years before on the train.\n\n=== Dr. Llewellyn Francis ===\n\nDr. Francis, portrayed by [[Paul Rhys]], is a bad tempered pathologist from [[Scotland Yard]], who replaces Dr. Ogden who left for a job in [[Buffalo, New York]].<ref name=\"doc\">{{cite web |url=http://tvguide.ca/TVNews/articles/100728_murdoch_mysteries_spoilers_GD.htm |title='Murdoch' mysteries revealed |last=David |first=Greg |work=tvguide.ca |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706205827/http://tvguide.ca/TVNews/articles/100728_murdoch_mysteries_spoilers_GD.htm |archive-date=July 6, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He is portrayed as cold and often dismissive in his manner. His character always clashes with Murdoch.<ref name=\"alibi\">{{cite web|url=http://uktv.co.uk/alibi/homepage/sid/8089|title=Murdoch Mysteries|publisher=UKTV|accessdate=January 29, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt is revealed that Dr. Francis accepted the position in Toronto only because his wife's family resided in Canada and after a great deal of persuasion from Inspector Brackenreid.  Though he is a highly capable pathologist, the lack of trust between him and Murdoch result in frequent frustration.  When Murdoch goes behind Francis' back to approach Dr. Ogden for an analysis, Francis reluctantly confirms that Ogden's analysis is correct but is furious with how Murdoch continues to interfere and doubt Francis' professional abilities.  He eventually quits and returns to England.\n\n=== Constable Henry Higgins ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Lachlan Murdoch (actor)|Lachlan Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Murdoch Mysteries\u2019 sealed with a kiss|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2014/12/09/interview-murdoch-mysteries-sealed-with-a-kiss/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> Constable Henry Higgins is a police constable at Toronto's station house four. He frequently assists George Crabtree in investigations.\n\nHiggins is best known for doing his own thing when it comes to any sort of case or off duty business, ranging from locating a new kind of ice cream with George (Season 9 Episode 15, House of Industry) or watching boxing fights with Jackson (Season 8 Episode 3, Glory Days). It appears that he and George are best friends, and that he is somewhat of an assistant to him. Higgins has appeared in almost all the episodes.  Higgins was amongst the sceptical constables to whom Murdoch presented his Pneumograph (Season 1 Episode 8, Still Waters\").  Henry was also one of the three who contributed to the purchase of the motor car between himself, George and Jackson in Murdoch Takes Manhattan.\n\nHenry is prone to making frequent mistakes in episodes, but usually has a redeeming moment towards the end. Detective Murdoch has taught Henry how to correctly make shoe impressions in the mud in Child's Play after Henry messes up three footprints beforehand, having no clue how to do them exactly.  When Prince Alfred visited Toronto and Constable George Crabtree was assigned to his security, Higgins assisted Detective William Murdoch with an investigation into the murder of Maggie Gilpatrick. Murdoch taught Higgins about fingermarks and how to trace a person's next of kin. When it was determined there was a plot to kidnap Prince Alfred, Higgins was selected to impersonate the prince to help safeguard His Highness (Season 1, Episode 12, The Prince and the Rebel).  However, Higgins also tends to let words slip out of his mouth before thinking about them, but means no harm. Such an example of this is during Unlucky in Love (Season 9 Episode 12) when Higgins accidentally insults Baby Roland Connor when Detective Murdoch is worried about Roland not walking yet and suggest that 'Maybe he's just slow.'which annoys Murdoch. Higgins later apologizes sincerely for this though, never meaning to speak ill of Murdoch's son. Nevertheless, Henry has proven himself to be good with young children, during this episode as well as \"Raised on Robbery\" (Season 9 Episode 9).\n\nGrowing up, Higgins family owned a piano shop. He did not enjoy playing, but he loved all of the parts. (Season 7 Episode 17, \"Blast of Silence\") It's also known that Henry's mother is from the Gasp\u00e9 in Quebec, and he knows how to speak a bit of French as shown in \"Convalescence and Monsieur Murdoch\". Higgins has a homosexual cousin and so was aware of the secret gay club where homosexual men gathered in Toronto (Season 1 Episode 5, \"'Til Death Do Us Part\").\n\nIn \"War on Terror\" (Season 5 Episode 4), Henry is caught in an explosion along with George and is rendered unconscious, resulting in George attempting to find the culprit behind the bombing of Milne's store. The bomber is caught, and Higgins returns to the station house having been hospitalized for the majority of the episode. In the beginning of Season 10, (Season 10 Episode 1, Great Balls of Fire, Part 1) Higgins picks up smoking cigars, but whether this was just to impress the Inspector or not is unknown, as we're never shown him smoking again after.\n\nAt the end of the Season 10 finale (Season 10 Episode 18, Hell to Pay), along with Constable George Crabtree and Constable Slugger Jackson, Henry is caught in an ambush; all are shot and possibly murdered.\n\nIn Season 11, Higgins begins courting Ruth Newsome (of the Mimico Newsomes), sister of Roger Newsome, who was involved in several of Murdoch's investigations. In Episode 11 (\"Biffers and Blockers\"), Higgins has taken up cricket and also engaged a butler, at Ruth's suggestion, part of his transformation to join the upper class. In Episode 12 (\"Mary Wept\"), Henry attempts to propose to Ruth but is interrupted when a body falls from a bell tower and lands just behind him, traumatizing Ruth. Ruth later proposes to Henry herself and is accepted.\n\n=== Margaret Brackenreid ===\n\nMargaret, portrayed by [[Arwen Humphreys]], is married to Inspector Thomas Brackenreid and together they have two young boys. Margaret is a very passionate woman, who is always very determined in everything she does. Thomas Brackenreid had just come out of the army when Margaret's father asked him to join the family's plumbing business. Margaret thought he'd have been a good plumber, but his heart was set on the police force. Married to a policeman, she knew what she was getting into, no point in complaining about the long hours \u2013 and the worry. But still... after they had two sons, Margaret does worry about her husband's safety due to his career as a police officer. Margaret does not like the opera but instead enjoys classical music on their gramophone. She is a good cook, bakes her own bread, and is noted for her excellent plum pudding at Christmas by Murdoch.\nShe is involved in the [[temperance movement]] for a period, and once becomes suspicious of her husband's relationship with an opera singer, but is typically portrayed as a loyal and loving partner. Brackenreid has stated he met Margaret when he was a beat cop and he arrested her for causing a disturbance. She and Thomas have two children, John and Bobby. John, the elder son, would go on to become a Constable under his father at station house four much to his mother's chagrin.<ref name=\"alibi\"/>\nIn [[List of Murdoch Mysteries episodes#Season 9 (2015\u201316)|season 9]], episode 13, ''Unlucky in Love'', Margaret Brackenreid has started a [[Wedding planner]] business.\n\n=== Nina Bloom ===\n\nNina, portrayed by [[Erin Agostino]], is the most popular burlesque dancer at the infamous Star Room. Nina doesn't much care what people think of her because her reputation is not who she is. She doesn't dance at the burlesque to snag a husband. She enjoys it and won't deny herself the things that bring her pleasure, and that includes George. George and Nina's relationship continues to be both challenging and challenged in Season 10 and by the end of Season 11, Nina leaves Toronto for her dream job in Paris.\n\n=== Louise Cherry ===\n\nLouise, portrayed by [[Bea Santos]], is a journalist for the Toronto Gazette. She is tenacious and very clever. Louise is a woman who doesn't take 'no' for an answer. In season 11, Louise Cherry taken to the Station House No. 4 cells for impersonating the Mercy Killer by fabricating letters from the murderer published the Toronto Gazette. Later, she has been hired by another paper, ''The Toronto Telegraph''. She received a visit from the editor of the Toronto Telegraph while locked up in jail. His offer is quite generous, her title and wages significantly more substantial than at the Gazette. She'll team up with the Detective Watts in a criminal investigation.\n\n=== James and Sally Pendrick ===\n\n[[File:Peter Stebbings.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Peter Stebbings]]\nJames Pendrick (portrayed by [[Peter Stebbings]])<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reserved.|first1=.

The Pendricks are advocates of [[eugenics]]. James is an engineer and inventor. They own Rembrandt's painting ''[[Bathsheba at Her Bath]]'', valued around $40 000, which is stolen in an episode in Season 3. Sally is an advocate of modern art, and gives Murdoch an avant-garde nude portrait of herself. The Pendrick family played a big part in the plot over the 2nd part of season 3.<ref name=\"alibi\"/> Indeed, James Pendrick was suspected by Murdoch of murder, or of being an accomplice to various crimes, in 4 of the 5 cases in which he was involved, much to Pendrick's annoyance. In the last episode of Season 3, Sally Pendrick is revealed to be a criminal from upstate New York, stealing her husband's fortune, and investing in the development of a doomsday weapon.\n\nJames Pendrick reappears in later seasons with various new inventions. Sally escaped justice at the end of Season 3, and her whereabouts are unknown.\n\n=== Dr. Darcy Garland ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jonathan Watton]],<ref>{{cite web|title='Murdoch Mysteries' Next Season: Everything You Need To Know|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/09/27/murdoch-mysteries-season-7-preview_n_4004130.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> the husband of Dr. Julia Ogden. He does, in fact, get along just fine with Detective William Murdoch. At the end of Season 5, Julia and Darcy part ways because she realizes she is with the wrong person. However, part way into Season 6, Darcy has second thoughts on separating from Julia and tears up their divorce papers. In episode \"Lovers in a Murderous Time\", Murdoch spots Darcy with his own mistress. Initially confronting him, Murdoch is goaded into punching him. In episode \"Crime and Punishment\", Darcy is murdered and Julia is implicated in his death.\n\n=== Leslie Garland ===\n\n[[File:Giacomo Gianniotti 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|100px|right|Giacomo Gianniotti]]\nPortrayed by [[Giacomo Gianniotti]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rideout|first1=T.

Despite appearing cordial towards both Julia and Murdoch, he actually blames them for his brother's death and resents them.  Previously a law student, Murdoch learns that Leslie was expelled from university.  He remains in Toronto, working as a gardener.  During his stay, he is formally introduced to Emily Grace and they form a connection over shared interests.  He briefly competes with George over the affections for Dr. Grace, eventually winning her over after George breaks up with her due to a misunderstanding.  However, Dr. Grace later learns that Leslie is behind a series of threatening letters addressed to Julia from the long-dead James Gillies as a form of revenge on Dr. Ogden and Murdoch.  Emily breaks up with him soon afterward and reveals the truth to Dr. Ogden, who furiously expels Leslie from Darcy's home and states her intention to sell Darcy's estate.\n\n=== Lillian Moss ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Sara Mitich]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Rising Star: Exclusive Interview with The Expanse\u2019s Sara Mitich|url=https://talknerdywithus.com/2016/01/07/rising-star-exclusive-interview-with-the-expanses-sara-mitich/|website=talknerdywithus.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=January 7, 2016}}</ref> Lillian Moss is a [[suffragist]], whom Emily Grace comes to know through their mutual support of women's rights. Because she refused to marry a man chosen by her family, she was disowned. It is revealed early on that Lillian is a [[lesbian]] and is extremely attracted to Dr. Grace. Emily's feelings towards Lillian remained ambiguous until \"Toronto's Girl Problem\", when Emily and Lillian begin a passionate romance. However, soon after Lillian convinces Emily to join her in London to pursue the suffragist cause, Lillian is murdered.\n\nAfter her death, Lillian's true identity is revealed to be Helen Walker. When Helen's affair with a married woman, Gladys, was discovered by Gladys' husband, Joe, the women were lured onto a boat, where Joe attempted to kill Helen. With the attempt was thwarted by Gladys, the women tossed Joe overboard, leaving him for dead, and staged a boating accident that left Helen the sole survivor because they knew the police would not believe their version of what had occurred. Despite Helen's insistence that they separate, Gladys pursued her to Toronto, where Helen had become Lillian Moss and had fallen in love with Emily Grace. When Joe, having secretly survived the attempt on his life, confronted Lillian to learn Gladys' whereabouts, he killed Lillian when she refused to reveal where Gladys had gone.\n\n=== Eva Pearce ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Daiva Johnston]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries' Season 9 end and what's to come in Season 10|url=http://www.tv-eh.com/2016/03/21/murdoch-mysteries-season-9-end-and-whats-to-come-in-season-10/|website=tv-eh.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=March 22, 2016}}</ref> Eva Pearce becomes Murdoch's nemesis, a white collar thief, kidnapper, and killer. She was deadly, manipulative, and cautious, making her a dangerous opponent of William Murdoch.\n\nIn her first appearance, Eva is introduced as a shop girl in the prestigious T. Eaton Co. department store where someone has been murdered. She flirts with Murdoch, who is unaware of her attentions until Dr. Ogden points it out to him. She is revealed to be responsible for causing murders by manipulating men that she seduces. Though Murdoch thwarts her plans to court a wealthy man, she gets away and manages to attract another suitor. She subsequently takes on the identity of [[Cassie Chadwick]], claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of [[Andrew Carnegie]], and manages to become the fianc\u00e9e of Ian Worthington, president of the Canadian Bank. Her scheme to marry Worthington and force him to take on her debts fails when Murdoch exposes her true identity and she is arrested. Eva is later sent to an insane asylum, where she and other female \"lunatics\" such as Mrs. Lynd, Rose Maxwell, and Charlotte, as well as a murderess named Hannah, concoct an escape plan. Eva is the only one who manages to escape, securing her freedom by tricking a man into giving her a cab ride.  Presumably she will continue to con men into getting what she wants. In her final appearance, the mentally unstable Eva attempts to kill Julia and kidnaps Murdoch, with the intention of forcing herself on him to \"give him the child he has always wanted\" as she has become obsessed and delusional with him. She is ultimately unsuccessful, and while in a confrontation with Julia, bleeds to death after Julia manages to stab her in the throat.\n\n=== Detective Llewellyn Watts ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Daniel Maslany]], Llewellyn Watts is a detective from station house 1 who is brought to station house 4 to re-examine a case where new evidence has arisen where a man sent to prison by Murdoch could be exonerated.  When Inspector Brackenreid leaves station house four to accompany James Pendrick to Panama, Watts is brought back to station house four as the station detective while Murdoch serves as the acting inspector. While working at station house four, Detective Watts becomes involved in an ongoing missing persons cases, assisted by Constable Slugger Jackson, which eventually leads Watts to his long-missing older sister, who abandoned him when he was a child (their parents were dead, and she just saw him as a burden).  After Inspector Brackenreid's return, Watts remains working with station house 4.  In \"Murdoch Schmurdoch\" (season 11, episode 15), while investigating the murder of a Jewish man, Watts recognises a [[Jewish]] lullaby as the same one as the one his late mother used to sing to him; he's told that, if his mother was Jewish, then he's Jewish, too (apparently, his family's original name was 'Wattsenburg', but his parents changed it when they [[Immigration|immigrated]] to Canada).\n\nCompared to Murdoch, Watts prefers performing his investigations outdoors and on the streets.  He is extremely well-read and philosophical, approaching his cases with objective analytical logic in the vein of [[Sherlock Holmes]]. He can be difficult to work with because he tends to speak with little regards to social graces and voices his thought processes aloud and unfiltered.\n\nWatts' eccentric body language and speech patterns are reminiscent of famous Canadian pianist and personality [[Glenn Gould]].\n\n== Minor recurring characters ==\n\n=== Harry Murdoch (Harry Smith) ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Stephen McHattie]], he is the father of Detective William Murdoch. When Murdoch meets his father for the first time after a long estrangement (episode: 1.06 - Let Loose The Dogs), for most of the case, he believes his father to be a killer and primary suspect based on his own prejudice that Harry had indirectly caused his mother's death by hitting her; after his innocence was proven, at William's request his father tells him that, as flawed and a drunk as he may have been, he never hit either his mother or him. Harry leaves Toronto, telling his son that he has plans to settle in the West. Murdoch later goes to [[British Columbia]] to investigate a case with a fellow Mounted Policeman (episode: 2.13 - Anything I Can Do), where he meets up with his father. His father reveals to William that he has a half-brother. Harry only found out about this son in the past five years. Harry also explained why his other son believes his name is \"Smith\". In season 12 Harry Murdoch was killed due to his involvement in the kidnapping of an infant child 30 years earlier.\n\n=== Terrance Meyers ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Peter Keleghan]],<ref>{{cite web|title=What I'm watching: Peter Keleghan|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/television/what-im-watching-peter-keleghan/article566626/|website=theglobeandmail.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> he appears in twelve episodes, once in each of the series' twelve seasons. He worked for [[Rouge Valley]] Lands Ltd. in the final episode of Season 1. The company planned to dam the Rouge River and create an electrical station. He also worked for the government in a high-level position, forcing Murdoch to pull off a case, making it Murdoch's third unsolved case. Terrance appeared in episode 7 of Season 4. like '''his''' boss Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]], he is very much disliked by station house four and always shows up at the most suspicious times. Most of his projects revolve around ensuring Canada receives air superiority. In Season 5, he and Murdoch infiltrate a visiting [[anarchist]] organization, following a bombing that took place in the streets of Toronto. In Season 6, Meyers attempted to appropriate an airplane before its inventor, James Pendrick, pushed it into [[Niagara Falls]]. Meyers also appeared in Season 7, where he first claimed to be assigned to assisting the U.S. in tracking down an anarchist cell.  In season 8, episode 17, Meyers adds to the confusion over a corpse's identity by claiming that the man was one of his secret agents.\n\n=== Constable Augustus Jackson ===\n\n[[File:Kristian Bruun by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Kristian Bruun]]\nPortrayed by [[Kristian Bruun]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Murdoch Mysteries: A Merry Murdoch Christmas - Holiday Guide|url=http://www.cbc.ca/holidayguide/schedule/view/murdoch-mysteries-a-merry-murdoch-christmas|website=www.cbc.ca|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> Constable Augustus \"Gus\" Jackson first appeared in season 5 as a baseball player for station house five and was nicknamed \"Slugger\" for his impressive athletic abilities. He later appeared as a constable for station house four in season 6 and became a recurring character beginning in season 7. He would occasionally join Crabtree and Higgins during investigations. During Detective Watts' missing women investigation for station house four, Jackson reveals that he had a wife who died in his arms from [[dropsy]] and encourages Watts not to give up for the sake of other women. In the finale of season 10, Jackson, Higgins, and Crabtree walk into a trap set by Chief Inspector Davis, at the orders of the ruthless businessman Robert Graham; the three constables are all shot by Graham's men. When they are found by Detective Watts, Jackson is taken to the hospital with Higgins, though Jackson succumbs to his wounds. His funeral occurs at the beginning of season 11; when the constables attempt to place his portrait at the station house to honour him, corrupt councilman Franklin Williams takes it down. When station house four returns to control of Inspector Brackenreid, he restores the portrait of Jackson and he, Crabtree, and Higgins, drink in honour of their fallen comrade.\n\n=== Reginald Poundsett ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jeff Douglas]], he was Dr. Julia Ogden's boyfriend throughout episode 12 (Werewolves) and the finale episode 13 (Anything I Can Do). These dates occurred when Murdoch was dating Enid Jones. It was believed that Dr. Ogden was seeing Reginald Poundsett only to make Detective William Murdoch jealous.\n\n=== Nikola Tesla ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Dmitry Chepovetsky]]. The famous inventor, [[Nikola Tesla]], helps Murdoch solve the case in the very first episode. He really likes inventing things and improving things as he was working on transmitting wireless phone calls throughout the episode. Later in the episode he feels that his work will not make him rich, so he explores new options. He reappears in a later episode.<ref name=\"alibi6\">{{cite web|url=http://murdochmysteries.tumblr.com/|title=Murdoch Mysteries|website=uktv.co.uk|accessdate=March 11, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHe re-appears in season 13, episode 11, \"Staring Blindly Into the Future\".\n\n=== Arthur Conan Doyle ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Geraint Wyn Davies]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geraint Wyn Davies - The Arthur Conan Doyle Encyclopedia|url=https://www.arthur-conan-doyle.com/index.php?title=Geraint_Wyn_Davies|website=www.arthur-conan-doyle.com|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}</ref> He follows Murdoch, trying to get a grasp on detective work for a future book and personal detective skills. He refers to Murdoch and himself as \"similar people\", because of their fathers both being alcoholics. He appeared in season 6 to help with the matter of a man with a personality disorder that led him to believe he was Sherlock Holmes. Because [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] is the creator and authority on Sherlock Holmes he was brought to assist the detectives in tricking the man into revealing his true self. However, to Doyle's surprise, the man was an impeccable likeness to his character, offering all logical answers to his questions. Doyle even asked him how \"Sherlock Holmes\" could've survived his death at the Reichenbach Falls, as there was no footprints leading away from the cliff, but the man replies he retraced his own footprints. Doyle is startled and admits that's a good idea. It is suggested that the man gave the ideas that made it possible for Doyle to bring his character back to life.\n\n=== Sarah Pensell ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Maria del Mar (actress)|Maria del Mar]], a spiritualist medium who helps Murdoch with his case (Season One, episode 4, ''Elementary, My Dear Murdoch''). Originally Murdoch did not trust her, but bad luck with his case caused him to change his mind and ask Ms. Pensell for help.

She tells Dr. Ogden to not let Murdoch slip away from her.<ref name=\"alibi\"/>\n\n=== Dr. Isaac Tash ===\n\nA doctor known for having an illegal abortionist business. He is a friend of Julia Ogden, having known her since their medical school days.  When Julia went to him for an abortion due to a relationship she had with another man, he refused due to personal and legal reasons.  When Julia almost died as a result of his decision, Isaac resolved never to allow another woman suffer as his friend did and has performed abortions in order to save the lives of other women.  Due to Isaac being aware of Julia's abortion and his decision to keep it a secret, Murdoch misinterprets Isaac and Julia's relationship as romantic.  Appears throughout the series twice.<ref name=\"alibi\"/>\n\n=== Anna Fulford ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Lisa Faulkner]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lisa Faulkner: Life as I know it|url=http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/158806/Lisa-Faulkner-Life-as-I-know-it|website=express.co.uk|accessdate=September 30, 2016|date=February 17, 2010}}</ref> Murdoch's former love from Bristol, England, during season 3. She also appears in season 4, where it is revealed that she is engaged to another man. Murdoch later finds out that her fianc\u00e9 was a member of the [[Black Hand (extortion)|Black Hand]], a criminal organization and forerunner of the Mafia, who chose to elope with Anna with the counterfeit money he was smuggling. This forced the Black Hand to kill him and put a hit on Anna, assuming she was complicit. This causes Anna to change her name. Murdoch later finds her working in a library where one of Anna's colleagues was murdered. Murdoch fears for her safety because the Black Hand still has a price on her head. By the end of the two-part episode, Murdoch fakes Anna's death, so the Black Hand would stop chasing her.\n\n=== Mick O'Shea ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jonathan Llyr]]. A Toronto dock worker, strongly dislikes Inspector Brackenreid to the point where he brutally beats him in an episode in season seven. He dies in a later episode.\n\n=== Freddie Pink ===\n\nPortrayed by [[Alex Paxton-Beesley]], Winifred \"Freddie\" Pink is a private detective in Montreal.  She first met Murdoch when they were children as Governor General Young Scholars, where they were rivals.  Tough and capable of protecting herself, she possesses a keen eye and mind, but little regard for her own personal safety.  Freddie and Murdoch meet again as adults years later, when Murdoch is investigating a murder in Montreal and Freddie is investigating a divorce case.  Realizing the common denominator between the cases was their attendance at the same camp, they work together to solve the murder.  She later establishes her private detective business in Toronto, where Julia approaches her to investigate the actual parentage of the Murdochs' adopted son, Roland.\n\n=== Dr. Roberts ===\n\nDr. Roberts is a practicing psychiatrist who assists William Murdoch on a number of cases, first introduced in Season 2, played by [[Paul Amos]]. Dr. Roberts, who was recently removed from his position at the Provincial Lunatic Asylum because his research on the workings of the criminal mind ruffled too many feathers. He is quite forward-thinking and is practicing at a private hospital in Etobicoke, the Toronto Hospital for the Incurables.\n\nIn \"Twentieth Century Murdoch\", Murdoch and the station were baffled by a supposed time machine and he consulted with Dr. Roberts on the psychiatric nature of those holding it. Dr. Roberts dropped his glass, cutting himself, and his hand trembles.\n\nLater, George discovered it was Dr. Roberts who planted the fake Santa suit with the finger mark to prove it. Leaving to arrest him, they instead discover that Dr. Roberts was frozen by his stepbrother as he had been dying from a genetic disease. He hypnotized Murdoch into believing he had travelled in time, along with the other people who entered the \"time machine\". Unsure of what to do, the policemen leave him as he is, and Dr. Roberts is left in his sleeping state.\n\n== Minor recurring police officers ==\n\n=== Chief Constable Stockton ===\n\nThe Chief Constable who once offered Murdoch a promotion to inspector, but decides not to give him the job because Murdoch is Catholic. Inspector Brackenreid is ordered to tell Murdoch he can't have the job, but the Inspector instead convinces Murdoch to decline the job.<ref name=\"alibi\"/> Stockton retires from the Toronto Constabulary sometime in late 1898, and is replaced by Percival Giles.\n\n=== Constable Worseley ===\n\nPlayed by Sean Harraher, Worseley is an older constable, with red hair and beard, who often appears when a group of constables are assigned to a task. First listed in credits in \"Blood and Circuses\".

The Chief of police, he succeeded Chief Constable Stockton. He believed that Murdoch set a prisoner free in season 4 episode 13, \"Murdoch in Wonderland\"; in the season 5 episode 1, \"Murdoch of the Klondike\", Brackenreid covered for Murdoch with the story of a faulty lock. Chief Constable Giles did not believe this story but because he did not have any evidence, he could not arrest Murdoch. However, because of that, in a number of episodes in season 5, Chief Constable Giles seemed to have something personally against Murdoch and was always against anything that Murdoch said in any episode that had both Chief Constable Giles and Murdoch. The storyline with Chief Constable Giles personally hating Murdoch was dropped from the program, and because of that in season 6 episode 6, \"Murdoch and the Cloud of Doom\", when somebody threatened Toronto with a deadly toxic gas, Chief Constable Giles personally asked Murdoch to find the person. In season 6 episode 12, \"Crime & Punishment\" he arrested Dr. Ogden for the murder of her husband Dr. Darcy Garland and suspended both Murdoch and Brackenreid, but when they secretly continued their investigation, he reinstated them. In season 8, episode 7, Giles admits to being homosexual, regarding which another constable years prior had tried to blackmail him. Constable Hodge (see below) killed the attempted blackmailer; Hodge and Giles covered up the killing but Murdoch unravelled the story when a body was found in the basement of station house four, ending the careers of both and sending them to prison.  In season 9, episode 1, Giles, now behind bars at the Don Jail, assists Crabtree and Murdoch in finding the killer of another inmate and thereby helping clear Crabtree of his own charge of murder.\n\n=== Constable John Hodge ===\n\nA constable seen around District 4 Department but who was not given a name until season 4 episode 1, \"All Tattered and Torn\", when Detective Malcolm Lamb returns to the station. Constable Hodge was discovered to have accidentally killed a constable to prevent Chief Constable Giles, a detective at the time, from being blackmailed. He was tried for manslaughter and imprisoned. Eventually released from prison.\n\n== Historical figures ==\n\nSeveral additional historical figures have been presented in the series.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=35em|\n\n* [[Alexander Graham Bell]] (John Tench)\n* [[Joseph-Elz\u00e9ar Bernier]] ([[R\u00e9my Girard]])\n* [[Andrew Carnegie]] ([[Philip Craig (actor)|Philip Craig]])\n* [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Thomas Howes (actor)|Thomas Howes]])\n* [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] ([[Nicholas Campbell]])\n* [[Leon Czolgosz]] (Goran Stjepanovic)\n* [[Thomas Edison]] ([[David Storch]])\n* [[Reginald Fessenden]] (William Matthews)\n* [[W.C.

For example, the YAS-21 student-grade alto saxophone of the 1970s was superseded by the YAS-23 and YAS-25 saxophones during the 1990s. When manufacture of the YAS-23 and YAS-25 ended they were superseded by the YAS-275, which was in production as of 2010, but was eventually replaced by the YAS-280.\n\n==Musical

Sabbatai seems to have chosen the latter by donning from then on a Turkish [[turban]]. He was then also rewarded by the heads of the Ottoman state with a generous pension for his compliance with their political and religious plans.<ref>Scholem, ''op cit.'', pp. 678\u2013681; Scholem, Gershom. \"Shabbetai Zevi.\" Encyclopaedia Judaica, pp. 348\u2013350</ref> Some of his followers also converted to Islam\u2014about 300 families who were known as the [[D\u00f6nmeh]] (converts).<ref name=\"tnr.com\">[http://www.tnr.com/book/review/the-other-secret-jews Adam Kirsch, \"The Other Secret Jews\", review of Marc David Baer, ''The D\u00f6nme: Jewish Converts, Muslim Revolutionaries, and Secular Turks''], ''The New Republic'', 15 Feb 2010, accessed 20 Feb 2010</ref> As the Ottomans tired of his schemes, he was banished twice, first to [[Constantinople]] and, when he was discovered singing [[psalms]] with the Jews, to a small town known today as [[Ulcinj]] in present-day [[Montenegro]].

His name literally meant the planet [[Saturn]], and in Jewish tradition \"The reign of Sabbatai\" (The highest planet) was often linked to the advent of the [[Messiah]].<ref>The mixed multitude:Jacob Frank and the Frankist movement, Pawel Maciejko, University of Pennsylvania Press, Mar 8, 2011, Page 45.</ref> Zevi's family were [[Romaniotes]] from [[Patras]] in present-day [[Greece]]; his father, Mordecai, was a [[poultry]] dealer in the [[Morea]].

Mordecai became the Smyrna agent of an English trading house and managed to achieve some wealth in this role.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\">{{Jewish Encyclopedia|article=SHABBETHAI \u1e92EBI B.

He attended a ''[[yeshiva]]'' under the rabbi of [[Smyrna]], [[Joseph Escapa]]. Studies in ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) did not appeal to him, but apparently Zevi did attain proficiency in the Talmud. On the other hand, he was fascinated by [[mysticism]] and the [[Kabbalah]], as influenced by [[Isaac Luria]]. He found the [[practical Kabbalah]] \u2013 with its [[ascetic]]ism, through which its devotees claimed to be able to communicate with God and the [[angel]]s, to [[prediction|predict the future]] and to perform all sorts of [[miracle]]s \u2013 especially appealing.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> He read the [[Zohar]], in addition to Luria's writings, and practiced asceticism and purification exercises called ''[[tikkunim]]''.<ref name=wigoder/>\n\n==Personal history==\n\n===Influence of English millenarianism===\nDuring the first half of the 17th century, [[millenarianism|millenarian]] ideas of the approach of the [[Messiah|Messianic]] time were popular. They included ideas of the [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] of the Jews and their return to the [[land of Israel]], with independent sovereignty. The [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] year was identified by Christian authors as 1666 and millenarianism was widespread in England. This belief was so prevalent that [[Manasseh ben Israel]], in his letter to [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Rump Parliament]], appealed to it as a reason to re-admit Jews into [[England]], saying, \"[T]he opinions of many Christians and mine do concur herein, that we both believe that the restoring time of our Nation into their native country is very near at hand.\"<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&letter=S#1742, \"SHABBETHAI \u1e92EBI B.

Sabbatai could have learned something about these Western millenarian expectations at his father's house.<ref>This theory was originally suggested by [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]]; [[Gershom Scholem]] argued forcefully against it in his major work on Sabbatai quoted throughout this entry.</ref> The more precise extensions of the overall combined influence of English/Dutch Calvinist millenarianism within the messianic movement that developed around Zevi's activities is still being studied and assessed by scholars.<ref>Heyd, Michael, \u201cThe \u2018Jewish Quaker\u2019: Christian Perceptions of Shabbatai Zevi as an Enthusiast,\u201d in Coudert, Allison and Jeffrey Shoulson, eds., ''Hebraica Veritas? Christian Hebraists, Jews, and the Study of Judaism in Early Modern Europe'', Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004, pp. 234-265.</ref>\n\n===Claims of messiahship===\nApart from this general Messianic theory, there was another computation, based on an interpreted passage in the ''[[Zohar]]'' (a famous Jewish mystical text), and particularly popular among the Jews, according to which the year 1648 was to be the year of [[Israelite|Israel's]] redemption by their long-awaited [[Jewish Messiah]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nAt age 22 in 1648, Sabbatai started declaring to his followers in Smyrna that he was the true Messianic redeemer. In order to prove this claim he started to pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]], an act which Judaism emphatically prohibited to all but the Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. For scholars acquainted with [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical]], and kabbalistic literature, the act was highly symbolic. He would also claim that he could fly, but explained to his beholders that he couldn't do so in public because they were 'not worthy enough' to witness the sight. So too, he declared regularly that he was having various visions of God.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abramson |first1=Dr. Henry |title=Who was Shabbetai Tsvi? |url=https://henryabramson.com/2012/02/02/shabbetai-tsvi-false-messiah/ |website=www.henryabramson.com/2012/02/02/shabbetai-tsvi-false-messiah/}}</ref> He revealed his Messiahship early on to [[Isaac Silveyra]] and [[Moses Pinheiro]], the latter a brother-in-law of the Italian rabbi and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Joseph Ergas]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nHowever, at this point he was still relatively young to be thought of as an accepted and established rabbinic authority; and his influence in the local community was not widespread. Even though Sabbatai had led the pious life of a mystic in Smyrna for several years, the older and more established rabbinic leadership was still suspicious of his activities. The local college of rabbis, headed by his teacher, [[Joseph Escapa]], kept a watchful eye on him. When his Messianic pretensions became too bold, they put him and his followers under ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'', a type of [[excommunication]] in [[Judaism]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nAbout the year 1651 (according to others, 1654), the rabbis banished Sabbatai and his disciples from Smyrna. It is not certain where he went from there. By 1658, he was in [[Constantinople]], where he met a preacher, [[Abraham Yachini]] (a disciple of [[Joseph di Trani]]), who confirmed Sabbatai's messianic mission. [[Abraham Yachini|Yachini]] is said to have forged a manuscript in archaic characters which, he alleged, bore testimony to Sabbatai's Messiahship.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> It was entitled \"The Great Wisdom of Solomon\", and began:\n<blockquote>\n\"I, Abraham, was confined in a cave for forty years, and I wondered greatly that the time of miracles did not arrive. Then was heard a voice proclaiming, 'A son will be born in the Hebrew year 5386 <nowiki>[</nowiki>the year 1626 CE<nowiki>]</nowiki> to Mordecai Zevi; and he will be called Shabbethai. He will humble the great dragon; ... he, the true Messiah, will sit upon My throne.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/></blockquote>\n\n===In Salonica, Cairo, and Jerusalem===\n[[File:20121020 exterior of Yeni Mosque Thessaloniki Greece.jpg|thumb|''[[New Mosque (Thessaloniki)|New Mosque]]'', built by Donmeh community of [[Salonica]] during the Ottoman period.]]\n\nWith this document, Sabbatai chose [[Salonica]], at that time a center of kabbalists, for his base. He proclaimed himself the Messiah or \"anointed one,\" gaining many adherents. He put on all sorts of mystical events\u2014e.g., the celebration of his marriage as the \"One Without End\" (the ''[[Ein Sof]]'') with the [[Torah]], preparing a solemn festival to which he invited his friends. The rabbis of Salonica, headed by Rabbi Hiyya Abraham Di Boton, banished him from the city. The sources differ widely as to the route he took after this expulsion, with [[Alexandria]], [[Athens]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], and Smyrna mentioned as temporary centers. After wandering, he settled in [[Cairo]], where he resided for about two years (1660\u20131662).<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\n[[Raphael Joseph Halabi]] (\"of [[Aleppo]]\") was a wealthy and influential Jew who held the high position of mint-master and [[Tax farming|tax-farmer]] in Cairo under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government. He led an ascetic life, which included fasting, bathing in cold water, and [[scourging]] his body at night. He used his great wealth for charity, supporting poor Talmudists and Kabbalists, fifty of whom reportedly dined at his table regularly. Sabbatai befriended Raphael Joseph, who became a supporter and promoter of his Messianic claims.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nAbout 1663 Sabbatai moved on to Jerusalem. Here he resumed his former ascetic practice of frequent fasting and other penances. Many saw this as proof of his extraordinary [[piety]]. He was said to have a good voice, and sang [[psalms]] all night long, or at times [[Spanish language|Spanish]] love-songs, to which he gave mystical interpretations. He attracted crowds of listeners. At other times he prayed and cried at the graves of pious men and women. He distributed [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] to children on the streets. Gradually he gathered a circle of adherents.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nThe important community of Jerusalem at the time was also in need of money to keep up with the heavy taxes imposed on it by the Ottoman government. The community was coming up short of funds to pay these levies, and these arrears could have dire consequences. Sabbatai, known as the favorite of the rich and powerful Raphael Joseph Halabi in the Turkish government center in Cairo, was chosen as the community envoy to appeal to Halabi for money and support. His success in getting the funds to pay off the Turks raised his prestige. His followers dated his public career from this journey to Cairo.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\n===Marriage to Sarah===\nAnother event helped spread Sabbatai's fame in the Jewish world of the time in the course of his second stay in Cairo. During the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki massacres]] in [[Poland]], a Jewish orphan girl named Sarah, about six years old, was found by Christians and sent to a [[convent]] for care. After ten years, she escaped (through a miracle she claimed), and made her way to [[Amsterdam]]. Some years later she went to [[Livorno]] where, according to reports, she led a life of [[prostitution]]. She also conceived the notion that she was to become the bride of the Messiah, who was soon to appear.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nWhen the report of Sarah's adventures reached Cairo, Sabbatai claimed that such a consort had been promised to him in a dream because he, as the Messiah, was bound to fall in love with an unchaste woman. He reportedly sent messengers to Livorno to bring Sarah to him, and they were married at Halabi's house. Her beauty and eccentricity reportedly helped him gain new followers. Through her a new romantic and licentious element entered Sabbatai's career. Even the overturning of her past scandalous life was seen by Sabbatai's followers as additional confirmation of his messiahship, following the biblical story of the prophet [[Hosea]], who had also been commanded to take a \"wife of whoredom\" as the first symbolic act of his calling.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Nathan of Gaza===\n{{Main|Nathan of Gaza}}\n\nWith Halabi's financial and political backing, a charming wife, and many additional followers, Sabbatai triumphantly returned to [[Jerusalem]]. Passing through the city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which at the time had an important Jewish community, he met Nathan Benjamin Levi, known since as [[Nathan of Gaza]] (\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05e2\u05d6\u05ea\u05d9 ''Nathan 'Azzati''). Nathan became very active in Sabbatai's subsequent Messianic career, serving as Sabbatai's right-hand man and declaring himself to be the risen [[Elijah]], who, it was predicted, would proclaim the arrival of the Messiah. In 1665, Nathan announced that the Messianic age would begin the following year with the conquest of the world without bloodshed. The Messiah would lead the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] back to the [[Holy Land]], \"riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in its jaws\".<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe rabbis of Jerusalem viewed Sabbatai's movement with great suspicion, and threatened its followers with [[excommunication]]. Acknowledging that Jerusalem would not be the best place to enact his plans, Sabbatai left for his native city, Smyrna.  Nathan proclaimed that henceforth Gaza, and not Jerusalem, would be the sacred city. On his way from Jerusalem to Smyrna, Sabbatai was greeted enthusiastically in [[Aleppo]]. In Smyrna, which he reached in the autumn of 1665, the greatest homage was paid to him. After some hesitation, he publicly declared himself to be the expected Messiah during the [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]] in 1665; his declaration was made in the [[synagogue]], with the blowing of [[Shofar|horns]], and shouts of \"Long live our King, our Messiah!\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nHis followers began to refer to him with the title AMIRAH, a [[Hebrew]] acronym for the phrase \"Our Lord and King, his Majesty be exalted\" (''Adoneinu Malkeinu Yarum Hodo'').\n\n===Proclaimed messiah===\n[[Image:Shabbatai2.jpg|thumb|left|\"Sabbatai Zevi enthroned\" (image from the Amsterdam/Jewish publication ''Tikkun'', Amsterdam, 1666).]]\n\nAssisted by his wife, Sabbatai became the leader of the community. He used his power to crush the opposition. He deposed the existing rabbi of Smyrna, [[Aaron Lapapa]], and appointed [[Chaim Benveniste]] in his place. His popularity grew, as people of all faiths repeated his story. His fame extended far and wide. [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] had centers of his Messianic movement. The Jews of [[Hamburg]] and [[Amsterdam]] learned of the events in Smyrna from trustworthy Christians. [[Henry Oldenburg]], a distinguished German savant who became the first secretary of the Royal Society, wrote to [[Baruch Spinoza]] (''Spinozae Epistolae'' No 33): \"All the world here is talking of a rumour of the return of the Israelites ... to their own country. ... Should the news be confirmed, it may bring about a revolution in all things.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nSabbatai's followers included many prominent rabbis, such as [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]], [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]], [[Moses Galante (the Younger)|Moses Galante]], [[Moses Zacuto]], and the above-mentioned Hayyim Benveniste. [[Benjamin Musaphia|Dionysius Musaphia]], an adherent of Spinoza, likewise became a follower. People spread fantastic reports, which were widely believed. For example, it was said, \"In the north of [[Scotland]] a ship had appeared with silken sails and ropes, manned by sailors who spoke [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The flag bore the inscription 'The Twelve Tribes of Israel'.\"<ref name=\"Lukach1914\">{{cite book|last= Lukach|first=Harry Charles|title=The City of Dancing Dervishes and Other Sketches and Studies from the Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IglFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA189|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|pages=189\u2013190}}</ref> The Jewish community of [[Avignon]], [[France]] prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom in the spring of 1666.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe readiness of the Jews to believe the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi may largely be explained by the desperate state of European Jewry in the mid-17th century.

There is no doubt that for most of the Jews of Europe there could not have been a more propitious moment for the messiah to deliver salvation than the moment Sabbetai Zevi made his appearance.\n\n===Spread of his influence===\n{{Main|Sabbateans}}\nProbably with his consent, Sabbatai's adherents planned to abolish many of the [[613 mitzvot|ritualistic observances]] because, according to a minority opinion in the Talmud, in the Messianic time there would no longer be holy obligations.  The fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet]] became a day of feasting and rejoicing.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> [[Samuel Primo]], who became Sabbatai's secretary when the latter went to Smyrna, directed in the name of the Messiah the following circular to all of the Jews:\n<blockquote>\n\"The first-begotten Son of God, Shabbethai Tebi, Messiah and Redeemer of the people of Israel, to all the sons of Israel, Peace! Since ye have been deemed worthy to behold the great day and the fulfilment of God's word by the Prophets, your lament and sorrow must be changed into joy, and your fasting into merriment; for ye shall weep no more. Rejoice with song and melody, and change the day formerly spent in sadness and sorrow into a day of jubilee, because I have appeared.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/></blockquote>\n\nPrimo's message was considered blasphemous, as Sabbatai wanted to celebrate his birthday rather than the holy day. There was outrage and dissension in the communities; many of the leaders who had regarded the movement sympathetically were shocked at such radical innovations. [[Solomon Algazi]], a prominent Talmudist of Smyrna, and other members of the rabbinate who opposed the abolition of the fast, narrowly escaped death at the hands of Sabbatai's followers.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===In Constantinople===\nAt the beginning of the year 1666, Sabbatai left Izmir for Constantinople (\u0130stanbul in present-day Turkey).  He may have been forced to flee by city officials. Nathan Ghazzati had prophesied that, once in Constantinople, Sabbatai would place the [[sultan]]'s crown on his own head. The [[grand vizier]], [[Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc]], ordered Sabbatai's immediate arrest upon his arrival and had him imprisoned, maybe to avoid any doubts among local and foreign observers of the imperial court as to the power still wielded by the Turkish Sultanate and by the Sultan himself.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nSabbatai's imprisonment discouraged neither him nor his followers at this stage. He was treated well in prison, perhaps because of bribes paid. This seems to have strengthened belief within his immediate circle of followers. Fabulous reports concerning the miraculous deeds \"the Messiah\" was performing in the Turkish capital were spread by Ghazzati, [[Abraham Yachini]], and Primo among the Jews of Smyrna and in many other communities, and the messianic expectations in the Jewish diasporas continued to rise.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===At Abydos (''Migdal Oz'')===\nAfter two months' imprisonment in Constantinople, Sabbatai was moved to the state prison at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]]. Some of his friends were allowed to accompany him. As a result, the Sabbataians called the fortress ''Migdal Oz'' (Tower [of] Strength). As Sabbatai had arrived on the day preceding [[Passover]], he slew a [[Korban Pesach|paschal lamb]] for himself and his followers. He ate it with its fat, a violation of Jewish Law. It is said that he pronounced over it the benediction: \"Blessed be God who hath restored again that which was forbidden.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe immense sums sent to him by his rich followers, the charms of the queenly Sarah, and the cooperation shown by the Turkish officials and others enabled Sabbatai to display royal splendor in the prison castle of Abydos. Accounts of his life there were exaggerated and spread among Jews in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. In some parts of Europe, Jews began to unroof their houses and prepare for a new \"exodus\". In almost every synagogue, Sabbatai's initials were posted, and prayers for him were inserted in the following form: \"Bless our Lord and King, the holy and righteous Sabbatai Zevi, the Messiah of the God of Jacob.\" In [[Hamburg]], the council introduced the custom of praying for Sabbatai not only on [[Shabbat|Saturday]] (the Jewish Sabbath), but also on Monday and Thursday. Unbelievers were compelled to remain in the synagogue and join in the prayer with a loud ''[[Amen]]''. Sabbatai's picture was printed together with that of [[King David]] in most of the prayer-books, along with his kabbalistic formulas and penances.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThese and similar innovations caused great commotion in some communities. In [[Moravia]] excitement reached such a pitch that the government had to intervene, while at [[Sal\u00e9|Sale]], Morocco, the [[emir]] ordered a [[persecution]] of the Jews. During this period Sabbatai declared the fasts of the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Ninth of Av]] (his birthday) would henceforth be feast-days. He contemplated converting the [[Day of Atonement]] to one of celebration.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Nehemiah ha-Kohen===\n[[File:Shabbatai 3.jpg|thumb|Sabbatai Zevi as a prisoner in Abydos.]]\n\nWhile Sabbatai was in the Abydos prison an incident occurred which ultimately led to Sabbatai's downfall. Two prominent Polish Talmudists from [[Lw\u00f3w]], [[Lesser Poland]], who were among Sabbatai's visitors in Abydos, informed him that in their native country a prophet, [[Nehemiah ha-Kohen]], had announced the coming of the Messiah. Sabbatai ordered the prophet to appear before him. (See ''Jew. Encyc.'' ix. 212a, s.v. Nehemiah ha-Kohen). Nehemiah obeyed, reaching Abydos after a journey of three months at the beginning of September, 1666. The meeting between the two ended in mutual dissatisfaction. Some Sabbataians are said to have contemplated the secret murder of the rival.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Conversion to Islam===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sabbateans]] -->\nNehemiah, however, escaped to Constantinople, where he pretended to embrace [[Islam]] to get an audience with the [[kaymakam]]. He told him of Sabbatai's ambitions. The kaymakam informed the [[sultan]], [[Mehmed IV]]. Sabbatai was taken from Abydos to [[Adrianople]],<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> where the sultan's vizier gave him three choices; subject himself to a trial of his divinity in the form of a volley of arrows (in which should the archers miss, his divinity would be proven); be impaled; or he could convert to Islam.<ref name=\"Hitchens2011\">{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9VdHv0OWEC&pg=PT123|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-85789-715-2|page=123}}</ref> On the following day (September 16, 1666) Zevi came before the sultan, cast off his Jewish garb and put a Turkish [[turban]] on his head. Thus his conversion to Islam was accomplished. The sultan was much pleased, and rewarded Sabbatai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) ''[[Effendi]]'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a generous salary. Sarah and approximately 300 families among Sabbatai's followers also converted to Islam. These new Muslims thereafter were known as [[d\u00f6nmeh]] (converts).<ref name=\"tnr.com\"/> The sultan's officials ordered Sabbatai to take an additional wife to demonstrate his conversion. Some days after his conversion he wrote to Smyrna: \"God has made me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done. The ninth day of my regeneration.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Disillusion===\n[[File:Shabbatai4.jpg|thumb|left|Former followers of Sabbatai do penance for their support of him.]]\n\nSabbatai's conversion devastated his followers. Muslims and Christians alike ridiculed his followers after the event. In spite of Sabbatai's [[apostasy]], many of his adherents still clung tenaciously to their belief in him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme. False Prophets such as Ghazzati and Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement, encouraged such belief. In many communities, the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Tisha B'Av|Ninth of Av]] were still observed as feast-days in spite of bans and excommunications by the rabbis.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nAt times Sabbatai assumed the role of a pious Muslim and reviled Judaism; at others he associated with Jews as one of their own faith. In March, 1668, he announced that he had been filled with the \"[[Holy Spirit]]\" at [[Passover]], and had received a \"revelation.\" He, or one of his followers, published a mystical work claiming Sabbatai was the true Messiah in spite of his conversion, whose goal was to bring thousands of Muslims to Judaism. He told the sultan, however, that he was trying to convert Jews to Islam. The sultan permitted Sabbatai to associate with other Jews and preach in their synagogues. He succeeded in bringing over a number of Muslims to his kabbalistic views.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" /> Whether through his efforts or their willingness to follow in his latest steps, about 300 families of [[Sephardi Jews]] converted to Islam, becoming known as the ''D\u00f6nmeh'' (also spelled ''D\u00f6nme''), convert.<ref name=\"tnr.com\" /> Some of the followers adhered to a combination of their former Jewish practices as well as Islam.\n\nGradually the Turks tired of Sabbatai's schemes. They ended his doorkeeper's salary and banished him to Constantinople. When he was discovered singing [[psalms]] with Jews, the grand vizier ordered his banishment to Dulcigno (today called [[Ulcinj]]), a small town in present-day [[Montenegro]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" /> In August 1676, he wrote to the [[Judaism in Albania|Jewish Community in Berat, Albania]], requesting religious books,<ref name=\"Elsie\" /> but he died shortly after in isolation, according to some accounts on September 17, 1676, the High Holy Day of [[Yom Kippur]]. His tomb was believed for a long time to have been in [[Berat]], at a ''[[khanqah|tekke]]'' built in the yard of the [[Imperial Mosque (Pristina)|Imperial Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), where a tomb stood until 1967.

This belief was so prevalent that [[Manasseh ben Israel]], in his letter to [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Rump Parliament]], appealed to it as a reason to re-admit Jews into [[England]], saying, \"[T]he opinions of many Christians and mine do concur herein, that we both believe that the restoring time of our Nation into their native country is very near at hand.\"<ref name=\"jewishencyclopedia.com\">[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=531&letter=S#1742, \"SHABBETHAI \u1e92EBI B.

Sabbatai could have learned something about these Western millenarian expectations at his father's house.<ref>This theory was originally suggested by [[Heinrich Graetz|Graetz]]; [[Gershom Scholem]] argued forcefully against it in his major work on Sabbatai quoted throughout this entry.</ref> The more precise extensions of the overall combined influence of English/Dutch Calvinist millenarianism within the messianic movement that developed around Zevi's activities is still being studied and assessed by scholars.<ref>Heyd, Michael, \u201cThe \u2018Jewish Quaker\u2019: Christian Perceptions of Shabbatai Zevi as an Enthusiast,\u201d in Coudert, Allison and Jeffrey Shoulson, eds., ''Hebraica Veritas?

In order to prove this claim he started to pronounce the [[Tetragrammaton]], an act which Judaism emphatically prohibited to all but the Jewish [[Kohen Gadol|high priest]] in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. For scholars acquainted with [[Rabbinic literature|rabbinical]], and kabbalistic literature, the act was highly symbolic. He would also claim that he could fly, but explained to his beholders that he couldn't do so in public because they were 'not worthy enough' to witness the sight. So too, he declared regularly that he was having various visions of God.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abramson |first1=Dr. Henry |title=Who was Shabbetai Tsvi? |url=https://henryabramson.com/2012/02/02/shabbetai-tsvi-false-messiah/ |website=www.henryabramson.com/2012/02/02/shabbetai-tsvi-false-messiah/}}</ref> He revealed his Messiahship early on to [[Isaac Silveyra]] and [[Moses Pinheiro]], the latter a brother-in-law of the Italian rabbi and [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Joseph Ergas]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nHowever, at this point he was still relatively young to be thought of as an accepted and established rabbinic authority; and his influence in the local community was not widespread. Even though Sabbatai had led the pious life of a mystic in Smyrna for several years, the older and more established rabbinic leadership was still suspicious of his activities. The local college of rabbis, headed by his teacher, [[Joseph Escapa]], kept a watchful eye on him. When his Messianic pretensions became too bold, they put him and his followers under ''[[Herem (censure)|cherem]]'', a type of [[excommunication]] in [[Judaism]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nAbout the year 1651 (according to others, 1654), the rabbis banished Sabbatai and his disciples from Smyrna. It is not certain where he went from there. By 1658, he was in [[Constantinople]], where he met a preacher, [[Abraham Yachini]] (a disciple of [[Joseph di Trani]]), who confirmed Sabbatai's messianic mission. [[Abraham Yachini|Yachini]] is said to have forged a manuscript in archaic characters which, he alleged, bore testimony to Sabbatai's Messiahship.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> It was entitled \"The Great Wisdom of Solomon\", and began:\n<blockquote>\n\"I, Abraham, was confined in a cave for forty years, and I wondered greatly that the time of miracles did not arrive.

He will humble the great dragon; ... he, the true Messiah, will sit upon My throne.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/></blockquote>\n\n===In Salonica, Cairo, and Jerusalem===\n[[File:20121020 exterior of Yeni Mosque Thessaloniki Greece.jpg|thumb|''[[New Mosque (Thessaloniki)|New Mosque]]'', built by Donmeh community of [[Salonica]] during the Ottoman period.]]\n\nWith this document, Sabbatai chose [[Salonica]], at that time a center of kabbalists, for his base. He proclaimed himself the Messiah or \"anointed one,\" gaining many adherents. He put on all sorts of mystical events\u2014e.g., the celebration of his marriage as the \"One Without End\" (the ''[[Ein Sof]]'') with the [[Torah]], preparing a solemn festival to which he invited his friends. The rabbis of Salonica, headed by Rabbi Hiyya Abraham Di Boton, banished him from the city. The sources differ widely as to the route he took after this expulsion, with [[Alexandria]], [[Athens]], [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], [[Jerusalem]], and Smyrna mentioned as temporary centers. After wandering, he settled in [[Cairo]], where he resided for about two years (1660\u20131662).<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\n[[Raphael Joseph Halabi]] (\"of [[Aleppo]]\") was a wealthy and influential Jew who held the high position of mint-master and [[Tax farming|tax-farmer]] in Cairo under the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] government. He led an ascetic life, which included fasting, bathing in cold water, and [[scourging]] his body at night. He used his great wealth for charity, supporting poor Talmudists and Kabbalists, fifty of whom reportedly dined at his table regularly. Sabbatai befriended Raphael Joseph, who became a supporter and promoter of his Messianic claims.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nAbout 1663 Sabbatai moved on to Jerusalem. Here he resumed his former ascetic practice of frequent fasting and other penances. Many saw this as proof of his extraordinary [[piety]]. He was said to have a good voice, and sang [[psalms]] all night long, or at times [[Spanish language|Spanish]] love-songs, to which he gave mystical interpretations. He attracted crowds of listeners. At other times he prayed and cried at the graves of pious men and women. He distributed [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] to children on the streets. Gradually he gathered a circle of adherents.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nThe important community of Jerusalem at the time was also in need of money to keep up with the heavy taxes imposed on it by the Ottoman government. The community was coming up short of funds to pay these levies, and these arrears could have dire consequences. Sabbatai, known as the favorite of the rich and powerful Raphael Joseph Halabi in the Turkish government center in Cairo, was chosen as the community envoy to appeal to Halabi for money and support. His success in getting the funds to pay off the Turks raised his prestige. His followers dated his public career from this journey to Cairo.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\n===Marriage to Sarah===\nAnother event helped spread Sabbatai's fame in the Jewish world of the time in the course of his second stay in Cairo. During the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Chmielnicki massacres]] in [[Poland]], a Jewish orphan girl named Sarah, about six years old, was found by Christians and sent to a [[convent]] for care. After ten years, she escaped (through a miracle she claimed), and made her way to [[Amsterdam]]. Some years later she went to [[Livorno]] where, according to reports, she led a life of [[prostitution]]. She also conceived the notion that she was to become the bride of the Messiah, who was soon to appear.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nWhen the report of Sarah's adventures reached Cairo, Sabbatai claimed that such a consort had been promised to him in a dream because he, as the Messiah, was bound to fall in love with an unchaste woman. He reportedly sent messengers to Livorno to bring Sarah to him, and they were married at Halabi's house. Her beauty and eccentricity reportedly helped him gain new followers. Through her a new romantic and licentious element entered Sabbatai's career. Even the overturning of her past scandalous life was seen by Sabbatai's followers as additional confirmation of his messiahship, following the biblical story of the prophet [[Hosea]], who had also been commanded to take a \"wife of whoredom\" as the first symbolic act of his calling.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Nathan of Gaza===\n{{Main|Nathan of Gaza}}\n\nWith Halabi's financial and political backing, a charming wife, and many additional followers, Sabbatai triumphantly returned to [[Jerusalem]]. Passing through the city of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], which at the time had an important Jewish community, he met Nathan Benjamin Levi, known since as [[Nathan of Gaza]] (\u05e0\u05ea\u05df \u05e2\u05d6\u05ea\u05d9 ''Nathan 'Azzati''). Nathan became very active in Sabbatai's subsequent Messianic career, serving as Sabbatai's right-hand man and declaring himself to be the risen [[Elijah]], who, it was predicted, would proclaim the arrival of the Messiah. In 1665, Nathan announced that the Messianic age would begin the following year with the conquest of the world without bloodshed. The Messiah would lead the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] back to the [[Holy Land]], \"riding on a lion with a seven-headed dragon in its jaws\".<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe rabbis of Jerusalem viewed Sabbatai's movement with great suspicion, and threatened its followers with [[excommunication]]. Acknowledging that Jerusalem would not be the best place to enact his plans, Sabbatai left for his native city, Smyrna.  Nathan proclaimed that henceforth Gaza, and not Jerusalem, would be the sacred city. On his way from Jerusalem to Smyrna, Sabbatai was greeted enthusiastically in [[Aleppo]]. In Smyrna, which he reached in the autumn of 1665, the greatest homage was paid to him. After some hesitation, he publicly declared himself to be the expected Messiah during the [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]] in 1665; his declaration was made in the [[synagogue]], with the blowing of [[Shofar|horns]], and shouts of \"Long live our King, our Messiah!\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nHis followers began to refer to him with the title AMIRAH, a [[Hebrew]] acronym for the phrase \"Our Lord and King, his Majesty be exalted\" (''Adoneinu Malkeinu Yarum Hodo'').\n\n===Proclaimed messiah===\n[[Image:Shabbatai2.jpg|thumb|left|\"Sabbatai Zevi enthroned\" (image from the Amsterdam/Jewish publication ''Tikkun'', Amsterdam, 1666).]]\n\nAssisted by his wife, Sabbatai became the leader of the community. He used his power to crush the opposition. He deposed the existing rabbi of Smyrna, [[Aaron Lapapa]], and appointed [[Chaim Benveniste]] in his place. His popularity grew, as people of all faiths repeated his story. His fame extended far and wide. [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and the [[Netherlands]] had centers of his Messianic movement. The Jews of [[Hamburg]] and [[Amsterdam]] learned of the events in Smyrna from trustworthy Christians. [[Henry Oldenburg]], a distinguished German savant who became the first secretary of the Royal Society, wrote to [[Baruch Spinoza]] (''Spinozae Epistolae'' No 33): \"All the world here is talking of a rumour of the return of the Israelites ... to their own country. ... Should the news be confirmed, it may bring about a revolution in all things.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nSabbatai's followers included many prominent rabbis, such as [[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]], [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]], [[Moses Galante (the Younger)|Moses Galante]], [[Moses Zacuto]], and the above-mentioned Hayyim Benveniste. [[Benjamin Musaphia|Dionysius Musaphia]], an adherent of Spinoza, likewise became a follower. People spread fantastic reports, which were widely believed. For example, it was said, \"In the north of [[Scotland]] a ship had appeared with silken sails and ropes, manned by sailors who spoke [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. The flag bore the inscription 'The Twelve Tribes of Israel'.\"<ref name=\"Lukach1914\">{{cite book|last= Lukach|first=Harry Charles|title=The City of Dancing Dervishes and Other Sketches and Studies from the Near East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IglFAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA189|year=1914|publisher=Macmillan and Company|location=London|pages=189\u2013190}}</ref> The Jewish community of [[Avignon]], [[France]] prepared to emigrate to the new kingdom in the spring of 1666.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe readiness of the Jews to believe the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi may largely be explained by the desperate state of European Jewry in the mid-17th century.

There is no doubt that for most of the Jews of Europe there could not have been a more propitious moment for the messiah to deliver salvation than the moment Sabbetai Zevi made his appearance.\n\n===Spread of his influence===\n{{Main|Sabbateans}}\nProbably with his consent, Sabbatai's adherents planned to abolish many of the [[613 mitzvot|ritualistic observances]] because, according to a minority opinion in the Talmud, in the Messianic time there would no longer be holy obligations.  The fast of the [[Tenth of Tevet]] became a day of feasting and rejoicing.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> [[Samuel Primo]], who became Sabbatai's secretary when the latter went to Smyrna, directed in the name of the Messiah the following circular to all of the Jews:\n<blockquote>\n\"The first-begotten Son of God, Shabbethai Tebi, Messiah and Redeemer of the people of Israel, to all the sons of Israel, Peace! Since ye have been deemed worthy to behold the great day and the fulfilment of God's word by the Prophets, your lament and sorrow must be changed into joy, and your fasting into merriment; for ye shall weep no more. Rejoice with song and melody, and change the day formerly spent in sadness and sorrow into a day of jubilee, because I have appeared.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/></blockquote>\n\nPrimo's message was considered blasphemous, as Sabbatai wanted to celebrate his birthday rather than the holy day. There was outrage and dissension in the communities; many of the leaders who had regarded the movement sympathetically were shocked at such radical innovations. [[Solomon Algazi]], a prominent Talmudist of Smyrna, and other members of the rabbinate who opposed the abolition of the fast, narrowly escaped death at the hands of Sabbatai's followers.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===In Constantinople===\nAt the beginning of the year 1666, Sabbatai left Izmir for Constantinople (\u0130stanbul in present-day Turkey).  He may have been forced to flee by city officials. Nathan Ghazzati had prophesied that, once in Constantinople, Sabbatai would place the [[sultan]]'s crown on his own head. The [[grand vizier]], [[Ahmed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc]], ordered Sabbatai's immediate arrest upon his arrival and had him imprisoned, maybe to avoid any doubts among local and foreign observers of the imperial court as to the power still wielded by the Turkish Sultanate and by the Sultan himself.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nSabbatai's imprisonment discouraged neither him nor his followers at this stage. He was treated well in prison, perhaps because of bribes paid. This seems to have strengthened belief within his immediate circle of followers. Fabulous reports concerning the miraculous deeds \"the Messiah\" was performing in the Turkish capital were spread by Ghazzati, [[Abraham Yachini]], and Primo among the Jews of Smyrna and in many other communities, and the messianic expectations in the Jewish diasporas continued to rise.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===At Abydos (''Migdal Oz'')===\nAfter two months' imprisonment in Constantinople, Sabbatai was moved to the state prison at [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]]. Some of his friends were allowed to accompany him. As a result, the Sabbataians called the fortress ''Migdal Oz'' (Tower [of] Strength). As Sabbatai had arrived on the day preceding [[Passover]], he slew a [[Korban Pesach|paschal lamb]] for himself and his followers. He ate it with its fat, a violation of Jewish Law. It is said that he pronounced over it the benediction: \"Blessed be God who hath restored again that which was forbidden.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThe immense sums sent to him by his rich followers, the charms of the queenly Sarah, and the cooperation shown by the Turkish officials and others enabled Sabbatai to display royal splendor in the prison castle of Abydos. Accounts of his life there were exaggerated and spread among Jews in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]]. In some parts of Europe, Jews began to unroof their houses and prepare for a new \"exodus\". In almost every synagogue, Sabbatai's initials were posted, and prayers for him were inserted in the following form: \"Bless our Lord and King, the holy and righteous Sabbatai Zevi, the Messiah of the God of Jacob.\" In [[Hamburg]], the council introduced the custom of praying for Sabbatai not only on [[Shabbat|Saturday]] (the Jewish Sabbath), but also on Monday and Thursday. Unbelievers were compelled to remain in the synagogue and join in the prayer with a loud ''[[Amen]]''. Sabbatai's picture was printed together with that of [[King David]] in most of the prayer-books, along with his kabbalistic formulas and penances.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\nThese and similar innovations caused great commotion in some communities. In [[Moravia]] excitement reached such a pitch that the government had to intervene, while at [[Sal\u00e9|Sale]], Morocco, the [[emir]] ordered a [[persecution]] of the Jews. During this period Sabbatai declared the fasts of the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Ninth of Av]] (his birthday) would henceforth be feast-days. He contemplated converting the [[Day of Atonement]] to one of celebration.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Nehemiah ha-Kohen===\n[[File:Shabbatai 3.jpg|thumb|Sabbatai Zevi as a prisoner in Abydos.]]\n\nWhile Sabbatai was in the Abydos prison an incident occurred which ultimately led to Sabbatai's downfall. Two prominent Polish Talmudists from [[Lw\u00f3w]], [[Lesser Poland]], who were among Sabbatai's visitors in Abydos, informed him that in their native country a prophet, [[Nehemiah ha-Kohen]], had announced the coming of the Messiah. Sabbatai ordered the prophet to appear before him. (See ''Jew. Encyc.'' ix. 212a, s.v. Nehemiah ha-Kohen). Nehemiah obeyed, reaching Abydos after a journey of three months at the beginning of September, 1666. The meeting between the two ended in mutual dissatisfaction. Some Sabbataians are said to have contemplated the secret murder of the rival.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Conversion to Islam===<!-- This section is linked from [[Sabbateans]] -->\nNehemiah, however, escaped to Constantinople, where he pretended to embrace [[Islam]] to get an audience with the [[kaymakam]]. He told him of Sabbatai's ambitions. The kaymakam informed the [[sultan]], [[Mehmed IV]]. Sabbatai was taken from Abydos to [[Adrianople]],<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/> where the sultan's vizier gave him three choices; subject himself to a trial of his divinity in the form of a volley of arrows (in which should the archers miss, his divinity would be proven); be impaled; or he could convert to Islam.<ref name=\"Hitchens2011\">{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lm9VdHv0OWEC&pg=PT123|year=2011|publisher=Atlantic Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-85789-715-2|page=123}}</ref> On the following day (September 16, 1666) Zevi came before the sultan, cast off his Jewish garb and put a Turkish [[turban]] on his head. Thus his conversion to Islam was accomplished. The sultan was much pleased, and rewarded Sabbatai by conferring on him the title (Mahmed) ''[[Effendi]]'', and appointing him as his doorkeeper with a generous salary. Sarah and approximately 300 families among Sabbatai's followers also converted to Islam. These new Muslims thereafter were known as [[d\u00f6nmeh]] (converts).<ref name=\"tnr.com\"/> The sultan's officials ordered Sabbatai to take an additional wife to demonstrate his conversion. Some days after his conversion he wrote to Smyrna: \"God has made me an Ishmaelite; He commanded, and it was done. The ninth day of my regeneration.\"<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\"/>\n\n===Disillusion===\n[[File:Shabbatai4.jpg|thumb|left|Former followers of Sabbatai do penance for their support of him.]]\n\nSabbatai's conversion devastated his followers. Muslims and Christians alike ridiculed his followers after the event. In spite of Sabbatai's [[apostasy]], many of his adherents still clung tenaciously to their belief in him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme. False Prophets such as Ghazzati and Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement, encouraged such belief. In many communities, the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]] and the [[Tisha B'Av|Ninth of Av]] were still observed as feast-days in spite of bans and excommunications by the rabbis.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" />\n\nAt times Sabbatai assumed the role of a pious Muslim and reviled Judaism; at others he associated with Jews as one of their own faith. In March, 1668, he announced that he had been filled with the \"[[Holy Spirit]]\" at [[Passover]], and had received a \"revelation.\" He, or one of his followers, published a mystical work claiming Sabbatai was the true Messiah in spite of his conversion, whose goal was to bring thousands of Muslims to Judaism. He told the sultan, however, that he was trying to convert Jews to Islam. The sultan permitted Sabbatai to associate with other Jews and preach in their synagogues. He succeeded in bringing over a number of Muslims to his kabbalistic views.<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" /> Whether through his efforts or their willingness to follow in his latest steps, about 300 families of [[Sephardi Jews]] converted to Islam, becoming known as the ''D\u00f6nmeh'' (also spelled ''D\u00f6nme''), convert.<ref name=\"tnr.com\" /> Some of the followers adhered to a combination of their former Jewish practices as well as Islam.\n\nGradually the Turks tired of Sabbatai's schemes. They ended his doorkeeper's salary and banished him to Constantinople. When he was discovered singing [[psalms]] with Jews, the grand vizier ordered his banishment to Dulcigno (today called [[Ulcinj]]), a small town in present-day [[Montenegro]].<ref name=\"KohlerMalter1905\" /> In August 1676, he wrote to the [[Judaism in Albania|Jewish Community in Berat, Albania]], requesting religious books,<ref name=\"Elsie\" /> but he died shortly after in isolation, according to some accounts on September 17, 1676, the High Holy Day of [[Yom Kippur]]. His tomb was believed for a long time to have been in [[Berat]], at a ''[[khanqah|tekke]]'' built in the yard of the [[Imperial Mosque (Pristina)|Imperial Mosque]] ({{lang-sq|Xhamia e Mbretit}}), where a tomb stood until 1967.
