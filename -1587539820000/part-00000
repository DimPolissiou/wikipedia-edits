He gained fame in his time as \"the extraordinary Negro\", and to 18th-century British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] he became a symbol of the humanity of Africans and immorality of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]].<ref name=\"Brycchan\"/> ''The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African'', edited and published two years after his death, is one of the earliest accounts of African slavery written in English by a former [[slavery|slave]].\n\n==Biography==\nCharles Ignatius Sancho was born on a slave ship crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in what was known as the [[Middle Passage]]. His mother died not long after in the Spanish colony of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada, corresponding to modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela]]. His father reportedly took his own life rather than live as a slave. Sancho's owner took the young orphan, barely two years old to England and gave him to three  unmarried sisters in [[Greenwich]], where he lived from ca. 1731 to 1749. [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]] (of the first creation) (1690\u20131749), impressed by Sancho's intellect, frankness, and his amiability, not only encouraged him to read, but also lent him books from his personal library at Blackheath. Sancho's informal education made his lack of freedom in Greenwich unbearable, and he ran away to the Montagus in 1749. For two years until her death in 1751, Sancho worked as the [[butler]] for [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Mary Montagu (n\u00e9e Churchill), Duchess of Montagu]], at [[Montagu House, Blackheath|Montagu House]], where he flourished by immersing himself in music, poetry, reading, and writing.<ref name=ellis1996>{{cite book |author=Ellis, Markman |title=The Politics of Sensibility: Race, Gender and Commerce in the Sentimental Novel |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |page=57}}</ref><ref name=walvin1997>{{cite book |author=Walvin, James |year=1997 |chapter=Ignatius Sancho: The Man and His Times |editor=King, Reyahn |title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London, UK |page=96 }}</ref> At her death in 1751 he received an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of \u00a330 and a year's salary, which he quickly squandered.<ref name=ellis1996 />\n\nDuring the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Ann Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children: Frances Joanna (1761\u20131815), Ann Alice (1763\u20131805), Elizabeth Bruce (1766\u20131837), Jonathan William (1768\u20131770), Lydia (1771\u20131776), Katherine Margaret (1773\u20131779), and William Leach Osborne (1775\u20131810).<ref name=Brycchanweb /> Around the time of the birth of their third child, Sancho became a valet to [[George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]] (of the second creation), son-in-law of his earlier patron.<ref name=ellis1996 /> He remained there until 1773.\n\nIn 1768 [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the [[Duchess of Montagu]] sat for her portrait by the artist.<ref name=king /><ref group=notes>According to King (1997:28-9), there is an inscription by [[antiquarian]] [[William Stevenson (publisher)|William Stevenson]] on the back of the canvas stating that Gainsborough completed the portrait in one hour and 40 minutes on 29 November 1768. Stevenson was the person Sancho corresponded with most frequently. This was the same time as the Duchess had her portrait done. Representations of African subjects typically reflected the artist's ideological view of slavery. Few African people were portrayed with the depth of feeling evoked in this portrait. Gainsborough conveys both the warmth and humour of Sancho's personality and his refined gentlemanly qualities. This is a sharp contrast to contemporary stereotypical images of African people. For this reason Gainsborough's portrait is exceptional. King argued that the Sancho portrait is the most accomplished portrait of an African person in British [[portraiture]] of the time (King 1997:30). Bartolozzi's 1781 engraving based on Gainsborough's portrait of Sancho, was used as the frontispiece when Sancho's Letters were published.</ref> By the late 1760s Sancho had already become accomplished and was considered by many to be a man of refinement.<ref name=ellis1996 />\n\nIn 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, Sancho wrote to [[Laurence Sterne]]<ref name=carey2003>{{cite journal\n|url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/Carey_BJECS_2003.pdf\n|title=The extraordinary Negro': Ignatius Sancho, Joseph Jekyll, and the Problem of Biography\n|author=Carey, Brycchan\n|journal=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies\n|location=\n|date=March 2003\n|volume=26\n|number=1\n|pages=1\u201313\n|accessdate=8 January 2013\n}}</ref> encouraging the famous writer to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Phillips, Caryl 1996 12\">{{cite book\n|title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters\n|chapter=Director's Forward\n|author=Phillips, Caryl\n|publisher=National Portrait Gallery\n|location=London\n|date=December 1996\n\n|page=12\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|That subject, handled in your striking manner, would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many\u2014but if only of one\u2014Gracious God!\u2014what a feast to a benevolent heart!}}\n\nIn July 1766 Sancho's letter was received by Reverend Laurence Sterne shortly after he had just finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters, Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', wherein Tom described the oppression of an African servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon that he had visited.<ref name=\"Norton\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/noa/pdf/27636_Rest_U12_Sancho.pdf\n|title=Ignatius Sancho and Laurence Sterne\n|series=A Web Companion to ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''\n|publisher=Norton\n}}</ref> Laurence Sterne's widely publicised 27 July 1766 response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.{{quote|There is a strange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me\u2014but why her brethren?\u2014or your\u2019s, Sancho! any more than mine?

He is the only Briton of [[Africans|African]] heritage known to have been eligible and voted in an 18th-century general election through property qualifications. He gained fame in his time as \"the extraordinary Negro\", and to 18th-century British [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionists]] he became a symbol of the humanity of Africans and immorality of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]].<ref name=\"Brycchan\"/> ''The Letters of the Late Ignatius Sancho, an African'', edited and published two years after his death, is one of the earliest accounts of African slavery written in English by a former [[slavery|slave]].\n\n==Biography==\nCharles Ignatius Sancho was born on a slave ship crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]], in what was known as the [[Middle Passage]]. His mother died not long after in the Spanish colony of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada, corresponding to modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela]]. His father reportedly took his own life rather than live as a slave. Sancho's owner took the young orphan, barely two years old to England and gave him to three  unmarried sisters in [[Greenwich]], where he lived from ca. 1731 to 1749. [[John Montagu, 2nd Duke of Montagu]] (of the first creation) (1690\u20131749), impressed by Sancho's intellect, frankness, and his amiability, not only encouraged him to read, but also lent him books from his personal library at Blackheath. Sancho's informal education made his lack of freedom in Greenwich unbearable, and he ran away to the Montagus in 1749. For two years until her death in 1751, Sancho worked as the [[butler]] for [[Mary Montagu, Duchess of Montagu|Mary Montagu (n\u00e9e Churchill), Duchess of Montagu]], at [[Montagu House, Blackheath|Montagu House]], where he flourished by immersing himself in music, poetry, reading, and writing.<ref name=ellis1996>{{cite book |author=Ellis, Markman |title=The Politics of Sensibility: Race, Gender and Commerce in the Sentimental Novel |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |page=57}}</ref><ref name=walvin1997>{{cite book |author=Walvin, James |year=1997 |chapter=Ignatius Sancho: The Man and His Times |editor=King, Reyahn |title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters |publisher=National Portrait Gallery |location=London, UK |page=96 }}</ref> At her death in 1751 he received an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]] of \u00a330 and a year's salary, which he quickly squandered.<ref name=ellis1996 />\n\nDuring the 1760s Sancho married a West Indian woman, Ann Osborne. He became a devoted husband and father. They had seven children: Frances Joanna (1761\u20131815), Ann Alice (1763\u20131805), Elizabeth Bruce (1766\u20131837), Jonathan William (1768\u20131770), Lydia (1771\u20131776), Katherine Margaret (1773\u20131779), and William Leach Osborne (1775\u20131810).<ref name=Brycchanweb /> Around the time of the birth of their third child, Sancho became a valet to the [[George Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu]] (of the second creation), son-in-law of his earlier patron.<ref name=ellis1996 /> He remained there until 1773.\n\nIn 1768 [[Thomas Gainsborough]] painted a portrait of Sancho at the same time as the [[Duchess of Montagu]] sat for her portrait by the artist.<ref name=king /><ref group=notes>According to King (1997:28-9), there is an inscription by [[antiquarian]] [[William Stevenson (publisher)|William Stevenson]] on the back of the canvas stating that Gainsborough completed the portrait in one hour and 40 minutes on 29 November 1768. Stevenson was the person Sancho corresponded with most frequently. This was the same time as the Duchess had her portrait done. Representations of African subjects typically reflected the artist's ideological view of slavery. Few African people were portrayed with the depth of feeling evoked in this portrait. Gainsborough conveys both the warmth and humour of Sancho's personality and his refined gentlemanly qualities. This is a sharp contrast to contemporary stereotypical images of African people. For this reason Gainsborough's portrait is exceptional. King argued that the Sancho portrait is the most accomplished portrait of an African person in British [[portraiture]] of the time (King 1997:30). Bartolozzi's 1781 engraving based on Gainsborough's portrait of Sancho, was used as the frontispiece when Sancho's Letters were published.</ref> By the late 1760s Sancho had already become accomplished and was considered by many to be a man of refinement.<ref name=ellis1996 />\n\nIn 1766, at the height of the debate about slavery, Sancho wrote to [[Laurence Sterne]]<ref name=carey2003>{{cite journal\n|url=http://www.brycchancarey.com/Carey_BJECS_2003.pdf\n|title=The extraordinary Negro': Ignatius Sancho, Joseph Jekyll, and the Problem of Biography\n|author=Carey, Brycchan\n|publisher=Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies\n|location=\n|date=March 2003\n|volume=26\n|number=1\n|pages=1\u201313\n|accessdate=8 January 2013\n}}</ref> encouraging the famous writer to use his pen to lobby for the abolition of the slave trade.<ref name=\"Phillips, Caryl 1996 12\">{{cite book\n|title=Ignatius Sancho: an African Man of Letters\n|chapter=Director's Forward\n|author=Phillips, Caryl\n|publisher=National Portrait Gallery\n|location=London\n|date=December 1996\n\n|page=12\n}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|That subject, handled in your striking manner, would ease the yoke (perhaps) of many\u2014but if only of one\u2014Gracious God!\u2014what a feast to a benevolent heart!}}\n\nIn July 1766 Sancho's letter was received by Reverend Laurence Sterne shortly after he had just finished writing a conversation between his fictional characters, Corporal Trim and his brother Tom in ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'', wherein Tom described the oppression of an African servant in a sausage shop in Lisbon that he had visited.<ref name=\"Norton\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/noa/pdf/27636_Rest_U12_Sancho.pdf\n|title=Ignatius Sancho and Laurence Sterne\n|series=A Web Companion to ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''\n|publisher=Norton\n}}</ref> Laurence Sterne's widely publicised 27 July 1766 response to Sancho's letter became an integral part of 18th-century abolitionist literature.{{quote|There is a strange coincidence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a tender tale of the sorrows of a friendless poor negro-girl, and my eyes had scarce done smarting with it, when your letter of recommendation in behalf of so many of her brethren and sisters, came to me\u2014but why her brethren?\u2014or your\u2019s, Sancho! any more than mine?

The justification they gave was that shareholders were the \"residual claimants\" of the corporation so they had the sole right to profits. The idea that shareholders are the sole residual claimants was later challenged by legal scholars, and some (such as Stout 2002<ref>[http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=680074082121112025004090017120081113037035046078090017099116007095094067016016121044126029017014087111078069029049038029069008022093122020122072097068072110051009095082023098017093008110065090086117028002095021069120031111115010117127092127009&EXT=pdf Bad and Not So Bad Arguments for Shareholder Primacy], Social Science Research Network</ref>) actively reject it, in favor of other arguments for shareholder primacy. However, recent literature (such as Rojas 2014<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rojas|first=Claudio|date=2014|title=An Indeterminate Theory of Canadian Corporate Law|ssrn=2391775|journal=University of British Columbia Law Review|volume=47|issue=1|pages=59\u2013128}} (\"[Canada's] multifaceted approach to the fiduciary duty of directors [incorporates] the basic principle within Jensen's theory of enlightened value maximization that 'we cannot maximize the long-term market value of an organization if we ignore or mistreat any important constituency.'\")</ref>) builds upon Jensen's work arguing in favor of a dynamic model of the corporation and theory of corporate governance.\n\nAfter Jensen and Murphy (1990), Congress passed Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (1993), making it cost effective to pay executives in equity. As a result, executives had a financial incentive to focus their efforts on increasing stock price. In the short run, some executives even manipulated accounting numbers ([[Enron]], [[Global Crossing]]) to achieve the goal. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/business/yourmoney/03guru.html?pagewanted=print&position= NYT article 2005]  In the long run, executives outsourced labor to reduce costs and then used the resulting savings to repurchase stock, thus increasing their own compensation as well as enriching shareholders.

As time went on, the ancient narratives became more exaggerated as the passage was copied and recopied many times. Even in later Septuagint manuscripts, Goliath's height is recorded as \"five cubits\" and in an even later manuscript as \"six cubits\", exemplifying how ancient narratives were sometimes exaggerated as they were retold and rewritten by narrators or scribes.<ref>Abegg, Martin, Peter Flint, and Eugene Ulrich. \"1 Samuel.\" In The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible: The Oldest Known Bible Translated for the First Time into English, 228. 1st ed.

This cruel and strange punishment seems out of place within the text. For punishment of this kind was meant for those who discretely or violently rebelled <ref name=flint>Flint, Peter W. The Dead Sea Scrolls. Nashville: Abingdon Press, 2013.</ref>\n\n10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. <sup>27</sup> But some worthless fellows said, \"How can this man save us?\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.\n11:1 About a month later, [[Nahash of Ammon|Nahash]] the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\"<sup>2</sup> But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone\u2019s right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.\"\n\nHowever, 4QSam<sup>a</sup>, which was copied in around 50 BCE,<ref name=flint/> offers a relevant and informative paragraph to this passage, bringing clarity to the text. This portion is found in column 10.<ref name=flint/> The additional passage from the Samuel scroll has been integrated by the translators of the [[New Revised Standard Version]]. This version is the first of its kind to do so.\n          \n[NRSV] 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. <sup>27</sup> But some worthless fellows said, \"How can this man save us?\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.\t\n'''Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the [[Tribe of Gad|Gadites]] and the [[Tribe of Reuben|Reubenites]]. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the [[Ammonites (people)|Ammonites]], had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead.'''\n11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\"<sup>2</sup> But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone\u2019s right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.\"\n\nThus, the Samuel scroll found at Qumran includes a lengthier text than that of the traditional Masoretic Text and Septuagint. It provides readers with two key pieces of information:<ref>Abegg Jr., Martin, Peter W. Flint, and Eugene C. Ulrich. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible. New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2002.</ref> 1. It was common for Nahash to gouge out people's right eyes; 2. the 7,000 men that fled from the Ammonites had taken refuge in Jabesh-gilead, which is why the city was being treated by Nahash as a stronghold for rebels. Therefore, the harsh behaviour and brutal punishment of the Ammonite Nahash has been illuminated by the additional excerpt in 4QSam<sup>a</sup>, allowing its readers to comprehend the text by explaining the book's complicated history.\n\nAdditionally, this fragment was included by the authoritative Jewish historian, Josephus, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]].'' He may have adopted these writings from 4QSam<sup>a</sup> and other early Scriptural texts similar to its tradition.<ref name=ulrich>Ulrich, Eugene. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1999.</ref> Josephus wrote of Nahash's clever practice of putting out the right eyes of warriors, leaving them useless in battle when their left eye was covered by their shield (5.1, 386). For those who committed insurrection or rebellion against him, he would give the ultimatum of either, cutting \"off a small member of their body, or universally perish[ing]\" (5.1, 387). Consequently, the Qumran texts and Josephus himself combine to form our \"two most ancient witnesses\",<ref name=flint/> demonstrating the validity of the missing segment from 1 Samuel 10 and thus must be considered valuable revelation.\n\nHowever, the question remains as to why this portion is missing from the Masoretic Text and Septuagint at all. Dead Sea Scrolls scholars indicate that its exclusion is possibly due to \"mechanical or scribal errors\" that occurred during the copying of the text.<ref>VanderKam, James C. The Dead Sea Scrolls Today. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1994.</ref> Furthermore, [[Emanuel Tov]], professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] notes that these verses were most likely accidentally omitted in the earliest stages of copying.<ref>Tov, Emanuel. Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible. Minneapolis: Fortress Press: 1992.</ref> In accordance to Tov, professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, [[Eugene Ulrich]] writes that a number of scribal errors occurred by the hand of a [[Masoretes|Masorete]] ancestor(s) that were never corrected in the later traditions of the Masoretic Text.<ref name=ulrich/> Thus, while scholars acknowledge that this topic is problematic, there are no concrete explanations for its occurrence, only weighted assumptions concerning the human scribes and their transmission.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Dead Sea Scrolls}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samuel Scroll}}\n[[Category:Dead Sea Scrolls]]\n", "text_old": "The Samuel scroll was a collective name of fragments containing parts of the [[Books of Samuel]] which were found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], discovered the first time in 1947, by a Bedouin shepherd who stumbled across them in what was termed \"The greatest archaeological find of the twentieth century\" by [[William F.

This portion is found in column 10.<ref name=flint/> The additional passage from the Samuel scroll has been integrated by the translators of the [[New Revised Standard Version]]. This version is the first of its kind to do so.\n          \n[NRSV] 10:26 Saul also went to his home at Gibeah, and with him went men of valor whose hearts God had touched. <sup>27</sup> But some worthless fellows said, \"How can this man save us?\" And they despised him and brought him no present. But he held his peace.\t\n'''Now Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the [[Tribe of Gad|Gadites]] and the [[Tribe of Reuben|Reubenites]]. He would gouge out the right eye of each of them and would not grant Israel a deliverer. No one was left of the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the [[Ammonites (people)|Ammonites]], had not gouged out. But there were seven thousand men who had escaped from the Ammonites and had entered Jabesh-gilead.'''\n11:1 About a month later, Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, \"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.\"<sup>2</sup> But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, \"On this condition I will make a treaty with you, namely that I gouge out everyone\u2019s right eye, and thus put disgrace upon all Israel.\"\n\nThus, the Samuel scroll found at Qumran includes a lengthier text than that of the traditional Masoretic Text and Septuagint. It provides readers with two key pieces of information:<ref>Abegg Jr., Martin, Peter W. Flint, and Eugene C. Ulrich. The Dead Sea Scrolls Bible. New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2002.</ref> 1. It was common for Nahash to gouge out people's right eyes; 2. the 7,000 men that fled from the Ammonites had taken refuge in Jabesh-gilead, which is why the city was being treated by Nahash as a stronghold for rebels. Therefore, the harsh behaviour and brutal punishment of the Ammonite Nahash has been illuminated by the additional excerpt in 4QSam<sup>a</sup>, allowing its readers to comprehend the text by explaining the book's complicated history.\n\nAdditionally, this fragment was included by the authoritative Jewish historian, Josephus, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]].'' He may have adopted these writings from 4QSam<sup>a</sup> and other early Scriptural texts similar to its tradition.<ref name=ulrich>Ulrich, Eugene. The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Origins of the Bible. Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1999.</ref> Josephus wrote of Nahash's clever practice of putting out the right eyes of warriors, leaving them useless in battle when their left eye was covered by their shield (5.1, 386). For those who committed insurrection or rebellion against him, he would give the ultimatum of either, cutting \"off a small member of their body, or universally perish[ing]\" (5.1, 387). Consequently, the Qumran texts and Josephus himself combine to form our \"two most ancient witnesses\",<ref name=flint/> demonstrating the validity of the missing segment from 1 Samuel 10 and thus must be considered valuable revelation.\n\nHowever, the question remains as to why this portion is missing from the Masoretic Text and Septuagint at all. Dead Sea Scrolls scholars indicate that its exclusion is possibly due to \"mechanical or scribal errors\" that occurred during the copying of the text.<ref>VanderKam, James C. The Dead Sea Scrolls Today. Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1994.</ref> Furthermore, [[Emanuel Tov]], professor at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] notes that these verses were most likely accidentally omitted in the earliest stages of copying.<ref>Tov, Emanuel. Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible. Minneapolis: Fortress Press: 1992.</ref> In accordance to Tov, professor of Theology at the University of Notre Dame, [[Eugene Ulrich]] writes that a number of scribal errors occurred by the hand of a [[Masoretes|Masorete]] ancestor(s) that were never corrected in the later traditions of the Masoretic Text.<ref name=ulrich/> Thus, while scholars acknowledge that this topic is problematic, there are no concrete explanations for its occurrence, only weighted assumptions concerning the human scribes and their transmission.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Dead Sea Scrolls}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Samuel Scroll}}\n[[Category:Dead Sea Scrolls]]\n", "name_user": "Amplifysound", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e4Q Samuelb", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Samuel_Scroll"}
