Her education focused on science and research where she developed a passion for microbiology. Her peers and teachers knew her as a quick learner and a bright student. In 1948, she teamed up with [[Rachel Fuller Brown]] to develop [[nystatin]], the first non-toxic drug treatment for fungal infections in humans. Her research had multiple applications ranging from saving infected trees to restoring paintings and artwork damaged due to mold.\n\n==Early life==\nElizabeth Lee Hazen was born on August 24, 1885, in [[Coahoma County|Rich, Mississippi]], to William Edgar Hazen and Maggie Harper Hazen.

Following her teaching job, Hazen applied and was accepted into Department of Biology at Columbia for graduate studies. She completed a Master's of Biology at [[Columbia University]] in 1917 and a Ph.D. in microbiology there in 1927, one their first female doctoral students.<ref name=WIM/><ref name=NWitLS/> She served as an [[United States Army|Army]] diagnostic laboratory technician during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Rachel Brown and Elizabeth Hazen|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/elizabeth-lee-hazen-and-rachel-fuller-brown|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018|date=June 2016}}</ref> In the 1920s, while studying at [[Columbia University]], Hazen worked with [[ricin]] and its effect on [[Botulinum toxin|''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin]].<ref name=\"The Journal of Immunology, 1927, 13: 171-218\">[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/3/171 The Journal of Immunology, 1927, 13: 171-218] General and Local Immunity to Ricin.  Accessed March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n==Scientific work==\n\n===After graduation===\n\nWith her strong science background and experience in the field, Hazen continued her research in bacteria and immunology. She was presented with an opportunity in 1931 to work with the New York State Department of Health. She accepted and worked in the Bacterial Diagnosis Laboratory Division in New York City. She had several major accomplishments there in the field of bacterial diagnosis. Among her works there were tracing an outbreak of anthrax, locating sources of tularemia, and tracing the source of food poisoning from improperly preserved foods.\n\nFrom there, she worked at the [[Wadsworth Center|New York office of the Division of Laboratories and Research of the State Department of Public Health]]. There she learned, trained, and studied about fungi and fungal diseases. She had picked up a project there and started producing her own culture collection. This collection and the research along with it helped place her name in the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].\n\n===Development of nystatin===\n\nIn 1944, she was chosen by Augustus Wadsworth, founder and head of the division, to be in charge of an investigation into fungi and their relation to bacteria and other microbes. In addition to a [[microbiologist]] (Hazen), a [[biochemist]] was also needed, and [[Rachel Fuller Brown]] was chosen.<ref name=CM>William E. Dismukes, Peter G. Pappas, Jack D. Sobel, ''Clinical mycology'', Oxford University Press US, 2003, p. 49.</ref> Hazen started researching and studying fungal diseases, specifically ones that had been widespread in the city. This included diseases such as pneumonia and moniliasis (thrush), a mouth condition that makes swallowing painful. She had a growing collection of fungi and was studying the effects and possible antifungal agents. However, Elizabeth needed someone to identify and isolate the antifungal activity occurring within samples. She was introduced by Dalldorf, the direction of the division in Albany, in 1948 to Rachel Fuller Brown, who had a laboratory in Albany.\n\nTheir research started by collecting soil samples from all over the country. Dr. Hazen cultured [[Actinomycetes]] (microorganisms most frequently having antifungal properties) from each sample and tested them to see if any fungal activity was present. If any activity was found, the soil sample was shipped to Albany, where Dr. Brown prepared samples and extracts from the cultures by isolating the chemical agents that appeared to have the property of killing fungi. These new samples would then be shipped back to New York City, where Hazen would test the samples again for toxicity. She would expose the organisms against two fungi, ''[[Candida albicans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''. She would then purify promising samples for further test of fungistatic and fungicidal activity.\n\nIn 1948, Hazen and Brown began searching for an effective antifungal agent. Hazen found a promising micro-organism in the soil of a friend's dairy farm.  She named it ''Streptomyces noursei'', after William Nourse, the farm's owner.<ref>Ana Espinel-Ingroff, ''Medical mycology in the United States: a historical analysis (1894-1996)'', Springer, 2003, p. 62.</ref> ''S. noursei'' was found to produce two antifungal substances. One turned out to be toxic for mice, but the other, when purified, turned out to be effective against [[candidiasis]] and a fungus that invaded the lungs and central nervous system. In 1950, they presented their discovery, the first safe and effective antifungal antibiotic, to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=\"halloffame\"/> They originally named it fungicidin, but later renamed it [[nystatin]], in honor of their employer, the New York State Department of Public Health.<ref name=CM/><ref name=notablebio>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Brown-Rachel-Fuller.html \"RACHEL FULLER BROWN Biography\"], Encyclopedia of World Biography website. Accessed March 27, 2009.</ref>\n\nIn fall 1950, Dr. Hazen and Dr. Brown announced at a National Academy of Sciences meeting that they had successfully produced two antifungal agents from an antibiotic. This led to their development of nystatin (named in honor of the New York State Public Health Department), the first fungicide safe for treating humans. After several animal and human studies proved satisfactory to the FDA, nystatin was put into the market through E.R. Squibb & Sons in 1954 and earning over $135,000 in its first year. Hazen and Brown donated their royalties, over $13 million, to a trust fund established under both Hazen and Brown for science and advancing women in science.\n\n==Patent==\nNystatin (antifungal / antibiotic)\nPatent Number: 2,797,183\n\nA patent was filed in late 1950 for nystatin. It took Hazen, Brown, and Squibb Research Company six and half years to secure a patent for the invention. Two reasons caused the delay. First, testing had to be done to prove the utility of the product. This required animal and human trials to be conducted for FDA approval. Nystatin was granted approval by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and released by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Squibb]] in 1954. In addition, an article published in the ''Journal of Investigative Dermatology'' in 1954 suggested Hazen and Brown exposed methods of nystatin in another article previously published in 1949. If this were the case, then it would have been over a year before a patent was filed, rendering the pending patent useless. However, after research and a signature by the author of the 1954 article stating there was no connection, the U.S. Patent Office issued a patent on June 25, 1957. It covered nystatin and the method of preparation for the next 17 years.\nHazen and Brown obtained the patent in 1957.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/HazenBrown.html \"Elizabeth Lee Hazen (1885-1975) and Rachel Fuller Brown (1898-1980)\"], Inventor of the Week Archives, [[Lemelson-MIT Prize|Lemelson-MIT Program]] website.

Her education focused on science and research where she developed a passion for microbiology. Her peers and teachers knew her as a quick learner and a bright student. In 1948, she teamed up with [[Rachel Fuller Brown]] to develop [[nystatin]], the first non-toxic drug treatment for fungal infections in humans. Her research had multiple applications ranging from saving infected trees to restoring paintings and artwork damaged due to mold.\n\n==Early life==\nElizabeth Lee Hazen was born on August 24, 1885, in [[Coahoma County|Rich, Mississippi]], to William Edgar Hazen and Maggie Harper Hazen.

Following her teaching job, Hazen applied and was accepted into Department of Biology at Columbia for graduate studies. She completed a Master's of Biology at [[Columbia University]] in 1917 and a Ph.D. in microbiology there in 1927, one their first female doctoral students.<ref name=WIM/><ref name=NWitLS/> She served as an [[United States Army|Army]] diagnostic laboratory technician during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"Profile\">{{cite web|title=Rachel Brown and Elizabeth Hazen|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/elizabeth-lee-hazen-and-rachel-fuller-brown|website=Science History Institute |accessdate=21 March 2018|date=June 2016}}</ref> In the 1920s, while studying at [[Columbia University]], Hazen worked with [[ricin]] and its effect on [[Botulinum toxin|''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin]].<ref name=\"The Journal of Immunology, 1927, 13: 171-218\">[http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/abstract/13/3/171 The Journal of Immunology, 1927, 13: 171-218] General and Local Immunity to Ricin.  Accessed March 30, 2009</ref>\n\n==Scientific work==\n\n===After graduation===\n\nWith her strong science background and experience in the field, Hazen continued her research in bacteria and immunology. She was presented with an opportunity in 1931 to work with the New York State Department of Health. She accepted and worked in the Bacterial Diagnosis Laboratory Division in New York City. She had several major accomplishments there in the field of bacterial diagnosis. Among her works there were tracing an outbreak of anthrax, locating sources of tularemia, and tracing the source of food poisoning from improperly preserved foods.\n\nFrom there, she worked at the [[Wadsworth Center|New York office of the Division of Laboratories and Research of the State Department of Public Health]]. There she learned, trained, and studied about fungi and fungal diseases. She had picked up a project there and started producing her own culture collection. This collection and the research along with it helped place her name in the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame]].\n\n===Development of nystatin===\n\nIn 1944, she was chosen by Augustus Wadsworth, founder and head of the division, to be in charge of an investigation into fungi and their relation to bacteria and other microbes. In addition to a [[microbiologist]] (Hazen), a [[biochemist]] was also needed, and [[Rachel Fuller Brown]] was chosen.<ref name=CM>William E. Dismukes, Peter G. Pappas, Jack D. Sobel, ''Clinical mycology'', Oxford University Press US, 2003, p. 49.</ref> Hazen started researching and studying fungal diseases, specifically ones that had been widespread in the city. This included diseases such as pneumonia and moniliasis (thrush), a mouth condition that makes swallowing painful. She had a growing collection of fungi and was studying the effects and possible antifungal agents. However, Elizabeth needed someone to identify and isolate the antifungal activity occurring within samples. She was introduced by Dalldorf, the direction of the division in Albany, in 1948 to Rachel Fuller Brown, who had a laboratory in Albany.\n\nTheir research started by collecting soil samples from all over the country. Dr. Hazen cultured [[Actinomycetes]] (microorganisms most frequently having antifungal properties) from each sample and tested them to see if any fungal activity was present. If any activity was found, the soil sample was shipped to Albany, where Dr. Brown prepared samples and extracts from the cultures by isolating the chemical agents that appeared to have the property of killing fungi. These new samples would then be shipped back to New York City, where Hazen would test the samples again for toxicity. She would expose the organisms against two fungi, ''[[Candida albicans]]'' and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]''. She would then purify promising samples for further test of fungistatic and fungicidal activity.\n\nIn 1948, Hazen and Brown began searching for an effective antifungal agent. Hazen found a promising micro-organism in the soil of a friend's dairy farm.  She named it ''Streptomyces noursei'', after William Nourse, the farm's owner.<ref>Ana Espinel-Ingroff, ''Medical mycology in the United States: a historical analysis (1894-1996)'', Springer, 2003, p. 62.</ref> ''S. noursei'' was found to produce two antifungal substances. One turned out to be toxic for mice, but the other, when purified, turned out to be effective against [[candidiasis]] and a fungus that invaded the lungs and central nervous system.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.<ref name=bsd>{{Man|5|tar|FreeBSD}}</ref> More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions.<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14 \u00a0| df = dmy-all }} </ref> Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref> The pax tags are better described in BSD tar's manual.<ref name=bsd/>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The name is derived from ''(t)ape (ar)chive'', as it was originally developed to write data to sequential [[Input/output|I/O]] devices with no file system of their own. The archive data sets created by tar contain various [[file system]] parameters, such as name, time stamps, ownership, file access permissions, and  [[Directory (computing)|directory]] organization.  The command line utility was first introduced in the [[Version 7 Unix]] in January 1979, replacing the tp program.<ref name=\"tar5\">{{cite web |url=https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tar&apropos=0&sektion=5&manpath=FreeBSD+7.0-RELEASE&arch=default&format=html |title=tar(5) manual page |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 May 2004 |website=freebsd.org |publisher=FreeBSD |access-date=2 May 2017}}</ref>  The [[file format|file structure]] to store this information was standardized in [[POSIX]].1-1988<ref>''IEEE Std 1003.1-1988, IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and later POSIX.1-2001,<ref>IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, ''IEEE Standard for Information Technology - Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)''</ref> and became a format supported by most modern file archiving systems.\n\n==Rationale==\nMany historic tape drives read and write variable-length data blocks, leaving significant wasted space on the tape between blocks (for the tape to physically start and stop moving).  Some tape drives (and raw disks) support only fixed-length data blocks.  Also, when writing to any medium such as a filesystem or network, it takes less time to write one large block than many small blocks.  Therefore, the tar command writes data in blocks of many 512 byte records.  The user can specify a blocking factor, which is the number of records per block; the default is 20, producing 10 kilobyte blocks.<ref>[http://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/tar/html_node/tar_130.html \"Blocking'\"] ''ftp.gnu.org''. Retrieved 28 November 2013.</ref>\n\n==File format==\nA tar archive consists of a series of file objects, hence the popular term ''tarball'', referencing how a [[tarball (oil)|tarball]]  collects objects of all kinds that stick to its surface.  Each file object includes any file data, and is preceded by a 512-byte [[Header (computing)|header]] record.  The file data is written unaltered except that its length is rounded up to a multiple of 512 bytes. The original tar implementation did not care about the contents of the padding bytes, and left the buffer data unaltered, but most modern tar implementations fill the extra space with zeros.<ref name = \"Hoo, e7z Org., 2015\" > {{ Cite web | url = http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | title = Open/Extract TAR File with Freeware on Windows/Mac/Linux | access-date = 2019-09-03 | first = James | last = Hoo | website = e7z Org. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150206035752/http://www.e7z.org/open-tar.htm | archive-date = 2015-02-06 | df = dmy-all }} </ref> The end of an archive is marked by at least two consecutive zero-filled records.  (The origin of tar's record size appears to be the 512-byte disk sectors used in the Version 7 Unix file system.) The final block of an archive is padded out to full length with zeros.\n\n===Header===\nThe file header record contains [[metadata]] about a file.  To ensure portability across different architectures with different [[Endianness|byte orderings]], the information in the header record is encoded in [[ASCII]].  Thus if all the files in an archive are ASCII text files, and have ASCII names, then the archive is essentially an ASCII text file (containing many [[Null character|NUL characters]]).\n\nThe fields defined by the original Unix tar format are listed in the table below.  The link indicator/file type table includes some modern extensions.  When a field is unused it is filled with NUL bytes.  The header uses 257 bytes, then is padded with NUL bytes to make it fill a 512 byte record.  There is no \"magic number\" in the header, for file identification.\n\nPre-POSIX.1-1988 (i.e. v7) tar header:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|100\n|File name\n|-\n|100\n|8\n|File mode\n|-\n|108\n|8\n|Owner's numeric user ID\n|-\n|116\n|8\n|Group's numeric user ID\n|-\n|124\n|12\n|File size in bytes (octal base)\n|-\n|136\n|12\n|Last modification time in numeric Unix time format (octal)\n|-\n|148\n|8\n|Checksum for header record\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Link indicator (file type)\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|Name of linked file\n|}\n\nThe pre-POSIX.1-1988 '''Link indicator''' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Link indicator field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|}\n\nSome pre-POSIX.1-1988 tar implementations indicated a directory by having a trailing [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] (/) in the name.\n\nNumeric values are encoded in [[octal]] numbers using ASCII digits, with leading zeroes.  For historical reasons, a final [[Null character|NUL]] or [[Space (punctuation)|space]] character should also be used. Thus although there are 12 bytes reserved for storing the file size, only 11 octal digits can be stored.  This gives a maximum file size of 8 [[gigabyte]]s on archived files.  To overcome this limitation, [[#Key implementations|star]] in 2001 introduced a base-256 coding that is indicated by setting the high-order bit of the leftmost byte of a numeric field. GNU-tar and BSD-tar followed this idea. Additionally, versions of tar from before the first POSIX standard from 1988 pad the values with spaces instead of zeroes.\n\nThe [[checksum]] is calculated by taking the sum of the unsigned byte values of the header record ''with the eight checksum bytes taken to be ascii spaces'' (decimal value 32).  It is stored as a six digit octal number with leading zeroes followed by a NUL and then a space. Various implementations do not adhere to this format. For better compatibility, ignore leading and trailing whitespace, and take the first six digits. In addition, some historic tar implementations treated bytes as signed. Implementations typically calculate the checksum both ways, and treat it as good if either the signed or unsigned sum matches the included checksum.\n\nUnix filesystems support multiple links (names) for the same file.  If several such files appear in a tar archive, only the first one is archived as a normal file; the rest are archived as hard links, with the \"name of linked file\" field set to the first one's name.  On extraction, such hard links should be recreated in the file system.\n\n===UStar format===\nMost modern tar programs read and write archives in the UStar (''Unix Standard TAR''<ref name=\"tar5\"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Kientzle |first=Tim |date=1995 |title=Internet File Formats |publisher=Coriolis Groups Books |isbn=978-1-883577-56-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/mac_Internet_File_Formats_1995 |access-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>) format, introduced by the POSIX IEEE P1003.1 standard from 1988.  It introduced additional header fields.  Older tar programs will ignore the extra information (possibly extracting partially named files), while newer programs will test for the presence of the \"ustar\" string to determine if the new format is in use.  The UStar format allows for longer file names and stores additional information about each file.  The maximum filename size is 256, but it is split among a preceding path \"filename prefix\" and the filename itself, so can be much less.<ref name=\"gnu.org\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_section/tar_68.html |title = GNU tar 1.32: 8.1 Using Less Space through Compression | date = 2019-02-23 | website = GNU | access-date = 2019-08-11}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Field offset\n!Field size\n!Field\n|-\n|0\n|156\n|''(several fields, same as in old format)''\n|-\n|156\n|1\n|Type flag\n|-\n|157\n|100\n|''(same field as in old format)''\n|-\n|257\n|6\n|UStar indicator \"ustar\" then NUL\n|-\n|263\n|2\n|UStar version \"00\"\n|-\n|265\n|32\n|Owner user name\n|-\n|297\n|32\n|Owner group name\n|-\n|329\n|8\n|Device major number\n|-\n|337\n|8\n|Device minor number\n|-\n|345\n|155\n|Filename prefix\n|}\n\nThe ''type flag'' field can have the following values:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Type flag field\n!Value\n!Meaning\n|-\n|'0' or ([[ASCII]] [[Null character|NUL]])\n|Normal file\n|-\n|'1'\n|[[Hard link]]\n|-\n|'2'\n|[[Symbolic link]]\n|-\n|'3'\n|[[Device file|Character special]]\n|-\n|'4'\n|[[Device file|Block special]]\n|-\n|'5'\n|[[Directory (computing)|Directory]]\n|-\n|'6'\n|[[Named pipe|FIFO]]\n|-\n| '7'\n| Contiguous file\n|-\n| 'g'\n| global extended header with meta data (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'x'\n| extended header with meta data for the next file in the archive (POSIX.1-2001)\n|-\n| 'A'\u2013'Z'\n| Vendor specific extensions (POSIX.1-1988)\n|-\n| All other values\n| reserved for future standardization\n|}\n\nPOSIX.1-1988 vendor specific extensions using link flag values 'A'..'Z' partially have a different meaning with different vendors and thus are seen outdated and replaced by the POSIX.1-2001 extensions that also include a vendor tag.\n\nType '7' (Contiguous file) is formally marked as reserved in the POSIX standard, but was meant to indicate files which ought to be contiguously allocated on disk. Few operating systems support creating such files explicitly, and hence most TAR programs do not support them, and will treat type 7 files as if they were type 0 (regular). An exception is older versions of GNU tar, when running on the [[MASSCOMP]] RTU (Real Time Unix) operating system, which supported an O_CTG flag to the open() function to request a contiguous file; however, that support was removed from GNU tar version 1.24 onwards.\n\n===POSIX.1-2001/pax===\nIn 1997, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] proposed a method for adding extensions to the tar format. This method was later accepted for the POSIX.1-2001 standard. This format is known as ''extended tar'' format or [[pax (Unix)|pax]]  format. The new tar format allows users to add any type of vendor-tagged vendor-specific enhancements. The following tags are defined by the POSIX standard:\n\n* '''atime''', '''mtime''': all three time stamps of a file in arbitrary resolution (most implementations use nanosecond granularity)\n* '''path''': path names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''linkpath''': symlink target names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''uname''', '''gname''': user and group names of unlimited length and character set coding\n* '''size''': files with unlimited size (the historic tar format is 8 GB)\n* '''uid''', '''gid''': userid and groupid without size limitation (this historic tar format was is limited to a max. id of 2097151)\n* a character set definition for path names and user/group names ([[UTF-8]])\n\nIn 2001, the Star program became the first tar to support the new format. In 2004, GNU tar supported the new format, though it does not write them as its default output from the tar program yet.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\nIt's designed so that all implementations able to read the UStar format will be able to read POSIX.1-2001 as well. The only exceptions are files that make use of extended features, such as longer file names. For compatibility, these are encoded in the tar files as special {{code|x}} or {{code|g}} type files. typically under a {{code|PaxHeaders.XXXX}} directory.<ref>{{man|1|pax|SUS}}</ref>{{rp|exthdr.name}} A Pax-supporting implementation would make use of the info, while non supporting ones like [[7-Zip]] would process them as extra files.<ref>{{cite web |title=#2116 Tars with pax headers not parsed |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/sevenzip/bugs/2116/ |website=7-Zip / Bugs | SourceForge}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n=== Command syntax ===\n tar [-options] <name of the tar archive> [files or directories which to add into archive]\nBasic options:\n* <code>-c, --create</code> \u2014 create a new archive;\n* <code>-a, --auto-compress</code>  \u2014 additionally compress the archive with a compressor which will be automatically determined by the file name extension of the archive. If the archive's name ends with {{code|*.tar.gz}} then use [[gzip]], if {{code|*.tar.xz}} then use [[XZ Utils|xz]], {{code|*.tar.zst}} for [[Zstandard]] etc.;\n* <code>-r, --append</code> \u2014 append files to the end of an archive;\n* <code>-x, --extract, --get</code> \u2014 extract files from an archive;\n* <code>-f, --file</code> \u2014 specify the archive's name;\n* <code>-t, --list</code> \u2014 show a list of files and folders in the archive;\n* <code>-v, --verbose</code> \u2014 show a list of processed files.\n\n=== Basic usage ===\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}}:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cvf archive.tar README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar\n</source>\n\nCreate an archive file {{code|archive.tar.gz}} from the file {{code|README.txt}} and directory {{code|src}} and compress it with [[gzip]] :\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -cavf archive.tar.gz README.txt src\n</source>\n\nExtract contents for the {{code|archive.tar.gz}} into the current directory:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ntar -xvf archive.tar.gz\n</source>\n\n===Tarpipe===\nA tarpipe is the method of creating an archive on the [[Standard streams#Standard output (stdout)|standard output]] file of the tar utility and piping it to another tar process on its [[Standard streams#Standard input (stdin)|standard input]], working in another directory, where it is unpacked.  This process copies an entire source directory tree including all special files, for example:\n tar cf - ''srcdir'' | tar x -C ''destdir''\n\n===Software distribution===\nThe tar format continues to be used extensively for [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[software distribution]].  *NIX-distributions use features prominently in various source- and binary-package distribution mechanisms, with most software [[source code]] made available in [[gzip]] compressed tar archives (.tar.gz, .tpz or .tgz file suffix).\n\n==Limitations==\nThe original tar format was created in the early days of UNIX, and despite current widespread use, many of its design features are considered dated.<ref>[http://duplicity.nongnu.org/new_format.html Proposed format to replace tar, by the Duplicity utility's developers.]</ref>\n\nMany older tar implementations do not record nor restore extended attributes (xattrs) or [[Access control list|ACL]]s. In 2001, [[#Key implementations|Star]] introduced support for ACLs and extended attributes, through its own tags for POSIX.1-2001 pax.  Bsdtar uses the star extensions to support ACLs.<ref name=bsd>{{Man|5|tar|FreeBSD}}</ref> More recent versions of GNU tar support Linux extended attributes, reimplementing star extensions.<ref name = \"Les bons comptes, 2014\"> {{ Cite web | url = http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | title = Extended attributes: the good, the not so good, the bad. | access-date = 2019-09-03 | date = 2014-07-15 | website = Les bons comptes | quote = The extended attributes can be very valuable for storing file metadata (e.g. author&#61;&#34;John Smith&#34;, subject&#61;&#34;country landscape&#34;), in the many cases where you do not want or can\u2019t store this data in the file internal properties. | format = html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141214001530/http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/pages/extattrs.html | archive-date = 2014-12-14 \u00a0| df = dmy-all }} </ref> Other formats have been created to address the shortcomings of tar.\n\n===Operating system support===\n[[Unix-like]] operating systems usually include tools to support tar files, as well as utilities commonly used to compress them, such as [[gzip]] and [[bzip2]]. BSD-tar has been included in [[Microsoft Windows]] since [[Windows 10 version history|Windows 10 April 2018 Update]]<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 17063 for PC\n |url=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2017/12/19/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17063-pc/\n |website=Windows Experience Blog\n |accessdate=2 July 2018\n|date=2017-12-19\n }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Containers/Tar-and-Curl-Come-to-Windows/ba-p/382409 | title=Tar and Curl Come to Windows!| date=2019-03-22}}</ref>, and there are otherwise multiple third party tools available to read and write these formats on Windows.\n\n===Tarbomb===\n{{redirect-distinguish|Tarbomb|zip bomb}}\nA '''tarbomb''', in [[Jargon File|hacker slang]], is a tar file that contains many files that extract into the working directory. Such a tar file can create problems by overwriting files of the same name in the working directory, or mixing one project's files into another. It is at best an inconvenience to the user, who is obliged to identify and delete a number of files interspersed with the directory's other contents. Such behavior is considered bad etiquette on the part of the archive's creator.\n\nA related problem is the use of [[Path (computing)|absolute path]]s or [[Directory (computing)|parent directory]] references when creating tar files. Files extracted from such archives will often be created in unusual locations outside the working directory and, like a tarbomb, have the potential to overwrite existing files. However, modern versions of FreeBSD and GNU tar do not create or extract absolute paths and parent-directory references by default, unless it is explicitly allowed with the flag {{code|-P}} or the option {{code|--absolute-names}}. The bsdtar program, which is also available on many operating systems and is the default tar utility on [[macOS|Mac OS X]] v10.6, also does not follow parent-directory references or symbolic links.<ref>[https://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bsdtar.1.html Man page for \"bsdtar\", as provided by Apple.]</ref>\n\nIf a user has only a very old tar available, which does not feature those security measures, these problems can be mitigated by first examining a tar file using the command <code>tar tf archive.tar</code>, which lists the contents and allows to exclude problematic files afterwards.\n\nThese commands do not extract any files, but display the names of all files in the archive. If any are problematic, the user can create a new empty directory and extract the archive into it\u2014or avoid the tar file entirely. Most graphical tools can display the contents of the archive before extracting them. [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] can open tar archives and display their contents. [[GNU Emacs]] is also able to open a tar archive and display its contents in a [[dired]] buffer.\n\n===Random access===\nThe tar format was designed without a centralized index or table of content for files and their properties for streaming to tape backup devices. The archive must be read sequentially to list or extract files. For large tar archives, this causes a performance penalty, making tar archives unsuitable for situations that often require random access to individual files.\n\n===Duplicates===\nAnother issue with tar format is that it allows several (possibly different) files in archive to have identical path and filename. When extracting such archive, usually the latter version of a file overwrites the former.\n\nThis can create a non-explicit (unobvious) tarbomb, which technically does not contain files with absolute paths or referring parent directories, but still causes overwriting files outside current directory (for example, archive may contain two files with the same path and filename, first of which is a [[symbolic link|symlink]] to some location outside current directory, and second of which is a regular file; then extracting such archive on some tar implementations may cause writing to the location pointed to by the symlink).\n\n==Key implementations==\n<!-- Implementations included with major unixoid OS only. No general archivers that can just \"also\" do tar - they probably just include libarchive included here. -->\n\nHistorically, many systems have implemented tar, and many [[Comparison of file archivers|general file archivers]] have at least partial support for tar (often using one of the implementations below). The history of tar is a story of incompatibilities, known as the \"tar wars\". Most tar implementations can also read and create [[cpio]] and [[pax (Unix)|pax]] (the latter actually is a ''tar''-format with [[POSIX]]-2001-extensions).\n\nKey implementations in order of origin:\n\n* '''[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] tar''', based on the original UNIX V7 tar <!-- is this correct? --> and comes as the default on the Solaris operating system\n* '''[[GNU]] tar''' is the default on most [[Linux]] distributions. It is based on the public domain implementation pdtar which started in 1987. Recent versions can use various formats, including ustar, pax, GNU and v7 formats.\n* '''[[FreeBSD]] tar''' (also '''BSD tar''') has become the default tar on most [[Berkeley Software Distribution]]-based operating systems including [[macOS|Mac OS X]]. The core functionality is available as '''libarchive''' for inclusion in other applications.  This implementation automatically detects the format of the file and can extract from tar, pax, cpio, zip, jar, ar, xar, rpm and ISO 9660 cdrom images. It also comes with a functionally equivalent cpio command-line interface.\n* '''Schily tar''', better known as '''star''', is historically significant as some of its extensions were quite popular. It is the oldest [[free software|free]] tar from 1982. It is still maintained.<ref>{{man|1|star|ManKier}}</ref> The tags are better described in BSD tar's manual.<ref name=bsd/>\n\nAdditionally, most [[Pax (Unix)|pax]] and [[cpio]] implementations can read and create many types of tar files.\n\n==Suffixes for compressed files==\n''tar'' archive files usually have the file suffix ''.tar'', e.g., ''somefile.tar''.\n\nA tar archive file contains uncompressed byte streams of the files which it contains. To achieve archive compression, a variety of [[data compression|compression]] programs are available, such as [[gzip]], [[bzip2]], [[XZ Utils|xz]], [[lzip]], [[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|lzma]], [[Zstandard|zstd]], or [[compress]], which compress the entire tar archive. Typically, the compressed form of the archive receives a filename by appending the format-specific compressor suffix to the archive file name. For example, a tar archive ''archive.tar'', is named ''archive.tar.gz'', when it is compressed by gzip.\n\nPopular tar programs like the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] and [[GNU]] versions of tar support the [[Command-line interface|command line options]] ''Z'' (compress), ''z'' (gzip), and ''j'' (bzip2) to compress or decompress the archive file upon creation or unpacking. [[GNU]] tar from version 1.20 onwards also supports the option ''--lzma'' ([[Lempel\u2013Ziv\u2013Markov chain algorithm|LZMA]]). 1.21 added support for [[lzop]] with ''--lzop''. 1.22 added support for [[XZ Utils|xz]] with ''--xz'' or ''-J''. 1.23 added support for [[lzip]] with ''--lzip''. 1.31 added support for [[Zstandard|zstd]] with ''--zstd''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2019-01/msg00001.html | title = tar-1.31 released [stable] | last = Poznyakoff | first = Sergey | date = 2019-01-02 | website = GNU mailing lists | access-date = 2019-08-06}}</ref> The decompression of these formats is handled automatically if supported filename extensions are used, and compression is handled automatically using the same filename extensions if the option ''--auto-compress'' (short form ''-a'') is passed to an applicable version of GNU tar.<ref name=\"gnu.org\"/>\n\n[[MS-DOS]]'s [[8.3 filename]] limitations resulted in additional conventions for naming compressed tar archives. (This practice has declined with [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] offering [[Long filename|long filenames]].)\n\n[[Image:Targzip.svg|thumb|400px|Tar archiving is often used together with a compression method, such as [[gzip]], to create a compressed archive.

The fort, together with Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 and Hill 339, created a triangular mutually-supporting defensive structure, which was able to provide fire suppression against any attack on \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng.<ref>Zhang, p. 97-98.</ref>\n\nAfter taking Hill 386, the PLA 163rd Division was tasked with capturing \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng, as well as striking Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 and Hills 339, 423, and 505.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 56.</ref> The attack was backed by small groups of [[tank]]s arriving on Highway 4A.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 81.</ref> These initial assaults were thwarted with heavy losses, which included nearly half of the tanks supporting the PLA 163rd Division.<ref>Zhang, p. 97.</ref> The PLA responded by conducting two enveloping thrusts on the flanks of the Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 perimeter; one was carried out by Unit 33980 of the [[54th Army (People's Republic of China)|54th Army]] to the east of Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 on the village of Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, and another was on C\u1ed3n Khoang, a position in the rear of Hill 339.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 81-82.</ref>\n\nChinese movement against C\u1ed3n Khoang was ambushed by the VPA 63rd Company at about 09:00 with an additional Vietnamese platoon moving in behind the enemy to block their retreatment, resulting in the decimation of one Chinese [[battalion]].<ref name=\"ODowd82\"/> At Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, Chinese launched massed attacks on several surrounding hills, which were stiffly contained by the defenders. On 18 February, a Vietnamese counter-attack launched by the VPA 2nd Regiment drove PLA units back to their assemble positions on Hills 409, 611, and 675; this pattern was repeated on the following days. On 23 February, the PLA stormed Phai M\u00f4n, a position to the east of Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, using six waves of attacks, of which all were rebuffed. Chinese forces had to launch twelve more charges throughout the day to finally break through Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 83.</ref>\n\nIn the Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 area, Chinese charges in mass formations had been continuously repulsed with heavy casualties. The Chinese field commanders had to switch their tactics, using small-unit attacks to flank Vietnamese positions instead of frontal attacks by human waves.<ref name=\"ODowd82\">O'Dowd, p. 82.</ref> In the evening of 19 February, the PLA launched a new wave of attacks against the Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 line, committing one company to the French Fort, one battalion to Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 and another to Hill 339. The Vietnamese forces, again, successfully held on their positions and fought off the assaults, taking a high toll on the attackers. Half of the Chinese company from the 489th Regiment assigned to capture the French Fort were lost in the assault.<ref name=\"Zhang98\">Zhang, p. 98.</ref> On 21 February, after receiving reinforcements, Chinese troops renewed their attack on the French Fort, securing most of the ground around it in a four-hour engagement. After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, the Chinese then used gasoline, explosives, and flamethrowers to demolish the fort, killing approximately 800 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians sheltering inside.<ref name=\"Zhang98\"/> At 20:00 on 22 February, Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 finally fell to the hands of the PLA 163rd Division.<ref name=\"ODowd82\"/>\n\nA Vietnamese veteran named Nguy\u1ec5n Duy Th\u1ef1c told that one of his comrades told him that he saw behind a Chinese battalion was marching into the town of Dong Dang was a  partisans team followed to support.

The fort, together with Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 and Hill 339, created a triangular mutually-supporting defensive structure, which was able to provide fire suppression against any attack on \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng.<ref>Zhang, p. 97-98.</ref>\n\nAfter taking Hill 386, the PLA 163rd Division was tasked with capturing \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng, as well as striking Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 and Hills 339, 423, and 505.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 56.</ref> The attack was backed by small groups of [[tank]]s arriving on Highway 4A.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 81.</ref> These initial assaults were thwarted with heavy losses, which included nearly half of the tanks supporting the PLA 163rd Division.<ref>Zhang, p. 97.</ref> The PLA responded by conducting two enveloping thrusts on the flanks of the Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 perimeter; one was carried out by Unit 33980 of the [[54th Army (People's Republic of China)|54th Army]] to the east of Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 on the village of Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, and another was on C\u1ed3n Khoang, a position in the rear of Hill 339.<ref>O'Dowd, p. 81-82.</ref>\n\nChinese movement against C\u1ed3n Khoang was ambushed by the VPA 63rd Company at about 09:00 with an additional Vietnamese platoon moving in behind the enemy to block their retreatment, resulting in the decimation of one Chinese [[battalion]].<ref name=\"ODowd82\"/> At Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, Chinese launched massed attacks on several surrounding hills, which were stiffly contained by the defenders. On 18 February, a Vietnamese counter-attack launched by the VPA 2nd Regiment drove PLA units back to their assemble positions on Hills 409, 611, and 675; this pattern was repeated on the following days. On 23 February, the PLA stormed Phai M\u00f4n, a position to the east of Th\u00e2m L\u0169ng, using six waves of attacks, of which all were rebuffed.

The Vietnamese forces, again, successfully held on their positions and fought off the assaults, taking a high toll on the attackers. Half of the Chinese company from the 489th Regiment assigned to capture the French Fort were lost in the assault.<ref name=\"Zhang98\">Zhang, p. 98.</ref> On 21 February, after receiving reinforcements, Chinese troops renewed their attack on the French Fort, securing most of the ground around it in a four-hour engagement. After unsuccessful attempts to negotiate, the Chinese then used gasoline, explosives, and flamethrowers to demolish the fort, killing approximately 800 Vietnamese soldiers and civilians sheltering inside.<ref name=\"Zhang98\"/> At 20:00 on 22 February, Th\u00e2m M\u00f4 finally fell to the hands of the PLA 163rd Division.<ref name=\"ODowd82\"/>\n\nA Vietnamese veteran named Nguy\u1ec5n Duy Th\u1ef1c told that one of his comrades told him that he saw behind a Chinese battalion was marching into the town of Dong Dang was a  partisans team followed to support.
