Cage culture started seriously in B.C. in the late 1980s. Smaller scale cage culture developed in freshwaters as well, including Georgian Bay, Ontario and Lake Diefenbaker, Sask. and B.C.  The oldest operating cage farm in Canada is actually in Georgian Bay.\nThe conventional net-pen is an open mesh net that is suspended within a framework constructed of steel, wood or plastic, that floats at the surface and held in place by down-haul weights. The arrangement of the cages (net pens) varies considerably. On Canada's east coast typical cages are circular and constructed of high density poly pipe (HDPE). The cages are 60m to 150m in circumference and moored individually within a grid system. On the west coast the cages are often steel with 8 to 24 cages in a group, half on each side of a main walkway. The cages are typically 15m to 30m across and 15m to 30m deep. Natural currents bring fresh, oxygenated water to the net pens and carry away soluble waste. The solid waste [[fecal material]] and uneaten feed settle to the ocean bottom near the cage site. Note that the amount of uneaten feed is negligible because the farmers cannot afford to waste feed, which is typically about 60% of their production cost.\n. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/multimedia/fig5.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403034140/http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/multimedia/fig5.jpg |archivedate=2012-04-03 }}</ref>\n\n=== Closed-containment systems with rigid walls ===\nThis system is the first alternative culture system.

These hatcheries which breed and raise juvenile fish are also utilized in freshwater stocking programs as well. \n\n==== Land-based saltwater flow-through system ====\n\nThe land-based saltwater flow-through system is mainly based on the culture of Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon is cultured in circular concrete tanks where the fresh seawater is continuously pumped into the tanks from a nearby ocean channel and wastewater piped back into the channel untreated. Like in the [[Buoyancy|floating]] bag system, portable oxygen tanks provide [[supplemental oxygen]] to the fish.<ref>[http://sres.management.dal.ca/Files/Tyedmers/LC_Impacts.pdf Ayer, N.W. & Tyedmers, P.H. Journal of Cleaner Production, 2008]</ref>\n\n==== Land-based freshwater recirculating system ====\n\nThe land-based freshwater recirculating system similar to the saltwater flow-through system consists of a series of circular concrete tanks; however, it is built inside a warehouse. The water is pumped into the tanks from an on-site freshwater well, and almost 99% of the water is  recirculated back into system through a mechanical and [[Biofiltration|bio-filtration process]]. The solid waste is collected in a holding tank to be used as fertilizer for plants.<ref>[http://sres.management.dal.ca/Files/Tyedmers/LC_Impacts.pdf Ayer, N.W. & Tyedmers, P.H. Journal of Cleaner Production, 2008]</ref> Four operations in Canada are now in commercial operation - West Creek Aquaculture in BC, Namgis in northern Vancouver Island, Watersong Farms in Manitoba, and Sustainable Blue in Nova Scotia.\n\n== Environmental Impacts of Aquaculture ==\n\nA significant issue that many aquaculture operations are faced with, particularly in marine environments, is accidental interactions between farmed fish and the surrounding natural ecosystem. There are many potential issues which can result in farmed fish interacting with wild. Various means of equipment failure can lead to farmed fish escaping their pens and dispersing into the wild:<ref>http://www2.gov.bc.ca/ Government of British Columbia</ref> \n* infrastructure failure (e.g. a result of extreme weather damage)\n* [[boat]] operations (e.g. collisions and propeller damage)\n* predation (e.g. [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lions]])\n* vandalism\n* fish handling errors\n* technical deficiencies (inadequate or damaged parts in cage systems)<ref>[http://www2.gov.bc.ca/ Government of British Columbia]</ref>\n\n[[File:IMTA cultured mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Bay of Fundy Canada.jpg|thumb|Mussels reared using IMTA practices in the Bay of Fundy.]]\nWhen farmed salmon escapes into the wild, [[interbreeding]] between wild and farmed salmon can occur if they are the same species. This may result in a decrease of genetic diversity of wild salmon in areas where the original genetic stocks of salmon still exist. In B.C. most of the salmon aquaculture is Atlantic salmon which are not only a different species from all of the native salmon, but a different genus and interbreeding is biologically impossible. Any escaped salmon in B.C. are reported to the provincial ministry of agriculture. The introduction of sterile Atlantic Salmon into aquaculture practices has begun to be adopted within Canada's aquaculture industry after a study conduction by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benfey|first=T. J.|date=1998|title=Use of triploid atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for aquaculture|url=https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/235086.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. Triploid fish is genetically modified organism which instead of having two chrosomosomes, it has three, this renders it incapable of reproduction. This technique of raising sterile fish in aquaculture prevents any breeding with wild populations if an enclosure was to fail, releasing them into the wild environment. The introduction and persistence of sea lice within marine net pens of  Salmonids is a severe issue in late summer during just before wild populations begin to spawn. As the wild populations migrate back to their spawning grounds they often come into indirect contact with farmed fish while passing by the net pens. Th close proximity which these populations interact are when sea lice are transmitted to the farmed populations. As the fish are trapped in close proximity to one another transmission of the parasite is rampant and unavoidable. These infestation of sea lice is often only deleterious to juvenile fish <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/publications/infographics-infographie/lice-pou-eng.html|title=Sea lice management at BC salmon farms|last=Government of Canada|first=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=2019-01-25|website=www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>. The farmers prevent this from happening by using approved theraputants to control the sea lice numbers. \n\nWith high densities of farmed fish within net pens, there are high concentrations of waste products beneath their pens. Fish waste is high in the nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which in high concentrations can be detrimental to farmed and natural life. There are several diets which some aquaculture practices follow to limit these two inputs into the environment <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazzari, R., & Baldisserotto, B.|first=|date=January 2008|title=Nitrogen and phosphorus waste in fish farming|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284425485_Nitrogen_and_phosphorus_waste_in_fish_farming|journal=\u2002Boletim do Instituto de Pesca Sao Paulo|volume=34(4)|pages=591-600|via=}}</ref>. The use of Integrate Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) methods are also useful for mitigating the build up of these nutrients. IMTA is based on the natural aquatic food web, the concept involves various types of organisms which are commonly farmed in aquaculture. The concept minimizes waste and need for chemical supplements, instead it uses the waste produced by finfish which is absorbed and consumed by shellfish and marine macrophytes. IMTA is also an organic method of decreasing dangerous algal blooms which are caused by high concentrations of N and P <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sci-res/imta-amti/index-eng.htm|title=Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture|last=Government of Canada|first=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=2013-01-12|website=www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>. \n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/sea-mer/ind-eng.htm Canada's Fish and Seafood Industry]\n* [http://www.aquaculture.ca/ Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance]\n* [http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/fisheries/ British Columbia's Fisheries]\n\n{{fishing industry topics|expanded=aquaculture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aquaculture In Canada}}\n[[Category:Aquaculture by country|Canada]]\n[[Category:Agriculture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Fishing in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Aquaculture]]''' is the farming of [[fish]], [[shellfish]] or [[aquatic plants]] in either fresh or saltwater, or both.<ref>Robson, P.A.

Like in the [[Buoyancy|floating]] bag system, portable oxygen tanks provide [[supplemental oxygen]] to the fish.<ref>[http://sres.management.dal.ca/Files/Tyedmers/LC_Impacts.pdf Ayer, N.W. & Tyedmers, P.H. Journal of Cleaner Production, 2008]</ref>\n\n==== Land-based freshwater recirculating system ====\n\nThe land-based freshwater recirculating system similar to the saltwater flow-through system consists of a series of circular concrete tanks; however, it is built inside a warehouse. The water is pumped into the tanks from an on-site freshwater well, and almost 99% of the water is  recirculated back into system through a mechanical and [[Biofiltration|bio-filtration process]]. The solid waste is collected in a holding tank to be used as fertilizer for plants.<ref>[http://sres.management.dal.ca/Files/Tyedmers/LC_Impacts.pdf Ayer, N.W. & Tyedmers, P.H.

There are many potential issues which can result in farmed fish interacting with wild. Various means of equipment failure can lead to farmed fish escaping their pens and dispersing into the wild:<ref>http://www2.gov.bc.ca/ Government of British Columbia</ref> \n* infrastructure failure (e.g. a result of extreme weather damage)\n* [[boat]] operations (e.g. collisions and propeller damage)\n* predation (e.g. [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lions]])\n* vandalism\n* fish handling errors\n* technical deficiencies (inadequate or damaged parts in cage systems)<ref>[http://www2.gov.bc.ca/ Government of British Columbia]</ref>\n\n[[File:IMTA cultured mussels (Mytilus edulis) in the Bay of Fundy Canada.jpg|thumb|Mussels reared using IMTA practices in the Bay of Fundy.]]\nWhen farmed salmon escapes into the wild, [[interbreeding]] between wild and farmed salmon can occur if they are the same species. This may result in a decrease of genetic diversity of wild salmon in areas where the original genetic stocks of salmon still exist. In B.C. most of the salmon aquaculture is Atlantic salmon which are not only a different species from all of the native salmon, but a different genus and interbreeding is biologically impossible. Any escaped salmon in B.C. are reported to the provincial ministry of agriculture. The introduction of sterile Atlantic Salmon into aquaculture practices has begun to be adopted within Canada's aquaculture industry after a study conduction by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benfey|first=T. J.|date=1998|title=Use of triploid atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for aquaculture|url=https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Library/235086.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>. Triploid fish is genetically modified organism which instead of having two chrosomosomes, it has three, this renders it incapable of reproduction. This technique of raising sterile fish in aquaculture prevents any breeding with wild populations if an enclosure was to fail, releasing them into the wild environment. The introduction and persistence of sea lice within marine net pens of  Salmonids is a severe issue in late summer during just before wild populations begin to spawn. As the wild populations migrate back to their spawning grounds they often come into indirect contact with farmed fish while passing by the net pens. Th close proximity which these populations interact are when sea lice are transmitted to the farmed populations. As the fish are trapped in close proximity to one another transmission of the parasite is rampant and unavoidable. These infestation of sea lice is often only deleterious to juvenile fish <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/publications/infographics-infographie/lice-pou-eng.html|title=Sea lice management at BC salmon farms|last=Government of Canada|first=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=2019-01-25|website=www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>. The farmers prevent this from happening by using approved theraputants to control the sea lice numbers. \n\nWith high densities of farmed fish within net pens, there are high concentrations of waste products beneath their pens. Fish waste is high in the nutrients, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), which in high concentrations can be detrimental to farmed and natural life. There are several diets which some aquaculture practices follow to limit these two inputs into the environment <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lazzari, R., & Baldisserotto, B.|first=|date=Jan. 2008|title=Nitrogen and phosphorus waste in fish farming|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284425485_Nitrogen_and_phosphorus_waste_in_fish_farming|journal=\u2002Boletim do Instituto de Pesca Sao Paulo|volume=34(4)|pages=591-600|via=}}</ref>. The use of Integrate Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) methods are also useful for mitigating the build up of these nutrients. IMTA is based on the natural aquatic food web, the concept involves various types of organisms which are commonly farmed in aquaculture. The concept minimizes waste and need for chemical supplements, instead it uses the waste produced by finfish which is absorbed and consumed by shellfish and marine macrophytes. IMTA is also an organic method of decreasing dangerous algal blooms which are caused by high concentrations of N and P <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/aquaculture/sci-res/imta-amti/index-eng.htm|title=Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture|last=Government of Canada|first=Fisheries and Oceans Canada|date=2013-01-12|website=www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>. \n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.ats.agr.gc.ca/sea-mer/ind-eng.htm Canada's Fish and Seafood Industry]\n* [http://www.aquaculture.ca/ Canadian Aquaculture Industry Alliance]\n* [http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/fisheries/ British Columbia's Fisheries]\n\n{{fishing industry topics|expanded=aquaculture}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aquaculture In Canada}}\n[[Category:Aquaculture by country|Canada]]\n[[Category:Agriculture in Canada]]\n[[Category:Fishing in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Jan. -> January", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture_in_Canada"}
