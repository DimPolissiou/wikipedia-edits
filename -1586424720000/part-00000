{"title_page": "Infantry of the British Army", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2016}}\n{{British Army Arms}}\n[[File:British Army Infantry Recruiting areas.png|thumb|right|Recruiting areas of British line infantry regiments]]\nThe '''Infantry of the British Army''', part of the [[Structure of the British Army|structure]] of the [[British Army]], comprises 49 [[infantry]] [[battalion]]s, from 19 [[regiment]]s. Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel.

Two notable ones depicting the modern British Army have been ''[[Spearhead (TV series)|Spearhead]]'' from the period of the late 1970s, and ''[[Soldier Soldier]]'' from the early to mid-1990s. Both are seen as reasonably accurate depictions of life in the army at those times, and both are centred on a fictional infantry regiment.

Of these, 33 battalions are part of the [[Standing army|Regular army]] and the remaining 16 a part of the [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Army Reserve]]. The British Army's Infantry forms a highly flexible organisation, taking on a variety of roles, including armoured, [[Mechanized infantry|mechanised]], [[air assault]] and [[Light infantry|light]].\n\n==Recruitment and training==\n===Recruitment===\nTraditionally, regiments that form the combat arms of the British Army (cavalry and infantry) recruit from specific areas of the country. Infantry regiments had been assigned specific areas from which they would recruit from by the mid eighteenth century. These were formalised under the [[Cardwell Reforms]] that began in the 1860s. Under this scheme, single battalion infantry regiments were amalgamated into two battalion regiments, then assigned to a depot and associated recruiting area (which would usually correspond to all or part of a county). The recruiting area (usually) would then become part of the regiment's title. It was this that gave rise to the concept of the \"county regiment\", with the local infantry regiment becoming part of the fabric of its local area.\n\nOver time, regiments have been amalgamated further, which has led to recruiting areas of individual regiments increasing in size. Often, these amalgamations have been between regiments whose recruiting areas border each other. However, there have been occasions where regiments of a similar type, but from widely different areas, have been amalgamated. Two modern examples have been the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (amalgamated from the county regiments of Northumberland, Warwickshire, [[City of London]] and Lancashire, all of which were regiments of [[fusiliers]]) and The Light Infantry (amalgamated from the county regiments of Cornwall, Somerset, Shropshire, South Yorkshire and Durham, all of which were regiments of [[light infantry]]).\n\nSince September 2007, when the most recent reforms were completed, the infantry has consisted of 18 separate regiments. The five regiments of foot guards recruit from their respective [[home nations]] (with the exception of the Coldstream Guards, which recruits from the counties through which the regiment marched between Coldstream and London). Scotland, Ireland and Wales each have a single regiment of [[line infantry]] from which they recruit (though the battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland recruit from the areas they recruited from when they were separate regiments), while England has seven line infantry and rifles regiments. The Parachute Regiment recruits nationally, while the Royal Gurkha Rifles recruits most of its serving personnel from [[Nepal]], and the [[Royal Gibraltar Regiment]] recruits from the [[UK]] and [[Commonwealth nations]]\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], infantry recruits were required to be at least {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall. They initially enlisted for seven years with the colours and a further five years with the reserve. They trained at their own regimental depot.<ref>[[War Office]], ''His Majesty's Army'', 1938</ref>\n\n===Training===\nUnlike the other trades in the army, which have separate units for basic training and specialised training, new recruits into the infantry undergo a single course at the [[Infantry Training Centre (British Army)|Infantry Training Centre Catterick]]. This course, called the \"Combat Infantryman's Course\" (CIC), lasts 26 weeks as standard and teaches recruits both the basics of soldiering (Phase 1 training) and the specifics of soldiering in the infantry (Phase 2 training). On completion of the CIC, the newly qualified infantry soldier will then be posted to his battalion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marshall|first1=Andrew|title=British Army Phase 1: Initial Military Training|url=http://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.wordpress.com/military-training/armed-forces-of-the-united-kingdom/british-army-phase-1-initial-military-training/|accessdate=27 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nFor some infantry units, the CIC is longer, due to specific additional requirements for individual regiments:\n*The Foot Guards CIC has an additional two-week enhanced drill course.\n*The Parachute Regiment CIC has an additional two-week [[P Coy|Pre-Parachute Selection]] (PPS) course.\n*The Brigade of Gurkhas CIC combines the Common Military Syllabus with the CIC, together with courses on British culture and the [[English Language]]. The Gurkha CIC lasts 37 weeks.\n\nNew officers conduct their Phase 1 training at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]]. Phase 2 training for officers, which is encompassed by the '''Platoon Commander's Battle Course''', is run at the [[Infantry Battle School]] at Brecon in Wales. It is here that leadership and tactics are taught to new platoon commanders. New NCOs and Warrant Officers are also sent on courses at Brecon when they come up for promotion. This encompasses Phase 3 training. Phase 3 training is also undertaken at the Support Weapons School at Warminster, where new officers, NCOs and soldiers are trained in the use of support weapons (mortars, anti-tank weapons) and in communications.\n\nTerritorial Infantrymen undertake preliminary training at [[Regional training centre|Regional Training Centres]] prior to attending a two-week CIC(TA) at Catterick.\n\n===Headquarters Infantry===\nHeadquarters Infantry, which is located at [[Waterloo Lines]] on Imber Road in [[Warminster]], is responsible for recruiting, manning and training policy of the Infantry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/23300.aspx|title=Headquarters Infantry|publisher=Ministry of Defence|accessdate=23 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Divisions of infantry==\n\nThe majority of the infantry in the British Army is divided for administrative purposes into four divisions. These are not the same as the ready and regenerative divisions (see below), but are based on either the geographical recruiting areas of the regiments, or the type of regiments:\n*The [[Guards Division]] has the five regiments of [[Foot Guards]].\n*The [[Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division]] has the infantry regiments from [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Ireland]].\n*The [[King's Division]] has the regiments from the north of [[England]].\n*The [[Queen's Division]] has the regiments from the east of England and the remaining regiment of [[Fusilier]]s.\n\nA further division, the [[Light Division]], grouped together [[The Light Infantry]] and [[The Royal Green Jackets]] until they were amalgamated to form [[The Rifles]] in 2007, while the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] merged with the [[Scottish Division]] in 2017 to become The Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division.\n\n===Regular army===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Guards Division!!Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division!!King's Division!!Queen's Division\n|-\n|[[Grenadier Guards]]<br />(GREN GDS)|||[[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]<br />(SCOTS)||[[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment<br />(King's, Lancashire and Border)]]<br />(LANCS)||[[Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment<br />(Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]<br />(PWRR)\n|-\n|[[Coldstream Guards]]<br />(CLDM GDS)||[[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]<br />(R WELSH)||[[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment<br />(14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]<br />(YORKS)||[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers|The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]<br />(RRF)\n|-\n|[[Scots Guards]]<br />(SG)||[[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling),<br /> 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]]<br />(R IRISH)||[[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshires,<br />Worcesters and Foresters, and Staffords)]]<br />(MERCIAN) ||[[Royal Anglian Regiment|The Royal Anglian Regiment]]<br />(R ANGLIAN)\n|-\n|[[Irish Guards]]<br />(IG)|| || ||[[Royal Gibraltar Regiment|The Royal Gibraltar Regiment]]<br />(RG)\n|-\n|[[Welsh Guards]]<br />(WG)|| || ||\n|}\n\nThere are further infantry units in the army that are not grouped in the various divisions:\n* [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]] (PARA)\n* [[Royal Gurkha Rifles|The Royal Gurkha Rifles]] (RGR)\n* [[The Rifles]] (RIFLES)\n\n===Army Reserve===\n*[[52nd Lowland Volunteers|52nd Lowland]], 6th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*[[51st Highland Volunteers|51st Highland]], 7th Battalion [[The Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment|The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (Queen's and Royal Hampshires)]]\n*[[London Regiment (1993)|The London Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Duke of Lancaster's Regiment|The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment (King's, Lancashire and Border)]]\n*5th Battalion, [[The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[The Royal Anglian Regiment]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Yorkshire Regiment|The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th & 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Mercian Regiment|The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire, Worcesters & Foresters, and Staffords)]]\n*3rd Battalion, [[Royal Welsh|The Royal Welsh]]\n*2nd Battalion, [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|The Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th & Ulster Defence Regiment)]]\n*4th Battalion, [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|The Parachute Regiment]]\n*6th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*7th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n*8th Battalion, [[The Rifles]]\n\n[[File:British Infantry 2020 Refine.png|thumb|center|920px|British Army Infantry Organization after Army 2020 Refine reform (click to enlarge)]]\n\n\n==Types of infantry==\n\n===Operations===\nWithin the British Army, there are six main types of infantry:\n*'''Armoured Infantry''' - armoured infantry are equipped with the [[Warrior Tracked Armoured Vehicle|Warrior]] armoured personnel carrier, a tracked vehicle that can deploy over all terrain.\n*'''Mechanised Infantry''' - mechanised infantry (or \"protected mobility infantry) are equipped with wheeled armoured vehicles for transporting troops. This is divided into \"heavy protected mobility infantry\" (with large vehicles such as [[Cougar (vehicle)|Mastiff]]), and \"light protected mobility infantry\" (with smaller vehicles such as [[Ocelot (vehicle)|Foxhound]]).\n*'''Light Infantry''' - light infantry are not equipped with armoured vehicles; such units may specialise in jungle and/or arctic warfare\n*'''Air Assault Infantry''' - air assault infantry are trained to be deployed using [[helicopter]]s, parachute or aircraft.\n*'''Specialised Infantry''' - infantry configured to undertake training, mentoring and assistance to indigenous forces in partner nations.\n*'''Public duties''' - infantry on public duties are essentially light infantry units undertaking primarily ceremonial tasks.\n\n===Traditions===\nThe infantry is traditionally divided into three types:\n*'''[[Foot Guards]]''' - foot guards are those infantry regiments that were formed specifically to provide close guard to the King. Soldiers in the guards were usually the best trained and equipped members of the infantry. However, they would fight in the same way as ordinary regiments.\n*'''[[Line Infantry]]''' - line infantry refers to those regiments that historically fought in linear formations, unlike light troops, who fought in loose order.  The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw expansion of the roles of the infantry. To this end, the [[company (military unit)|companies]] stationed on each flank of an infantry battalion were specialist units, with a company of [[light infantry]] trained as skirmishers to operate independently on the battlefield, and a company of [[grenadiers]], who were usually the biggest and strongest men in the battalion, operating as the lead assault troops.\n*'''[[Light Infantry]]/[[Rifle regiment|Rifles]]''' - in the late eighteenth century, the development of the [[Baker rifle]] led to the commissioning by the British Army of regiments specially trained to use the new weapon. These regiments would operate as skirmishers and [[marksman|sharpshooters]] on the edges of the field of battle. These regiments wore green rather than red tunics to enable them to blend in more with the environment, thus giving them the nickname \"green jackets\".\n\nThe tactical distinctions between infantry regiments disappeared in the late nineteenth century, but remain in tradition. In the order of precedence, the five regiments of foot guards are ranked above the ten regiments of traditional line infantry, who are ranked above the two remaining regiments of rifles.\n\n==Divisions and brigades==\nBattalions are attached permanently (semi-permanently for light role battalions) to formations.

World War]], reductions in the size of the infantry led to the amalgamation of the existing [[regimental depot]]s, together with their operational battalions, into geographically based infantry depots, each designated by a letter of the alphabet from A to O (not including I). In 1948, upon the further reduction of line infantry and rifle regiments to a single battalion, the 14 infantry depots were renamed as geographical brigades (with the exception of Depot J, which was the brigade for those regiments designated as \"light infantry\", and Depot O, which was for the two regiments of rifles<ref>Whitaker's Almanack 1956, p. 471</ref> ). These brigades assumed the administrative functions from the individual regimental depots, essentially forming what amounted to a multi-battalion regiment. This was taken a stage further following the [[1957 Defence White Paper]], when each brigade adopted a single cap badge that would be worn by all of the regiments under its administration. This led to discussions within the government regarding the flexibility of the infantry under the then present regimental system, as well as the difficulty of potentially making reductions to the size of the army owing to the emotive nature of the amalgamation of regiments into single battalions. This led to the concept of the \"[[large regiment]]\", which would use the existing brigades as the basis of new, multi-battalion infantry regiments, amalgamating the existing single-battalion regiments en masse, with each of them becoming a battalion of the new formation.<ref>More adaptations forecast in the Army: study of \"large regiment\" basis for infantry, ''The Times'', 9 March 1962</ref> This process had to a certain degree begun in the [[East Anglian Brigade|East Anglian]] and [[Green Jackets Brigade]]s, which had redesignated the regiments they were responsible for from their old names to numbered designations.<ref>Bigger infantry regiments planned by War Office, ''The Times'', 16 March 1962</ref> These two became the first large regiments as the Royal Anglian Regiment and [[Royal Green Jackets]] in 1964 and 1966 respectively.<ref>First of new large regiments, ''The Times'', 25 February 1964</ref><ref>New Green Jackets Regiment, ''The Times'', 29 May 1965</ref> Four further large regiments (The [[Queen's Regiment]], Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, [[Royal Irish Rangers]] and [[The Light Infantry|Light Infantry]]) were formed between 1966 and 1968, before the process was halted - the brigade system was abolished, with instead all of the remaining infantry regiments grouped into six administrative divisions.\n\nThe amalgamations into large regiments coincided with a planned reduction in the size of the infantry - the intention was that the junior battalion of each large regiment or brigade (prior to the implementation of the divisional structure) would be removed, whether by amalgamation or disbanding. This saw plans for the creation of four new single battalion infantry regiments:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Wales]] - [[South Wales Borderers]] and [[Welch Regiment]]\n*[[Queen's Lancashire Regiment]] - [[Lancashire Regiment]] and [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)]]\n*[[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] - [[Worcestershire Regiment]] and [[Sherwood Foresters]]\n*Royal Regiment of Gloucestershire and Hampshire - [[Gloucestershire Regiment]] and [[Royal Hampshire Regiment]]\n\nAt the same time, three more single battalion regiments elected to disband rather than amalgamate:\n*[[The Cameronians|The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles)]]\n*[[York and Lancaster Regiment]]\n*[[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders|Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's)]]\n\nThree of the regimental amalgamations, two of the regimental disbandments, plus another three of the planned disbandings of large regiment battalions, took place between 1968 and 1970. However, the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 General Election]] saw a change of administration, with the new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Heath ministry|government]] electing to review the plans. The outcome of this saw the planned amalgamation of the Gloucestershire Regiment and Royal Hampshire Regiment rescinded, together with plans to disband another four infantry battalions completely. Instead, six battalions were reduced in size to a single company:\n*2nd Battalion, [[Scots Guards]] (2nd Battalion Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsguards.co.uk/history1.htm |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=Scots Guards Association |access-date=2 September 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Royal Hampshire Regiment (Minden Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://1rhamps.com/rhamps/rhamps.html |title=Royal Hampshire Regiment from 1946-1992 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=The Royal Hampshire Regiment |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*1st Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Balaclava Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://argylls1945to1971.co.uk/AandSH_BalaklavaCoy.htm |title= 1st Battalion The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders Balaklava Company 1971|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=28 January 2015 |website=The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders History from 1945 to 1971 |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Queen's Regiment (Albuhera Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://queensregimentalassociation.org/queens-forebears.html |title=The Queen's Regiment: Formation and Forebears |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher=The Queen's Regiment Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*4th Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment (Tiger Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikingveterans.com/history-of-the-1st-battalion-the-royal-anglian-regiment/ |title=History of the 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2017 |website=Viking Veterans |publisher= |access-date=15 September 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n*3rd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets (R Company)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |title=The Royal Green Jackets: The Formation and Origins of the Regiment |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=February 2009 |website=greenjackets-net.org.uk |publisher=Royal Green Jackets Association |access-date=15 September 2018 |page=31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401111607/http://www.greenjackets-net.org.uk/assoc_new/publications/swiftandbold/sb2008.pdf |archive-date=1 April 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe battalions of the Scots Guards, Royal Hampshire Regiment, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, and Royal Green Jackets were subsequently reconstituted.\n\n===Delivering Security in a Changing World (2003)===\n{{main|Delivering Security in a Changing World}}\n[[HM Treasury]] asked for major cuts in the strength of the infantry in 2003, with at least ten battalions to be disbanded. This proved so unacceptable that, in November 2003, there was consideration to instead reducing each battalion to two rifle companies (with the third to come from the TA).<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/11/24/narmy24.xml News - Telegraph<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> By March 2004, ECAB had shown that the maximum number of battalions it was possible to cut was four. This was finally officially announced as part of the army [[Delivering Security in a Changing World|re-organisation]]. The [[arms plot]] system would be abolished; instead, individual battalions would be given fixed roles. To ensure that officers and men could continue to gain the variety of skills that the arms plot provided, the restructuring would also see a series of amalgamations of the remaining single battalion infantry regiments into large regiments. In addition, the regular army will lose four battalions. The roles are divided up as follows:\n*Armoured Infantry - 8 battalions (including Land Warfare Training Battalion)\n*Mechanised Infantry - 3 battalions\n*Light Role Infantry (including public duties and Gurkhas) - 20 battalions\n*Air Assault Infantry - 4 battalions\n*Commando Infantry - 1 battalion\n*Territorial Army Infantry - 14 battalions\n\nThe reorganisation was a hybrid of the systems used to organise the regular infantry in [[Australian Army|Australia]] and [[Canadian Army|Canada]]. Australia's regular infantry encompasses eight battalions in a single large regiment, the [[Royal Australian Regiment]] - this system is the one undertaken by the [[Scottish Division]] and the [[Light Division]]. Canada's regular infantry has three regiments, each of three battalions, which is how the [[King's Division]] and the [[Prince of Wales' Division]] will be restructured (albeit with one regiment of three battalions and one of two battalions each).\n\nIn addition to the army's infantry battalions, there are three further battalion-sized commando infantry units, which are part of the [[Royal Marines]], as well as eight field squadrons (each larger than an infantry company) of the [[RAF Regiment]], who have responsibility for the ground defence of air assets and are under the control of the [[Royal Air Force]].\n\nThe majority of infantry battalions are attached to one of the deployable brigades. However, there are a number of formations that exist to administer those infantry battalions that are not assigned to deployable brigades, but are instead available for independent deployment on [[roulement]] tours.\n\n====Guards Division====\nEach battalion in the five single battalion regiments of the Guards Division has a fixed role:\n*Armoured Infantry ([[Scots Guards|1 SG]]) - 1\n*Light Role/Public Duties ([[Grenadier Guards|1 GREN GDS]], [[Coldstream Guards|1 COLDM GDS]], [[Irish Guards|1 IG]], [[Welsh Guards|1 WG]]) - 4\n\nTwo battalions will be assigned as general light role battalions, with the other two assigned to public duties.

The ultimate conclusion of this process was to reduce the size of the [[British Army]] from approximately 102,000 to approximately 82,000 by 2020. The detail of the process was subsequently announced as ''[[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]]'' in July 2012. As part of this, the infantry was reduced in size from 36 regular battalions to 31. Of the five to be withdrawn, two were armoured infantry units, two general light infantry and one a specialist air assault infantry battalion. The withdrawal of two armoured infantry battalions is to bring this into line with the planned future operational structure, intended to see three \"armoured infantry brigades\", each with a pair of infantry battalions, forming the core of the Army's \"reaction forces\". These two battalions, along with the two light infantry battalions, will be disbanded and their personnel distributed among the remaining battalions of each regiment. The air assault battalion will be reduced to company strength, with the intention that it is assigned as a permanent [[public duties]] unit in Scotland.\n\nThe affected regiments were:\n*[[Royal Regiment of Scotland]]\n**The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland - Reduced to an incremental company and assigned to [[public duties]] in Scotland.\n*[[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n*[[Yorkshire Regiment|Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot)]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (14th/15th, 19th and 33rd/76th Foot) (Green Howards) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 3rd Battalions. 3 YORKS will eventually be renamed as 1 YORKS. 1 YORKS will eventually be renumbered as 2 YORKS.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194816/http://www.dwr.org.uk/news.php?id=2&nw=239 Duke of Wellington's Regiment]</ref>\n*[[Mercian Regiment]]\n**3rd Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n*[[Royal Welsh]]\n**2nd Battalion, The Royal Welsh (Royal Regiment of Wales) - Disbanded and personnel redistributed to 1st Battalion.\n\nIn addition, the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment (27th (Inniskilling), 83rd, 87th and Ulster Defence Regiment)]] was transferred to the administration of the [[Prince of Wales' Division]].\n\n===Army 2020 Refine===\nUnder a further review called [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020 Refine)|Army 2020 Refine]], the 1st Battalion, Scots Guards and the 4th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland will be equipped with [[Mechanised Infantry Vehicle]]s and form the core of the first Strike Brigade under the Reaction Force. Five infantry battalions will undertake the new specialist infantry role; these units will provide an increased contribution to countering terrorism and building stability overseas, and will number around 300 personnel. Four of these battalions, 1st Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Scotland; 2nd Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment; 2nd Battalion, The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment; and 4th Battalion, The Rifles, will be existing battalions, while the fifth will be formed as a new battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2016-12-15/HCWS367/|title=Strategic Defence and Security Review - Army: Written statement - HCWS367|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/sdsr-2015-and-the-army/oral/34418.html|title=Oral evidence: SDSR 2015 and the Army, HC 108|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=17 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.janes.com/article/81826/uk-to-recruit-more-gurkha-soldiers |title=UK to recruit more Gurkha soldiers |last=Ripley |first=Tim |date=18 July 2018|website=Jane's 360 |publisher= |access-date=20 July 2018 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====Guards Division====\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (1 SG) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 COLDM GDS, 1 IG) - 2\n*Light Role/Public Duties (1 GREN GDS, 1 WG) - 2\n*Public Duties (2 GREN GDS, 2 COLDM GDS, 2 SG){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve (LONDONS) - 1\n<small>All five battalions will periodically rotate roles</small>\n\n====Scottish, Welsh and Irish Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 R WELSH) - 1\n*Heavy Protected Mobility Infantry (4 SCOTS) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 SCOTS, 1 R IRISH) - 2\n*Light Role Infantry (2 SCOTS) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (1 SCOTS) - 1\n*Public Duties - (5 SCOTS){{ref|Alpha|\u03b1}}\n*Army Reserve - (6 SCOTS, 7 SCOTS, 3 R WELSH, 2 R IRISH) - 4\n\n====King's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 YORKS, 1 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 YORKS) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 LANCS, 2 MERCIAN) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 LANCS) - 1\n*Army Reserve (4 LANCS, 4 YORKS, 4 MERCIAN) - 3\n\n====Queen's Division====\n*Armoured Infantry (1 PWRR, 1 RRF) - 2\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (2 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 R ANGLIAN) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (Home Defence) (1 RG) - 1\n*Specialised Training Infantry (2 PWRR) - 1\n*Army Reserve (3 PWRR, 4 PWRR, 5 RRF, 3 R ANGLIAN) - 4\n\n====The Rifles====\n*Armoured Infantry (5 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Protected Mobility Infantry (3 RIFLES) - 1\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RIFLES, 2 RIFLES) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (4 RIFLES) - 1\n*Army Reserve (6 RIFLES, 7 RIFLES, 8 RIFLES) - 3\n\n====Other infantry regiments====\n*Light Role Infantry (1 RGR, 2 RGR) - 2\n*Parachute Infantry (2 PARA, 3 PARA, 4 PARA) - 2\n*Specialised Training Infantry (3 RGR) - 1\n<small>:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} These are the battalions represented by the [[British Army incremental infantry companies|four incremental companies]]</small>\n\n==Other regiments==\n\n===Disbanded regiments===\nOver time, a handful of infantry regiments have disappeared from the roll through disbandment rather than amalgamation.

The more recent depiction of the British Army came in the film ''[[The Mark of Cain (2007 film)|The Mark of Cain]]'', which featured an infantry regiment deployed to [[Iraq]], and the difficulties it faced.\n\n*[[Loamshire Regiment|The Loamshire Regiment]]\nThe Loamshire Regiment is used by the British Army as the [[placeholder name]] in the provision of examples for its procedures, for example in the method of addressing letters to members of the forces produced by the [[British Forces Post Office]].\n\n==Order of precedence==\n{{S-start}}\n{{order of precedence |\n  before= [[Royal Corps of Signals]]| |\n  title= [[British Army Order of Precedence|Order of precedence]]|\n  after= [[Special Air Service]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|War}}\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20040913102237/http://www.army.mod.uk/infantry/organisation/organisation.htm\n\n{{The British Army}}\n{{British Infantry}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Infantry Of The British Army}}\n[[Category:British administrative corps]]\n[[Category:Organisations based in Wiltshire]]\n", "name_user": "Hammersfan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e3rd (United Kingdom) Division", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry_of_the_British_Army"}

The club started the season with [[John Sillett]] in charge, three years after he and [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] had managed the club to victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]]. Sillett left the club in November after a run of poor results, and was replaced by [[Terry Butcher]] who arrived as a player-manager from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nCoventry's league form in the season was a contrast between a solid home record and poor away form, as they recorded only one win away from [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]]. In the FA Cup they suffered a defeat to Southampton in the fourth round, but the highlight of the season was their run in [[1991 League Cup|the League Cup]]. They beat holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 5\u20134 in the fourth round, before losing to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-final.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1990\u201391 season was [[Coventry City]]'s 24th consecutive campaign in the [[Football League First Division]], following their promotion from the Second Division in 1967.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} The club had achieved its first major trophy a few seasons earlier, with victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]] Final under the joint management of [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] and [[John Sillett]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/coventry-city-1987-fa-cup-11336205 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Coventry City's 1987 FA Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur 32 years on |author=Andy Turner |date=16 May 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> and Sillett remained manager at the beginning of 1990\u201391. Their league form in the seasons following the cup win was solid with tenth, seventh,{{sfn|Brassington|1989|p=125}} and twelfth-place finishes,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} although the 1989\u201390 season finished disappointingly as they won just one of their final nine games.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}} They failed to defend the FA Cup in 1987\u201388, exiting in the fourth round,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=108}} and they suffered one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history in 1989\u201390, as they [[Sutton United 2\u20131 Coventry City (1989)|lost 2\u20131]] to non-league [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in the third round.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/03/vault-sutton-united-coventry-city-fa-cup-1989-giantkilling |work=The Guardian |date=3 January 2014 |author=Paul Campbell |title=From the Vault: Sutton United knock Coventry City out of the FA Cup in 1989}}</ref> They suffered another embarrassing FA Cup defeat the following season, this time to Third Division [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]], but fared better in [[1989\u201390 Football League Cup|the League Cup]], reaching the semi-final with a 5\u20130 win over Sunderland before losing to eventual winners [[Nottingham Forest]] in the semi-final.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nSillett did not buy or sell very heavily in the summer of 1990, before the start of the season. Supporters were calling for a strong midfield player to be bought to bolster the team, but defender [[Andy Pearce]] was the only major signing, bought from [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] for \u00a315,000. [[Greg Downs]], who had been part of the Cup winning squad, moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer. Despite this lack of transfer activity and the poor finish to the previous season, Sillett was optimistic that the club could challenge for a top six finish or even the league title.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}}\n\n==Season summary==\n===Football League First Division===\nThe season started poorly, with a win against a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] side the only highlight of the opening games. Under pressure to change something, and with regulars [[Dean Emerson]] and [[Lloyd McGrath]] injured, Sillett signed players from Europe to add depth to the team. Winger [[Zolt\u00e1n Csucs\u00e1nszky]] came from Hungary for a trial, but sustained an injury in his first game, a friendly.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}} Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Perdomo]] had more success, arriving on loan from [[Genoa F.C.|Genoa]] and impressing Sillett in six games for Coventry. The club were unable to sign him permanently, however.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}}\n\nResults did not improve significantly as the autumn progressed, and morale was poor. Star striker [[David Speedie]] was dropped from the team after a run of poor performances, and by November the club were in sixteenth position.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> In November, the club announced that Sillett was leaving his post as manager. Historians do not know if he resigned or was sacked, although he was not working due to sickness at the time and had been planning to leave at the end of the season anyway. The club appointed [[Terry Butcher]] as Sillett's replacement.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Butcher was still an active player for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the time, and had been captain of the [[England national football team|England team]] during their World Cup semi-final against West Germany in the summer, so he arrived as [[player\u2013manager]] and the club had to pay a transfer fee of up to \u00a3450,000 for him. His first game, at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], ended in a defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/2019/november/supremos-a-look-at-the-career-of-terry-butcher/ |work=Coventry City F.C. |title=SUPREMOS: A look at the career of Terry Butcher |date=20 November 2019 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDespite success in the League Cup, Butcher had to wait more than a month before the club won a league game under his management and supporters feared that the club would be dragged into a relegation battle. Butcher bought [[Ray Woods (footballer)|Ray Woods]] from Wigan Athletic, but was forced to sell the promising young players [[Steve Livingstone]] and [[Tony Dobson]], who both left for Blackburn Rovers. Speedie was also sold, moving to Liverpool for \u00a3675,000, following a series of sub-par performances and a poor relationship with Butcher. Butcher then signed [[Kenny Sansom]] and [[Stewart Robson]], and the club began to record some better results,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} recording home wins against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea, amongst others. By mid-April, with three games remaining, Coventry had moved up to ninth place in the table, but two defeats from their last three games saw them finish in sixteenth.<ref name=\"Statto\"/>\n\nThe league season had been a contrast between excellent form at [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]], where the side won ten of nineteen games and were unbeaten after the November defeat to Liverpool, and a poor away record with just one win,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} at Sheffield United early in the season.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> The player of the year was [[Kevin Gallacher]], who scored eleven league goals.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=307}} As a player, Terry Butcher had only started seven games, six in the league, as a result of injury. [[Cyrille Regis]] played well throughout the season, but did not score heavily and was released by Coventry at the end of the season, moving to rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.]]{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}}\n\n===FA Cup===\nFollowing defeats to lower-division and non-league opposition in the previous two seasons, Coventry faced the possibility of another upset in the third round against [[Wigan Athletic]].{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Wigan had some future top-flight players in their team including [[Peter Atherton]], who later signed for Coventry, but were having a poor season, being in seventeenth place in [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. The first match, played at Highfield Road on 5 January 1991, ended in a 1\u20131 draw as [[Micky Gynn]]'s opener in the 66th minute was cancelled out by a last minute equaliser by Wigan's [[Darren Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockneylatic.co.uk/match-reports/1990-1991/943-coventry-city-1-wigan-athletic-1 |title=1990-1991 - Coventry City 1 Wigan Athletic 1 |author=John Patrick Heeley |work=Cockney Latic |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> The replay at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]] was four days later and was won 1\u20130 by Coventry courtesy of another Gynn goal.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=11v11 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/wigan-athletic-v-coventry-city-09-january-1991-216384/ |title=Wigan Athletic v Coventry City, 09 January 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth round in late January, a few days after their defeat in the League Cup quarter final, City again drew 1\u20131 at home against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] with [[Alan Shearer]] equalising after Brian Kilcline's opener.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} In the replay at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]] City had eight players out through injury,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} and lost [[Steve Ogrizovic]] after 24 minutes.

The campaign began in September with a two-legged second-round tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], in which City won both their home and away games by scores of 4\u20132 and 3\u20132 respectively. In the third round, on 31 October, they played at home to [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]]. The visitors dominated the first half but were unable to score, and then suffered the set-back of losing former Coventry player [[Dave Bamber]]. Coventry improved after half-time, and won the game 3\u20130 with goals from Speedie, Livingstone and Regis.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\nIn the fourth round on 28 November,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} Coventry faced [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in Butcher's third match as manager. Forest had won the tournament in both of the previous two seasons, beating City on each occasion, and started the match as favourites. After 35 minutes, Coventry had moved into a 4\u20130 lead with Gallacher claiming a [[hat-trick]] and [[Steve Livingstone]] also scoring. Forest responded, however, and [[Nigel Clough]], son of manager [[Brian Clough]], stunned Highfield Road with a hat-trick of his own, scored in just seven minutes and leaving the score 4\u20133 at half time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/flashback-coventry-citys-famous-5-4-8194722 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Flashback: Coventry City's famous 5-4 League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest on this day in 1990 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 November 2014 |author=Aidan McCartney}}</ref> Forest levelled the match through a [[Garry Parker]] goal after half-time, but Livingstone's goal with half an hour remaining won the game for Coventry by a 5\u20134 scoreline.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=124}}\n\nCity had to wait almost two months for their next match in the competition, the quarter-final tie at home to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] of the Second Division. Coventry created few chances in the game, with player-manager Terry Butcher sustaining an injury as well, and [[Nigel Pearson]]'s 9th-minute goal was enough to win the

The club started the season with [[John Sillett]] in charge, three years after he and [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] had managed the club to victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]]. Sillett left the club in November after a run of poor results, and was replaced by [[Terry Butcher]] who arrived as a player-manager from [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]].\n\nCoventry's league form in the season was a contrast between a solid home record and poor away form, as they recorded only one win away from [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]]. In the FA Cup they suffered a defeat to Southampton in the fourth round, but the highlight of the season was their run in [[1991 League Cup|the League Cup]]. They beat holders [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] 5\u20134 in the fourth round, before losing to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in the quarter-final.\n\n==Background==\nThe 1990\u201391 season was [[Coventry City]]'s 24th consecutive campaign in the [[Football League First Division]], following their promotion from the Second Division in 1967.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} The club had achieved its first major trophy a few seasons earlier, with victory in the [[1986\u201387 FA Cup]] Final under the joint management of [[George Curtis (footballer, born 1939)|George Curtis]] and [[John Sillett]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/coventry-city-1987-fa-cup-11336205 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Coventry City's 1987 FA Cup final victory over Tottenham Hotspur 32 years on |author=Andy Turner |date=16 May 2019 |accessdate=17 March 2020}}</ref> and Sillett remained manager at the beginning of 1990\u201391. Their league form in the seasons following the cup win was solid with tenth, seventh,{{sfn|Brassington|1989|p=125}} and twelfth place finishes,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=161}} although the 1989\u201390 season finished disappointingly as they won just won of their final nine games.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}} They failed to defend the FA Cup in 1987\u201388, exiting in the fourth round,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=108}} and they suffered one of the biggest upsets in FA Cup history in 1989\u201390, as they [[Sutton United 2\u20131 Coventry City (1989)|lost 2\u20131]] to non-league [[Sutton United F.C.|Sutton United]] in the third round.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/03/vault-sutton-united-coventry-city-fa-cup-1989-giantkilling |work=The Guardian |date=3 January 2014 |author=Paul Campbell |title=From the Vault: Sutton United knock Coventry City out of the FA Cup in 1989}}</ref> They suffered another embarrassing FA Cup defeat the following season, this time to Third Division [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton]], but fared better in [[1989\u201390 Football League Cup|the League Cup]], reaching the semi-final with a 5\u20130 win over Sunderland before losing to eventual winners [[Nottingham Forest]] in the semi-final.{{sfn|Brown|1998|pp=116\u2013118}}\n\nSillett did not buy or sell very heavily in the summer of 1990, before the start of the season. Supporters were calling for a strong midfield player to be bought to bolster the team, but defender [[Andy Pearce]] was the only major signing, bought from [[Halesowen Town F.C.|Halesowen Town]] for \u00a315,000. [[Greg Downs]], who had been part of the Cup winning squad, moved to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on a free transfer. Despite this lack of transfer activity and the poor finish to the previous season, Sillett was optimistic that the club could challenge for a top six finish or even the league title.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}}\n\n==Season summary==\n===Football League First Division===\nThe season started poorly, with a win against a struggling [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] side the only highlight of the opening games. Under pressure to change something, and with regulars [[Dean Emerson]] and [[Lloyd McGrath]] injured, Sillett signed players from Europe to add depth to the team. Winger [[Zolt\u00e1n Csucs\u00e1nszky]] came from Hungary for a trial, but sustained an injury in his first game, a friendly.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=121}} Uruguayan [[Jos\u00e9 Perdomo]] had more success, arriving on loan from [[Genoa F.C.|Genoa]] and impressing Sillett in six games for Coventry. The club were unable to sign him permanently, however.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}}\n\nResults did not improve significantly as the autumn progressed, and morale was poor. Star striker [[David Speedie]] was dropped from the team after a run of poor performances, and by November the club were in sixteenth position.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> In November, the club announced that Sillett was leaving his post as manager. Historians do not know if he resigned or was sacked, although he was not working due to sickness at the time and had been planning to leave at the end of the season anyway. The club appointed [[Terry Butcher]] as Sillett's replacement.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Butcher was still an active player for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] at the time, and had been captain of the [[England national football team|England team]] during their World Cup semi-final against West Germany in the summer, so he arrived as [[player\u2013manager]] and the club had to pay a transfer fee of up to \u00a3450,000 for him. His first game, at home to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], ended in a defeat.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ccfc.co.uk/news/2019/november/supremos-a-look-at-the-career-of-terry-butcher/ |work=Coventry City F.C. |title=SUPREMOS: A look at the career of Terry Butcher |date=20 November 2019 |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nDespite success in the League Cup, Butcher had to wait more than a month before the club won a league game under his management and supporters feared that the club would be dragged into a relegation battle. Butcher bought [[Ray Woods (footballer)|Ray Woods]] from Wigan Athletic, but was forced to sell the promising young players [[Steve Livingstone]] and [[Tony Dobson]], who both left for Blackburn Rovers. Speedie was also sold, moving to Liverpool for \u00a3675,000, following a series of sub-par performances and a poor relationship with Butcher. Butcher then signed [[Kenny Sansom]] and [[Stewart Robson]], and the club began to record some better results,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} recording home wins against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea, amongst others. By mid-April, with three games remaining, Coventry had moved up to ninth place in the table, but two defeats from their last three games saw them finish in sixteenth.<ref name=\"Statto\"/>\n\nThe league season had been a contrast between excellent form at [[Highfield Road stadium|Highfield Road]], where the side won ten of nineteen games and were unbeaten after the November defeat to Liverpool, and a poor away record with just one win,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} at Sheffield United early in the season.<ref name=\"Statto\"/> The player of the year was [[Kevin Gallacher]], who scored eleven league goals.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=307}} As a player, Terry Butcher had only started seven games, six in the league, as a result of injury. [[Cyrille Regis]] played well throughout the season, but did not score heavily and was released by Coventry at the end of the season, moving to rivals [[Aston Villa F.C.]]{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}}\n\n===FA Cup===\nFollowing defeats to lower-division and non-league opposition in the previous two seasons, Coventry faced the possibility of another upset in the third round against [[Wigan Athletic]].{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=122}} Wigan had some future top-flight players in their team including [[Peter Atherton]], who later signed for Coventry, but were having a poor season, being in seventeenth place in [[Football League Division Three|Division Three]]. The first match, played at Highfield Road on 5 January 1991, ended in a 1\u20131 draw as [[Micky Gynn]]'s opener in the 66th minute was cancelled out by a last minute equaliser by Wigan's [[Darren Patterson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockneylatic.co.uk/match-reports/1990-1991/943-coventry-city-1-wigan-athletic-1 |title=1990-1991 - Coventry City 1 Wigan Athletic 1 |author=John Patrick Heeley |work=Cockney Latic |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> The replay at [[Springfield Park (Wigan)|Springfield Park]] was four days later and was won 1\u20130 by Coventry courtesy of another Gynn goal.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=18 March 2020 |work=11v11 |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/wigan-athletic-v-coventry-city-09-january-1991-216384/ |title=Wigan Athletic v Coventry City, 09 January 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth round in late January, a few days after their defeat in the League Cup quarter final, City again drew 1\u20131 at home against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] with [[Alan Shearer]] equalising after Brian Kilcline's opener.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} In the replay at [[The Dell, Southampton|The Dell]] City had eight players out through injury,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=123}} and lost [[Steve Ogrizovic]] after 24 minutes.

The campaign began in September with a two-legged second-round tie against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], in which City won both their home and away games by scores of 4\u20132 and 3\u20132 respectively. In the third round, on 31 October, they played at home to [[Hull City F.C.|Hull City]]. The visitors dominated the first half but were unable to score, and then suffered the set-back of losing former Coventry player [[Dave Bamber]]. Coventry improved after half-time, and won the game 3\u20130 with goals from Speedie, Livingstone and Regis.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\nIn the fourth round on 28 November,{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}} Coventry faced [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], in Butcher's third match as manager. Forest had won the tournament in both of the previous two seasons, beating City on each occasion, and started the match as favourites. After 35 minutes, Coventry had moved into a 4\u20130 lead with Gallacher claiming a [[hat-trick]] and [[Steve Livingstone]] also scoring. Forest responded, however, and [[Nigel Clough]], son of manager [[Brian Clough]], stunned Highfield Road with a hat-trick of his own, scored in just seven minutes and leaving the score 4\u20133 at half time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/flashback-coventry-citys-famous-5-4-8194722 |work=Coventry Telegraph |title=Flashback: Coventry City's famous 5-4 League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest on this day in 1990 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=28 November 2014 |author=Aidan McCartney}}</ref> Forest levelled the match through a [[Garry Parker]] goal after half-time, but Livingstone's goal with half an hour remaining won the game for Coventry by a 5\u20134 scoreline.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=124}}\n\nCity had to wait almost two months for their next match in the competition, the quarter-final tie at home to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] of the Second Division. Coventry created few chances in the game, with player-manager Terry Butcher sustaining an injury as well, and [[Nigel Pearson]]'s 9th minute goal was enough to win the tie.{{sfn|Brown|1998|p=306}}\n\n==Final league table==\n{{main|1990\u201391 Football League}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:

His cousin, Kirill Fedorovich Nesturkh, then a young physicist, invited him to attend the defense of the dissertation of [[Abram Ioffe|Abram Fedorovich Ioffe]]. Physics lecturer Vladimir Konstantinovich Lebedinskiy had explained to Theremin the dispute over Ioffe's work on the [[electron]]. On 9 May 1913 Theremin and his cousin attended Ioffe's dissertation defense. Ioffe's subject was on the elementary photoelectric effect, the magnetic field of cathode rays and related investigations. In 1917 Theremin wrote that Ioffe talked of electrons, the photoelectric effect and magnetic fields as parts of an objective reality that surrounds us every day, unlike others that talked more of somewhat abstract formulae and symbols. Theremin wrote that he found this explanation revelatory and that it fit a scientific \u2013 not abstract \u2013 view of the world, different [[Order of magnitude|scales of magnitude]], and matter.<ref name=\"ima19\">{{cite web |title=Termens Kindheit |url=http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |work=Erinnerungen an A.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;Joffe |language=German |accessdate=2009-04-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511013506/http://www.ima.or.at/theremin/?page_id=19&cat=1 |archivedate=2009-05-11 }}</ref> From then on Theremin endeavoured to study the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]], in the same way he had studied the macrocosm with his hand-built telescope.<ref name=\"ima55\"/> Later, Kyrill introduced Theremin to Ioffe as a young experimenter and physicist, and future student of the university.\n\nTheremin recalled that while still in his last year of school, he had built a million-volt [[Tesla coil]] and noticed a strong glow associated with his attempts to ionise the air. He then wished to further investigate the effects using university resources. A chance meeting with Abram Fedorovich Ioffe led to a recommendation to see Karl Karlovich Baumgart, who was in charge of the physics laboratory equipment. Karl then reserved a room and equipment for Theremin's experiments. Abram Fedorovich suggested Theremin also look at methods of creating gas fluorescence under different conditions and of examining the resulting [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|light's spectra]]. However, during these investigations Theremin was called up for [[World War I]] military service.<ref name=\"ima54\">{{cite web |author=L. S.

Theremin and others evacuated the station, sending equipment east on rail cars. Theremin then detonated explosives to destroy the 120-meter-high antennae mast before traveling to Petrograd to set up an international listening station.

His cousin, Kirill Fedorovich Nesturkh, then a young physicist, invited him to attend the defense of the dissertation of [[Abram Ioffe|Abram Fedorovich Ioffe]]. Physics lecturer Vladimir Konstantinovich Lebedinskiy had explained to Theremin the dispute over Ioffe's work on the [[electron]]. On 9 May 1913 Theremin and his cousin attended Ioffe's dissertation defense. Ioffe's subject was on the elementary photoelectric effect, the magnetic field of cathode rays and related investigations. In 1917 Theremin wrote that Ioffe talked of electrons, the photoelectric effect and magnetic fields as parts of an objective reality that surrounds us every day, unlike others that talked more of somewhat abstract formulae and symbols.

He then wished to further investigate the effects using university resources. A chance meeting with Abram Fedorovich Ioffe led to a recommendation to see Karl Karlovich Baumgart, who was in charge of the physics laboratory equipment. Karl then reserved a room and equipment for Theremin's experiments. Abram Fedorovich suggested Theremin also look at methods of creating gas fluorescence under different conditions and of examining the resulting [[Fluorescence spectroscopy|light's spectra]].

He developed performance locations that could automatically react to dancers' movements with varied patterns of sound and light.\n\nThe Soviet consulate had apparently demanded he divorce Katia.

At the time, the reasons for his return were unclear; some claimed that he was simply homesick, while others believed that he had been kidnapped by Soviet officials. Beryl Campbell, one of Theremin's dancers, said his wife Lavinia \"called to say that he had been kidnapped from his studio\" and that \"some Russians had come in\" and that she felt that he was going to be spirited out of the country.<ref name=\"t\">''[[Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey]]'', written, directed and produced by Steven M.
