Under Mayer's management, MGM became the film industry's most prestigious movie studio, accumulating the largest concentration of leading writers, directors and stars in Hollywood.\n\nMayer was born in the Russian Empire and grew up poor in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. He quit school at 12 to support his family and later moved to Boston and purchased a small vaudeville theater in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] called the \"Garlic Box\" as it catered to poorer Italian immigrants. He renovated and expanded several other theaters in the Boston area catering to higher end audiences. After expanding and moving to Los Angeles, he teamed with film producer [[Irving Thalberg]], and they developed hundreds of high quality story-based films, noted for their wholesome and lush entertainment. Mayer handled the business of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions, while Thalberg, still in his twenties, supervised all MGM productions.\n\nDuring his long reign at MGM, Mayer acquired many enemies as well as admirers. Some stars did not appreciate his attempts to control their private lives, while others saw him as a solicitous father figure. He believed in wholesome entertainment and went to great lengths to discover new actors and develop them into major stars.<ref>McLean, Adrienne L.

Mayer & Son. An immigrant unskilled in any trade, he struggled to earn a living. Young Louis quit school at age twelve to work with his father and help support his family.<ref name=Eyman22/> He roamed the streets with a cart that said \"Junk Dealer\", and collected any scrap metal he came across. When the owner of a tin business, John Wilson, saw him with his cart, he began giving him copper trimmings which were of no use, and Mayer considered Wilson to be his first partner and his best friend. Wilson remembered that he was impressed with the boy's good manners and bright personality.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 23\">Eyman, p. 23.</ref> Whenever Mayer visited Saint John in later years, he placed flowers on Wilson's grave, just as he did on his mother's.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 23\"/>\n\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I had been to his hometown.

His family was poor, and Mayer's father spoke little English and had no valuable skills. It thereby became young Mayer's ambition and drive which supported the family.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 25\">Eyman, p. 25.</ref> With his family speaking mostly Yiddish at home, his goal of self-education when he quit school was made more difficult.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 25\"/>\n\nIn his spare time, he hung around the York theater, sometimes paying to watch the live vaudeville shows. He became enamored with the entertainment business. Then in 1904 the 20-year-old Mayer left Saint John for [[Boston]], where he continued for a time in the scrap metal business, got married, and took a variety of odd jobs to support his new family when his junk business lagged.\n\n==Early career==\nMayer renovated the Gem Theater, a rundown, 600 seat [[burlesque house]]\nin [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]],<ref>Rosenberg, Chaim M. ''The Great Workshop: Boston's Victorian Age''. Arcadia Publishing (2004), p. 60.</ref> which he reopened on November 28, 1907 as the Orpheum, his first movie theater.

Mayer paid [[D.W. Griffith]] $25,000 for the exclusive rights to show ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) in New England. Although Mayer made the bid on a film that one of his scouts had seen, but he had not, his decision netted him over $100,000.<ref>Id. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}</ref> Mayer partnered with [[Richard A. Rowland]] in 1916 to create [[Metro Pictures Corporation]], a talent booking agency, in New York City.\n\nTwo years later, Mayer moved to Los Angeles and formed his own production company, [[Louis B. Mayer Pictures|Louis B. Mayer Pictures Corporation]]. The first production was 1918's ''Virtuous Wives''. A partnership was set up with [[B. P. Schulberg]] to make the Mayer-Schulberg Studio\n\nIn late 1922, Mayer was introduced to [[Irving Thalberg]], then working for [[Universal Pictures]]. Mayer was searching for someone to help him manage his small, but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg made an immediate positive impression on Mayer, writes biographer Roland Flamini. Later that evening, after Thalberg had left, Mayer told the studio's attorney, Edwin Loeb, to let Thalberg know that if he wanted to work for Mayer, he would be treated like a son.<ref name=Flamini>Flamini, Roland. ''Thalberg: The Last Tycoon and the World of M-G-M'', Crown (1994).</ref>{{rp|46}}\n\nAlthough their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man's age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at [[Louis B. Mayer Productions]]. Years later, Mayer's daughter, [[Irene Mayer Selznick]], found it hard to believe that anyone \"so boyish could be so important.\"<ref name=Flamini/>{{rp|47}} According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, he lacked Thalberg's strong ability to combine making films of quality with gaining commercial success.<ref name=Flamini/>{{rp|47}}\n\n==Heading new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios==\n\nMayer's big breakthrough was in April 1924 when his company subsequently merged with two others to become [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM).  The 24-year-old Thalberg was made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production.\n\n[[Marcus Loew]], owner of the [[Loews Theatres|Loew's]] chain, merged Metro Pictures, [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s [[Goldwyn Pictures Corporation]], and Mayer Pictures into Metro-Goldwyn. Loew had bought Metro and Goldwyn some months before, but could not find anyone to oversee his new holdings on the West Coast. Mayer, with his proven success as a producer, was an obvious choice. He was named head of studio operations and a Loew's vice president, based in Los Angeles, reporting to Loew's longtime right-hand man [[Nicholas Schenck]]. He would hold this post for the next 27 years. Before the year was out, Mayer added his name to the studio with Loew's blessing, renaming it Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.\n\nLoew died in 1927, and Schenck became president of Loew's. Mayer and Schenck hated each other intensely; Mayer reportedly referred to his boss, whose name was pronounced \"Skenk\", as \"Mr. Skunk\" in private.<ref>{{cite book |title=MGM: When the Lion Roars |last=H\u00e1y |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter H\u00e1y (Canadian author, publisher and bookseller) |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Turner Publications |location= |isbn=978-1-878685-04-9 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/mgmwhenlionroars0000hayp |accessdate= |url-access=registration }}</ref> Two years later, Schenck agreed to sell Loew's \u2013 and MGM \u2013 to [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]], which angered Mayer. But despite his important role in MGM, Mayer was not a shareholder, and had no standing to challenge the sale. So he instead used his Washington connections to persuade the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to delay the merger on [[antitrust]] grounds. During the summer of 1929, Fox was severely injured in an auto accident. By the time he recovered, the [[stock market crash of 1929|stock market crash]] had wiped out his fortune, destroying any chance of the deal going through even if the Justice Department had lifted its objections. Nonetheless, Schenck believed Mayer had cost him a fortune and never forgave him, causing an already frigid relationship to get even worse.\n\n===Working with Irving Thalberg===\n[[File:With Mayer-Shearer.jpg|thumb|Mayer (r) with Irving Thalberg and Thalberg's wife, actress [[Norma Shearer]], 1932]]\nMayer and Thalberg were a brilliant team that worked well together. They relied on each other, and neither operated unilaterally.<ref>Eyman, p. 111.</ref> Mayer took charge of the business part of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions. Thalberg, eventually called the \"boy wonder\", took charge of all MGM productions. Director [[Joseph M. Newman|Joseph Newman]] said that their skills complemented each other well, with Thalberg having a great story mind, and Mayer having superior business acumen.\n\nThey shared a guiding philosophy, to make the best motion pictures they could at any cost, even if it meant reshooting the entire picture.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 120\">Eyman, p. 120.</ref> More important than showing a consistent profit with their films was, for them, to see MGM become a high quality studio. That goal began with their early silent films, when stars such as [[Greta Garbo]], Mayer's discovery, acted on lush settings with spectacular camera work.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 120\"/>\n\nAlthough they initially got along well, their relationship frayed over philosophical differences. Thalberg preferred literary works over the crowd-pleasers Mayer wanted. He ousted Thalberg as production chief in 1932, while Thalberg was recovering from a heart attack, and replaced him with producer [[David O. Selznick]].\n\nBut MGM received a serious blow when Thalberg died suddenly on September 14, 1936, at age 37. His death came as a shock to Mayer and everyone at MGM and the other studios.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 231\">Eyman, p. 231.</ref> Mayer issued statements to the press, calling Thalberg \"the finest friend a man could ever have&nbsp;... the guiding inspiration behind the artistic progress on the screen.\" His funeral was a major news event in Los Angeles. All the studios observed five minutes of silence, while MGM closed its studio for the entire day.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 231\"/>\n\nMayer dedicated MGM's front office building and christened it the Thalberg Building.<ref>Eyman, p. 232.</ref> He had the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] establish the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], given to producers to recognize their exceptional careers, now considered one of the most prestigious awards in the Hollywood film industry.<ref>Hay, p. 145.</ref>\n\n===Continued success after Thalberg's death===\nAfter Thalberg died, many in Hollywood expected Mayer to \"stumble and fall.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 12\">Eyman, p. 12.</ref> Director [[Joseph M. Newman]] saw the studio start to change for the worse.<ref>Eyman, p. 233.</ref> Some actors were affected, such as [[Luise Rainer]], winner of Hollywood's first back-to-back Oscars, who felt that the death of Thalberg marked the death of her career: \"Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.\" <ref>Verswijver, Leo. ''Movies Were Always Magical'', McFarland Publ. (2003), e-book.</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] was also concerned, feeling that with Thalberg gone, the concept of the quality \"big\" picture \"pretty much went out the window.\"<ref>Leider, Emily W. ''Myrna Loy: The Only Good Girl in Hollywood'', Univ. of California Press (2011), p. 184.</ref>\n\nHowever, MGM under Mayer's leadership continued to produce successful movies. Mayer was made head of production as well as studio chief. For the next ten years, MGM grew and thrived.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 12\"/> 1939 was an especially \"golden\" year: besides distributing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]],'' MGM released ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]],'' ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' ''[[At the Circus]],'' and ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]''. Garbo laughed in ''[[Ninotchka]],'' ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' won an Oscar, and was nominated for seven, and [[Hedy Lamarr]], another of Mayer's personal discoveries, made her film debut.\n\nMayer became the first person in American history to earn a million-dollar salary. For nine years from 1937, when he earned $1,300,000\u2014equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1300000|1937|r=0}}}} today,{{Inflation-fn|US}}Mayer was the highest-paid man in the United States.<ref name=friedrich1986>{{cite book|last=Friedrich|first=Otto|title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in 1940s|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-20949-4|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x8AFchW4JsC&lpg=PP1&dq=city%20of%20nets&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Managing MGM==\n\n===Management style===\nIn his overall management skills, Mayer was considered a great executive, someone who could have run General Motors equally as well as a large studio like MGM, said producer [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]].<ref name=Eyman7/> He worked at the studio all the time, and decisively, without any fixed schedule, but didn't like paperwork.<ref name=Eyman284/> Some said Mayer had a lot in common with newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Hearst had financed various MGM pictures, while MGM benefited by having film reviews included nationwide in the Hearst newspapers.\n\nHearst, 20 years Mayer's senior, affectionately referred to Mayer as \"son\" and they became good friends.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\">Eyman, p. 115.</ref> Mayer took Hearst's suggestion to build himself an office bungalow on the MGM lot, something Hearst said was appropriate for a studio head: \"Everybody of distinction from all over the world comes to Los Angeles and everybody who comes wants to see your studio and they all want to meet you and do meet you, so put on a few airs son, and provide the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\"/> Director [[Clarence Brown]] pointed out that overall, Mayer's skill was similar to Hearst's in that they both learned by doing. What Mayer couldn't do on his own, he hired the best talent he could find to do for him. \"Like Hearst and [[Henry Ford]],\" said Brown, \"he was an executive genius.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\"/>\n\nMayer's temper was widely known, but most people knew that his sudden bursts of anger faded quickly. With those working underneath him, he was usually patient and preferred to leave department heads alone, and would fire executives if they failed to produce successful films over a long period.<ref name=Eyman284>Eyman, p. 284.</ref>\n\n===Growth of the studio===\nAt its peak in the 1940s, MGM employed six thousand people, had three entrances, and covered 185 acres in [[Culver City]], California, outside of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=Hogan>Hogan, David J. ''The Wizard of Oz FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Life, According to Oz'', Hal Leonard Corp. (2014), e-book.</ref> It had forty cameras and sixty sound machines, used on its six separate lots, and connected with its own rail line.<ref name=Hogan/><ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\">Eyman, p. 1.</ref> About 2,700 people ate in the commissary every day. Power was supplied by an in-house electrical plant which could light a town of 25,000.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\"/> MGM also maintained a police force of fifty officers\u2014larger than that of Culver City itself.<ref name=Eyman2>Eyman, p. 2.</ref>\n\n\"Anywhere from sixteen to eighteen pictures were being shot at one time\", remembers actress [[Ann Rutherford]]. \"They were either shooting or preparing to shoot on every sound stage.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\"/>\n\n===Creating a \"star system\"===\nMayer helped create what is termed the [[Star system (filmmaking)|\"star system\"]]. At one point he explained the process he went through in creating a star:\n\n{{quote|The idea of a star being born is bush-wah. A star is made, created; carefully and cold-bloodedly built up from nothing, from nobody. All I ever looked for was a face. If someone looked good to me, I'd have him tested. If a person looked good on film, if he photographed well, we could do the rest.&nbsp;... We hired geniuses at make-up, hair dressing, surgeons to slice away a bulge here and there, rubbers to rub away the blubber, clothes designers, lighting experts, coaches for everything\u2014fencing, dancing, walking, talking, sitting and spitting.<ref>Eyman, p. 266.</ref>}}\n\n===Hiring actors and staff===\nDuring MGM's growth period, Mayer traveled often, and among his personal discoveries were [[Greta Garbo]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref name=Eyman8>Eyman, p. 8.</ref> He also signed up dancing team [[Marge Champion|Marge]] and [[Gower Champion]] and discovered [[Mario Lanza]], then a young tenor from Philadelphia, who Mayer hoped to turn into a \"singing [[Clark Gable]]\".<ref>Eyman, p. 377.</ref>\n\nWhen hiring new actors, he typically wanted them to agree to stay with the studio for either three or seven years, during which time they would become one of the MGM \"family.\" The studio usually succeeded in hiring those it wanted since they offered the highest salaries.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 288\">Eyman, p. 288.</ref> With executives, Mayer took more time before taking them, wanting to know them first on a personal level. He respected intelligence and talent overall, said manager Joe Cohn: \"One time he said to me, 'Never be afraid of hiring a fellow smarter than you are. You'll only learn from them.'\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 288\"/>\n\nMayer took pride in his ability to hire good people, and once hired, he left  them alone to do their job without interference. That policy held true whether the person was a producer, a department head or simply a janitor.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\">Eyman, p. 289.</ref> As a result, while other studios went through continuous upheavals or reorganizations, Mayer's hands-off policy kept MGM stable and sound, where employees felt their jobs were secure.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\">Eyman, p. 287.</ref>\n\nWhen meeting a new employee, he always told them to come to him personally for help with any problems. Some, like [[Barbara Stanwyck]], considered this attitude to be \"pompous\" however, since he used his position to meddle into people's lives. Others, such as actor [[Edward G. Robinson]], after his first meeting Mayer, said \"I found him to be a man of truth&nbsp;... Behind his gutta-percha face and roly-poly figure, it was evident there was a man of steel\u2014but well-mannered steel.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 295.</ref> British director [[Victor Saville]] remembers him as being \"the best listener. He wanted to know. He was the devil's advocate. He would prod you and question you and suck you dry of any knowledge.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 301.</ref>\n\n===Working with studio people===\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=L.B. wasn't crude at all. Super-intelligent people might have found him common or crass. He may have been an immigrant with a good suit of clothes, but never forget that this was a man working hard to be an American.|source=\u2014actress [[Esther Williams]]<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\"/>}}\n\nHis attitude and conversational style was both professional and animated, sometimes \"theatrical\", observed June Caldwell, [[Eddie Mannix]]'s secretary. \"Bombastic and colorful, but I never heard him use nasty language&nbsp;... he had a great loyalty to everybody, and everybody respected him. And he would listen ... You could work with him.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 315.</ref> His manners were considered \"impeccable.\"\n\nWith MGM's film output as high as one film each week, he never panicked over a bad picture. If somebody suggested canceling a movie and cutting the studio's losses, when a film had consistent production problems, Mayer would typically refuse.<ref name=Eyman284/> He relied on his instinct and intuition, said actress [[Esther Williams]]. Although he didn't read full scripts, if he was given the framework of a story, he could assemble the pieces needed to see if it could be a successful film.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 300\">Eyman, p. 300.</ref>\n\nOccasionally, when producers, directors, writers or actors were deadlocked over how to handle a problem in a film, he would mediate. On [[Rosalie (film)|''Rosalie'']], for instance, when [[Nelson Eddy]] refused to sing a song he thought was too melodramatic, its songwriter, [[Cole Porter]], went to Mayer and played it for him. Mayer was moved to tears by the song, and told Eddy to sing it. \"Imagine making Louis B. Mayer cry,\" Porter later told friends.<ref>Furia, Michael L. ''America's Songs: The Stories Behind the Songs of Broadway, Hollywood, and Tin Pan Alley'', Routledge (2008), p. 143.</ref>\n\n===Response to technical innovations===\nWith regard to any technical issues with productions, Mayer left the details and solutions to MGM's engineers. He, though, like other top film executives and Hollywood stars in the 1920s and early 1930s, was often too quick to dismiss news of inventions and major innovations on the horizon that might profoundly change the movie industry or possibly challenge in the future the growing dominance of films in the realm of American entertainment.<ref name=FilmDaily32>[https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume660newy#page/252 \"Television, Wide Screen, Color Dismissed by Louis B. Mayer\"], ''The Film Daily'' (New York, N.Y.), August 17, 1932, pp. 1, 6. [[Internet Archive]], San Francisco, California. Retrieved August 20, 2018.</ref> Beyond the well-entrenched aspect of sound by 1932, other technologies being discussed at that time in newspapers and on studio lots included color features, widescreen formatting, and even early television.<ref name=FilmDaily32/> In August 1932, after an \"exclusive\" interview with Mayer in New York, ''[[The Film Daily]]'' reported the movie mogul's assertions that the noted developments would never impact motion pictures in substantial, meaningful ways:\n\n{{quote|Peering into the industry's future, Louis B. Mayer ... sees no great production development or invention which will again revolutionize the business, as in the instance of sound. Television, color, and wide film he dismissed as promising no important influence on motion pictures. Television, according to the M-G-M chieftain, is impractical from the standpoint of any association with motion pictures. In taking this attitude he stressed the rapidity at which images must be transmitted in television and pointed out that satisfactory  results cannot be obtained with this requirement.\n\nExcept in some short subjects, such as educationals, [[Travel documentary|travelogues]], and novelties, color has no place on the screen, Mayer asserted. It has the effect of detracting interest from the story being told. In addition the cost must be considered. Examining the possibility of the wide screen, Mayer said that it eliminates the intimacy allowed by the standard-sized screen. It might be effectively used in mob scenes, he observed, but pointed out the impracticability of switching back and forth between projectors capable of projecting both sizes of pictures.<ref name=FilmDaily32/>}}\n\n===Being a father figure===\n\nWith many of his actors, Mayer was like an overprotective mother. In some cases, especially with child actors, he could become closely involved in managing their everyday life, telling them where to shop, where to dine, or what doctor to visit. He liked giving suggestions about how they could take better care of themselves.<ref>Eyman, p. 285.</ref> He sometimes arranged marriages, and coping with occupational hazards like alcoholism, suicide, and eccentric sexual habits were as much a part of his job as negotiating contracts with stars and directors.<ref>Eyman, p. 6.</ref> When he learned that [[June Allyson]] was dating David Rose, for instance, he told her to stop seeing him: \"If you care about your reputation, you cannot be seen with a married man.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 290.</ref>\n[[Image:Louis B Mayer and Joan Crawford.jpg|thumb|left|Mayer with [[Joan Crawford]] at the premiere of ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', 1953.<br>\"To me,\" she once stated, \"L.B. Mayer was my father, my father confessor, the best friend I ever had.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 22\">Hay, p. 22.</ref>]]\nStories about his sobbing or rages have often been repeated in books, but few employees ever saw that part of him. \"Mr. Mayer was to me like a father\", said [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. \"He really thought of the people under contract as his boys and girls.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/> Mayer's paternalism could extend to productions; for example, he revised the ''Dr. Kildare'' stories in order to keep an ailing [[Lionel Barrymore]], who became wheelchair-bound with [[arthritis]], on the job.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/>\n\nSome, such as young starlet [[Elizabeth Taylor]], didn't like Mayer overseeing her life; she called him a \"monster.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 294.</ref> While [[Mickey Rooney]], another young actor, and someone who co-starred with Elizabeth when she was 12, formed the opposite impression: \"He was the daddy of everybody and vitally interested in everybody. They always talk badly about Mayer, but he was really a wonderful guy ... he listened and you listened.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 323.</ref>  Rooney spoke from experience, as he himself had some confrontations with Mayer, notes film historian Jane Ellen Wayne:\n\n{{quote|Mayer naturally tried to keep all his child actors in line, like any father figure. After one such episode, Mickey Rooney replied, \"I won't do it. You're asking the impossible.\" Mayer then grabbed young Rooney by his lapels and said, \"Listen to me! I don't care what you do in private. Just don't do it in public. In public, behave. Your fans expect it. You're Andy Hardy! You're the United States! You're the Stars and Stripes. Behave yourself! You're a symbol!\" Mickey nodded. \"I'll be good, Mr. Mayer. I promise you that.\" Mayer let go of his lapels, \"All right\", he said.<ref name=Wayne>Wayne, Jane Ellen. ''The Leading Men of MGM'', Carroll & Graf (2005) p. 246.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Rooney-Garland-ebay-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'', 1938]]\nOne of Rooney's repeat costars in ''Andy Hardy'' and other films was [[Judy Garland]], with whom he made nine films. While Garland stated in her autobiography that Mayer molested her, this was contested by multiple people who knew her personally and/or a number of reputable biography authors.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In the late 1940s she began having personal problems which affected her acting, and Mayer tried his best to protect her star reputation while continuing to have her overworked and making money for MGM. She suffered from addictions to various prescription drugs, severely disordered eating and domestic strains, as well as a multitude of issues with her mental health. This was largely the result of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, her mother, and the era's ignorance of diet and drugs.<ref name=\"Hay, 275\">Hay, p. 275.</ref>  When her absences caused the production of ''[[Summer Stock]]'' to go far over budget, producer [[Joe Pasternak]] suggested that Mayer cut his losses and cancel the picture. Mayer refused, telling him, \"Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, it'll finish her.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 406.</ref> in what some consider to be his last attempt at holding on to her fame for the benefit of the studio. She completed the film, but during her next picture, [[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|''Annie Get Your Gun'']], the studio finally ran out of patience. Costar [[Howard Keel]] recalls that \"she began to fall apart.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 275\"/>\n\nAfter the studio fired her, she attempted suicide. This would not be her first or last attempt and her early, tragic death is often considered to be the result of the abuse she received while working at Metro Goldwyn Mayer under Mayer's control.\n\n===Developing child stars===\nMayer wanted the studio to develop a number of child stars, necessary for producing family-oriented stories. The studio provided all the essential services, such as formal education and medical care. They were given acting or dancing tutors. Mayer loved children, writes biographer Kitty Kelley: \"They provided the magic that brought millions of people stampeding into theaters every week ... They were the good, clean, wholesome elements of the folksy entertainment that was MGM's specialty.\"<ref>Kelley, Kitty. ''Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star'', Simon & Schuster (1981), ch. 1.</ref>\n\n[[Jackie Coogan]], then 11, marked the studio's debut using child stars with his role in ''The Rag Man'' in 1925. During Hollywood's golden age, MGM had more child actors than any other studio, including [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Freddie Bartholomew]], [[Margaret O'Brien]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Roddy McDowall]].<ref>Hay, p. 137.</ref>\n\n==Themes, musicals and formula==\nWhile MGM's films during the 1920s and 1930s were often notable for having adult themes and strong female stars, such as Greta Garbo, after Thalberg's early death in 1936, Mayer promoted a change in emphasis to more male leads, family themes, and child stars.<ref>Hay, p. 161.</ref> And unusual for a movie mogul, he took moral positions in his movies, especially when it came to portraying family values\u2014as in the ''Andy Hardy'' series.<ref name=Eyman8/> One of Mayer's proudest moments came when Mickey Rooney, who starred as Andy Hardy, was given a special award by the Academy in 1942 for \"furthering the American way of life.\"<ref>Hay, p. 165.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I am going to make pictures you can take your mother and your children to see. I am not going to make pictures for the sake of awards or for the critics. I want to make pictures for Americans and for all people to enjoy. When I send my pictures abroad, I want them to show America in the right light\u2014and not that we are a nation chiefly of drunks, gangsters and prostitutes.|source=\u2014Louis B. Mayer<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 450\">Eyman, p. 450.</ref>}}\n\nMayer tried to express an idealized vision of men, women, and families in the real world they lived in. He also believed in beauty, glamour, and the \"star system.\"<ref name=Eyman8/> In MGM films, \"marriage was sacrosanct and mothers were objects of veneration.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 3.</ref> Author Peter Hay states that Mayer \"cherished the Puritan values of family and hard work.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/> When he hired writers, he made those objectives clear at the outset, once telling screenwriter Frances Marion that he never wanted his own daughters or his wife to be embarrassed when watching an MGM movie. \"I worship good women, honorable men, and saintly mothers\", he told her.<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/> Mayer was serious about that, once coming from behind his desk and knocking director [[Erich von Stroheim]] to the floor when he said that all women were whores.<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/><ref>Thomson, David. ''Have You Seen&nbsp;... ?'', Knopf Doubleday (2008), p. 544.</ref>\n\nMayer knew that formula in his themes and stories usually works. He felt that the general public, especially Americans, like to see stars, spectacle, and optimism on screen, and if possible, with a little sentiment attached. They don't like to be challenged or instructed, but comforted and entertained.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 9\">Eyman, p. 9.</ref>\n\nTherefore, having messages was less important to Mayer than giving his audience pure entertainment and escapism. In his screen dramas, he wanted them to be melodramatic, whereas in comedies, he often laced them with a strong doses of sentimentality. \"He loved swaggering, charismatic hams like [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Marie Dressler]]\", writes Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 9\"/>\n\n[[Musical film|Musicals]] were high on his list of preferred genres. Anxious to make more of them, on a hunch, he asked songwriter [[Arthur Freed]] to be associate producer for [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']]. As Mayer hoped, Freed went on to produce a number of films considered among the best musicals ever made: ''For Me and My Gal'', ''Girl Crazy'', ''Meet Me in St. Louis'', ''The Harvey Girls'', ''The Pirate'', ''Easter Parade'', ''The Barkleys of Broadway'', ''On the Town'', ''An American in Paris'', ''Singin' in the Rain'', ''The Band Wagon'', and ''Gigi''. Mayer's greatest contributions to posterity are said to be his musicals.<ref>Eyman, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==World War II problems==\n\nUnlike [[Charlie Chaplin]], who produced ''The Great Dictator'', the other, much larger Hollywood studios lacked the freedom to make such independent films. Mayer understood that the Germans could ban or boycott Hollywood films throughout much of Europe, with serious economic implications, since 30 to 40 percent of Hollywood's income came from Europe's audiences.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 276\">Eyman, p. 276.</ref> Nevertheless, MGM produced ''[[Three Comrades (1938 film)|Three Comrades]]'' in 1938, despite movie censor [[Joseph Breen]] warning Mayer that the film was \"a serious indictment of the German nation and people and is certain to be violently resented by the present government in that country.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 276\"/>\n\nAfter the war erupted in Europe in September 1939, Mayer authorized the production of two anti-Nazi films, ''[[The Mortal Storm]]'' and ''Escape.'' At the same time, Warner Brothers produced ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]].'' The German government informed the studios that \"those films would be remembered by Germany ''when'' \u2014 not ''if'' \u2014 they won the war\", writes Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 278\">Eyman, p. 278.</ref> Warners had to post guards to protect the family of actor [[Edward G. Robinson]], and the Germans threatened Mayer with a boycott of all MGM films.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 278\"/>\n\nFrom September 1939, until January 1940, all films that could be considered anti-Nazi were banned by the [[Hays Office]].<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 277\">Eyman, p. 277.</ref> The U.S. ambassador to England, [[Joseph Kennedy]], told the studios to stop making pro-British and anti-German films.<ref name=Wapshott/> Kennedy felt that \"British defeat was imminent and there was no point in America holding out alone: 'With England licked, the party's over,' said Kennedy.\"<ref name=Wapshott>Wapshott, Nicholas. ''The Sphinx: Franklin Roosevelt, the Isolationists, and the Road to World War II'', W.W. Norton & Co. (2015), e-book. {{ISBN|978-0393088885}}.</ref>\n\nDefying those pleadings, MGM produced ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'', a simple story about a British family trying to get by during the bombing [[the Blitz|Blitz]] in London.<ref>Hay, p. 191.</ref> [[Eddie Mannix]], Mayer's assistant, agreed that \"someone should salute England. And even if we lose $100,000, that'll be okay.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 344.</ref>\n\n[[File:Greer Garson-publicity.JPG|thumb|left|Greer Garson, 1940s]]\nMayer wanted British actress [[Greer Garson]], his personal discovery, to star, but she refused to play a matronly role.<ref>Eyman, p. 354.</ref> Mayer implored her \"to have the same faith in me\" that he had in her.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 345\">Eyman, p. 345.</ref> He read from the script, having her visualize the image she would present to the world, \"a woman who survives and endures. She was London. No, more than that, she was&nbsp;... England!\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 345\"/> Garson accepted the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. ''Mrs. Miniver'' won six Academy Awards and became the top box office hit of 1942.\n\n[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] both loved the film, said historian Emily Yellin, and Roosevelt wanted prints rushed to theaters nationwide. The [[Voice of America]] radio network broadcast the minister's speech from the film, magazines reprinted it, and it was copied onto leaflets and dropped over German-occupied countries. Churchill sent Mayer a telegram claiming that \"''Mrs. Miniver'' is propaganda worth 100 battleships.\"<ref>Yellin, Emily. ''Our Mother's War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Simon & Schuster (2004), p. 100.</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] (1960 biographer of Mayer, [[#Further reading|below]]), wrote in his ''New York Times'' review that ''Mrs. Miniver'' was the finest film yet made about the war, \"and a most exalting tribute to the British.\"<ref>Troyan, Michael. ''A Rose for Mrs. Miniver: The Life of Greer Garson'', Univ. of Kentucky Press (1999), e-book. ASIN: B00A6IOY1W.</ref>\n\nThe following year, 1943, saw the release of another Oscar-winning film, this one aimed at supporting the home front, entitled [[The Human Comedy (film)|''The Human Comedy.'']] It was Mayer's personal favorite and the favorite of its director, [[Clarence Brown]]. Mayer also assisted the U.S. government by producing a number of short films related to the war, and helped produce pro-American films such as ''[[Joe Smith, American]],'' in 1942.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 277\"/>\n\n==Declining years at MGM==\nThe post-war years saw a gradual decline in profits for MGM and the other studios. The number of high-grossing films in 1947 dwindled to six, compared to twenty-two a year earlier. MGM had to let go many of its top producers and other executives. Mayer was pressured to tighten expenses by the studio's parent company, although Mayer's reputation as a \"big-picture man\" would make that difficult. They began looking for someone, another Thalberg, to redo the studio system.\n\nIn the interim, Mayer kept making \"big pictures.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\">Eyman, p. 408.</ref> When RKO turned down financing of [[Frank Capra]]'s [[State of the Union (film)|''State of the Union'']] in 1948 because of its expensive budget, Mayer took on the project. He filled the cast with MGM stars including [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Van Johnson]], [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Angela Lansbury]], but the film only broke even. Nicholas Schenck called Mayer and insisted that he \"cut, cut\", recalls director [[George Sidney]]. Mayer replied, \"A studio isn't salami, Nick.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\"/> \"L.B. would ask only one question: 'Can you make it better?' It was all he cared about\", said Sidney.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\"/>\n\nAs pressure built to find a new Thalberg-style manager to handle production, [[Dore Schary]] was brought in from RKO, and began work on July 14, 1948, as vice president in charge of production, working under Mayer's direction.\n\nSome long-time studio executives saw this change as a sign of the eventual downfall of MGM. When she heard the news, Lillian Burns Sidney, George Sidney's wife, marched into Mayer's office and announced, \"Now you've done it. You've ruined everything.\" She told Mayer that she was afraid Schary would eliminate all future musicals, comedies and adventure movies, and replace them with the \"message\" movies that he preferred. She expressed her fear: \"They won't have need for anybody around here. Even you! You'll see.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 411.</ref>\n\nBy mutual consent with Loew's, Mayer resigned from MGM in August 1951. On his final day, as he walked down a red carpet laid out in front of the Thalberg Building, executives, actors and staff lined the path and applauded him for his contributions. \"He was so respected,\" said June Caldwell, Eddie Mannix's secretary.<ref>Eyman, p. 444.</ref> Many assumed that his leaving meant the end of an era. Actor [[Turhan Bey]] said, \"In every meaningful way, it was the end of Hollywood.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 445.</ref>\n\nMayer, for a period after he left MGM, tried to finance and assemble a new group of film stars and directors to produce his own films as an independent. He told the press that his films would carry on in the tradition of MGM's previous style of film subjects.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 450\"/>\nIn 1952 he became chairman of the board and the single largest shareholder in [[Cinerama]], and had hoped to produce a property he owned, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'', in the widescreen process, but without success. He left Cinerama in 1954 when the company was sold.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family===\nMayer had two daughters from his first marriage to Margaret Shenberg (1883-1955).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/?name=Margaret_Shenberg&birth=1883&birth_x=0-0-0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry.com}}</ref> The elder of these, Edith (Edie) Mayer (1905 \u2013 1987), whom he would later become estranged from and disinherit, married producer [[William Goetz]] (who served as vice president for Twentieth-Century Fox and later became president of [[Universal Pictures]]). The younger, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]] (1907\u20131990), married producer [[David O. Selznick]] and became a successful theatrical producer.\n\nAt home, Mayer was boss. \"In our family, all the basic decisions were made by him\", remembers his nephew, Gerald Mayer. \"He was a giant.&nbsp;... Were we afraid of him? Jesus Christ, yes!\"<ref>Eyman, p. 296.</ref> And although he never spoke Yiddish at the office, he sometimes spoke Yiddish with \"some of the relatives\", said his daughter Irene.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\"/>\n\nMayer's activities for the Jewish Home for the Aged led to a strong friendship with [[Edgar Magnin]], the rabbi at the Wilshire Temple in Los Angeles. \"Edgar and Louis B. virtually built that temple\", said Herbert Brin.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 297\">Eyman, p. 297.</ref>\n\nMayer reportedly was in love with actress [[Jean Howard]] and pursued her energetically but without success.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vbs2JeSNOUEC&pg=PA134&dq=louis+b.+mayer+charlie+feldman+jean+howard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmuITr7e3WAhXK2SYKHWGKDpYQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=louis+b.+mayer+charlie+feldman+jean+howard&f=false|title=When Blanche Met Brando: The Scandalous Story of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"|first=Sam|last=Staggs|date=July 25, 2006|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment and leisure===\nAt his home on Saint Cloud Road in the [[East Gate Bel Air, Los Angeles|East Gate Bel Air]] neighborhood, Sundays were reserved for brunches in what was an open house, which often included visiting statesmen or former Presidents, along with various producers, directors or stars.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/> There would be a buffet supper, drinks, and later a movie.<ref>Eyman, p. 135.</ref> Mayer drank almost no alcohol, cared nothing for fine cuisine, and didn't gamble, but might play penny-ante card games for fun.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 300\"/>\n\nFor leisure activities, he liked going to the [[Hollywood Bowl]], especially the annual [[John Philip Sousa]] concert. Sousa's patriotic-style music built up his pride in America, and he \"would be stoked with extra exuberance for days afterward\", states Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 297\"/> Mayer also enjoyed ballet and opera, and concerts where violinist [[Jascha Heifetz]] or pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]] performed.<ref>Eyman, p. 299.</ref>\n\nWhile Mayer seldom discussed his early life, his partiality towards Canada would sometimes be revealed, especially after Canada and the United States entered World War II. On one occasion in 1943, [[Mary Pickford]] called to tell him she met a movie-struck [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot from New Brunswick, where Mayer grew up. Mayer asked her to have him drop by the studio. The pilot, Charles Foster, recalled his visit: \"Mary's driver took me through the gates, and I saw this little man come running down the steps of the Thalberg Building. I thought, 'Oh, he's sent a man to greet me.' And I got out of the car, and this man threw his arms around me and said, 'Welcome to my studio.' \"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\">Eyman, p. 310.</ref>\n\nMayer took him on a personal tour of the studio, and Foster remembers that \"everybody waved to him and he waved back. He spoke to people and knew them by name. I was shocked.\" <ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\"/> Mayer invited him back for lunch the next day. But before Foster arrived, Mayer had invited every Canadian in Hollywood to meet the flier, including [[Fay Wray]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Jack Carson]], [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]], [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Ann Rutherford]], and even his main competitor, [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]. Mayer told him, \"When this war is over, if you want to come back here, I'll find a job for you.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 311.</ref> Foster said \"It was like he was the father I never knew.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nActive in Republican Party politics, Mayer served as the vice chairman of the [[California Republican Party]] in 1931 and 1932, and as its state chairman in 1932 and 1933.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNma11zsi6MC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67|title=Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2011|last=Ross|first=Steven J.|pages=67\u201371}}</ref> As a delegate to the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] in Kansas City, Louis B.

It was considered one of the finest racing stables in the United States and raised the standards of the California racing business. Among his horses were [[Your Host (horse)|Your Host]], sire of [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]]; the 1945 [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|U.S. Horse of the Year]], [[Busher (horse)|Busher]]; and the 1959 [[Preakness Stakes]] winner, [[Royal Orbit]]. Eventually Mayer sold off the stable, partly to finance his divorce in 1947. His 248 horses brought more than $4.4&nbsp;million. In 1976, ''Thoroughbred of California'' magazine named him \"California Breeder of the Century\".\n\n==Death==\nLouis B.

At the event, screenwriter [[Charles Brackett]] presented the award and thanked him for guiding MGM's \"production policy with foresight, aggressiveness and with a real desire for taste and quality.\" Mayer was also thanked for founding and developing new personalities and for bringing the Hollywood \"star system into full flower.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 439.</ref>\n\nAlthough Mayer was often not liked and even feared by many in the studio, editor [[Sam Marx]] explains that \"his reputation is far worse than it should be.

Under Mayer's management, MGM became the film industry's most prestigious movie studio, accumulating the largest concentration of leading writers, directors and stars in Hollywood.\n\nMayer was born in the Russian Empire and grew up poor in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. He quit school at 12 to support his family and later moved to Boston and purchased a small vaudeville theater in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]] called the \"Garlic Box\" as it catered to poorer Italian immigrants. He renovated and expanded several other theaters in the Boston area catering to higher end audiences. After expanding and moving to Los Angeles, he teamed with film producer [[Irving Thalberg]], and they developed hundreds of high quality story-based films, noted for their wholesome and lush entertainment. Mayer handled the business of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions, while Thalberg, still in his twenties, supervised all MGM productions.\n\nDuring his long reign at MGM, Mayer acquired many enemies as well as admirers. Some stars did not appreciate his attempts to control their private lives, while others saw him as a solicitous father figure. He believed in wholesome entertainment and went to great lengths to discover new actors and develop them into major stars.<ref>McLean, Adrienne L.

His parents were Jacob Meir and Sarah Meltzer, and he had two sisters\u2014Yetta, born in c. 1878, and Ida, born in c. 1883.

Mayer & Son. An immigrant unskilled in any trade, he struggled to earn a living. Young Louis quit school at age twelve to work with his father and help support his family.<ref name=Eyman22/> He roamed the streets with a cart that said \"Junk Dealer\", and collected any scrap metal he came across. When the owner of a tin business, John Wilson, saw him with his cart, he began giving him copper trimmings which were of no use, and Mayer considered Wilson to be his first partner and his best friend. Wilson remembered that he was impressed with the boy's good manners and bright personality.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 23\">Eyman, p. 23.</ref> Whenever Mayer visited Saint John in later years, he placed flowers on Wilson's grave, just as he did on his mother's.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 23\"/>\n\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I had been to his hometown.

His family was poor, and Mayer's father spoke little English and had no valuable skills. It thereby became young Mayer's ambition and drive which supported the family.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 25\">Eyman, p. 25.</ref> With his family speaking mostly Yiddish at home, his goal of self-education when he quit school was made more difficult.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 25\"/>\n\nIn his spare time, he hung around the York theater, sometimes paying to watch the live vaudeville shows. He became enamored with the entertainment business. Then in 1904 the 20-year-old Mayer left Saint John for [[Boston]], where he continued for a time in the scrap metal business, got married, and took a variety of odd jobs to support his new family when his junk business lagged.\n\n==Early career==\nMayer renovated the Gem Theater, a rundown, 600 seat [[burlesque house]]\nin [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]],<ref>Rosenberg, Chaim M. ''The Great Workshop: Boston's Victorian Age''. Arcadia Publishing (2004), p. 60.</ref> which he reopened on November 28, 1907 as the Orpheum, his first movie theater.

Mayer paid [[D.W. Griffith]] $25,000 for the exclusive rights to show ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915) in New England. Although Mayer made the bid on a film that one of his scouts had seen, but he had not, his decision netted him over $100,000.<ref>Id. {{citation needed|date=December 2015}}</ref> Mayer partnered with [[Richard A. Rowland]] in 1916 to create [[Metro Pictures Corporation]], a talent booking agency, in New York City.\n\nTwo years later, Mayer moved to Los Angeles and formed his own production company, Louis B. Mayer Pictures Corporation. The first production was 1918's ''Virtuous Wives''. A partnership was set up with [[B. P. Schulberg]] to make the Mayer-Schulberg Studio\n\nIn late 1922, Mayer was introduced to [[Irving Thalberg]], then working for [[Universal Pictures]]. Mayer was searching for someone to help him manage his small, but dynamic and fast-growing studio. At that first meeting, Thalberg made an immediate positive impression on Mayer, writes biographer Roland Flamini. Later that evening, after Thalberg had left, Mayer told the studio's attorney, Edwin Loeb, to let Thalberg know that if he wanted to work for Mayer, he would be treated like a son.<ref name=Flamini>Flamini, Roland. ''Thalberg: The Last Tycoon and the World of M-G-M'', Crown (1994).</ref>{{rp|46}}\n\nAlthough their personalities were in many ways opposite, Mayer being more outspoken and nearly twice the younger man's age, Thalberg was hired as vice president in charge of production at Louis B. Mayer Productions. Years later, Mayer's daughter, [[Irene Mayer Selznick]], found it hard to believe that anyone \"so boyish could be so important.\"<ref name=Flamini/>{{rp|47}} According to Flamini, Thalberg was hired because, although Mayer was an astute businessman, he lacked Thalberg's strong ability to combine making films of quality with gaining commercial success.<ref name=Flamini/>{{rp|47}}\n\n==Heading new Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) studios==\n\nMayer's big breakthrough was in April 1924 when his company subsequently merged with two others to become [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM).  The 24-year-old Thalberg was made part-owner and accorded the same position as vice president in charge of production.\n\n[[Marcus Loew]], owner of the [[Loews Theatres|Loew's]] chain, merged Metro Pictures, [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s [[Goldwyn Pictures Corporation]], and Mayer Pictures into Metro-Goldwyn. Loew had bought Metro and Goldwyn some months before, but could not find anyone to oversee his new holdings on the West Coast. Mayer, with his proven success as a producer, was an obvious choice. He was named head of studio operations and a Loew's vice president, based in Los Angeles, reporting to Loew's longtime right-hand man [[Nicholas Schenck]]. He would hold this post for the next 27 years. Before the year was out, Mayer added his name to the studio with Loew's blessing, renaming it Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.  Three years after the merger, MGM became the most successful studio in Hollywood.\n\nLoew died in 1927, and Schenck became president of Loew's. Mayer and Schenck hated each other intensely; Mayer reportedly referred to his boss, whose name was pronounced \"Skenk\", as \"Mr. Skunk\" in private.<ref>{{cite book |title=MGM: When the Lion Roars |last=H\u00e1y |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter H\u00e1y (Canadian author, publisher and bookseller) |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Turner Publications |location= |isbn=978-1-878685-04-9 |page= |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/mgmwhenlionroars0000hayp |accessdate= |url-access=registration }}</ref> Two years later, Schenck agreed to sell Loew's \u2013 and MGM \u2013 to [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]], which angered Mayer. But despite his important role in MGM, Mayer was not a shareholder, and had no standing to challenge the sale. So he instead used his Washington connections to persuade the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to delay the merger on [[antitrust]] grounds. During the summer of 1929, Fox was severely injured in an auto accident. By the time he recovered, the [[stock market crash of 1929|stock market crash]] had wiped out his fortune, destroying any chance of the deal going through even if the Justice Department had lifted its objections. Nonetheless, Schenck believed Mayer had cost him a fortune and never forgave him, causing an already frigid relationship to get even worse.\n\n===Working with Irving Thalberg===\n[[File:With Mayer-Shearer.jpg|thumb|Mayer (r) with Irving Thalberg and Thalberg's wife, actress [[Norma Shearer]], 1932]]\nMayer and Thalberg were a brilliant team that worked well together. They relied on each other, and neither operated unilaterally.<ref>Eyman, p. 111.</ref> Mayer took charge of the business part of running the studio, such as setting budgets and approving new productions. Thalberg, eventually called the \"boy wonder\", took charge of all MGM productions. Director [[Joseph M. Newman|Joseph Newman]] said that their skills complemented each other well, with Thalberg having a great story mind, and Mayer having superior business acumen.\n\nThey shared a guiding philosophy, to make the best motion pictures they could at any cost, even if it meant reshooting the entire picture.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 120\">Eyman, p. 120.</ref> More important than showing a consistent profit with their films was, for them, to see MGM become a high quality studio. That goal began with their early silent films, when stars such as [[Greta Garbo]], Mayer's discovery, acted on lush settings with spectacular camera work.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 120\"/>\n\nAlthough they initially got along well, their relationship frayed over philosophical differences. Thalberg preferred literary works over the crowd-pleasers Mayer wanted. He ousted Thalberg as production chief in 1932, while Thalberg was recovering from a heart attack, and replaced him with producer [[David O. Selznick]].\n\nBut MGM received a serious blow when Thalberg died suddenly on September 14, 1936, at age 37. His death came as a shock to Mayer and everyone at MGM and the other studios.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 231\">Eyman, p. 231.</ref> Mayer issued statements to the press, calling Thalberg \"the finest friend a man could ever have&nbsp;... the guiding inspiration behind the artistic progress on the screen.\" His funeral was a major news event in Los Angeles. All the studios observed five minutes of silence, while MGM closed its studio for the entire day.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 231\"/>\n\nMayer dedicated MGM's front office building and christened it the Thalberg Building.<ref>Eyman, p. 232.</ref> He had the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] establish the [[Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award]], given to producers to recognize their exceptional careers, now considered one of the most prestigious awards in the Hollywood film industry.<ref>Hay, p. 145.</ref>\n\n===Continued success after Thalberg's death===\nAfter Thalberg died, many in Hollywood expected Mayer to \"stumble and fall.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 12\">Eyman, p. 12.</ref> Director [[Joseph M. Newman]] saw the studio start to change for the worse.<ref>Eyman, p. 233.</ref> Some actors were affected, such as [[Luise Rainer]], winner of Hollywood's first back-to-back Oscars, who felt that the death of Thalberg marked the death of her career: \"Had it not been that he died, I think I may have stayed much longer in films.\" <ref>Verswijver, Leo. ''Movies Were Always Magical'', McFarland Publ. (2003), e-book.</ref> [[Joan Crawford]] was also concerned, feeling that with Thalberg gone, the concept of the quality \"big\" picture \"pretty much went out the window.\"<ref>Leider, Emily W. ''Myrna Loy: The Only Good Girl in Hollywood'', Univ. of California Press (2011), p. 184.</ref>\n\nHowever, MGM under Mayer's leadership continued to produce successful movies. Mayer was made head of production as well as studio chief. For the next ten years, MGM grew and thrived.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 12\"/> 1939 was an especially \"golden\" year: besides distributing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]],'' MGM released ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]],'' ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' ''[[At the Circus]],'' and ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]''. Garbo laughed in ''[[Ninotchka]],'' ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' won an Oscar, and was nominated for seven, and [[Hedy Lamarr]], another of Mayer's personal discoveries, made her film debut.\n\nMayer became the first person in American history to earn a million-dollar salary. For nine years from 1937, when he earned $1,300,000\u2014equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1300000|1937|r=0}}}} today,{{Inflation-fn|US}}Mayer was the highest-paid man in the United States.<ref name=friedrich1986>{{cite book|last=Friedrich|first=Otto|title=City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in 1940s|year=1986|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|isbn=0-520-20949-4|page=15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0x8AFchW4JsC&lpg=PP1&dq=city%20of%20nets&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Managing MGM==\n\n===Management style===\nIn his overall management skills, Mayer was considered a great executive, someone who could have run General Motors equally as well as a large studio like MGM, said producer [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]].<ref name=Eyman7/> He worked at the studio all the time, and decisively, without any fixed schedule, but didn't like paperwork.<ref name=Eyman284/> Some said Mayer had a lot in common with newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Hearst had financed various MGM pictures, while MGM benefited by having film reviews included nationwide in the Hearst newspapers.\n\nHearst, 20 years Mayer's senior, affectionately referred to Mayer as \"son\" and they became good friends.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\">Eyman, p. 115.</ref> Mayer took Hearst's suggestion to build himself an office bungalow on the MGM lot, something Hearst said was appropriate for a studio head: \"Everybody of distinction from all over the world comes to Los Angeles and everybody who comes wants to see your studio and they all want to meet you and do meet you, so put on a few airs son, and provide the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\"/> Director [[Clarence Brown]] pointed out that overall, Mayer's skill was similar to Hearst's in that they both learned by doing. What Mayer couldn't do on his own, he hired the best talent he could find to do for him. \"Like Hearst and [[Henry Ford]],\" said Brown, \"he was an executive genius.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 115\"/>\n\nMayer's temper was widely known, but most people knew that his sudden bursts of anger faded quickly. With those working underneath him, he was usually patient and preferred to leave department heads alone, and would fire executives if they failed to produce successful films over a long period.<ref name=Eyman284>Eyman, p. 284.</ref>\n\n===Growth of the studio===\nAt its peak in the 1940s, MGM employed six thousand people, had three entrances, and covered 185 acres in [[Culver City]], California, outside of [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=Hogan>Hogan, David J. ''The Wizard of Oz FAQ: All That's Left to Know About Life, According to Oz'', Hal Leonard Corp. (2014), e-book.</ref> It had forty cameras and sixty sound machines, used on its six separate lots, and connected with its own rail line.<ref name=Hogan/><ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\">Eyman, p. 1.</ref> About 2,700 people ate in the commissary every day. Power was supplied by an in-house electrical plant which could light a town of 25,000.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\"/> MGM also maintained a police force of fifty officers\u2014larger than that of Culver City itself.<ref name=Eyman2>Eyman, p. 2.</ref>\n\n\"Anywhere from sixteen to eighteen pictures were being shot at one time\", remembers actress [[Ann Rutherford]]. \"They were either shooting or preparing to shoot on every sound stage.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 1\"/>\n\n===Creating a \"star system\"===\nMayer helped create what is termed the [[Star system (filmmaking)|\"star system\"]]. At one point he explained the process he went through in creating a star:\n\n{{quote|The idea of a star being born is bush-wah. A star is made, created; carefully and cold-bloodedly built up from nothing, from nobody. All I ever looked for was a face. If someone looked good to me, I'd have him tested. If a person looked good on film, if he photographed well, we could do the rest.&nbsp;... We hired geniuses at make-up, hair dressing, surgeons to slice away a bulge here and there, rubbers to rub away the blubber, clothes designers, lighting experts, coaches for everything\u2014fencing, dancing, walking, talking, sitting and spitting.<ref>Eyman, p. 266.</ref>}}\n\n===Hiring actors and staff===\nDuring MGM's growth period, Mayer traveled often, and among his personal discoveries were [[Greta Garbo]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greer Garson]].<ref name=Eyman8>Eyman, p. 8.</ref> He also signed up dancing team [[Marge Champion|Marge]] and [[Gower Champion]] and discovered [[Mario Lanza]], then a young tenor from Philadelphia, who Mayer hoped to turn into a \"singing [[Clark Gable]]\".<ref>Eyman, p. 377.</ref>\n\nWhen hiring new actors, he typically wanted them to agree to stay with the studio for either three or seven years, during which time they would become one of the MGM \"family.\" The studio usually succeeded in hiring those it wanted since they offered the highest salaries.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 288\">Eyman, p. 288.</ref> With executives, Mayer took more time before taking them, wanting to know them first on a personal level. He respected intelligence and talent overall, said manager Joe Cohn: \"One time he said to me, 'Never be afraid of hiring a fellow smarter than you are. You'll only learn from them.'\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 288\"/>\n\nMayer took pride in his ability to hire good people, and once hired, he left  them alone to do their job without interference. That policy held true whether the person was a producer, a department head or simply a janitor.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\">Eyman, p. 289.</ref> As a result, while other studios went through continuous upheavals or reorganizations, Mayer's hands-off policy kept MGM stable and sound, where employees felt their jobs were secure.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\">Eyman, p. 287.</ref>\n\nWhen meeting a new employee, he always told them to come to him personally for help with any problems. Some, like [[Barbara Stanwyck]], considered this attitude to be \"pompous\" however, since he used his position to meddle into people's lives. Others, such as actor [[Edward G. Robinson]], after his first meeting Mayer, said \"I found him to be a man of truth&nbsp;... Behind his gutta-percha face and roly-poly figure, it was evident there was a man of steel\u2014but well-mannered steel.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 295.</ref> British director [[Victor Saville]] remembers him as being \"the best listener. He wanted to know. He was the devil's advocate. He would prod you and question you and suck you dry of any knowledge.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 301.</ref>\n\n===Working with studio people===\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=L.B. wasn't crude at all. Super-intelligent people might have found him common or crass. He may have been an immigrant with a good suit of clothes, but never forget that this was a man working hard to be an American.|source=\u2014actress [[Esther Williams]]<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\"/>}}\n\nHis attitude and conversational style was both professional and animated, sometimes \"theatrical\", observed June Caldwell, [[Eddie Mannix]]'s secretary. \"Bombastic and colorful, but I never heard him use nasty language&nbsp;... he had a great loyalty to everybody, and everybody respected him. And he would listen ... You could work with him.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 315.</ref> His manners were considered \"impeccable.\"\n\nWith MGM's film output as high as one film each week, he never panicked over a bad picture. If somebody suggested canceling a movie and cutting the studio's losses, when a film had consistent production problems, Mayer would typically refuse.<ref name=Eyman284/> He relied on his instinct and intuition, said actress [[Esther Williams]]. Although he didn't read full scripts, if he was given the framework of a story, he could assemble the pieces needed to see if it could be a successful film.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 300\">Eyman, p. 300.</ref>\n\nOccasionally, when producers, directors, writers or actors were deadlocked over how to handle a problem in a film, he would mediate. On [[Rosalie (film)|''Rosalie'']], for instance, when [[Nelson Eddy]] refused to sing a song he thought was too melodramatic, its songwriter, [[Cole Porter]], went to Mayer and played it for him. Mayer was moved to tears by the song, and told Eddy to sing it. \"Imagine making Louis B. Mayer cry,\" Porter later told friends.<ref>Furia, Michael L. ''America's Songs: The Stories Behind the Songs of Broadway, Hollywood, and Tin Pan Alley'', Routledge (2008), p. 143.</ref>\n\n===Response to technical innovations===\nWith regard to any technical issues with productions, Mayer left the details and solutions to MGM's engineers. He, though, like other top film executives and Hollywood stars in the 1920s and early 1930s, was often too quick to dismiss news of inventions and major innovations on the horizon that might profoundly change the movie industry or possibly challenge in the future the growing dominance of films in the realm of American entertainment.<ref name=FilmDaily32>[https://archive.org/stream/filmdailyvolume660newy#page/252 \"Television, Wide Screen, Color Dismissed by Louis B. Mayer\"], ''The Film Daily'' (New York, N.Y.), August 17, 1932, pp. 1, 6. [[Internet Archive]], San Francisco, California. Retrieved August 20, 2018.</ref> Beyond the well-entrenched aspect of sound by 1932, other technologies being discussed at that time in newspapers and on studio lots included color features, widescreen formatting, and even early television.<ref name=FilmDaily32/> In August 1932, after an \"exclusive\" interview with Mayer in New York, ''[[The Film Daily]]'' reported the movie mogul's assertions that the noted developments would never impact motion pictures in substantial, meaningful ways:\n\n{{quote|Peering into the industry's future, Louis B. Mayer ... sees no great production development or invention which will again revolutionize the business, as in the instance of sound. Television, color, and wide film he dismissed as promising no important influence on motion pictures. Television, according to the M-G-M chieftain, is impractical from the standpoint of any association with motion pictures. In taking this attitude he stressed the rapidity at which images must be transmitted in television and pointed out that satisfactory  results cannot be obtained with this requirement.\n\nExcept in some short subjects, such as educationals, [[Travel documentary|travelogues]], and novelties, color has no place on the screen, Mayer asserted. It has the effect of detracting interest from the story being told. In addition the cost must be considered. Examining the possibility of the wide screen, Mayer said that it eliminates the intimacy allowed by the standard-sized screen. It might be effectively used in mob scenes, he observed, but pointed out the impracticability of switching back and forth between projectors capable of projecting both sizes of pictures.<ref name=FilmDaily32/>}}\n\n===Being a father figure===\n\nWith many of his actors, Mayer was like an overprotective mother. In some cases, especially with child actors, he could become closely involved in managing their everyday life, telling them where to shop, where to dine, or what doctor to visit. He liked giving suggestions about how they could take better care of themselves.<ref>Eyman, p. 285.</ref> He sometimes arranged marriages, and coping with occupational hazards like alcoholism, suicide, and eccentric sexual habits were as much a part of his job as negotiating contracts with stars and directors.<ref>Eyman, p. 6.</ref> When he learned that [[June Allyson]] was dating David Rose, for instance, he told her to stop seeing him: \"If you care about your reputation, you cannot be seen with a married man.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 290.</ref>\n[[Image:Louis B Mayer and Joan Crawford.jpg|thumb|left|Mayer with [[Joan Crawford]] at the premiere of ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', 1953.<br>\"To me,\" she once stated, \"L.B. Mayer was my father, my father confessor, the best friend I ever had.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 22\">Hay, p. 22.</ref>]]\nStories about his sobbing or rages have often been repeated in books, but few employees ever saw that part of him. \"Mr. Mayer was to me like a father\", said [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. \"He really thought of the people under contract as his boys and girls.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/> Mayer's paternalism could extend to productions; for example, he revised the ''Dr. Kildare'' stories in order to keep an ailing [[Lionel Barrymore]], who became wheelchair-bound with [[arthritis]], on the job.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/>\n\nSome, such as young starlet [[Elizabeth Taylor]], didn't like Mayer overseeing her life; she called him a \"monster.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 294.</ref> While [[Mickey Rooney]], another young actor, and someone who co-starred with Elizabeth when she was 12, formed the opposite impression: \"He was the daddy of everybody and vitally interested in everybody. They always talk badly about Mayer, but he was really a wonderful guy ... he listened and you listened.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 323.</ref>  Rooney spoke from experience, as he himself had some confrontations with Mayer, notes film historian Jane Ellen Wayne:\n\n{{quote|Mayer naturally tried to keep all his child actors in line, like any father figure. After one such episode, Mickey Rooney replied, \"I won't do it. You're asking the impossible.\" Mayer then grabbed young Rooney by his lapels and said, \"Listen to me! I don't care what you do in private. Just don't do it in public. In public, behave. Your fans expect it. You're Andy Hardy! You're the United States! You're the Stars and Stripes. Behave yourself! You're a symbol!\" Mickey nodded. \"I'll be good, Mr. Mayer. I promise you that.\" Mayer let go of his lapels, \"All right\", he said.<ref name=Wayne>Wayne, Jane Ellen. ''The Leading Men of MGM'', Carroll & Graf (2005) p. 246.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Rooney-Garland-ebay-1938.jpg|thumb|[[Mickey Rooney]] and [[Judy Garland]] in ''[[Love Finds Andy Hardy]]'', 1938]]\nOne of Rooney's repeat costars in ''Andy Hardy'' and other films was [[Judy Garland]], with whom he made nine films. While Garland stated in her autobiography that Mayer molested her, this was contested by multiple people who knew her personally and/or a number of reputable biography authors.{{fact|date=January 2020}} In the late 1940s she began having personal problems which affected her acting, and Mayer tried his best to protect her star reputation while continuing to have her overworked and making money for MGM. She suffered from addictions to various prescription drugs, severely disordered eating and domestic strains, as well as a multitude of issues with her mental health. This was largely the result of Metro Goldwyn Mayer, her mother, and the era's ignorance of diet and drugs.<ref name=\"Hay, 275\">Hay, p. 275.</ref>  When her absences caused the production of ''[[Summer Stock]]'' to go far over budget, producer [[Joe Pasternak]] suggested that Mayer cut his losses and cancel the picture. Mayer refused, telling him, \"Judy Garland has made this studio a fortune in the good days, and the least we can do is to give her one more chance. If you stop production now, it'll finish her.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 406.</ref> in what some consider to be his last attempt at holding on to her fame for the benefit of the studio. She completed the film, but during her next picture, [[Annie Get Your Gun (film)|''Annie Get Your Gun'']], the studio finally ran out of patience. Costar [[Howard Keel]] recalls that \"she began to fall apart.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 275\"/>\n\nAfter the studio fired her, she attempted suicide. This would not be her first or last attempt and her early, tragic death is often considered to be the result of the abuse she received while working at Metro Goldwyn Mayer under Mayer's control.\n\n===Developing child stars===\nMayer wanted the studio to develop a number of child stars, necessary for producing family-oriented stories. The studio provided all the essential services, such as formal education and medical care. They were given acting or dancing tutors. Mayer loved children, writes biographer Kitty Kelley: \"They provided the magic that brought millions of people stampeding into theaters every week ... They were the good, clean, wholesome elements of the folksy entertainment that was MGM's specialty.\"<ref>Kelley, Kitty. ''Elizabeth Taylor: The Last Star'', Simon & Schuster (1981), ch. 1.</ref>\n\n[[Jackie Coogan]], then 11, marked the studio's debut using child stars with his role in ''The Rag Man'' in 1925. During Hollywood's golden age, MGM had more child actors than any other studio, including [[Jackie Cooper]], [[Mickey Rooney]], [[Judy Garland]], [[Freddie Bartholomew]], [[Margaret O'Brien]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], and [[Roddy McDowall]].<ref>Hay, p. 137.</ref>\n\n==Themes, musicals and formula==\nWhile MGM's films during the 1920s and 1930s were often notable for having adult themes and strong female stars, such as Greta Garbo, after Thalberg's early death in 1936, Mayer promoted a change in emphasis to more male leads, family themes, and child stars.<ref>Hay, p. 161.</ref> And unusual for a movie mogul, he took moral positions in his movies, especially when it came to portraying family values\u2014as in the ''Andy Hardy'' series.<ref name=Eyman8/> One of Mayer's proudest moments came when Mickey Rooney, who starred as Andy Hardy, was given a special award by the Academy in 1942 for \"furthering the American way of life.\"<ref>Hay, p. 165.</ref>\n\n{{quote box|align=|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=I am going to make pictures you can take your mother and your children to see. I am not going to make pictures for the sake of awards or for the critics. I want to make pictures for Americans and for all people to enjoy. When I send my pictures abroad, I want them to show America in the right light\u2014and not that we are a nation chiefly of drunks, gangsters and prostitutes.|source=\u2014Louis B. Mayer<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 450\">Eyman, p. 450.</ref>}}\n\nMayer tried to express an idealized vision of men, women, and families in the real world they lived in. He also believed in beauty, glamour, and the \"star system.\"<ref name=Eyman8/> In MGM films, \"marriage was sacrosanct and mothers were objects of veneration.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 3.</ref> Author Peter Hay states that Mayer \"cherished the Puritan values of family and hard work.\"<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/> When he hired writers, he made those objectives clear at the outset, once telling screenwriter Frances Marion that he never wanted his own daughters or his wife to be embarrassed when watching an MGM movie. \"I worship good women, honorable men, and saintly mothers\", he told her.<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/> Mayer was serious about that, once coming from behind his desk and knocking director [[Erich von Stroheim]] to the floor when he said that all women were whores.<ref name=\"Hay, 22\"/><ref>Thomson, David. ''Have You Seen&nbsp;... ?'', Knopf Doubleday (2008), p. 544.</ref>\n\nMayer knew that formula in his themes and stories usually works. He felt that the general public, especially Americans, like to see stars, spectacle, and optimism on screen, and if possible, with a little sentiment attached. They don't like to be challenged or instructed, but comforted and entertained.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 9\">Eyman, p. 9.</ref>\n\nTherefore, having messages was less important to Mayer than giving his audience pure entertainment and escapism. In his screen dramas, he wanted them to be melodramatic, whereas in comedies, he often laced them with a strong doses of sentimentality. \"He loved swaggering, charismatic hams like [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Marie Dressler]]\", writes Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 9\"/>\n\n[[Musical film|Musicals]] were high on his list of preferred genres. Anxious to make more of them, on a hunch, he asked songwriter [[Arthur Freed]] to be associate producer for [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']]. As Mayer hoped, Freed went on to produce a number of films considered among the best musicals ever made: ''For Me and My Gal'', ''Girl Crazy'', ''Meet Me in St. Louis'', ''The Harvey Girls'', ''The Pirate'', ''Easter Parade'', ''The Barkleys of Broadway'', ''On the Town'', ''An American in Paris'', ''Singin' in the Rain'', ''The Band Wagon'', and ''Gigi''. Mayer's greatest contributions to posterity are said to be his musicals.<ref>Eyman, p. 10.</ref>\n\n==World War II problems==\n\nUnlike [[Charlie Chaplin]], who produced ''The Great Dictator'', the other, much larger Hollywood studios lacked the freedom to make such independent films. Mayer understood that the Germans could ban or boycott Hollywood films throughout much of Europe, with serious economic implications, since 30 to 40 percent of Hollywood's income came from Europe's audiences.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 276\">Eyman, p. 276.</ref> Nevertheless, MGM produced ''[[Three Comrades (1938 film)|Three Comrades]]'' in 1938, despite movie censor [[Joseph Breen]] warning Mayer that the film was \"a serious indictment of the German nation and people and is certain to be violently resented by the present government in that country.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 276\"/>\n\nAfter the war erupted in Europe in September 1939, Mayer authorized the production of two anti-Nazi films, ''[[The Mortal Storm]]'' and ''Escape.'' At the same time, Warner Brothers produced ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]].'' The German government informed the studios that \"those films would be remembered by Germany ''when'' \u2014 not ''if'' \u2014 they won the war\", writes Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 278\">Eyman, p. 278.</ref> Warners had to post guards to protect the family of actor [[Edward G. Robinson]], and the Germans threatened Mayer with a boycott of all MGM films.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 278\"/>\n\nFrom September 1939, until January 1940, all films that could be considered anti-Nazi were banned by the [[Hays Office]].<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 277\">Eyman, p. 277.</ref> The U.S. ambassador to England, [[Joseph Kennedy]], told the studios to stop making pro-British and anti-German films.<ref name=Wapshott/> Kennedy felt that \"British defeat was imminent and there was no point in America holding out alone: 'With England licked, the party's over,' said Kennedy.\"<ref name=Wapshott>Wapshott, Nicholas. ''The Sphinx: Franklin Roosevelt, the Isolationists, and the Road to World War II'', W.W. Norton & Co. (2015), e-book. {{ISBN|978-0393088885}}.</ref>\n\nDefying those pleadings, MGM produced ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'', a simple story about a British family trying to get by during the bombing [[the Blitz|Blitz]] in London.<ref>Hay, p. 191.</ref> [[Eddie Mannix]], Mayer's assistant, agreed that \"someone should salute England. And even if we lose $100,000, that'll be okay.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 344.</ref>\n\n[[File:Greer Garson-publicity.JPG|thumb|left|Greer Garson, 1940s]]\nMayer wanted British actress [[Greer Garson]], his personal discovery, to star, but she refused to play a matronly role.<ref>Eyman, p. 354.</ref> Mayer implored her \"to have the same faith in me\" that he had in her.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 345\">Eyman, p. 345.</ref> He read from the script, having her visualize the image she would present to the world, \"a woman who survives and endures. She was London. No, more than that, she was&nbsp;... England!\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 345\"/> Garson accepted the role, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. ''Mrs. Miniver'' won six Academy Awards and became the top box office hit of 1942.\n\n[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] both loved the film, said historian Emily Yellin, and Roosevelt wanted prints rushed to theaters nationwide. The [[Voice of America]] radio network broadcast the minister's speech from the film, magazines reprinted it, and it was copied onto leaflets and dropped over German-occupied countries. Churchill sent Mayer a telegram claiming that \"''Mrs. Miniver'' is propaganda worth 100 battleships.\"<ref>Yellin, Emily. ''Our Mother's War: American Women at Home and at the Front During World War II'', Simon & Schuster (2004), p. 100.</ref> [[Bosley Crowther]] (1960 biographer of Mayer, [[#Further reading|below]]), wrote in his ''New York Times'' review that ''Mrs. Miniver'' was the finest film yet made about the war, \"and a most exalting tribute to the British.\"<ref>Troyan, Michael. ''A Rose for Mrs. Miniver: The Life of Greer Garson'', Univ. of Kentucky Press (1999), e-book. ASIN: B00A6IOY1W.</ref>\n\nThe following year, 1943, saw the release of another Oscar-winning film, this one aimed at supporting the home front, entitled [[The Human Comedy (film)|''The Human Comedy.'']] It was Mayer's personal favorite and the favorite of its director, [[Clarence Brown]]. Mayer also assisted the U.S. government by producing a number of short films related to the war, and helped produce pro-American films such as ''[[Joe Smith, American]],'' in 1942.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 277\"/>\n\n==Declining years at MGM==\nThe post-war years saw a gradual decline in profits for MGM and the other studios. The number of high-grossing films in 1947 dwindled to six, compared to twenty-two a year earlier. MGM had to let go many of its top producers and other executives. Mayer was pressured to tighten expenses by the studio's parent company, although Mayer's reputation as a \"big-picture man\" would make that difficult. They began looking for someone, another Thalberg, to redo the studio system.\n\nIn the interim, Mayer kept making \"big pictures.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\">Eyman, p. 408.</ref> When RKO turned down financing of [[Frank Capra]]'s [[State of the Union (film)|''State of the Union'']] in 1948 because of its expensive budget, Mayer took on the project. He filled the cast with MGM stars including [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Spencer Tracy]], [[Van Johnson]], [[Adolphe Menjou]] and [[Angela Lansbury]], but the film only broke even. Nicholas Schenck called Mayer and insisted that he \"cut, cut\", recalls director [[George Sidney]]. Mayer replied, \"A studio isn't salami, Nick.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\"/> \"L.B. would ask only one question: 'Can you make it better?' It was all he cared about\", said Sidney.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 408\"/>\n\nAs pressure built to find a new Thalberg-style manager to handle production, [[Dore Schary]] was brought in from RKO, and began work on July 14, 1948, as vice president in charge of production, working under Mayer's direction.\n\nSome long-time studio executives saw this change as a sign of the eventual downfall of MGM. When she heard the news, Lillian Burns Sidney, George Sidney's wife, marched into Mayer's office and announced, \"Now you've done it. You've ruined everything.\" She told Mayer that she was afraid Schary would eliminate all future musicals, comedies and adventure movies, and replace them with the \"message\" movies that he preferred. She expressed her fear: \"They won't have need for anybody around here. Even you! You'll see.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 411.</ref>\n\nBy mutual consent with Loew's, Mayer resigned from MGM in August 1951. On his final day, as he walked down a red carpet laid out in front of the Thalberg Building, executives, actors and staff lined the path and applauded him for his contributions. \"He was so respected,\" said June Caldwell, Eddie Mannix's secretary.<ref>Eyman, p. 444.</ref> Many assumed that his leaving meant the end of an era. Actor [[Turhan Bey]] said, \"In every meaningful way, it was the end of Hollywood.\"<ref>Eyman, p. 445.</ref>\n\nMayer, for a period after he left MGM, tried to finance and assemble a new group of film stars and directors to produce his own films as an independent. He told the press that his films would carry on in the tradition of MGM's previous style of film subjects.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 450\"/>\nIn 1952 he became chairman of the board and the single largest shareholder in [[Cinerama]], and had hoped to produce a property he owned, ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]]'', in the widescreen process, but without success. He left Cinerama in 1954 when the company was sold.\n\n==Personal life==\n\n===Family===\nMayer had two daughters from his first marriage to Margaret Shenberg (1883-1955).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/?name=Margaret_Shenberg&birth=1883&birth_x=0-0-0&name_x=1_1|title=Ancestry.com}}</ref> The elder of these, Edith (Edie) Mayer (1905 \u2013 1987), whom he would later become estranged from and disinherit, married producer [[William Goetz]] (who served as vice president for Twentieth-Century Fox and later became president of [[Universal Pictures]]). The younger, [[Irene Mayer Selznick|Irene]] (1907\u20131990), married producer [[David O. Selznick]] and became a successful theatrical producer.\n\nAt home, Mayer was boss. \"In our family, all the basic decisions were made by him\", remembers his nephew, Gerald Mayer. \"He was a giant.&nbsp;... Were we afraid of him? Jesus Christ, yes!\"<ref>Eyman, p. 296.</ref> And although he never spoke Yiddish at the office, he sometimes spoke Yiddish with \"some of the relatives\", said his daughter Irene.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 287\"/>\n\nMayer's activities for the Jewish Home for the Aged led to a strong friendship with [[Edgar Magnin]], the rabbi at the Wilshire Temple in Los Angeles. \"Edgar and Louis B. virtually built that temple\", said Herbert Brin.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 297\">Eyman, p. 297.</ref>\n\nMayer reportedly was in love with actress [[Jean Howard]] and pursued her energetically but without success.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vbs2JeSNOUEC&pg=PA134&dq=louis+b.+mayer+charlie+feldman+jean+howard&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjmuITr7e3WAhXK2SYKHWGKDpYQ6AEIQDAE#v=onepage&q=louis+b.+mayer+charlie+feldman+jean+howard&f=false|title=When Blanche Met Brando: The Scandalous Story of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\"|first=Sam|last=Staggs|date=July 25, 2006|publisher=Macmillan|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment and leisure===\nAt his home on Saint Cloud Road in the [[East Gate Bel Air, Los Angeles|East Gate Bel Air]] neighborhood, Sundays were reserved for brunches in what was an open house, which often included visiting statesmen or former Presidents, along with various producers, directors or stars.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 289\"/> There would be a buffet supper, drinks, and later a movie.<ref>Eyman, p. 135.</ref> Mayer drank almost no alcohol, cared nothing for fine cuisine, and didn't gamble, but might play penny-ante card games for fun.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 300\"/>\n\nFor leisure activities, he liked going to the [[Hollywood Bowl]], especially the annual [[John Philip Sousa]] concert. Sousa's patriotic-style music built up his pride in America, and he \"would be stoked with extra exuberance for days afterward\", states Eyman.<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 297\"/> Mayer also enjoyed ballet and opera, and concerts where violinist [[Jascha Heifetz]] or pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]] performed.<ref>Eyman, p. 299.</ref>\n\nWhile Mayer seldom discussed his early life, his partiality towards Canada would sometimes be revealed, especially after Canada and the United States entered World War II. On one occasion in 1943, [[Mary Pickford]] called to tell him she met a movie-struck [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] pilot from New Brunswick, where Mayer grew up. Mayer asked her to have him drop by the studio. The pilot, Charles Foster, recalled his visit: \"Mary's driver took me through the gates, and I saw this little man come running down the steps of the Thalberg Building. I thought, 'Oh, he's sent a man to greet me.' And I got out of the car, and this man threw his arms around me and said, 'Welcome to my studio.' \"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\">Eyman, p. 310.</ref>\n\nMayer took him on a personal tour of the studio, and Foster remembers that \"everybody waved to him and he waved back. He spoke to people and knew them by name. I was shocked.\" <ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\"/> Mayer invited him back for lunch the next day. But before Foster arrived, Mayer had invited every Canadian in Hollywood to meet the flier, including [[Fay Wray]], [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Jack Carson]], [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]], [[Deanna Durbin]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Ann Rutherford]], and even his main competitor, [[Jack L. Warner|Jack Warner]]. Mayer told him, \"When this war is over, if you want to come back here, I'll find a job for you.\" <ref>Eyman, p. 311.</ref> Foster said \"It was like he was the father I never knew.\"<ref name=\"Eyman, p. 310\"/>\n\n===Politics===\nActive in Republican Party politics, Mayer served as the vice chairman of the [[California Republican Party]] in 1931 and 1932, and as its state chairman in 1932 and 1933.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JNma11zsi6MC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67|title=Hollywood Left and Right: How Movie Stars Shaped American Politics|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|date=2011|last=Ross|first=Steven J.|pages=67\u201371}}</ref> As a delegate to the [[1928 Republican National Convention]] in Kansas City, Louis B.

It was considered one of the finest racing stables in the United States and raised the standards of the California racing business. Among his horses were [[Your Host (horse)|Your Host]], sire of [[Kelso (horse)|Kelso]]; the 1945 [[Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year|U.S. Horse of the Year]], [[Busher (horse)|Busher]]; and the 1959 [[Preakness Stakes]] winner, [[Royal Orbit]]. Eventually Mayer sold off the stable, partly to finance his divorce in 1947. His 248 horses brought more than $4.4&nbsp;million.

''The Fall of Gondolin'' tells of the founding of the city; of the arrival there of [[Tuor]], a prince of [[Edain|Men]]; of the betrayal of the city to [[Morgoth]] by the king's nephew, Maeglin; and of its subsequent catastrophic destruction by Morgoth's armies. It also relates the flight of the fugitives to the [[Havens of Sirion]], the wedding of Tuor and Idril, as well as the childhood of [[E\u00e4rendil]].\n\n==Gondolin==\n{{redirect|Gondolin|the South African fossil site|Gondolin Cave}}\nGondolin<ref>\"Tolkien explained its origin in his \"Name-list to \"The Fall of Gondolin\" thus: \"''Gondolin'' meaneth in [[Gnomish]] 'stone of song' (whereby figuratively the Gnomes meant stone that was carven and wrought to great beauty)\".

It was originally named 'Ondolind\u00eb'. According to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \"Hill of Watch\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in [[Valinor]] that the [[Noldor]] had left.\n\nTurgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast\u2014almost a third of the Noldor of [[Fingolfin]]'s House\u2014as well as nearly three quarters of the northern [[Sindar]].\n\n=== The seven gates of the city ===\nThe Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel, perhaps based on [[Herodotus]]'s description of the [[Medes|Medean]] city of [[Ecbatana]].  The seven gates of [[Minas Tirith]] echoed this notion of a layered defence on a hill.\n\n=== The fall of the city ===\nThe city stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to [[Morgoth]] by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew. Maeglin was captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains (against Turgon's orders). Maeglin betrayed the location of Gondolin after being promised Lordship and Turgon's daughter Idril.  Morgoth then sent an army over the Crissaegrim, the northernmost precipitous and dangerous portion of the Encircling Mountains, during [[The Gates of Summer]] (a great Gondolin festival), catching them unawares and sacking the city with relative ease.  In addition to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], [[Balrog]]s and [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]], Melkor's (Morgoth's) army, in early versions of the story, included iron machines (tanks) powered by \"internal fires\" and used as personnel carriers, to surmount difficult geographic obstacles and to defeat fortifications.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin closely resembles that of [[Troy]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Mythlore]]|first=Alexander M.|last=Bruce|year=2012|volume=30|issue=3-4|title=The Fall of Gondolin and the Fall of Troy: Tolkien and Book II of the Aeneid|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society]]|location=East Lansing, Michigan}}</ref>\n\n=== The seven names of Gondolin ===\n\nAccording to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the city had seven names: \"\u2019Tis said and \u2019tis sung: '''Gondobar''' am I called and '''Gondothlimbar''', City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; '''Gondolin''' the Stone of Song and '''Gwarestrin''' am I named, the Tower of the Guard, '''Gar Thurion''' or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me '''Loth''', for like a flower am I, even '''Lothengriol''' the flower that blooms on the plain.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=J.R.R.|last=Tolkien|authorlink=J.R.R.

It was originally named 'Ondolind\u00eb'. According to ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[Vala (Middle-earth)|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], the Lord of Waters, revealed the location of the Vale of Tumladen to Turgon in a dream. Under this divine guidance, Turgon travelled from his kingdom in Nevrast and found the vale. Within the Echoriath, the Encircling Mountains, lay a round level plain with sheer walls on all sides and a ravine and tunnel leading out to the southwest known as the Hidden Way. In the middle of the vale there was a steep hill which was called Amon Gwareth, the \"Hill of Watch\". There Turgon decided to found a city, designed after the city of Tirion in [[Valinor]] that the [[Noldor]] had left.\n\nTurgon and his people built Gondolin in secret. After it was completed, he took with him to dwell in the hidden city his entire people in Nevrast\u2014almost a third of the Noldor of [[Fingolfin]]'s House\u2014as well as nearly three quarters of the northern [[Sindar]].\n\n=== The seven gates of the city ===\nThe Hidden Pass was protected by seven gates, all constantly guarded; the first of wood, then stone, bronze, iron, silver, gold, and steel, perhaps based on [[Herodotus]]'s description of the [[Medes|Medean]] city of [[Ecbatana]].  The seven gates of [[Minas Tirith]] echoed this notion of a layered defence on a hill.\n\n=== The fall of the city ===\nThe city stood for nearly 400 years until it was betrayed to [[Morgoth]] by Maeglin, Turgon's nephew. Maeglin was captured while mining outside the Encircling Mountains (against Turgon's orders). Maeglin betrayed the location of Gondolin after being promised Lordship and Turgon's daughter Idril.  Morgoth then sent an army over the Crissaegrim, the northernmost precipitous and dangerous portion of the Encircling Mountains, during [[The Gates of Summer]] (a great Gondolin festival), catching them unawares and sacking the city with relative ease.  In addition to [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]], [[Balrog]]s and [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]], Melkor's (Morgoth's) army, in early versions of the story, included iron machines (tanks) powered by \"internal fires\" and used as personnel carriers, to surmount difficult geographic obstacles and to defeat fortifications.\n\nThe Fall of Gondolin closely resembles that of [[Troy]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Mythlore]]|first=Alexander M.|last=Bruce|year=2012|volume=30|issue=3-4|title=The Fall of Gondolin and the Fall of Troy: Tolkien and Book II of the Aeneid|publisher=[[Mythopoeic Society]]|location=East Lansing, Michigan}}</ref>\n\n=== The seven names of Gondolin ===\n\nAccording to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the city had seven names: \"\u2019Tis said and \u2019tis sung: '''Gondobar''' am I called and '''Gondothlimbar''', City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; '''Gondolin''' the Stone of Song and '''Gwarestrin''' am I named, the Tower of the Guard, '''Gar Thurion''' or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me '''Loth''', for like a flower am I, even '''Lothengriol''' the flower that blooms on the plain.\"<ref>{{cite book|first=J.R.R.|last=Tolkien|authorlink=J.R.R.

[[Christopher Tolkien]] retitled the story before including it in ''Unfinished Tales'', because it ends at the point of Tuor's arrival in Gondolin, and does not depict the actual Fall.\n\nThere is also an unfinished poem, ''The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin'', of which a few verses are quoted in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. In 130 verses Tolkien reaches the point where [[Dragon (Middle-earth)|dragons]] attack the city.\n\n==Stand-alone book==\nOn 30 August 2018,<ref name=\"TolkienSociety100418\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2018/04/the-fall-of-gondolin-to-be-published/|title=The Fall of Gondolin to be published|date=10 April 2018|first=Daniel|last=Helen|publisher=Tolkien Society|accessdate=18 April 2018|quote=HarperCollins has announced that it will, for the very first time, publish The Fall of Gondolin on 30 August this year.

The estrogen definitely  protects women, they have mild symptoms and they don't die from this virus. So, women, you can go shopping to Italy, I've heard that, now, there will be huge discounts there, because now nobody wants to go to Italy. So, prepare your husbands mentally for that.

This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]] and victory for Singhasari.\n\n==Background==\n[[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the principal khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]], had sent envoys to many states to ask them to put themselves under his protection and pay tribute.

The campaign also has other purpose. According to Kubilai khan himself, if the Mongol forces were able to defeat Java, the other countries around it would submit themselves.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> That way, the Yuan Mongol Dynasty could control the Asian sea trade routes, because of the strategic geographical position of the archipelago in trading.<ref name=\"mpm\" /> \n\nAccording to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan shi]]'', the history of the Yuan dynasty, 20,000\u201330,000 men were collected from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] in Southern [[China]], along with 1,000 ships and enough provisions for a year.<ref>Weatherford (2004), and also Man (2007).</ref> The officers were the [[Mongol]] Shi-bi, the [[Yugur people|Uyghur]] Ike Mese, and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Gaoxing. \n\nMeanwhile, after defeating [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] in [[Sumatra]] in 1290, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kertanegara sent a massive army to Sumatra in this [[Pamalayu]] campaign. However, seizing the opportunity of the lack of army guarding the capital, in 1292 [[Jayakatwang]], the duke of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] (Gelang-gelang), a vassal state of Singhasari, revolted against Kertanegara.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang. Wijaya was then given permission to establish a new settlement in Tarik timberland. The new settlement was named [[Majapahit]], which was taken from [[Aegle marmelos|''maja'' fruit]] that had a bitter taste in that timberland (''maja'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter).\n\n=== Military composition ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een krijgsman uit Djokja TMnr 60040120.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century studio portrait of a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] warrior with an iron [[kris]]-tipped spear (a ''[[Tombak (spear)|tombak]]'').

Light armor was deemed more suitable in Java than heavy armor, which is a tropical country, as noted by the Khan himself. The Yuan new army's armor rate was only 20%, and the Northern Chinese army's was slightly more. They had a lot of bows, shields and other ballistic weapons. The heavily armored infantry guards behind these were armed with a spear and a heavy axe. Mongolian soldiers also brought horses. [[History of Yuan]] also mentioned the use of [[Gunpowder artillery in the Middle Ages|gunpowder weapons]], in the form of cannon (Chinese: ''[[Hu dun pao|Pao]]'').<ref name=\"yuan\" /> What kind of ships used for the campaign is not mentioned in the Yuanshi, but Worcester estimates that Yuan junks were 11 m (36 ft) in beam and over 30 m (100 ft) long.

Modern estimates place the Javanese forces at around the same size as the Mongol army, of around 20,000 to 30,000 men.<ref name=mpm/> Military forces in various parts of Southeast Asia were lightly armored. As is common in Southeast Asia, most of the Javanese forces were composed of temporarily conscripted commoners led by the warrior and noble castes.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> The Javanese navy, however, was more advanced than the Chinese.

The small states of [[Malay Peninsula|Malay]] and [[Sumatra]] submitted and sent envoys to them, and Yuan commanders left [[darughachi]]s there. It is known that the Yuan forces stopped at Ko-lan ([[Biliton]]) to plan their strategy. In February 1293, Ike Mese departed first to bring the Emperor's order to Java. The main fleet then sailed to [[Karimunjawa|Karimun Jawa]], and from there sailed to Tuban. As noted in Kidung Panji-Wijayakrama, they probably looted the coastal village of [[Tuban]]. After that, the commanders decided to split the forces into two. The first will advance inland, the second will follow them using boats. Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river). Land troops under Gao Xing and Ike Mese, which consist of cavalry and infantry, went to Du-Bing-Zu. Three commanders sailed using fast boats from Sedayu to Majapahit's floating bridge and then joined with the main troops on the way to Kali Mas river.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|112}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|22}}\n\n[[File:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of a 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]].

According to the Yuan-shi, Wijaya attacked Jayakatwang without success when he heard of the arrival of the Yuan navy. Then he requested their aid. In return, Yuan generals demanded his submission to their emperor, and he gave it.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|113}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nOn the 1 March, all of the troops gathered in Kali Mas. At the headwaters of the river was the palace of [[Tumapel]] ([[Singhasari]]) king. This river was the entryway to Java, and here they decided to battle. A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night. More than 100 large boats used to block the river were seized by Yuan forces.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nA large portion of the army was tasked to guard the estuary of Kali Mas, meanwhile, the main troops advanced. Raden Wijaya's messenger said that the king of Kediri had chased him to Majapahit and begged the Yuan army to protect him. Because the position of Kediri's army couldn't be determined, the Yuan army returned to Kali Mas. Upon hearing information from Ike Mese that the enemy's army would arrive that night, the Yuan army departed to Majapahit.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n\nOn 7 March, Kediri's army arrived from 3 directions to attack Wijaya. In the morning of 8th, Ike Mese led his troops to attack the enemy in the southwest, but couldn't find them.

Gao Xing attacked again and managed to defeat them in the evening.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n\nOn 15 March, the troops split into 3 to attack Kediri, and it was agreed that on the 19th they would meet up in Daha to begin the attack after hearing cannon fire. The first troops sailed along the river. The second troops led by Ike Mese marched along the eastern riverbank while the third troops led by Gao Xing marched along the western riverbank.

The prince of Kediri defended the city with his troops. The battle lasted from 6.00 to 14.00. After attacking 3 times, Kediri forces were defeated and fled. At the same time that the Mongol and Kediri forces clashed, Majapahit forces attacked the city from another direction and quickly defeat the guards.

After that Raden Wijaya marched his forces to the main Yuan camp and launched a surprise attack, killing many and sending the rest running back to their ships. Upon reaching a temple, the Yuan army was ambushed by the Javanese army. They managed to make a breakthrough in the middle, continuing their 123 km rout eastward. Raden Wijaya did not engage the Mongols head on, instead, he used all possible tactics to harass and reduce the enemy army bit by bit.

In 1293, he sent a large invasion fleet to Java with 20,000<ref>{{citation |last=Weatherford |first=Jack |title=Genghis khan and the making of the modern world |year=2004 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-609-80964-4 |page=239 }}</ref> to 30,000 soldiers. This was a [[punitive expedition]] against King [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], who had refused to pay tribute to the Yuan and maimed one of its ministers. However, it ended with failure for the [[Mongols]] and victory for Singhasari.\n\n==Background==\n[[Kublai Khan]], founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], the principal khanate of the [[Mongol Empire]], had sent envoys to many states to ask them to put themselves under his protection and pay tribute.

The campaign also has other purpose. According to Kubilai khan himself, if the Mongol forces were able to defeat Java, the other countries around it would submit themselves.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> That way, the Yuan Mongol Dynasty could control the Asian sea trade routes, because of the strategic geographical position of the archipelago in trading.<ref name=\"mpm\" /> \n\nAccording to the ''[[History of Yuan|Yuan shi]]'', the history of the Yuan dynasty, 20,000\u201330,000 men were collected from [[Fujian]], [[Jiangxi]] and [[Huguang]] in Southern [[China]], along with 1,000 ships and enough provisions for a year.<ref>Weatherford (2004), and also Man (2007).</ref> The officers were the [[Mongol]] Shi-bi, the [[Yugur people|Uyghur]] Ike Mese, and the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] Gaoxing. \n\nMeanwhile, after defeating [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu Dharmasraya]] in [[Sumatra]] in 1290, Singhasari became the most powerful kingdom in the region. Kertanegara sent a massive army to Sumatra in this [[Pamalayu]] campaign. However, seizing the opportunity of the lack of army guarding the capital, in 1292 [[Jayakatwang]], the duke of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kediri]] (Gelang-gelang), a vassal state of Singhasari, revolted against Kertanegara.

The king only realised the invasion from the north and sent his son-in-law, Nararya Sanggramawijaya ([[Raden Wijaya]]) northward to vanquish the rebellion. The northern attack was quashed, but the southern attack successfully remained undetected until they reached and sacked the unprepared capital city of Kutaraja. Jayakatwang usurped and killed Kertanagara during the [[Tantra]] sacred ceremony, thus bringing an end to the Singhasari kingdom.\n\nHaving learned of the fall of the Singhasari capital of Kutaraja to Kediri rebellion, Raden Wijaya tried to return and defend Singhasari but failed. He and his three colleagues, Ranggalawe, Sora and Nambi, went to exile to Madura under the protection of the regent Arya Wiraraja, Nambi's father, who then turned to Jayakatwang's side. Kertanegara's son-in-law, Raden Wijaya, submitted to Kediri, brokered by Arya Wiraraja and was pardoned by Jayakatwang. Wijaya was then given permission to establish a new settlement in Tarik timberland. The new settlement was named [[Majapahit]], which was taken from [[Aegle marmelos|''maja'' fruit]] that had a bitter taste in that timberland (''maja'' is the fruit name and ''pahit'' means bitter).\n\n=== Military composition ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Studioportret van een krijgsman uit Djokja TMnr 60040120.jpg|thumb|upright|19th-century studio portrait of a native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] warrior with an iron [[kris]]-tipped spear (a ''[[Tombak (spear)|tombak]]''). The Javanese forces consisted mostly of lightly-armored troops like this.]]\nKublai chose the troops from Southern China because they were more lightly armored. Light armor was deemed more suitable in Java than heavy armor, which is a tropical country, as noted by the Khan himself. The Yuan new army's armor rate was only 20%, and the Northern Chinese army's was slightly more. They had a lot of bows, shields and other ballistic weapons. The heavily armored infantry guards behind these were armed with a spear and a heavy axe. Mongolian soldiers also brought horses. [[History of Yuan]] also mentioned the use of [[Gunpowder artillery in the Middle Ages|gunpowder weapons]], in the form of cannon (Chinese: ''[[Hu dun pao|Pao]]'').<ref name=\"yuan\" /> What kind of ships used for the campaign is not mentioned in the Yuanshi, but Worcester estimates that Yuan junks were 11 m (36 ft) in beam and over 30 m (100 ft) long.

This is now believed to be an exaggerated or mistaken number. Modern estimates place the Javanese forces at around the same size as the Mongol army, of around 20,000 to 30,000 men.<ref name=mpm/> Military forces in various parts of Southeast Asia were lightly armored. As is common in Southeast Asia, most of the Javanese forces were composed of temporarily conscripted commoners led by the warrior and noble castes.<ref name=\"yuan\" /> The Javanese navy, however, was more advanced than the Chinese. [[Javanese junk]]s were more than 50 m (164 ft) long, able to carry 500\u20131000 men, and constructed in multiple thick planks that rendered artillery useless.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Majapahit Peradaban Maritim|last=Nugroho|first=Irawan Djoko|publisher=Suluh Nuswantara Bakti|year=2011|isbn=9786029346008|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Invasion==\nThe Yuan forces departed from the southern port of [[Quanzhou]],<ref name=chengho>{{Citation\n  | last =  Sen \n  | first = Tan Ta \n |author2=Dasheng Chen\n  | title = Cheng Ho and Islam in Southeast Asia\n  | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies\n  | date = 2009\n  | location = \n  | pages = 186\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vIUmU2ytmIIC\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 9789812308375}}</ref> traveled along the coast of [[Tr\u1ea7n dynasty]] [[Dai Viet]] and [[Champa]] along the way to their primary target. The small states of [[Malay Peninsula|Malay]] and [[Sumatra]] submitted and sent envoys to them, and Yuan commanders left [[darughachi]]s there. It is known that the Yuan forces stopped at Ko-lan ([[Biliton]]) to plan their strategy. In February 1293, Ike Mese departed first to bring the Emperor's order to Java. The main fleet then sailed to [[Karimunjawa|Karimun Jawa]], and from there sailed to Tuban. As noted in Kidung Panji-Wijayakrama, they probably looted the coastal village of [[Tuban]]. After that, the commanders decided to split the forces into two. The first will advance inland, the second will follow them using boats. Shi Bi sailed to the estuary of Sedayu, and from there went to a small river called [[Mas River|Kali Mas]] (which is a distributary of [[Brantas River|Brantas]] river). Land troops under Gao Xing and Ike Mese, which consist of cavalry and infantry, went to Du-Bing-Zu. Three commanders sailed using fast boats from Sedayu to Majapahit's floating bridge and then joined with the main troops on the way to Kali Mas river.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|112}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|22}}\n\n[[File:YuanJunk(14thcentury).jpg|thumb|left|Painting of a 14th-century [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] [[Junk (ship)|junk]].

According to the Yuan-shi, Wijaya attacked Jayakatwang without success when he heard of the arrival of the Yuan navy. Then he requested their aid. In return, Yuan generals demanded his submission to their emperor, and he gave it.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|113}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nOn the 1 March, all of the troops gathered in Kali Mas. At the headwaters of the river was the palace of [[Tumapel]] ([[Singhasari]]) king. This river was the entryway to Java, and here they decided to battle. A Javanese minister blocked the river using boats. The Yuan commanders then made a crescent-shaped encampment at the bank of the river. They instructed the waterborne troops, cavalry and infantry to move forward together, scaring the Javanese minister. The minister abandoned his boats and fled in the night. More than 100 large boats used to block the river were seized by Yuan forces.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|23}}\n\nA large portion of the army was tasked to guard the estuary of Kali Mas, meanwhile, the main troops advanced. Raden Wijaya's messenger said that the king of Kediri had chased him to Majapahit and begged the Yuan army to protect him. Because the position of Kediri's army couldn't be determined, the Yuan army returned to Kali Mas. Upon hearing information from Ike Mese that the enemy's army would arrive that night, the Yuan army departed to Majapahit.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n\nOn 7 March, Kediri's army arrived from 3 directions to attack Wijaya. In the morning of 8th, Ike Mese led his troops to attack the enemy in the southwest, but couldn't find them. Gao Xing battled the enemy in the southeast direction, eventually forcing them to flee into the mountains. Near midday, enemy troops came from the southeast. Gao Xing attacked again and managed to defeat them in the evening.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|114}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n\nOn 15 March, the troops split into 3 to attack Kediri, and it was agreed that on the 19th they would meet up in Daha to begin the attack after hearing cannon fire. The first troops sailed along the river. The second troops led by Ike Mese marched along the eastern riverbank while the third troops led by Gao Xing marched along the western riverbank. Raden Wijaya and his troops marched in the rear.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|115}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n[[File:Brantas 140722-44842 kdi.JPG|left|thumb|240x240px|21st century view of Brantas river in Kediri.]]\nThe army arrived at Daha on 19 March. The prince of Kediri defended the city with his troops. The battle lasted from 6.00 to 14.00. After attacking 3 times, Kediri forces were defeated and fled. At the same time that the Mongol and Kediri forces clashed, Majapahit forces attacked the city from another direction and quickly defeat the guards. Jayakatwang's palace was looted and burned.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kidung Harsa-Wijaya|last=Berg|first=C.C.|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff|year=1931|isbn=|location=S-Gravenhage|pages=}}</ref> A few thousands Kediri troops tried to cross the river but drowned, while 5,000 were killed in the battle.

In the afternoon Jayakatwang declared his submission to the Mongols.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|115}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\n\nOnce Jayakatwang was captured by the Mongols, Raden Wijaya returned to Majapahit, ostensibly to prepare his tribute settlement, leaving his allies to celebrate their victory. Shi-bi and Ike Mese allowed Raden Wijaya to go back to his country to prepare his tribute and a new letter of submission, but Gaoxing disliked the idea and he warned the other two. Wijaya asked the Yuan forces to come to his country unarmed.<ref name=\":2\" />{{Rp|115}}<ref name=\"sources\" />{{Rp|24}}\nTwo hundred unarmed Yuan soldiers led by two officers were sent to Raden Wijaya's country, but on 19 April Raden Wijaya quickly mobilized his forces again and ambushed the Yuan convoy. After that Raden Wijaya marched his forces to the main Yuan camp and launched a surprise attack, killing many and sending the rest running back to their ships. Upon reaching a temple, the Yuan army was ambushed by the Javanese army. They managed to make a breakthrough in the middle, continuing their 123 km rout eastward. Raden Wijaya did not engage the Mongols head on, instead, he used all possible tactics to harass and reduce the enemy army bit by bit.
