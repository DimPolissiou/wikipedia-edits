He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections and helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company. He advocated for the construction of [[internal improvements]], which would become a consistent theme throughout his public career.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=25\u201326}}{{efn|When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cop.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Youngest_Senator.htm|title=Youngest Senator|publisher=United States Senate}}</ref> It is unclear whether the state legislature or Clay himself knew that he did not meet the Senate's age requirement at the time, though he did know of the issue later in his career.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=26}} Such an age qualification issue [[United States Senate#Qualifications|has occurred with only three other U.S. Senators]]: [[Armistead Thomson Mason]], [[John Jordan Crittenden]], and [[John Eaton (politician)|John Eaton]].}} During his two-month tenure in the Senate, Clay advocated for the construction of various bridges and canals, including [[Chesapeake & Delaware Canal|a canal connecting]] the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Delaware River]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=64-67}}\n\nAfter Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|speaker]] of the state house of representatives.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=10\u201310}} That same year, in response to attacks on American shipping by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], President Jefferson arranged passage of the [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. In support of Jefferson's policy, which limited trade with foreign powers, Clay introduced a resolution to require legislators to wear [[Spinning (textiles)|homespun]] suits rather than those made of imported British [[broadcloth]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=70-71}} The vast majority of members of the state house voted for the measure, but [[Humphrey Marshall (politician)|Humphrey Marshall]], an \"aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue,\" voted against it.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} In early 1809, Clay challenged Marshall to a duel, which took place on January 19.{{sfn|Remini|1991|p=55}} While many contemporary duels were called off or fought without the intention of killing one another, both Clay and Marshall fought the duel with intent of killing their opponent.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=72-73}} They each had three turns to shoot; both were hit by bullets, but both survived.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=17}} Clay quickly recovered from his injury, and received only a minor censure from the Kentucky legislature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=74}}\n\nIn 1810, U.S. Senator [[Buckner Thruston]] resigned to accept appointment to a position as a federal judge, and Clay was selected by the legislature to fill Thruston's seat. Clay quickly emerged as a fierce critic of British attacks on American shipping, becoming part of an informal group of \"[[war hawk]]s\" who favored expansionist policies.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=26\u201330}} He also advocated the annexation of [[West Florida]], which was controlled by [[Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=79-81}} On the insistence of the Kentucky legislature, Clay helped prevent the re-charter of the [[First Bank of the United States]], arguing that it interfered with state banks and infringed on [[states' rights]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=81-83}} After serving in the Senate for one year, Clay decided that he disliked the rules of the Senate and instead sought election to the [[United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=76-78}} He won election unopposed in late 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=30}}\n\nc==Speaker of the House==\n[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|upright=.90|Portrait by [[Matthew Harris Jouett]], 1818]]\n\n===Election and leadership===\n\nThe [[1810 and 1811 United States House of Representatives elections|1810-11 elections]] produced many young, anti-British members of Congress who, like Clay, supported going to war with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]].

Clay was exceptional in his ability to control the legislative agenda through well-placed allies and the establishment of new committees, and departed from precedent by frequently taking part in floor debates.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=86}} Yet he also gained a reputation for personal courteousness and fairness in his rulings and committee appointments.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=31\u201332}} Clay's drive to increase the power of the office of speaker was aided by President [[James Madison]], who deferred to Congress in most matters.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=88-89}} [[John Randolph of Roanoke|John Randolph]], a member of the Democratic-Republican Party but also a member of the \"[[tertium quids]]\" group that opposed many federal initiatives, emerged as a prominent opponent of Speaker Clay.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=87-88}} While Randolph frequently attempted to obstruct Clay's initiatives, Clay became a master of parliamentary maneuvers that enabled him to advance his agenda even over the attempted obstruction of Randolph and others.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=96}}{{efn|The Clay\u2013Randolph rivalry eventually escalated into a duel in 1826, the second of two duels fought by Clay, and ended with both parties unhurt.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=65\u201367}}}}\n\n===Madison administration, 1811\u20131817===\n{{Further|Presidency of James Madison}}\n\nClay and other House war hawks demanded that the British revoke the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders in Council]], a series of decrees that had resulted in a de facto commercial war with the United States.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=89-90}} Though Clay recognized the dangers inherent in fighting Britain, one of the most powerful countries in the world, he saw it as the only realistic alternative to a humiliating submission to British attacks on American shipping.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=33}} Clay led a successful effort in the House to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]] against Britain, complying with a request from President Madison.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} Madison signed the declaration of war on June 18, 1812, beginning the [[War of 1812]]. During the war, Clay frequently communicated with Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] and Secretary of War [[William Eustis]], though he advocated for the replacement of the latter.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=99-101}} The war started poorly for the Americans, and Clay lost friends and relatives in the fighting.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=97-98}} In October 1813, the British asked Madison to begin negotiations in Europe, and Madison asked Clay to join his diplomatic team, as the president hoped that the presence of the leading War Hawk would ensure support for an Anglo-American peace treaty. Clay was reluctant to leave Congress, but felt duty-bound to accept the offer, and so he resigned from Congress on January 19, 1814.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=107-108}}\n\nClay left the country on February 25, but negotiations with the British did not begin until August 1814. Clay was part of a team of five commissioners that also included Treasury Secretary [[Albert Gallatin]], Senator [[James A. Bayard (elder)|James Bayard]], ambassador [[Jonathan Russell]], and ambassador [[John Quincy Adams]], the nominal head of the American team.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=108-111}} Clay and Adams maintained an uneasy relationship marked by frequent clashes, and Gallatin emerged as the unofficial leader of the American commission.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=110-115}} When the British finally presented their initial peace offer, Clay was outraged by its terms, especially the British proposal for an [[Indian barrier state]] on the [[Great Lakes]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=112-113}} After a series of American military successes in 1814, the British delegation made several concessions and offered a better peace deal.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=116-117}} While Adams and Gallatin were eager to make peace as quickly as possible even if that required sub-optimal terms in the peace treaty, Clay believed that the British, worn down by years of fighting against France, greatly desired peace with the United States. Partly due to Clay's hard-line stance, the [[Treaty of Ghent]] included relatively favorable terms for the United States, essentially re-establishing the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]'' between Britain and the U.S. The treaty was signed on December 24, 1814, bringing a close to the War of 1812.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=35\u201336}} After the signing of the treaty, Clay briefly traveled to [[London]], where he helped Gallatin negotiate a commercial agreement with Britain.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=117}}\n\nClay returned to the United States in September 1815; despite his absence, he had been elected to another term in the House of Representatives. Upon his return to Congress, Clay won election as Speaker of the House.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=119-122}} The War of 1812 strengthened Clay's support for interventionist economic policies such as federally-funded internal improvements, which he believed were necessary to improve the country's infrastructure system.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=39\u201340}} He eagerly embraced President Madison's ambitious domestic package, which included infrastructure investment, [[tariffs in United States history|tariffs]] to [[protective tariffs|protect]] domestic manufacturing, and spending increases for the army and navy. With the help of [[John C. Calhoun]] and [[William Lowndes (congressman)|William Lowndes]], Clay passed the [[Tariff of 1816]], which served the dual purpose of raising revenue and protecting American manufacturing.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=123-125}} To stabilize the currency, Clay and Treasury Secretary [[Alexander J.

At the time, the Democratic-Republicans used a [[congressional nominating caucus]] to choose their presidential nominees, giving congressmen a powerful role in the presidential selection process. Monroe and Secretary of War [[William H. Crawford|William Crawford]] emerged as the two main candidates for the Democratic-Republican nomination. Clay had a favorable opinion of both individuals, but he supported Monroe, who won the nomination and went on to defeat Federalist candidate [[Rufus King]] in the general election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=126-130}} Monroe offered Clay the position of secretary of war, but Clay strongly desired the office of secretary of state, and was angered when Monroe instead chose John Quincy Adams for that position.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=40\u201341}} Clay became so bitter that he refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber, and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration.{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=150\u2013151}}\n\nIn early 1819, a dispute erupted over the proposed statehood of [[Missouri]] after New York Congressman [[James Tallmadge, Jr.|James Tallmadge]] introduced a [[Tallmadge Amendment|legislative amendment]] that would provide for the gradual emancipation of Missouri's slaves.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=44\u201345}} Though Clay had previously called for gradual emancipation in Kentucky, he sided with the Southerners in voting down Tallmadge's amendment.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=143-144}} Clay instead supported Illinois Senator [[Jesse B.

Clay helped assemble a coalition that passed the [[Missouri Compromise]], as Thomas's proposal became known.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=45\u201346}} Further controversy ensued when Missouri's constitution banned free blacks from entering the state, but Clay was able to engineer another compromise that allowed Missouri to join as a state in August 1821.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=150-152}} \n\nIn foreign policy, Clay was a leading American supporter of the [[Latin American wars of independence|independence movements and revolutions]] that broke out in [[Latin America]] beginning in 1810.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=74\u201375}} Clay frequently called on the Monroe administration to recognize the fledgling Latin American republics, but Monroe feared that doing so would derail his plans to acquire Spanish Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=136-137}} In 1818, General [[Andrew Jackson]] crossed into Spanish Florida to suppress raids by [[Seminole]] Indians.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Though Jackson was following Monroe's implied wishes in entering Florida, he created additional controversy in seizing the Spanish town of [[Pensacola]]. Despite protests from Secretary of War Calhoun, Monroe and Adams decided to support Jackson's actions in the hope that they would convince Spain to sell Florida.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=137-138}} Clay, however, was outraged, and he publicly condemned Jackson's decision to hang two foreign nationals without a trial. Before the House chamber, he compared Jackson to military dictators of the past, telling his colleagues \"that Greece had her [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] her [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], England her [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]], France her Bonaparte, and, that if we would escape the rock on which they split, we must avoid their errors.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} Jackson saw Clay's protestations as an attack on his character, and thus began a long rivalry between Clay and Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=104\u2013105}} The rivalry and the controversy over Jackson's expedition temporarily subsided after the signing of the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], in which the U.S. purchased Florida and delineated its western boundary with [[New Spain]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=143}}\n\n====1824 presidential election====\n{{main|1824 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:House Election of 1825.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay helped Adams win the 1825 contingent House election after Clay failed to finish among the three electoral vote-winners.

Under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], the top three electoral vote-getters would be eligible to be elected by the House. Clay was confident that he would prevail in a contingent held in the chamber he presided over, so long as he was eligible for election.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=110\u2013112}} Clay won Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri, but the failure of Clay's supporters in New York and Louisiana relegated him to a fourth-place finish behind Adams, Jackson, and Crawford.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=174-175}} Clay was humiliated that he finished behind the invalid Crawford and Jackson, but supporters of the three remaining presidential candidates immediately began courting his support for the contingent election.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=176}} \n\nFor various reasons, supporters of all three candidates believed they had the best chance of winning Clay's backing, but Clay quickly settled on supporting Adams.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=122\u2013124}} Of the three candidates, Adams was the most sympathetic to Clay's American System, and Clay viewed both Jackson and the sickly Crawford as unsuitable for the presidency.{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|pages=33\u201334, 36\u201338}} On January 9, 1825, Clay privately met with Adams for three hours, after which Clay promised Adams his support; both would later claim that they did not discuss Clay's position in an Adams administration.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=179-180}} With the help of Clay, Adams won the House vote on the first ballot.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=183-184}} After his election, Adams offered Clay the position of Secretary of State, which Clay accepted, despite fears that he would be accused of trading his support for the Cabinet post. Jackson was outraged by the election, and he and his supporters accused Clay and Adams of having reached a \"[[Corrupt Bargain]].\"{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=184-185}} Pro-Jackson forces immediately began preparing for the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]], with the Corrupt Bargain accusation becoming their central issue.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=134\u2013136}}\n\n==Secretary of State==\n[[File:Clay-standing.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Henry Clay]]\n{{Further|Presidency of John Quincy Adams}}\n\nAs secretary of state, Clay was the top foreign policy official in the Adams administration, but he also held several domestic duties, such as oversight of the patent office.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=142\u2013143}} Clay came to like Adams, a former rival, and they developed a strong working relationship.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=187, 191-192}} Adams and Clay were both wary of forming entangling alliances with the emerging states, and they continued to uphold the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which called for European non-intervention in former colonies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=192-193}} Clay was rebuffed in his efforts to reach a commercial treaty and a settlement of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]] with Britain, and was also unsuccessful in his attempts to make the French pay for damages arising from attacks on American shipping during the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=192-193}} He had more success in negotiating commercial treaties with Latin American republics, reaching \"[[most favoured nation]]\" trade agreements in attempt to ensure that no European country had a trading advantage over the United States.{{sfn|Graebner|Herring|2009|pp=555-556}} Seeking deeper relations with Latin American countries, Clay strongly favored sending American delegates to the [[Congress of Panama]], but his efforts were defeated by opponents in Senate.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=145\u2013147}}\n\n[[File:National road map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Clay supported construction of the [[National Road]], which extended west from [[Cumberland, Maryland]]]]\n\nAdams proposed an ambitious domestic program based in large part on Clay's American System, but Clay warned the president that many of his proposals held little chance of passage in the [[19th United States Congress|19th Congress]].{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|page=165\u2013166}} Adams's opponents defeated many of his proposals, including the establishment of a naval academy and a national observatory, but Adams did preside over the construction or initiation of major infrastructure projects like the [[National Road]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]].{{sfn|Hargreaves|1985|page=166\u2013177}} Followers of Adams began to call themselves [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], and Jackson's followers became known as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=2207}} Both campaigns spread untrue stories about the opposing candidates.{{sfn|Remini|1981|p=134}} Adams followers denounced Jackson as a demagogue, and some Adams-aligned papers accused Jackson's wife, [[Rachel Jackson]], of [[bigamy]].

Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court.

He received [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] for president in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], and [[1844 United States presidential election|1844]] presidential elections and helped found both the [[National Republican Party]] and the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. For his role in defusing sectional crises, he earned the appellation of the \"Great Compromiser.\"\n\nClay was born in [[Hanover County, Virginia]] in 1777 and launched a legal career in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], in 1797. As a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], Clay won election to the Kentucky state legislature in 1803 and to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1810. He was chosen as speaker of the House in early 1811 and, along with President [[James Madison]], led the United States into the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. In 1814, he helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which brought an end to the War of 1812. After the war, Clay returned to his position as speaker of the House and developed the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], which called for federal [[internal improvements|infrastructure investments]], support for the [[history of central banking in the United States|national bank]], and [[protective tariff|protective]] [[tariffs in United States history|tariff rates]]. In 1820, he helped bring an end to a sectional crisis over [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] by leading the passage of the [[Missouri Compromise]].\n\nClay finished with the fourth-most electoral votes in the multi-candidate [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], and he helped [[John Quincy Adams]] win the [[contingent election]] held to select the president. President Adams appointed Clay to the prestigious position of secretary of state; critics alleged that the two had agreed to a \"[[First Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]].\" Despite receiving support from Clay and other National Republicans, Adams was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]]. Clay won election to the Senate in 1831 and ran as the National Republican nominee in the 1832 presidential election, but he was defeated by President Jackson. After the 1832 election, Clay helped bring an end to the [[Nullification Crisis]] by leading passage of the [[Tariff of 1833]]. During Jackson's second term, opponents of the president coalesced into the Whig Party, and Clay became a leading congressional Whig. \n\nClay sought the presidency in the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 election]] but was defeated at the [[1839 Whig National Convention|Whig National Convention]] by [[William Henry Harrison]]. He clashed with Harrison's running mate and successor, [[John Tyler]], who broke with Clay and other congressional Whigs after taking office in 1841. Clay resigned from the Senate in 1842 and won the 1844 Whig presidential nomination, but he was defeated in the [[1844 United States presidential election|general election]] by Democrat [[James K. Polk]], who made the annexation of the [[Republic of Texas]] his key issue. Clay strongly criticized the subsequent [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and sought the Whig presidential nomination in [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]], but was defeated by General [[Zachary Taylor]]. After returning to the Senate in 1849, Clay played a key role in passing the [[Compromise of 1850]], which resolved a crisis over the status of slavery in the [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Clay is generally regarded as one of the most important and influential political figures of his era.<ref>Smith, D.

However, Clay did not follow, as Watkins secured him temporary employment in a [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] emporium, with the promise that Clay would receive the next available clerkship at the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=13-15}}\n\nAfter Clay worked in the Richmond emporium for one year, a clerkship finally opened up at the Virginia Court of Chancery. Clay adapted well to his new role, and his handwriting earned him the attention of [[College of William and Mary|William & Mary]] professor [[George Wythe]], a signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], mentor of [[Thomas Jefferson]], and judge on Virginia's High Court of Chancery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-20}} Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary and [[amanuensis]], a role in which Clay would remain for four years.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=7}} Wythe had a powerful effect on Clay's worldview, and Clay embraced Wythe's belief that the example of the United States could help spread human freedom around the world.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=20-21}} Wythe arranged for Clay a position with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]], with the understanding that Brooke would finish Clay's legal studies.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=23}} Under Brooke's tutelage, Clay was admitted to the Virginia Bar in 1797.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=5}}\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{See also|Clay family}}\n\nOn April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Her father, Colonel Thomas Hart, was early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=12}} Hart proved to be an important business connection for Clay, as he helped Clay gain new clients and grow in professional stature.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=41\u201342}} Hart was the namesake and grand-uncle of Missouri Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and was also related to [[James Brown (Louisiana politician)|James Brown]], a prominent Louisiana politician, and [[Isaac Shelby]], the first [[Governor of Kentucky]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=12\u201313}} Henry and Lucretia would remain married until his death in 1852; she lived until 1864, dying at the age of 83.

By 1835, all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young mothers. Henry Jr. was killed while commanding a regiment at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Clay's oldest son, Theodore Wythe Clay, spent the second half of his life confined to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. When a young child, Theodore was injured by a blow to his head that fractured his skull. As he grew older his condition devolved into insanity and from 1831 until his death in 1870 he was confined to [[Eastern State Hospital (Kentucky)|an asylum in Lexington]].<ref name = \"Gatton\">{{cite journal |last1=Gatton |first1=John Spalding |title=\"Mr. Clay & I got stung\": Harriet Martineau in Lexington |journal=The Kentucky Review |date=Fall 1979 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=55-56 |url=https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1344&context=kentucky-review |accessdate=May 16, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=402}} Thomas (who had served some jail-time in Philadelphia in 1829-1830)<ref name = \"Gatton\"/> became a successful farmer, James established a legal practice (and later served in Congress), and John (who in his mid-20s was also confined to the Asylum for a short time) became a successful horse breeder.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=285\u2013286}} After the deaths of Anne and Susan, Clay and Lucretia raised several grandchildren at Ashland.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|p=288}}\n\nThey initially lived in downtown Lexington, but in 1804 they began building a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] outside of Lexington known as [[Ashland (Henry Clay estate)|Ashland]]. The Ashland estate eventually encompassed over 500 acres, with numerous outbuildings such as a smokehouse, a greenhouse, and several barns. Clay owned a maximum of about 50 slaves, and he planted crops like corn, wheat, and rye, as well as [[hemp]], the chief crop of the [[Bluegrass region]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=275\u2013277}} Clay also took a strong interest in [[thoroughbred racing]] and imported livestock such as [[Arabian horse]]s, [[Maltese donkey]]s, and [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] cattle.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=277\u2013278}} Though Clay suffered some financial issues during economic downturns, he never fell deeply into debt and ultimately left his children a large inheritance.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=279\u2013280}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Early law and political career==\n===Legal career===\n[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803\u20131810), Lexington, Kentucky]]\n\nIn November 1797, Clay relocated to Lexington, Kentucky, near where his parents and siblings resided. The Bluegrass Region, with Lexington at its center, had quickly grown in the preceding decades, but had only recently stopped being under the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] raids. Lexington was an established town that hosted [[Transylvania University]], the first university west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=27-29}} Having already passed the Virginia Bar, Clay quickly received a Kentucky license to practice law. After apprenticing himself to Kentucky attorneys such as [[George Nicholas]], [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], and James Brown, Clay established his own law practice, frequently working on debt collections and land disputes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=30-31}} Clay soon established a reputation for strong legal ability and courtroom oratory. In 1805, he was appointed to the faculty of [[Transylvania University]], where he taught, among others, future Kentucky Governor [[Robert P. Letcher]] and Robert Todd, the future father-in-law of [[Abraham Lincoln]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=43}}\n\nClay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]], who was indicted for allegedly planning an [[Burr conspiracy|expedition]] into [[New Spain|Spanish territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Biddle]]'', Clay submitted the Supreme Court's first [[amicus curiae]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=156}}\n\n===Early political career===\n\nClay began dabbling in politics shortly after arriving in Kentucky. In the first political speech of his career, Clay attacked the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], federal laws designed to suppress dissent during the [[Quasi-War]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=20\u201321}} Like most Kentuckians, Clay was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], but he clashed with state party leaders over a state constitutional convention. Using the pseudonym \"Scaevola\" (in reference to [[Gaius Mucius Scaevola]]), Clay advocated for direct elections for Kentucky elected officials and the gradual emancipation of [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slavery in Kentucky]]. The 1799 [[Kentucky Constitution]] included the direct election of public officials, but the state did not adopt Clay's plan for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33-36}} \n\nIn 1803, Clay won election to the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=21\u201323}} His first legislative initiative was the partisan [[gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymander]] of Kentucky's [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] districts, which ensured that all of Kentucky's presidential electors voted for President Thomas Jefferson in the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 presidential election]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=48-51}} Clay clashed with legislators who sought to reduce the power of Clay's Bluegrass Region, and he unsuccessfully advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to Lexington. Clay frequently opposed populist firebrand [[Felix Grundy]], and he helped defeat Grundy's effort to revoke the banking privileges of the state-owned Kentucky Insurance Company.

Clay's compromise tariff won the backing of both manufacturers, who believed they would not receive a better deal, and Calhoun, who sought a way out of the crisis but refused to work with President Jackson's supporters on an alternative tariff bill.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=217\u2013218}} Though most members of Clay's own National Republican Party opposed it, the [[Tariff of 1833]] passed both houses of Congress. Jackson simultaneously signed the tariff bill and the Force bill, and South Carolina leaders accepted the new tariff, effectively bringing the crisis to an end. Clay's role in resolving the crisis brought him renewed national stature in the wake of a crushing presidential election defeat, and some began referring to him as the \"Great Compromiser.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=219\u2013221}}\n\n====Formation of the Whig Party====\n\nFollowing the end of the Nullification Crisis in March 1833, Jackson renewed his offensive against the national bank, despite some opposition from within his own Cabinet.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=187\u2013188}} Jackson and Secretary of the Treasury [[Roger Taney]] pursued a policy of removing all federal deposits from the national bank and placing them in state-chartered banks known as \"[[pet banks]].\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=387\u2013388}} Because federal law required the president to deposit federal revenue in the national bank so long as it was financially stable, many regarded Jackson's actions as illegal, and Clay led the passage of a Senate motion [[Censure in the United States|censuring]] Jackson.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=225\u2013227}} Nonetheless, the national bank's federal charter expired in 1836, and though the institution continued to function under a Pennsylvania charter, it never regained the influence it had had at the beginning of Jackson's administration.{{sfn|Cole|1993|pp=209\u2013211}}\n\nThe removal of deposits helped unite Jackson's opponents into one party for the first time, as National Republicans, Calhounites, former Democrats, and members of the Anti-Masonic Party coalesced into the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=227\u2013228}} The term \"Whig\" originated from a speech Clay delivered in 1834, in which he compared opponents of Jackson to the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]], a British political party opposed to [[absolute monarchy]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=266}} Neither the Whigs nor the Democrats were unified geographically or ideologically. However, Whigs tended to favor a stronger legislature, a stronger federal government, a higher tariff, greater spending on infrastructure, re-authorization of the Second Bank of the United States, and publicly funded education. Conversely, Democrats tended to favor a stronger president, stronger state governments, lower tariffs, [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]], and expansionism. Neither party took a strong national stand on slavery.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=313-315}} The Whig base of support lay in wealthy businessmen, professionals, the professional class, and large planters, while the Democratic base of support lay in immigrant [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]] and yeomen farmers, but each party appealed across class lines.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=229\u2013231}}\n\nPartly due to grief over the death of his daughter, Anne, Clay chose not to run in the [[1836 United States presidential election|1836 presidential election]], and the Whigs were too disorganized to nominate a single candidate.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=272-273}} Three Whig candidates ran against Van Buren: General [[William Henry Harrison]], Senator [[Hugh Lawson White]], and Senator Daniel Webster. By running multiple candidates, the Whigs hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives. Clay personally preferred Webster, but he threw his backing behind Harrison who had the broadest appeal among voters. Clay's decision not to endorse Webster opened a rift between the two Whig party leaders, and Webster would work against Clay in future presidential elections.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=239\u2013241}} Despite the presence of multiple Whig candidates, Van Buren won the 1836 election with 50.8 percent of the popular vote and 170 of the 294 electoral votes.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=274}}\n\n===Van Buren administration, 1837\u20131841===\n{{See also|Presidency of Martin Van Buren}}\n[[File:1839WhigPresidentialNomination1stBallot.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Clay (brown) won the backing of several state delegations on the first ballot of the [[1839 Whig National Convention]], but [[William Henry Harrison]] ultimately won the party's presidential nomination.]]\n\nVan Buren's presidency was quickly hit by the [[Panic of 1837]], a major recession that badly damaged the Democratic Party.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=279-280}} Clay and other Whigs argued that Jackson's policies, including the use of pet banks, had encouraged speculation and caused the panic.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=242\u2013243}} He promoted the American System as a means for economic recovery, but President Van Buren's response focused on the practice of \"strict economy and frugality.\"{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=505\u2013506}} As the [[1840 United States presidential election|1840 presidential election]] approached, many expected that the Whigs would win control of the presidency due to the ongoing economic crisis.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=84}} Clay initially viewed Webster as his strongest rival,{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=284-287}} but Clay, Harrison, and General [[Winfield Scott]] emerged as the principal candidates at the [[1839 Whig National Convention]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=296-297, 300}} \n\nThough he was widely regarded as the most qualified Whig leader to serve as president, many Whigs questioned Clay's electability after two presidential election defeats. He also faced opposition in the North due to his ownership of slaves and lingering association with the Freemasons, and in the South from Whigs who distrusted his moderate stance on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=249\u2013254}} Clay won a plurality on the first ballot of the Whig National Convention, but, with the help of [[Thurlow Weed]] and other backers, Harrison consolidated support on subsequent ballots and won the Whig presidential nomination on the fifth ballot of the convention.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=257\u2013258}} Seeking to placate Clay's supporters and to balance the ticket geographically, the convention chose former Virginia Governor and Senator [[John Tyler]], a personal friend of Clay, whose previous career in the Democratic Party had practically come to an end, as the vice presidential nominee.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=309-310}} Clay was disappointed by the outcome, but helped Harrison's ultimately successful campaign by delivering numerous speeches.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=311-312}} With Whigs also winning control of Congress in the [[1840 United States elections|1840 elections]], Clay saw the upcoming [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] as an opportunity for the Whig Party to establish itself as the dominant political party by leading the country out of recession.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=261\u2013263}}\n\n===Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1841\u20131845===\n{{See also|Presidency of William Henry Harrison|Presidency of John Tyler}}\n\nPresident-elect Harrison asked Clay to serve another term as Secretary of State, but Clay chose to remain in Congress.

Clay and his congressional allies attempted to craft a national bank bill acceptable to Tyler, but Tyler vetoed two separate bills to re-establish the national bank, showing that he in fact had no will to reach a solution for the party's issues. Clay and other Whig leaders were now outraged not only by Tyler's rejection of the Whig party platform, but also because they felt that Tyler had purposely misled them into thinking that he would sign the bills.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=265\u2013269}} \n\nAfter the second veto, congressional Whigs voted to expel Tyler from the party, and on Clay's request every Cabinet member except for Webster, who wanted to continue negotiating the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]] with Great Britain about the border to Canada, resigned from office.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=351-353}} This made Tyler increasingly move closer to his former Democratic Party and, with Webster still serving in the Tyler administration, Clay emerged as the clear leader of the Whig Party.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=270\u2013271}} In early 1842, Clay resigned from the Senate after arranging for Crittenden to succeed him.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=362-363}} Though he vetoed other Whig bills, Tyler did sign some Whig priorities into law, including the [[Preemption Act of 1841]], which distributed the proceeds of land sales to the states, and the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, which was the first law in U.S. history that allowed for voluntary bankruptcy.{{sfn|Howe|2007|pp=592\u2013593}} Facing a large budget deficit, Tyler also signed the [[Tariff of 1842]], which restored the protective rates of the Tariff of 1832 but ended the distribution policy that had been established with the Preemption Act of 1841.{{sfn|Peterson|1989|pp=103\u2013108}}\n\n====1844 presidential election====\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1844.svg|thumb|upright=1|James K.

Though contemporaries credited Fillmore, Douglas, and Webster for their role in passing the Compromise of 1850, Clay was widely regarded as the key figure in ending a major sectional crisis.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=365\u2013367}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Henry Clay monument.jpg|thumb|Henry Clay monument and mausoleum, Lexington Cemetery]]\n\nIn December 1851, with his health declining, Clay announced that he would resign from the Senate the following September.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}} On June 29, 1852, Clay died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 75 in his room at the [[National Hotel (Washington, D.C.)|National Hotel]].<ref>John DeFerrari.

Crosby: An Autobiography'' ([[Peabody, Massachusetts]]: Hendrickson Publishers Marketing, 2013 printing), p. 87, {{ISBN|978-1-59856-281-1}}.</ref>}}\n\n==Ideology and slavery==\n===American System===\n{{main|American System (economic plan)}}\n\nThroughout most of his political life, Clay promoted his American System as both an economic program and a means for unifying the country. Clay's American System rejected [[strict constructionism]] in favor of an activist government that would help ensure a fairer and more efficient distribution of economic gains. The American System had four key tenets: high tariffs, a stable financial system, federal investment in internal improvements, and a public land sale policy designed to raise revenue and provide for carefully-managed expansion into the [[American frontier]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=80\u201382}} Through high tariffs, Clay hoped to free the United States from dependence on foreign imports, especially from Britain.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=85\u201387}} Clay sought to ensure a stable financial system through support for the national bank, which regulated the country's banking system and helped ensure a consistent supply of credit.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=87\u201389}} Clay's support for federally-financed internal improvements stemmed from his belief that only the federal government could construct the transportation system necessary for uniting the country commercially and culturally.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=89\u201391}} His land policy was centered on the using revenue from land sales to fund money to the states, which could then invest that money in education, infrastructure projects, and other priorities.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=220\u2013221}}\n\n===Slavery and the Dupuy case===\n\nClay inherited slaves as a young child,{{sfn|Eaton|1957|pp=6\u20137}} and he continued to own slaves throughout his life. However, in the 1790s, he adopted antislavery views under the influence of his mentor George Wythe.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=19-21}} Like most of his contemporaries, Clay was not a racial egalitarian, and he never called for the immediate abolition of slavery, but he viewed slavery as a \"grievous wrong to the slave\" and spoke in favor of equal treatment for [[free black]]s.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=189\u2013191}} Early in his career, Clay favored gradual emancipation in both Kentucky and Missouri, but each state rejected plans that would have provided for gradual emancipation.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=33\u201336, 143-144}} Clay continued to  support gradual emancipation throughout his career, and in 1849 he published an open letter calling for gradual emancipation in Kentucky.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=354\u2013356}} Unlike many other Southern leaders, he consistently favored recognition of [[Haiti]], which had been established through a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]].{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=191\u2013192}} \n\nIn 1816, Clay helped establish the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa. The group was made up of [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] who wanted to end slavery and slaveholders who wanted to deport free blacks.{{sfn|Eaton|1957|p=133}} Clay's support for colonization reflected his belief that a multiracial society was ultimately unworkable, both for whites and free blacks.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=198\u2013199}} Later in his career, Clay became increasingly concerned about abolitionism, remarking that \"the ultraism of the South on the one hand ... and the ultraism of abolition on the other\" represented the greatest threat to the Union. Nonetheless, he consistently defended the right of abolitionists to send materials through the mail and opposed the [[gag rule]], which limited congressional debate on slavery.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=204\u2013205, 247}}\n\nMany contemporaries, including anti-slavery activist [[James G. Birney]], believed that Clay's home state of Kentucky had the most permissive slave laws of any slave state. Clay considered himself to be a \"good\" master, and biographer James C. Klotter concludes that Clay took actions, such as keeping families together, to mitigate the harshness of slavery. Klotter also concludes that there is no evidence that Clay ever had an affair with any of his slaves. Yet, as Clay himself wrote, \"here in Kentucky slavery is in its most mitigated form, still it is slavery.\"{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=192\u2013193, 196}} In 1829, Clay's slave, [[Charlotte Dupuy]], [[freedom suit|sued for her freedom]] while visiting relatives in Maryland. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in Washington until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for Martin Van Buren, Clay's successor as secretary of state.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|pp=217-218}} The case embarrassed Clay politically and personally, but he ultimately prevailed in court. After winning the case, Clay sent Dupuy to New Orleans, causing her to be away from her own family, but he later freed Dupuy and two of her children.{{sfn|Klotter|2018|pp=195\u2013196}} Clay's will freed all the slaves he held at the time of his death.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2010|p=484}}\n\n==Legacy==\n===Historical reputation===\n\n\nClay's Whig Party collapsed shortly after his death, but Clay cast a long shadow over the generation of political leaders that presided over the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Mississippi Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] stated his opinion that \"had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860-'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war\".{{sfn|Remini|1991|pp=761\u2013762}}<ref name=\"king1\">{{cite magazine|last1=King|first1=Gilbert|title=The Day Henry Clay Refused to Compromise|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-day-henry-clay-refused-to-compromise-153589853/?no-ist|accessdate=25 October 2016|magazine=Smithsonian|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> Clay's protege and fellow Kentuckian, John J.

After recording their [[shoegaze]]-influenced debut album ''[[Methodrone]]'' (1995) and releasing a collection of early recordings, ''[[Spacegirl & Other Favorites]]'', the band took influence from 1960s British [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[garage rock]] and recorded ''Take it from the Man!'' from November 1995\u2013February 1996. After recording the entire album with an unnamed producer who scrapped the recordings, the band re-recorded the album on a minimal budget, mostly at Lifesource Studios in [[Emeryville, California]] with production from [[Psychic TV]]'s [[Larry Thrasher]], whose usual \"studio\" approach was vetoed out by the band's back-to-basics approach.\n\nThe album's psychedelic garage rock has often been compared to [[the Rolling Stones]]. Released by [[Bomp! Records]] on May 28, 1996, it is the first of three full-length albums released by the band in 1996, preceding ''[[Their Satanic Majesties' Second Request]]'' and ''[[Thank God for Mental Illness]]''. The album was released to critical acclaim, with journalists praising the exuding of its influences and spirit. Newcombe has since named the album as one of his favorites by the band. The album has featured in several \"best of\" lists and has been cited by several musicians as an influence. \"Straight Up and Down\", which is featured in two alternate versions on the album, later became the theme music for ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]''.\n\n==Background==\nIn 1995, The Brian Jonestown Massacre, lead by frontman [[Anton Newcombe]], along with bassist [[Matt Hollywood]], guitarist [[Dean Taylor (musician)|Dean Taylor]], organist Mara Regal, accordionist Dawn Thomas, drummer Brian Glaze, and \"Spokesman for the Revolution\" [[Joel Gion]] released their debut album ''[[Methodrone]]'' which featured a [[shoegazing]]-influenced style.<ref name=\"allmusic.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-brian-jonestown-massacre-mn0000614455/biography|title=The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> Although the album was critically acclaimed, the band never returned the album's sound \"in full,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/methodrone-mw0000181271|title=Methodrone - The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> and issued ''[[Spacegirl & Other Favorites]]'' later in the year, a collection of the band's earliest recordings from 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/spacegirl-and-other-favorites-mw0000026988|title=Spacegirl and Other Favorites - The Brian Jonestown Massacre - Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref> Looking for a change in direction, and under the influence of 1960s British rock music, the band soon began work on ''Take it from the Man!''. In the liner notes, Newcombe jokingly recalls the album's conception:\n{{quote|\"I, Anton A. Newcombe, do solemnly swear that the ghost of [[Brian Jones]] came to me in the studio and asked me to make this record. P.S. He also asked that I kick the shit out of old [[Mick Jagger|Mick]] and [[Keith Richards|Keith]] for ripping off his band, girl and money, having him murdered, being glad he's dead, and for not being very nice people.\"<ref name=\"booklet1\" />}}\n\n==Recording==\nAccording to the liner notes, ''Take it from the Man!'' was recorded \"live\" between November 1995 and February 1996 at Dance Home Studio and [[Larry Thrasher]]'s Lifesource Studios in [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], [[California]], with digital editing undertaken at Music Box, [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\"booklet1\">{{cite AV media notes| title = Take it from the Man!| others= The Brian Jonestown Massacre| year = 1996| type = liner| publisher = [[Bomp!

I was like, 'Fuck you dude. Then I'm gonna kick your ass the minute I see you on the street.' He did end up destroying it but I let him off the hook as far as the violence.\"<ref name=\"psychicgloss\" />\n\n{{\nQuote box\n | quote  = \"\nLarry Thrasher from Psychic TV was interested and told us how [[Genesis P-Orridge|Genesis [P-Orridge]]] had seen our band and somehow conversation started and Larry wanted to produce us so he borrowed this studio from Counting Crows or something for us to record in.\"\n | source =&nbsp;\u2014[[Anton Newcombe]].<ref name=\"psychicgloss\" />\n | width  = 25%\n | align  = right\n | style  = padding:10px;\n}}\nWith the band needing to re-record the album in its entirety, [[Larry Thrasher]] from [[Psychic TV]] became interested in the band and producing the album, and borrowed a recording studio, possibly belonging to the [[Counting Crows]], for the band to record in, presumably his Lifesource Studios credited in the liner notes.<ref name=\"psychicgloss\" /> Newcombe stated that, with a line-up of Newcombe, Dean Taylor (guitar), Matt Hollywood (bass) and Brian Glaze (drums), the band showed up on the day of recording without guitarist Jeff Davies because \"he was a junkie\" and so Newcombe's girlfriend Dawn played guitar instead.<ref name=\"psychicgloss\" /> The album was recorded on a minimal budget.<ref name=\"translate.google.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://www.xsilence.net/disque-3309.htm&prev=search|title=Google Translate|website=Translate.googl.eco.uk|accessdate=9 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhen the band turned up to the studio, they were surprised to find that Thrasher had \"about sixteen [[microphone practice|microphones set up]] for the drums,\" because the band preferred a stripped down studio approach; Newcombe stated that \"I asked him, 'What the hell is this?' and he said, 'Well, these are for the drums\u2026' and I was like, 'We don't need sixteen mics for the drums. Take all of these away. I'm gonna use three mics for the drums and we're gonna record it live, all at once. We're just gonna put all the [[guitar amp]]s down the hallway, the drums will be in here, and we'll put on headphones and we'll just play our set.'

After recording the entire album with an unnamed producer who scrapped the recordings, the band re-recorded the album on a minimal budget, mostly at Lifesource Studios in [[Emeryville, California]] with production from [[Psychic TV]]'s [[Larry Thrasher]], whose usual \"studio\" approach was vetoed out by the band's back-to-basics approach.\n\nThe album's psychedelic garage rock has often been compared to [[the Rolling Stones]].

He traveled to Germany and brought 5,000 Jews to America.\n\nIn 1936, the American Jewish Congress was instrumental in establishing the [[World Jewish Congress|World Jewish Congress (WJC)]]. Maintaining his position as President of the AJCongress, Rabbi Wise was also elected president of the WJC. During World War II, the AJCongress acted as a liaison between the U.S. government and the WJC on issues relating to rescue attempts made on behalf of European Jews.\n\n===The 1940s===\nIn August 1942, [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Rabbi Wise]] received a cable from [[Gerhart M. Riegner|Gerhart Riegner]],<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Riegner.html JVL Website]</ref> the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] representative in Switzerland. Riegner reported that the Nazis had planned, and were implementing, a policy to [[The Holocaust|exterminate]] all of European Jewry; the cable also referred specifically to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp]]. After the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] confirmed the accuracy of the information in the cable, now known as the [[Riegner Telegram]], the AJCongress convened a Joint Emergency Committee.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/jewplan.html Joint Emergency Committee]</ref> The committee sought to coordinate the major Jewish organizations in the United States to lobby the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration to take increased measures rescuing European Jews.\n\t \nIn December 1942, the American Jewish Congress established a Planning Committee, which sought support for a variety of rescue proposals. The committee was never more than marginally successful in mobilizing American public support for rescue efforts. The most impressive of these projects was another rally at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Held on March 1, 1943, the rally drew a crowd of 70,000. Similar rallies were subsequently held in a number of cities throughout the United States.\n\nIn August 1943, Rabbi Wise met [[Jan Karski]].\n\nThe American Jewish Congress was pro-[[Zionism|Zionist]] in its platform. Its leadership overlapped with that of the [[Zionist Organization of America|Zionist Organization of America (ZOA)]]. As a result, the two organizations agreed to concentrate on different tasks during the war. The American Jewish Congress dedicated itself to rescuing European Jews, while the ZOA worked to establish a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. This arrangement continued after the war, although its significance decreased after the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe AJCongress was a pioneer in the struggle for [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewry]] long before it became a popular movement.\n\nDomestically, the AJCongress became active as well. It was the first Jewish organization to use law and legislation to protect the rights of American Jews, at a time when other Jewish organizations were using appeals to goodwill to achieve this objective.\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s===\n[[Joachim Prinz|Rabbi Joachim Prinz]] (1902\u201388) was President of the AJCongress from 1958 to 1966.  He served as a founding chairman of the 1963 [[March on Washington]] and spoke at that event.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520222318&id=qW-NYdIefPgC&pg=PA517&lpg=PA517&dq=%22Joachim+Prinz%22&sig=_hiqidL5P02UKz54ievBkopqCuo ''Papers of Martin Luther King'', pg 517]</ref>\n\nThe AJCongress was involved in legal proceedings that sometimes conflicted with other Jewish American organizations. In 1966, the AJCongress joined the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], the United Parents Associations, and the [[United Federation of Teachers]] in filing suit against provisions of the [[Federal Education Act]], which would provide support to religious schools. Jewish day school educators and leaders in over 30 states and over 100 communities representing 330 Hebrew day schools insisted that the American Jewish Congress did not speak for American Jews on religious or educational issues, and was viewed by some in the Jewish community as primarily a secular agency. The President of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (also known as the [[Orthodox Union]]), Rabbi Joseph Karasick, said that the American Jewish Congress \u201cspeaks for itself only and is under no circumstances to be taken as representing the American Jewish community. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, central spokesman for this country\u2019s 3,100 Orthodox synagogues, as well as all Orthodox rabbinic bodies and every other Orthodox Jewish body, have given full support to the Federal Education Act and deem its provisions to be consonant with the principle of church-state separation.\u201d<ref>[http://www.jta.org/1966/12/05/archive/orthodox-groups-to-defend-in-court-federal-aid-to-parochial-schools Orthodox Groups to Defend in Court Federal Aid to Parochial Schools] JTA, 5 December 1966</ref>\n\nIn late 1978 New York State's prison system reached an agreement, brokered in part by AJCongress's then-assistant executive director Marc D.

There were disputes over ideological issues and finances. Some of those chapters have since reestablished themselves as independent non-profits focused on liberal social and community issues. Finding the AJCongress had become too conservative, members of the Los Angeles chapter, for instance, created the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance|Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA)]] in 1999.<ref name=\"encycjud\">{{cite web | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587516109&v=2.1&u=new27191&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=519b978883006e7d3f29e74131072396 | title=Progressive Jewish Alliance Ed.

The Progressive Jewish Alliance expanded in February 2005 by opening a San Francisco Bay Area chapter.\n\nThe AJCongress has since regrouped and is actively engaged in constitutional issues domestically and supporting [[Israel]] and challenging [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] abroad.\n\n===2000\u20132010===\nIn 2004, the AJCongress led a successful effort to keep federal funds out of Catholic schools. U.S. District Judge [[Gladys Kessler]] sided with the American Jewish Congress, which argued that federal funds were being used to pay for the teaching of Catholic values through programs such as the [[University of Notre Dame]]\u2019s Alliance for Catholic Education. [[AmeriCorps]] argued that its funding was based on a program\u2019s secular activities, not religious teachings. But Judge Kessler ruled that the religious and secular activities were not sufficiently separated or monitored.<ref>[http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/americorps-sponsor-must-stop-funding-catholic-programs AmeriCorps sponsor must stop funding Catholic programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929090611/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/americorps-sponsor-must-stop-funding-catholic-programs |date=2014-09-29 }} The First Amendment Center, 7 July 2004</ref>\n\nThe AJCongress suspended its activities and laid off much of its staff on July 13, 2010 because it had run out of operating funds due to losses in the [[Madoff scandal]].<ref name=\"JTA Madoff\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/07/20/2740132/ex-ajcongress-employees-put-in-tough-spot |title=AJCongress shutters quickly, pays debts slowly |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency (jta.org) |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |author=Berkman, Jacob |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724065258/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/07/20/2740132/ex-ajcongress-employees-put-in-tough-spot |archivedate=2010-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"FOX Madoff\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/20/jewish-group-eyes-merger-ajc-losing-money-madoff-scam/ |title=U.S. Jewish Group Eyes Merger With AJC After Losing Money in Madoff Scam |date=20 July 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026050607/http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/07/20/jewish-group-eyes-merger-ajc-losing-money-madoff-scam/ |archivedate=October 26, 2012 |publisher=Fox News |url-status=live }}</ref> It disclosed that it lost roughly $21 million of the $24 million in endowments it had invested through [[Bernie Madoff|Bernard Madoff]] and his firm, money that supported the AJCongress and its programs. The endowments supported about one quarter of the AJCongress\u2019 budget, which was $6.2 million in 2006. The AJCongress had connected with Madoff through Martin and Lillian Steinberg, supporters of AJCongress and friends of Madoff who invested with him, and Madoff became a trusted advisor of AJCongress on financial matters. The AJCongress increased its investments with Madoff in 2004, after it sold its New York headquarters for $18 million in 2003, and when the Steinbergs died they left approximately $17 million to the organization, which was also invested with Madoff. While the financial losses of the endowment were crippling, others noted that the AJCongress had long been in the shadow of larger American Jewish organizations such as the [[American Jewish Committee|American Jewish Committee (AJC)]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League (ADL)]]. While the AJCongress focused on religious freedom in America, free speech, and women's rights, donors showed more interest in Israel and anti-Semitism.<ref>[http://forward.com/articles/14905/ajcongress-crippled-by-madoff-scandal-/ \"AJCongress Crippled by Madoff Scandal\"] ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 8 January 2009</ref>\n\nWhile the AJCongress had a long history of fighting aid to religious schools, the effort proved to be in conflict with Orthodox Jewish communities that were very successful in attracting government funds for students. An investigation by ''[[The Forward|The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' showed that each year, tens of millions of dollars in federal [[Pell Grant]]s go to [[yeshiva]]s, which typically focus on [[Talmud]] study rather than secular subjects. For 2010, 63 of the 152 religious institutions that received Pell Grants were Jewish, the data shows. The Jewish schools received 53% of the $84.5 million in Pell Grant money that went to religious schools in 2010. Of the top 10 Pell Grant recipients in dollar terms in 2010, six were yeshivas.<ref>[http://forward.com/articles/164946/yeshivas-score-huge-pell-grant-windfall/?p=all \"Yeshivas Score Huge Pell Grant Windfall Jewish Religious Colleges Get Tens of Millions in Federal Aid\"] ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2012, the AJCongress spent 16.5% of its expenses on programs and services it delivered.

Today, the American Jewish Congress primarily focuses on the following challenges: strengthening the bond between the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Israel]]; combating domestic and global [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]; combating the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement]]; preventing a nuclear [[Iran]]; and promoting cooperation and trade between Israel and countries around the world.\n\nAmong its major programs are the International Mayors Conference, where the organization brings over 30 mayors from around the world to promote [[Israel]] back in their cities. Past participants include [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Bill de Blasio]], [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]], [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier of Taiwan]] [[William Lai]], and former [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Matteo Renzi]].\n\nMoreover, the organization successfully fights the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement]]<ref>[https://www.pressreader.com/israel/jerusalem-post/20180422/281655370674286]</ref> and believes that BDS is not a purely anti-Israel issue, but a human right issue. Moreover, in order to make decision makers more accessible to the [[American Jews|Jewish community]], the organization created the 500 Club and executive briefing meetings and conference calls with the decision makers and members of the Jewish community.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-friedman-restructuring-gaza-without-pa-tremendous-prize-for-hamas-1.6431064]</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Congress meets regularly with global leaders<ref>https://medium.com/@munrkazmir/guatemalan-president-jimmy-morales-is-a-great-friend-to-western-democracy-921e9cdb003c</ref> in order to promote the U.S.\u2013Israel alliance.

The Women's Division, founded 1933, carried on these activities for approximately fifty years before it was discontinued as a separate section; the organization subsequently continued its support for women's rights and [[Feminism|feminist]] perspectives under the auspices of the Commission for Women's Equality (CWE), which was established in 1984.<ref>Svonkin, Stuart. \"[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/american-jewish-congress American Jewish Congress].\" ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. 1 March 2009.

The 1996 conference, \"Understanding the Genetics of Breast Cancer: Implications for Treatment, Policy and Advocacy,\" organized by national CWE, has been duplicated by AJCongress regions nationwide. In 2000, CWE presented Cancer Genetics in the Ashkenazi Community, to explore medical breakthroughs since the first conference as well as new developments in genetic testing. This follow-up conference was distinctly more upbeat than its predecessor, both in terms of medical preventive measures and in regard to legislation to ensure privacy and eliminate discrimination based on testing.\n\nIn 1988, AJCongress hosted \"The First International Jewish Feminist Conference: The Empowerment of Women\" in Israel to address women's rights.  More than 600 Jewish women from around the world attended, including former Congresswoman [[Bella Abzug]] and [[Betty Friedan]]. Some of the attendees visited the Kotel, Torah in hand and found that they were not allowed to pray in their fashion because of Orthodox restrictions on women wearing religious items, singing or reading Torah. A movement began, now known around the world as [[Women of the Wall]], headed by [[Anat Hoffman]]. Polls show that in Israel \"64 percent of the secular public, 53 percent of the traditional non-religious public, and 26 percent of the traditional-religious public support the group, [[Women of the Wall]], and their quest to pray at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] in their fashion.

[[Rabbi Stephen S. Wise]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Louis Brandeis]], and others joined to lay the groundwork for a national democratic organization of Jewish leaders from all over the country, to rally for equal rights for all Americans regardless of race, religion, or national ancestry.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788721,00.html Time Magazine, June 20, 1938]</ref>\n\nIn addition to its stated goal of equal rights for all, it was founded to broaden Jewish leadership and to present a unified American Jewish position at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]]. It became effective as a pressure group in 1928 under the leadership of [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise]], who remained the President and chief spokesperson of the AJCongress until his death in 1949. The current head of the AJCongress is [[Jack Rosen]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Secretary Powell to Attend Berlin Conference on Anti-Semitism |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/31530.htm |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===The 1930s===\nThroughout the 1930s, [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Rabbi Wise]] was vocal in his warnings about the dangers of [[Nazism]]. When [[Adolf Hitler]] was named Chancellor of [[Germany]] on January 30, 1933, Wise organized a mass protest rally at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. He did this despite strong opposition by the German government, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], and conservative Jewish organizations such as the [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[B'nai B'rith]]. The American Jewish Congress continued to organize protest rallies throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In August 1933, the American Jewish Congress led a general boycott of German goods.<ref>[http://www.ajhs.org/scholarship/chapters/chapter.cfm?documentID=230 American Jewish Historical Society]</ref>\n\nIn 1934, Daniel Marks was named head of the AJCongress. He traveled to Germany and brought 5,000 Jews to America.\n\nIn 1936, the American Jewish Congress was instrumental in establishing the [[World Jewish Congress|World Jewish Congress (WJC)]]. Maintaining his position as President of the AJCongress, Rabbi Wise was also elected president of the WJC. During World War II, the AJCongress acted as a liaison between the U.S. government and the WJC on issues relating to rescue attempts made on behalf of European Jews.\n\n===The 1940s===\nIn August 1942, [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Rabbi Wise]] received a cable from [[Gerhart M. Riegner|Gerhart Riegner]],<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Riegner.html JVL Website]</ref> the [[World Jewish Congress|WJC]] representative in Switzerland. Riegner reported that the Nazis had planned, and were implementing, a policy to [[The Holocaust|exterminate]] all of European Jewry; the cable also referred specifically to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp]]. After the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] confirmed the accuracy of the information in the cable, now known as the [[Riegner Telegram]], the AJCongress convened a Joint Emergency Committee.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/jewplan.html Joint Emergency Committee]</ref> The committee sought to coordinate the major Jewish organizations in the United States to lobby the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration to take increased measures rescuing European Jews.\n\t \nIn December 1942, the American Jewish Congress established a Planning Committee, which sought support for a variety of rescue proposals. The committee was never more than marginally successful in mobilizing American public support for rescue efforts. The most impressive of these projects was another rally at [[Madison Square Garden]]. Held on March 1, 1943, the rally drew a crowd of 70,000. Similar rallies were subsequently held in a number of cities throughout the United States.\n\nIn August 1943, Rabbi Wise met [[Jan Karski]].\n\nThe American Jewish Congress was pro-[[Zionism|Zionist]] in its platform. Its leadership overlapped with that of the [[Zionist Organization of America|Zionist Organization of America (ZOA)]]. As a result, the two organizations agreed to concentrate on different tasks during the war. The American Jewish Congress dedicated itself to rescuing European Jews, while the ZOA worked to establish a Jewish state in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. This arrangement continued after the war, although its significance decreased after the creation of the [[Israel|State of Israel]] in 1948.\n\nThe AJCongress was a pioneer in the struggle for [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewry]] long before it became a popular movement.\n\nDomestically, the AJCongress became active as well. It was the first Jewish organization to use law and legislation to protect the rights of American Jews, at a time when other Jewish organizations were using appeals to goodwill to achieve this objective.\n\n===The 1960s and 1970s===\n[[Joachim Prinz|Rabbi Joachim Prinz]] (1902\u201388) was President of the AJCongress from 1958 to 1966.  He served as a founding chairman of the 1963 [[March on Washington]] and spoke at that event.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520222318&id=qW-NYdIefPgC&pg=PA517&lpg=PA517&dq=%22Joachim+Prinz%22&sig=_hiqidL5P02UKz54ievBkopqCuo ''Papers of Martin Luther King'', pg 517]</ref>\n\nThe AJCongress was involved in legal proceedings that sometimes conflicted with other Jewish American organizations. In 1966, the AJCongress joined the [[New York Civil Liberties Union]], the United Parents Associations, and the [[United Federation of Teachers]] in filing suit against provisions of the [[Federal Education Act]], which would provide support to religious schools. Jewish day school educators and leaders in over 30 states and over 100 communities representing 330 Hebrew day schools insisted that the American Jewish Congress did not speak for American Jews on religious or educational issues, and was viewed by some in the Jewish community as primarily a secular agency. The President of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (also known as the [[Orthodox Union]]), Rabbi Joseph Karasick, said that the American Jewish Congress \u201cspeaks for itself only and is under no circumstances to be taken as representing the American Jewish community. The Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, central spokesman for this country\u2019s 3,100 Orthodox synagogues, as well as all Orthodox rabbinic bodies and every other Orthodox Jewish body, have given full support to the Federal Education Act and deem its provisions to be consonant with the principle of church-state separation.\u201d<ref>[http://www.jta.org/1966/12/05/archive/orthodox-groups-to-defend-in-court-federal-aid-to-parochial-schools Orthodox Groups to Defend in Court Federal Aid to Parochial Schools] JTA, 5 December 1966</ref>\n\nIn late 1978 New York State's prison system reached an agreement, brokered in part by AJCongress's then-assistant executive director Marc D.

There were disputes over ideological issues and finances. Some of those chapters have since reestablished themselves as independent non-profits focused on liberal social and community issues. Finding the AJCongress had become too conservative, members of the Los Angeles chapter, for instance, created the [[Progressive Jewish Alliance|Progressive Jewish Alliance (PJA)]] in 1999.<ref name=\"encycjud\">{{cite web | url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX2587516109&v=2.1&u=new27191&it=r&p=GVRL&sw=w&asid=519b978883006e7d3f29e74131072396 | title=Progressive Jewish Alliance Ed.

U.S. District Judge [[Gladys Kessler]] sided with the American Jewish Congress, which argued that federal funds were being used to pay for the teaching of Catholic values through programs such as the [[University of Notre Dame]]\u2019s Alliance for Catholic Education. [[AmeriCorps]] argued that its funding was based on a program\u2019s secular activities, not religious teachings.

The endowments supported about one quarter of the AJCongress\u2019 budget, which was $6.2 million in 2006. The AJCongress had connected with Madoff through Martin and Lillian Steinberg, supporters of AJCongress and friends of Madoff who invested with him, and Madoff became a trusted advisor of AJCongress on financial matters. The AJCongress increased its investments with Madoff in 2004, after it sold its New York headquarters for $18 million in 2003, and when the Steinbergs died they left approximately $17 million to the organization, which was also invested with Madoff. While the financial losses of the endowment were crippling, others noted that the AJCongress had long been in the shadow of larger American Jewish organizations such as the [[American Jewish Committee|American Jewish Committee (AJC)]] and the [[Anti-Defamation League|Anti-Defamation League (ADL)]]. While the AJCongress focused on religious freedom in America, free speech, and women's rights, donors showed more interest in Israel and anti-Semitism.<ref>[http://forward.com/articles/14905/ajcongress-crippled-by-madoff-scandal-/ \"AJCongress Crippled by Madoff Scandal\"] ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 8 January 2009</ref>\n\nWhile the AJCongress had a long history of fighting aid to religious schools, the effort proved to be in conflict with Orthodox Jewish communities that were very successful in attracting government funds for students. An investigation by ''[[The Forward|The Jewish Daily Forward]]'' showed that each year, tens of millions of dollars in federal [[Pell Grant]]s go to [[yeshiva]]s, which typically focus on [[Talmud]] study rather than secular subjects. For 2010, 63 of the 152 religious institutions that received Pell Grants were Jewish, the data shows. The Jewish schools received 53% of the $84.5 million in Pell Grant money that went to religious schools in 2010. Of the top 10 Pell Grant recipients in dollar terms in 2010, six were yeshivas.<ref>[http://forward.com/articles/164946/yeshivas-score-huge-pell-grant-windfall/?p=all \"Yeshivas Score Huge Pell Grant Windfall Jewish Religious Colleges Get Tens of Millions in Federal Aid\"] ''The Jewish Daily Forward'', 31 October 2012</ref>\n\n===2010\u2013present===\nIn 2012, the AJCongress spent 16.5% of its expenses on programs and services it delivered.

Today, the American Jewish Congress primarily focuses on the following challenges: strengthening the bond between the [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Israel]]; combating domestic and global [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]; combating the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement]]; preventing a nuclear [[Iran]]; and promoting cooperation and trade between Israel and countries around the world.\n\nAmong its major programs are the International Mayors Conference, where the organization brings over 30 mayors from around the world to promote [[Israel]] back in their cities. Past participants include [[Mayor of New York City]] [[Bill de Blasio]], [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]], [[Premier of the Republic of China|Premier of Taiwan]] [[William Lai]], and former [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Matteo Renzi]].\n\nMoreover, the organization successfully fights the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions|BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) Movement]]<ref>[https://www.pressreader.com/israel/jerusalem-post/20180422/281655370674286]</ref> and believes that BDS is not a purely anti-Israel issue, but a human right issue. Moreover, in order to make decision makers more accessible to the [[American Jews|Jewish community]], the organization created the 500 Club and executive briefing meetings and conference calls with the decision makers and members of the Jewish community.<ref>[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-friedman-restructuring-gaza-without-pa-tremendous-prize-for-hamas-1.6431064]</ref>\n\nThe American Jewish Congress meets regularly with global leaders<ref>https://medium.com/@munrkazmir/guatemalan-president-jimmy-morales-is-a-great-friend-to-western-democracy-921e9cdb003c</ref> in order to promote the U.S.\u2013Israel alliance.

The Women's Division, founded 1933, carried on these activities for approximately fifty years before it was discontinued as a separate section; the organization subsequently continued its support for women's rights and [[Feminism|feminist]] perspectives under the auspices of the Commission for Women's Equality (CWE), which was established in 1984.<ref>Svonkin, Stuart. \"[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/american-jewish-congress American Jewish Congress].\" ''Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia''. 1 March 2009.

The 1996 conference, \"Understanding the Genetics of Breast Cancer: Implications for Treatment, Policy and Advocacy,\" organized by national CWE, has been duplicated by AJCongress regions nationwide. In 2000, CWE presented Cancer Genetics in the Ashkenazi Community, to explore medical breakthroughs since the first conference as well as new developments in genetic testing. This follow-up conference was distinctly more upbeat than its predecessor, both in terms of medical preventive measures and in regard to legislation to ensure privacy and eliminate discrimination based on testing.\n\nIn 1988, AJCongress hosted \"The First International Jewish Feminist Conference: The Empowerment of Women\" in Israel to address women's rights.  More than 600 Jewish women from around the world attended, including former Congresswoman [[Bella Abzug]] and [[Betty Friedan]]. Some of the attendees visited the Kotel, Torah in hand and found that they were not allowed to pray in their fashion because of Orthodox restrictions on women wearing religious items, singing or reading Torah. A movement began, now known around the world as [[Women of the Wall]], headed by [[Anat Hoffman]]. Polls show that in Israel \"64 percent of the secular public, 53 percent of the traditional non-religious public, and 26 percent of the traditional-religious public support the group, [[Women of the Wall]], and their quest to pray at the [[Western Wall|Kotel]] in their fashion.
