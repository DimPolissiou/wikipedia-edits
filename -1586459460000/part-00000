At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics <ref>Harries, Meirion (1994). Soldiers of the Sun: The Rise and Fall of the Imperial Japanese Army. Random House; Reprint edition.</ref> and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]].

At the age of four, his father was transferred to [[France]], and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in [[Yamaguchi (city)|Yamaguchi]]. Due to his family's close connections with former [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]], he was officially registered as a resident of [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]] around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Imperial Guard (Japan)|Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion]].\n\nAfter the war, Terauchi returned to the [[Army War College (Japan)|Army Staff College]] and graduated from the 21st class in 1909<ref>Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II</ref>. In July 1912, he was sent as a [[military attach\u00e9]] to [[Austria-Hungary]] and in July 1914 to [[Germany]]. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]] from September 1918.\n\nIn early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of ''hakushaku'' ([[count]]) under the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to [[colonel]]. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923.\n\n===As general===\nTerauchi was promoted to [[major general]] in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 1st Division]] in March 1926. In September 1926, the [[Sany\u014d Main Line]] train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured.\n\t\nIn August 1927, Terauchi became [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]] of the [[Chosen Army]] in [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]]. He was promoted to [[lieutenant general]] in August 1929 and was assigned command of the [[Hiroshima]]-based [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 5th Division]].  In January 1932, he was transferred to the [[Osaka]]-based [[4th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 4th Division]]. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \"Go-Stop Incident\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men\u2014an off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a [[traffic light]] and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial-level conflict between the [[Home Ministry]] and the Army.<ref name=\"tobe248\">{{Harvnb|Tobe|1998|p=248}}</ref><ref>{{citation|year= 1997|title =Police in Occupation Japan|last =Aldous|first=Christopher|publisher=CRC Press|page=41|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTJs9dWy_5IC&lpg=PP1|accessdate=22 July 2009|isbn=978-0-203-44014-8}}</ref>Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that [[military personnel]] should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law.<ref name=\"tobe248\"/>\n\nIn August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the [[Taiwan Army of Japan]]. He was promoted to full [[general]]  in October 1935.\n\n===Military-political career===\n[[File:1938 terauchi hisaichi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Terauchi (right) with [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Field Marshal]] [[Shunroku Hata]] in [[Xuzhou]], 1938]]\nTerauchi was strongly associated with the ''[[K\u014dd\u00f5ha]]'' faction in military politics{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} and briefly served as interim [[Ministry of the Army|Army Minister]] in March 1936 in the cabinet of [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] [[Koki Hirota]]. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit ''[[seppuku]]'' if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit ''seppuku'' himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the [[Japanese Diet]].\n\n===World War II===\nIn February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the [[Inspectorate General of Military Training]], the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the [[North China Area Army]] in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] in 1938.\n\n[[File:Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore 1942.png|thumb|Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942]]\n\nIn November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral [[Yamamoto Isoroku]] for the [[Pacific War]].<ref>Fuller, ''Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai''</ref> After leading the conquest of [[Southeast Asia]], Terauchi established his headquarters in [[Singapore]]. he received the  [[Order of the Golden Kite]], 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to ''[[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Army)|Gensui]]'' ([[Field Marshal]]) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the [[Philippines]] in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to [[Saigon]] in [[French Indochina]]. Soon after receiving word of the loss of [[Burma]] by Japan, he suffered a [[stroke]] on 10 May 1945. \n\nAs the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|General Mountbatten]] to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to [[Yangon International Airport|RAF Mingaladon Airfield]] to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]]. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon.  On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at [[Renggam]], [[Johor Bahru]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]]  while being transferred to a [[prisoner of war]] camp and died.<ref>Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia</ref> He was buried at the [[Japanese Cemetery Park|Japanese cemetery]] in Singapore.\n\nThe 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom ''[[wakizashi]]'' short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at [[Windsor Castle]]. It was almost the subject of a [[diplomatic incident]] in the mid-1980s, when [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for [[Crown Prince]] [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan|Naruhito]] of Japan.
