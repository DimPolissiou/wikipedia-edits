[[Ty Burrell]], [[Michael Kelly (actor)|Michael Kelly]], [[Kevin Zegers]], and [[Lindy Booth]] play supporting roles; the original's cast members [[Ken Foree]], [[Scott Reiniger]], and [[Tom Savini]] appear in cameos. The film was released by Universal Pictures on March 19, 2004, and grossed $102 million worldwide against a budget of $26 million.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Please see [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding any material. The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter finishing a long shift as a nurse at the [[Froedtert Hospital|Milwaukee County Hospital]], Ana returns to her [[suburban]] neighborhood and her husband Louis. Caught up in a date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, a girl from the neighborhood enters and kills Louis, who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking, she joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombie security guard, who scratches Luda. Three guards \u2014 C.J., Bart, and Terry \u2014 make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot.\n\nThe next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. They include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Luda keeps her scratch a secret from the group, though Andre knows. Frank, who has been bitten, elects to be isolated. When he reanimates, Kenneth shoots him.\n\nKenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, a few of the survivors go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator and find a friendly dog who is adopted by Nicole and named Chips. Zombies kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda \u2014 tied up by Andre \u2014 gives birth and dies. She reanimates and Norma kills Luda. This makes Andre snap; he exchanges gunfire with Norma and the two kill each other. The others find a zombie baby, which they kill reluctantly. The group decides to fight their way to the marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on [[Lake Michigan]]. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the garage for it; welding on a snowplow, attaching metal bars and chains as well as stocking chainsaws, propane tanks and road flares.\n\nTo rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows and bites Andy. Pursuing Chips, Nicole crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. A group of them reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door because Steve temporarily abandoned his guard duty. Zombies storm the mall, forcing an evacuation via the buses.\n\nWhile navigating the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica. In the chaos, their bus crashes. Steve tries to flee on his own but is ambushed by a zombie. Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J. sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht. Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows the group runs out of supplies, arrives at an island and is attacked by a swarm of zombies. The camcorder drops leaving their fate unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Ana\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Kenneth\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Michael\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Andre\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Steve\n* [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as C.J.\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Terry\n* [[Michael Barry (actor)|Michael Barry]] as Bart\n* [[Lindy Booth]] as Nicole\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Norma\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Tucker\n* [[Inna Korobkina]] as Luda\n* [[R.

He and Abraham secured the rights to the film after it was handed over by [[Richard P. Rubinstein]], the original's producer.<ref name=\"production\"/> Rubinstein stated that he finally agreed to grant the rights after several years because he was worried \"that somewhere along the way a studio would sanitize Newman's vision for producing a version with 'attitude'\", as Romero's film was independently produced. In addition, the producer was impressed by Abraham's \"long track record in keeping the creative integrity of the studio distributed films he has produced intact\".<ref name=\"production\"/>\n\nNewman and Abraham said that the new ''Dawn of the Dead'' is more of a \"re-envisioning\" of Romero's film which is geared toward younger audiences who had not seen the original. Newman stated that the production's goal is \"to make the old fans happy and make a lot of new fans. Because that's the only reason we are doing it.\" He cited his favorite classic horror films ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1978), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), and ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986) as cinematic influences, explaining that these had \"some amazing updates\" which \"add to rather than diminish the original films\".<ref name=\"production\"/> In search of a screenwriter, Rubinstein hired [[James Gunn]], an avid fan of the original, who began writing a draft. [[Michael Tolkin]] and [[Scott Frank]] were brought in for rewriting after Gunn left the project to concentrate on ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004). Rubinstein stated that Tolkin further developed the characters while Frank provided some of the bigger, upbeat action scenes.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Dawn of the Dead: Ultimate Edition (Disc 2: Extended Version) |type=audio commentary |people=[[Richard P.

In the remake, the zombies are fast and agile. Many admirers of the original, as well as Romero himself, protested this change, feeling that it limited the impact of the undead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |title=John Leguizamo on Land of the Dead |work=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029040534/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}</ref> This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the remake has almost no close-up shots of zombies that last more than a second or two. Snyder mentions this in the commentary track of the remake's DVD, pointing out that they seem too human when the camera lingers upon them for longer. However, it was for this change that ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine ranked the zombies #5 on its \"100 Greatest Villains Ever\" list.\n\nThe original had a smaller cast than the remake, allowing more screen time for each character. Many fans and critics criticized the resulting loss of character development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |title=Dawn of the Dead |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123512/http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nIn the original version, the story unfolds over several months, indicated by the advancing stages of Fran's pregnancy. In the remake, the events transpire within approximately one month, as evidenced by the supplemental feature ''The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed'', located on the DVD in the special features section. Another big change from the original is that unlike Romero, Snyder treats zombification more like a disease, pointing to the bites as the source, instead of anyone who is dead turning into a zombie.\n\nThree actors from the original film have cameos in the remake, appearing on the televisions the survivors watch: [[Ken Foree]], who played Peter from the original, plays an evangelist who asserts that God is punishing mankind; [[Scott H. Reiniger]], who played Roger in the original, plays an army general telling everyone to stay at home for safety; and [[Tom Savini]], who did the special effects for many of Romero's films and played the motorcycle gang member Blades in the original ''Dawn of the Dead'', plays the Monroeville Sheriff explaining the only way to kill the zombies is to \"shoot 'em in the head\". Monroeville is also the location of the mall used in the 1978 film. In addition, a store shown in the mall is called \"Gaylen Ross\", an obvious tribute to actress [[Gaylen Ross]], who played Francine in the original film. In the beginning of the film, a helicopter that is very similar to the one in the original flies across the screen.\n\nIn ''The Zombie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said that the original film \"served as a bridge between the talky, slow-paced 1970s horror and the fast-paced splatter to come in the 1980s\", whereas the 2004 remake \"generally forsakes slow-mounting suspense in favor of frenetic action\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000\u20132010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=49\u201351|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>\n\n==Planned sequel==\nA [[sequel]] titled ''[[Army of the Dead]]'' was planned but was later cancelled.<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/dawn-of-the-dead-sequel-army-of-the-dead-will-not-renimate Dawn of the Dead sequel Army of the Dead will not reanimate]</ref> [[Zack Snyder]] stated that he would only be producing the sequel instead of reprising his role as the director due to working on ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' when he announced the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |title=Zack Snyder NOT directing \"Army of the Dead\" |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |work=bloodydisgusting.com |date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603222919/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> The script of ''Army of the Dead'' was written by Zack Snyder and [[Joby Harold]].

The plot summary should be between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter finishing a long shift as a nurse at the [[Froedtert Hospital|Milwaukee County Hospital]], Ana returns to her [[suburban]] neighborhood and her husband Louis. Caught up in a date night, they miss an emergency news bulletin. The next morning, a girl from the neighborhood enters and kills Louis, who immediately reanimates as a zombie and attacks Ana. She flees in her car, crashes, and passes out. Upon waking, she joins police sergeant Kenneth Hall, electronics salesman Michael, petty criminal Andre and his pregnant wife, Luda. They break into a nearby mall and are attacked by a zombie security guard, who scratches Luda. Three guards \u2014 C.J., Bart, and Terry \u2014 make them surrender their weapons in exchange for refuge. They split into groups to secure the mall. On the roof, they see another survivor, Andy, who is stranded in his gun store across the zombie-infested parking lot.\n\nThe next day, a delivery truck carrying more survivors enters the lot, pursued by zombies. They include Norma, Steve, Tucker, Monica, Glen, Frank and his daughter, Nicole. Another woman is too ill to walk; she is wheeled inside, only to die and reanimate. After she is killed, the group determines the disease is passed by bites. Luda keeps her scratch a secret from the group, though Andre knows. Frank, who has been bitten, elects to be isolated. When he reanimates, Kenneth shoots him.\n\nKenneth and Andy start a friendship by way of messages written on a whiteboard; romance buds between Ana and Michael, and Nicole and Terry. When the power goes out, a few of the survivors go to the parking garage to activate the emergency generator and find a friendly dog who is adopted by Nicole and named Chips. Zombies kill Bart, forcing the others to douse the zombies in gas and set them ablaze. Meanwhile, Luda \u2014 tied up by Andre \u2014 gives birth and dies. She reanimates and Norma kills Luda. This makes Andre snap; he exchanges gunfire with Norma and the two kill each other. The others find a zombie baby, which they kill reluctantly. The group decides to fight their way to the marina and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on [[Lake Michigan]]. They reinforce two shuttle buses from the garage for it; welding on a snowplow, attaching metal bars and chains as well as stocking chainsaws, propane tanks and road flares.\n\nTo rescue Andy, the group straps supplies onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips enters Andy's store safely, but a zombie follows and bites Andy. Pursuing Chips, Nicole crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. A group of them reach the gun store via the sewers, kill Andy, and rescue Nicole. They grab ammunition and go back to the mall; along the way, Tucker breaks his legs, and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door because Steve temporarily abandoned his guard duty. Zombies storm the mall, forcing an evacuation via the buses.\n\nWhile navigating the city, Glen loses control of a chainsaw, accidentally killing himself and Monica. In the chaos, their bus crashes. Steve tries to flee on his own but is ambushed by a zombie. Ana kills the zombified Steve and retrieves his boat keys. At the marina, C.J. sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Michael, after revealing a bite wound, kills himself as Ana, Kenneth, Nicole, Terry, and Chips flee on the yacht. Footage from a camcorder found on the boat shows the group runs out of supplies, arrives at an island and is attacked by a swarm of zombies. The camcorder drops leaving their fate unknown.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Cast, order and roles per closing credits -->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Sarah Polley]] as Ana\n* [[Ving Rhames]] as Kenneth\n* [[Jake Weber]] as Michael\n* [[Mekhi Phifer]] as Andre\n* [[Ty Burrell]] as Steve\n* [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]] as C.J.\n* [[Kevin Zegers]] as Terry\n* [[Michael Barry (actor)|Michael Barry]] as Bart\n* [[Lindy Booth]] as Nicole\n* [[Jayne Eastwood]] as Norma\n* [[Boyd Banks]] as Tucker\n* [[Inna Korobkina]] as Luda\n* [[R.

He and Abraham secured the rights to the film after it was handed over by [[Richard P. Rubinstein]], the original's producer.<ref name=\"production\"/> Rubinstein stated that he finally agreed to grant the rights after several years because he was worried \"that somewhere along the way a studio would sanitize Newman's vision for producing a version with 'attitude'\", as Romero's film was independently produced. In addition, the producer was impressed by Abraham's \"long track record in keeping the creative integrity of the studio distributed films he has produced intact\".<ref name=\"production\"/>\n\nNewman and Abraham said that the new ''Dawn of the Dead'' is more of a \"re-envisioning\" of Romero's film which is geared toward younger audiences who had not seen the original. Newman stated that the production's goal is \"to make the old fans happy and make a lot of new fans. Because that's the only reason we are doing it.\" He cited his favorite classic horror films ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978 film)|Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' (1978), ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' (1982), and ''[[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]]'' (1986) as cinematic influences, explaining that these had \"some amazing updates\" which \"add to rather than diminish the original films\".<ref name=\"production\"/> In search of a screenwriter, Rubinstein hired [[James Gunn]], an avid fan of the original, who began writing a draft. [[Michael Tolkin]] and [[Scott Frank]] were brought in for rewriting after Gunn left the project to concentrate on ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]'' (2004). Rubinstein stated that Tolkin further developed the characters while Frank provided some of the bigger, upbeat action scenes.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Dawn of the Dead: Ultimate Edition (Disc 2: Extended Version) |type=audio commentary |people=[[Richard P.

In the remake, the zombies are fast and agile. Many admirers of the original, as well as Romero himself, protested this change, feeling that it limited the impact of the undead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |title=John Leguizamo on Land of the Dead |work=ComingSoon.net |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029040534/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=7973 |archivedate=October 29, 2008}}</ref> This is somewhat borne out by the fact that the remake has almost no close-up shots of zombies that last more than a second or two. Snyder mentions this in the commentary track of the remake's DVD, pointing out that they seem too human when the camera lingers upon them for longer. However, it was for this change that ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine ranked the zombies #5 on its \"100 Greatest Villains Ever\" list.\n\nThe original had a smaller cast than the remake, allowing more screen time for each character. Many fans and critics criticized the resulting loss of character development.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |title=Dawn of the Dead |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123512/http://www.pajiba.com/dawn-of-the-dead.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nIn the original version, the story unfolds over several months, indicated by the advancing stages of Fran's pregnancy. In the remake, the events transpire within approximately one month, as evidenced by the supplemental feature ''The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed'', located on the DVD in the special features section. Another big change from the original is that unlike Romero, Snyder treats zombification more like a disease, pointing to the bites as the source, instead of anyone who is dead turning into a zombie.\n\nThree actors from the original film have cameos in the remake, appearing on the televisions the survivors watch: [[Ken Foree]], who played Peter from the original, plays an evangelist who asserts that God is punishing mankind; [[Scott H. Reiniger]], who played Roger in the original, plays an army general telling everyone to stay at home for safety; and [[Tom Savini]], who did the special effects for many of Romero's films and played the motorcycle gang member Blades in the original ''Dawn of the Dead'', plays the Monroeville Sheriff explaining the only way to kill the zombies is to \"shoot 'em in the head\". Monroeville is also the location of the mall used in the 1978 film. In addition, a store shown in the mall is called \"Gaylen Ross\", an obvious tribute to actress [[Gaylen Ross]], who played Francine in the original film. In the beginning of the film, a helicopter that is very similar to the one in the original flies across the screen.\n\nIn ''The Zombie Encyclopedia, Volume 2'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said that the original film \"served as a bridge between the talky, slow-paced 1970s horror and the fast-paced splatter to come in the 1980s\", whereas the 2004 remake \"generally forsakes slow-mounting suspense in favor of frenetic action\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia, Volume 2: 2000\u20132010|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|year=2012|pages=49\u201351|isbn=978-0-7864-6163-9}}</ref>\n\n==Planned sequel==\nA [[sequel]] titled ''[[Army of the Dead]]'' was planned but was later cancelled.<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/dawn-of-the-dead-sequel-army-of-the-dead-will-not-renimate Dawn of the Dead sequel Army of the Dead will not reanimate]</ref> [[Zack Snyder]] stated that he would only be producing the sequel instead of reprising his role as the director due to working on ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' when he announced the film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |title=Zack Snyder NOT directing \"Army of the Dead\" |accessdate=June 29, 2011 |work=bloodydisgusting.com |date=June 5, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603222919/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/12494 |archivedate=June 3, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> The script of ''Army of the Dead'' was written by Zack Snyder and [[Joby Harold]].

Various share capital fundraising programmes were undertaken and, together with great assistance from the various statutory bodies over the years, the airport has developed from a runway of 1,090 metres x 23 metres commissioned in 1969, to a runway of 1,239m x 30m commissioned in 1989, and a new runway of 2,000m x 45m opened in May 1994.\n\nThe first aircraft to land at Kerry Airport, on 25 August 1969, was piloted by Captain Milo Carr of the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport and Power]]. For a number of years the only aircraft using the aerodrome were [[General aviation|light private aircraft]] and the occasional [[Air charter|charter]] or [[Air cargo|cargo]] flight; extensive [[parachuting]] also took place. The first scheduled service was inaugurated in July 1979, using an [[Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander|Islander]] aircraft operated by [[Aer Arann]].<ref name=AirportHistory>{{cite web|title=History - Kerry Airport|url=http://kerryairport.ie/website/about/index-3/|website=kerryairport.ie|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nEncouraged by the apparent success of other regional airports in Ireland, the board of directors drew up a development plan to lengthen and widen the runway to 1,200m x 30m and to extend and upgrade the terminal buildings and to install an [[Instrument Landing System]] and appropriate lighting.<ref name=AirportHistory/>\n\nThe runway was completed on schedule; the first scheduled flight into Kerry was on 22 May 1989 from [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]] by Aer Lingus, followed the next day by [[Ryanair]] from [[London-Luton]].

Various share capital fundraising programmes were undertaken and, together with great assistance from the various statutory bodies over the years, the airport has developed from a runway of 1,090 metres x 23 metres commissioned in 1969, to a runway of 1,239m x 30m commissioned in 1989, and a new runway of 2,000m x 45m opened in May 1994.\n\nThe first aircraft to land at Kerry Airport, on 25 August 1969, was piloted by Captain Milo Carr of the [[Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport|Department of Transport and Power]]. For a number of years the only aircraft using the aerodrome were [[General aviation|light private aircraft]] and the occasional [[Air charter|charter]] or [[Air cargo|cargo]] flight; extensive [[parachuting]] also took place. The first scheduled service was inaugurated in July 1979, using an [[Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander|Islander]] aircraft operated by [[Aer Arann]].<ref name=AirportHistory>{{cite web|title=History - Kerry Airport|url=http://kerryairport.ie/website/about/index-3/|website=kerryairport.ie|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nEncouraged by the apparent success of other regional airports in Ireland, the board of directors drew up a development plan to lengthen and widen the runway to 1,200m x 30m and to extend and upgrade the terminal buildings and to install an [[Instrument Landing System]] and appropriate lighting.<ref name=AirportHistory/>\n\nThe runway was completed on schedule; the first scheduled flight into Kerry was on 22 May 1989 from [[Dublin Airport|Dublin]] by Aer Lingus, followed the next day by [[Ryanair]] from [[London-Luton]]. The contract for the new runway of 2,000m x 45m and the new terminal was signed in May 1993, and the official [[groundbreaking|sod-turning ceremony]] was performed by [[Dick Spring]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], the [[T\u00e1naiste]].<ref name=AirportHistory/>\n\nThe Runway 08/26 was licensed by the [[Irish Aviation Authority]] on 20 May 1994, and the first flight landed at 13:23 local time on 20 May. It was a [[Piper PA-28 Cherokee|PA28]] aircraft registration G-BLSD from [[Manchester]], piloted by C. Gurley. This was followed by the first commercial flight by Aer Lingus, a [[Saab 340]]. Its registration was EI-CFD and it was commanded by Captain Peter Heinz.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.kerryairport.com/about.html |title=About Kerry Airport |publisher=Kerry Airport |year=2014 |accessdate=10 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713144406/http://www.kerryairport.com/about.html |archivedate=13 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe airport is a public limited company, but is not quoted on any stock exchange.
