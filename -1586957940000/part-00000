During the Gupta times, either [[Kumaragupta]] or [[Skandagupta]] made it their capital, after which it came to be called Ayodhya. [[Kalidasa]] wrote [[Raghuvamsa]] here, and referred to ''Gopratara tirtha'' (Guptar Ghat), where Rama was believed to have entered the waters of [[Saryu]] in his ascent to heaven. According to a local tradition recorded by Francis Buchanan and [[Alexander Cunningham]], Ayodhya became desolate after Rama's ascent to heaven and \"Vikramaditya\" revived it. (In ''Raghuvamsa'', Rama's son ''Kusa'' revived it.) [[Prabhavatigupta]], the daughter of [[Chandragupta II]], was a Rama devotee. Her son, [[Pravarasena II]] wrote ''Sethubandha'', in which Rama is regarded as identical to Vishnu. He also built a temple to Rama at Pravarapura (Paunar near [[Ramtek]]) in about 450 AD.{{sfnp|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=3\u20135,&nbsp;94\u201395}}\n\n=== Gahadavala period ===\n{{see also|Hari-Vishnu inscription}}\nAfter the Guptas, the capital of North India moved to [[Kannauj]] and Ayodhya fell into relative neglect. It was revived by the [[Gahadavala]]s, coming to power in the 11th century AD. The Gahadavalas were [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]].

In particular, multiple versions of ''Ayodhya Mahatmya'' (magical powers of Ayodhya) prescribed the celebration of ''Ram Navami'' (the birthday of Rama).{{sfnp|Bakker, The rise of Ayodhya as a place of pilgrimage|1982}}\n\n=== Mughal period ===\n\nIn modern times, a mosque was located at the supposed birth spot of Rama, which sat on a large mound in the centre of Ayodhya, called the ''Ramadurg'' or ''Ramkot'' (the fort of Rama).

[[Ram Nath|R.&nbsp;Nath]], who has examined these records, concludes that Jai Singh had acquired the land of ''Rama Janmasthan'' in 1717. The ownership of the land was vested in the deity. The hereditary title of the ownership was recognized and enforced by the Mughal State from 1717. He also found a letter from a ''gumastha'' Trilokchand, dated 1723, stating that, while under the Muslim administration people had been prevented from taking a ritual bath in the Saryu river, the establishment of the ''Jaisinghpura'' has removed all impediments.{{sfnp|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nThe Jesuit priest [[Joseph Tieffenthaler]], who visited Awadh in 1766\u20131771, wrote, \"Emperor Aurangzebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place.

The Babri mosque was attacked by Hindus in the process. Since then, local Hindu groups made occasional demands that they should have the possession of the site and that they should be allowed to build a temple on the site, all of which were denied by the colonial government. In 1946, an offshoot of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] called  ''Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha'' (ABRM) started an agitation for the possession of the site. In 1949, Sant [[Digvijay Nath]] of [[Gorakhnath Math]] joined the ABRM and organised a 9-day continuous recitation of [[Ramcharit Manas]], at the end of which the Hindu activists broke into the mosque and placed idols of Rama and Sita inside. People were led to believe that the idols had 'miraculously' appeared inside the mosque. The date of the event was 22 December 1949.<ref>{{harvp|Bacchetta, Sacred Space in Conflict|2000}}; {{harvp|Jha & Jha, Ayodhya: The Dark Night|2012}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC Timeline\"/>\n\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] insisted that the idols should be removed. However, the local official [[K. K. K. Nair]], known for his Hindu nationalist connections, refused to carry out orders, claiming that it would lead to communal riots. The police locked the gates so that the public (Hindus as well as Muslims) could not enter.  However, the idols remained inside and priests were allowed entry to perform daily worship. So, the mosque had been converted into a ''de facto'' temple. Both the Sunni Wakf Board and the ABRM filed civil suits in a local court staking their respective claims to the site. The land was declared to be under dispute, and the gates remained locked.{{sfnp|van der Veer, Ayodhya and Somnath|1992|pp=98\u201399}}\n\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] has called the [[Gorakhnath Math|Gorakhnath]] wing of Hindu nationalism 'the other saffron', which has maintained its existence separately from the mainstream Hindu nationalism of the [[Sangh Parivar]].

The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), formed in 1980 from the remnants of the [[Jana Sangh]], became the political face of the campaign. In 1986, a district judge ruled that the gates would be reopened and Hindus permitted to worship inside, providing a major boost to the movement.<ref name=\"BBC Timeline\"/> In September 1990, BJP leader [[L.

In spite of this, a large number of '[[Kar Sevak|kar sevaks]]' or Sangh Parivar activists reached Ayodhya and tried to attack the mosque. They were stopped by the [[Uttar Pradesh]] police and the paramilitary forces, resulting in a pitched battle in which several ''kar sevaks'' were killed. Accusing the central government led by [[V.

[[Kalidasa]] wrote [[Raghuvamsa]] here, and referred to ''Gopratara tirtha'' (Guptar Ghat), where Rama was believed to have entered the waters of [[Saryu]] in his ascent to heaven. According to a local tradition recorded by Francis Buchanan and [[Alexander Cunningham]], Ayodhya became desolate after Rama's ascent to heaven and \"Vikramaditya\" revived it. (In ''Raghuvamsa'', Rama's son ''Kusa'' revived it.) [[Prabhavatigupta]], the daughter of [[Chandragupta II]], was a Rama devotee. Her son, [[Pravarasena II]] wrote ''Sethubandha'', in which Rama is regarded as identical to Vishnu. He also built a temple to Rama at Pravarapura (Paunar near [[Ramtek]]) in about 450 AD.{{sfnp|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=3\u20135,&nbsp;94\u201395}}\n\n=== Gahadavala period ===\n{{see also|Hari-Vishnu inscription}}\nAfter the Guptas, the capital of North India moved to [[Kannauj]] and Ayodhya fell into relative neglect. It was revived by the [[Gahadavala]]s, coming to power in the 11th century AD. The Gahadavalas were [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnavas]].

[[Ram Nath|R.&nbsp;Nath]], who has examined these records, concludes that Jai Singh had acquired the land of ''Rama Janmasthan'' in 1717. The ownership of the land was vested in the deity. The hereditary title of the ownership was recognized and enforced by the Mughal State from 1717. He also found a letter from a ''gumastha'' Trilokchand, dated 1723, stating that, while under the Muslim administration people had been prevented from taking a ritual bath in the Saryu river, the establishment of the ''Jaisinghpura'' has removed all impediments.{{sfnp|Jain, Rama and Ayodhya|2013|pp=112\u2013114}}\n\nThe Jesuit priest [[Joseph Tieffenthaler]], who visited Awadh in 1766\u20131771, wrote, \"Emperor Aurangzebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place.

The Babri mosque was attacked by Hindus in the process. Since then, local Hindu groups made occasional demands that they should have the possession of the site and that they should be allowed to build a temple on the site, all of which were denied by the colonial government. In 1946, an offshoot of the [[Hindu Mahasabha]] called  ''Akhil Bharatiya Ramayana Mahasabha'' (ABRM) started an agitation for the possession of the site. In 1949, Sant [[Digvijay Nath]] of [[Gorakhnath Math]] joined the ABRM and organised a 9-day continuous recitation of [[Ramcharit Manas]], at the end of which the Hindu activists broke into the mosque and placed idols of Rama and Sita inside. People were led to believe that the idols had 'miraculously' appeared inside the mosque. The date of the event was 22 December 1949.<ref>{{harvp|Bacchetta, Sacred Space in Conflict|2000}}; {{harvp|Jha & Jha, Ayodhya: The Dark Night|2012}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC Timeline\"/>\n\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]] insisted that the idols should be removed. However, the local official [[K. K. K. Nair]], known for his Hindu nationalist connections, refused to carry out orders, claiming that it would lead to communal riots. The police locked the gates so that the public (Hindus as well as Muslims) could not enter.  However, the idols remained inside and priests were allowed entry to perform daily worship. So, the mosque had been converted into a ''de facto'' temple. Both the Sunni Wakf Board and the ABRM filed civil suits in a local court staking their respective claims to the site. The land was declared to be under dispute, and the gates remained locked.{{sfnp|van der Veer, Ayodhya and Somnath|1992|pp=98\u201399}}\n\n[[Christophe Jaffrelot]] has called the [[Gorakhnath Math|Gorakhnath]] wing of Hindu nationalism 'the other saffron', which has maintained its existence separately from the mainstream Hindu nationalism of the [[Sangh Parivar]].

The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), formed in 1980 from the remnants of the [[Jana Sangh]], became the political face of the campaign. In 1986, a district judge ruled that the gates would be reopened and Hindus permitted to worship inside, providing a major boost to the movement.<ref name=\"BBC Timeline\"/> In September 1990, BJP leader [[L. K. Advani]] began a \"''[[Ram Rath Yatra|rath yatra]]''\" (pilgrimage procession) to Ayodhya in order to generate support for the movement. Advani later stated in his memoirs, \"If Muslims are entitled to an Islamic atmosphere in [[Mecca]], and if Christians are entitled to a Christian atmosphere in the [[Holy See|Vatican]], why is it wrong for the Hindus to expect a Hindu atmosphere in Ayodhya?\" The yatra resulted in communal riots in many cities in its wake, prompting the government of [[Bihar]] to arrest Advani. In spite of this, a large number of '[[Kar Sevak|kar sevaks]]' or Sangh Parivar activists reached Ayodhya and tried to attack the mosque. They were stopped by the [[Uttar Pradesh]] police and the paramilitary forces, resulting in a pitched battle in which several ''kar sevaks'' were killed. Accusing the central government led by [[V.
