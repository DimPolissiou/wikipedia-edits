It also features [[Leila Arcieri]] as Jordan King from the first film and John G. Connolly as [[Lieutenant colonel (Australia)|Lt. Colonel]] Alabama \"Bama\" Cobb, one of the villains from ''xXx: State of the Union'' who is Deckert's right-hand man, as the man behind the attack on Xander.\n\nThe sequence opens with Xander driving in a car with Jordan King. He stops next to his apartment building. King makes sexual overtures to him and they get intimate. Suddenly they hear a noise and Xander goes to check it out. Cobb's men show up and abduct King. They plant a bomb in the building and drop her coat on the steps to trick Xander to his death. After confronting a homeless man, Xander returns to the building. He takes the bait left by Cobb and his henchmen and is apparently blown apart by a huge explosion. His trademark coat survives the blast. Cobb shows up and picks up a piece of burnt skin from Xander's neck which has the triple x tattoo on it. He remarks \"Poor Xander, you never had very much between the ears.\" His men pick him up and drive off in their car. Cobb's motives for killing Xander are obvious; he doesn't want him to interfere in Deckert's plans. [[Feuer Frei]] by [[Rammstein]] plays in the background during the sequence.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n===Cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:88%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Films\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | Short film\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:9%;\" | ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[XXX: State of the Union|XXX:<br>State of the Union]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:11%;\" | ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage|XXX:<br>Return of Xander Cage]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:11%;\" | ''XXX 4''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:17%;\" | ''The Final Chapter:<br>The Death of Xander Cage''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Xander Cage<br>{{small|xXx}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Vin Diesel]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Vin Diesel\n| Khristian Lupo\n|-\n| {{N/A|Vin Diesel}}<br>{{small|(''archive recordings'')}}\n|-\n!

It also features [[Leila Arcieri]] as Jordan King from the first film and John G. Connolly as [[Lieutenant colonel (Australia)|Lt. Colonel]] Alabama \"Bama\" Cobb, one of the villains from ''xXx: State of the Union'' who is Deckert's right-hand man, as the man behind the attack on Xander.\n\nThe sequence opens with Xander driving in a car with Jordan King. He stops next to his apartment building. King makes sexual overtures to him and they get intimate. Suddenly they hear a noise and Xander goes to check it out. Cobb's men show up and abduct King. They plant a bomb in the building and drop her coat on the steps to trick Xander to his death. After confronting a homeless man, Xander returns to the building. He takes the bait left by Cobb and his henchmen and is apparently blown apart by a huge explosion. His trademark coat survives the blast. Cobb shows up and picks up a piece of burnt skin from Xander's neck which has the triple x tattoo on it. He remarks \"Poor Xander, you never had very much between the ears.\" His men pick him up and drive off in their car. Cobb's motives for killing Xander are obvious; he doesn't want him to interfere in Deckert's plans. [[Feuer Frei]] by [[Rammstein]] plays in the background during the sequence.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n===Cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:88%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Films\n! style=\"text-align:center;\" | Short film\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:9%;\" | ''[[XXX (2002 film)|XXX]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:10%;\" | ''[[XXX: State of the Union|XXX:<br>State of the Union]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:11%;\" | ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage|XXX:<br>Return of Xander Cage]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:11%;\" | ''XXX 4''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:17%;\" | ''The Final Chapter:<br>The Death of Xander Cage''\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Xander Cage<br>{{small|xXx}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | [[Vin Diesel]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\" |\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Vin Diesel\n| Khristian Lupo\n|-\n| {{N/A|Vin Diesel}}<br>{{small|(''archive recordings'')}}\n|-\n!

The line is under the administrative jurisdiction of [[Central Railway (India)|Central Railway]], [[Gondia-Arjuni-Nagbhir-Balharshah Line]].\n{{Narkhed-Amravati Railway|collapse=y}}\n\n==History==\n<ref>http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/how-different-things-work/1/18367.html</ref>\nNarkhed and Amravati towns in Maharashtra's orange belt have waited for more than 80 years to be linked by rail. The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84&nbsp;billion approved.\n\nThe then-Prime Minister [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] laid the foundation stone. But protests by the [[Shiv Sena]], which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years.\n\nIn September 2008, when President [[Pratibha Patil]] inaugurated the [[New Amravati railway station]], it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010.\n\nBut in January 2011, after doing protest by Krupal who is one of the youth leader among region then finally it has been completed the project and opened for the people.\n\n==Railway station==\n\nThis railway route has thirteen railway station excluding [[Narkhed]], [[New Amravati railway station|New Amravati]] and [[Badnera]]. Those are [[Narkhed]], [[Mowad]], Pusla, [[Warud Orange City railway station|Warud Orange City]], Benoda, Pala, [[Hiwarkhed]], [[Morshi]], Astegoan, Kolvihir, [[Chandur Bazar]], Sirla, [[Walgaon]], [[New Amravati railway station|New Amravati]] and [[Badnera]].\n\n==Other aspects==\n\nThe area from which this railway route is passing is agricultural rich belt, famous for orange and cotton growing. The route directly connects many places of tourist interest, including:\n\n* Hanuman Temple of Belona.\n* [[Upper Wardha Dam|Nal-Damyanti Sagar]] Dam [[Morshi]]\n* [[Muktagiri]] Jain Temple\n* [[Chikhaldara]] Hill Station\n* [[Melghat Tiger Reserve]]\n* Amba Devi Temple Amravati\n* Gurukunj Mozari\n\n==Connectivity==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Optional route==\n\nThis route is become very important because it provided the connectivity between two important railway route in India.\n\nThe New Delhi\u2013Chennai [[Delhi\u2013Chennai line|Grand trunk route]] and [[Howrah\u2013Nagpur\u2013Mumbai line]] both have heavy passenger as well as goods train traffic.

The 140-km track was first sanctioned in 1928 under the British, but stayed on the backburner. The project was revived only in 1993/94 and a budget of Rs 2.84&nbsp;billion approved.\n\nThe then-Prime Minister [[P.V. Narasimha Rao]] laid the foundation stone. But protests by the [[Shiv Sena]], which opposed the displacement of people, stalled the project for many more years.\n\nIn September 2008, when President [[Pratibha Patil]] inaugurated the [[New Amravati railway station]], it seemed as if the project would be completed soon. Far from it. In November 2009, the Railway Ministry announced the link would be inaugurated in December 2010.\n\nBut in January 2011, after doing protest by Krupal who is one of the youth leader among region then finally it has been completed the project and opened for the people.\n\n==Railway station==\n\nThis railway route has thirteen railway station excluding [[Narkhed]], [[New Amravati railway station|New Amravati]] and [[Badnera]].

The route directly connects many places of tourist interest, including:\n\n* Hanuman Temple of Belona.\n* [[Upper Wardha Dam|Nal-Damyanti Sagar]] Dam [[Morshi]]\n* [[Muktagiri]] Jain Temple\n* [[Chikhaldara]] Hill Station\n* [[Melghat Tiger Reserve]]\n* Amba Devi Temple Amravati\n* Gurukunj Mozari\n\n==Connectivity==\n\n{{Empty section|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Optional route==\n\nThis route is become very important because it provided the connectivity between two important railway route in India.\n\nThe New Delhi\u2013Chennai [[Delhi\u2013Chennai line|Grand trunk route]] and [[Howrah\u2013Nagpur\u2013Mumbai line]] both have heavy passenger as well as goods train traffic.
