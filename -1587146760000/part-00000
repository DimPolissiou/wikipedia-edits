It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million. See also [[medieval demography]].}}  With its large population base, the dynasty was able to raise professional and conscripted armies of hundreds of thousands of troops to contend with nomadic powers in dominating [[Inner Asia]] and the lucrative trade-routes along the [[Silk Road]].  [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]]. [[Buddhism]] became a major influence in Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|enacted policies to persecute Buddhism]], which subsequently declined in influence. The dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in damaging atrocities such as the [[Guangzhou massacre]] of 878\u2013879.

There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=\u90e8|hp=b\u00f9|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}\n\nAlthough the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}\u20133rd century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}\n\nAlthough the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted.

But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M.

After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily.

''Jintishi'' poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|characters]] per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=102}} Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773\u2013819) and [[Han Yu]] (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the ''piantiwen'' ({{lang|zh|\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587}}, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated ''piantiwen'', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=106}} This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfn|Huters|1987|p=52}}\n\nShort story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wong|1979|p=97}} Timothy C.

In an age before [[Neo-Confucianism]] and figures such as [[Zhu Xi]] (1130\u20131200), Buddhism had begun to flourish in China during the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]], and became the dominant ideology during the prosperous Tang. Buddhist monasteries played an integral role in Chinese society, offering lodging for travelers in remote areas, schools for children throughout the country, and a place for urban literati to stage social events and gatherings such as going-away parties.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=121}} Buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=122}}{{sfn|Eberhard|2005|p=181}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=86}} Although the monasteries retained 'serfs', these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=126}}\n\nThe prominent status of Buddhism in Chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century.

In 845 [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] finally shut down 4,600 Buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 Buddhist monks and nuns to return to [[Secularity (non-religiosity)|secular]] life;{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=96}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=86}} this episode would later be dubbed one of the [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China]].

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist ''[[dharani]]'' [[sutra]] unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670.{{sfn|Pan|1997|pp=979\u2013980}} The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868.{{sfn|Temple|1986|p=112}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=151}} Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=124\u2013125}} With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} Although the later [[Bi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] [[printing]] in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant [[History of typography in East Asia|printing type in China]] until the more advanced [[printing press]] from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=227}} The first use of the [[playing card]] during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Dunhuang star map.jpg|thumb|The [[Dunhuang map]], a [[star map]] showing the North Polar region. c. 700.{{sfn|Xi|1981|p=464}} The whole set of star maps contains over 1,300 stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/astronomy_researchers/index.a4d|title=The Dunhuang Chinese Sky: A comprehensive study of the oldest known star atlas|last1=Bonnet-Bidaud |first1=J.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[Chinese cartography|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]]; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|p=90}}\n\n===Medicine===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=235}} In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}} Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of sugar in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=132\u2013133}} As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=134\u2013135}} The use of the [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgam]], manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text ''Xinxiu Bencao'' written by Su Gong in 659.<ref name=czarnetzki>{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|author2=Ehrhardt S. |title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325\u2013332}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of [[underwater diving|underwater divers]], a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=452}} The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Wood|1999|p=49}}\n\nEver since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport natural gas from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract salt.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=78\u201379}} During the Tang dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}} These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) in diameter and manually powered.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=99, 151, 233}} In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the ''[[Tang Yulin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5510\u8a9e\u6797}}) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=134, 151}} During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=151}}\n\n==Historiography==\n{{See also|Chinese historiography}}\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060).

One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086).

It was preceded by the [[Sui dynasty]] and followed by the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in Chinese history. Historians generally regard the Tang as a high point in Chinese civilization, and a [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden age]] of cosmopolitan culture.{{sfn|Lewis|2012|p= 1}} Tang territory, acquired through the military campaigns of its early rulers, rivaled that of the [[Han dynasty]]. The Tang capital at [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]) was the most populous city in the world in its day.\n\nThe [[House of Li|L\u01d0 family]] ({{Lang-zh|c=\u674e|s=|t=|labels=no}}) founded the dynasty, seizing power during the decline and collapse of the Sui Empire. The dynasty was interrupted for 15 years when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] seized the throne, proclaiming the [[Zhou dynasty (690\u2013705)|Wu Zhou dynasty]] and becoming the only legitimate Chinese [[empress regnant]]. In two censuses of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Tang records estimated the population by number of registered households at about 50 million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p= 91}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp= 111, 141}}  Yet, even when the central government was breaking down and unable to compile an accurate census of the population in the 9th century, it is estimated that the population had grown by then to about 80 million people.{{sfn|Du|1998|p= 37}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p= 106}}{{efn|During the rule of the Tang the world population grew from about 190 million to approximately 240&nbsp;million, a difference of 50&nbsp;million.

[[List of tributaries of Imperial China|Various kingdoms and states paid tribute]] to the Tang court, while the Tang also conquered or subdued several regions which it indirectly controlled through a [[protectorate]] system.  Besides political [[hegemony]], the Tang also exerted a powerful cultural influence over neighboring [[East Asia]]n states such as those in [[History of Japan#Classical Japan|Japan]] and [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Korea]].\n\nThe Tang dynasty was largely a period of progress and stability in the first half of the dynasty's rule, until the devastating [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763) and the decline of central authority in the later half of the dynasty. Like the previous [[Sui dynasty]], the Tang dynasty maintained a civil-service system by recruiting [[scholar-official]]s through [[Imperial examination|standardized examinations]] and recommendations to office.  The rise of regional military governors known as ''[[jiedushi]]'' during the 9th century undermined this civil order.  [[Chinese culture]] flourished and further matured during the Tang era; it is traditionally considered the greatest age for [[Chinese poetry]].{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp= 73\u201387}}  Two of China's most famous poets, [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]], belonged to this age, as did many famous painters such as [[Han Gan]], [[Zhang Xuan]], and [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]].  Scholars of this period compiled a rich variety of [[Chinese historiography|historical literature]], as well as encyclopedias and geographical works. The adoption of the title [[Khan of Heaven]] by the Tang emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] in addition to his title as [[Emperor of China|emperor]] was eastern Asia's first \"simultaneous kingship\".{{sfn|Skaff|2012|p= 127}}\n\nMany notable innovations occurred under the Tang, including the development of [[woodblock printing]]. [[Buddhism]] became a major influence in Chinese culture, with [[Chinese Buddhism|native Chinese sects]] gaining prominence. However, in the 840s the [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution|enacted policies to persecute Buddhism]], which subsequently declined in influence. The dynasty and central government had gone into decline by the latter half of the 9th century; agrarian rebellions resulted in damaging atrocities such as the [[Guangzhou massacre]] of 878\u2013879.

The ''Tangshu'' ([[Old Book of Tang]]) compiled in the year 945 recorded that in 828 the Tang government issued a decree that standardized [[irrigation]]al square-pallet [[chain pump]]s in the country:\n\n<blockquote>In the second year of the Taihe reign period [828], in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of [[Jingzhao Fu]] (d footnote: the capital) were ordered by the emperor to make a considerable number of machines, for distribution to the people along the [[Zhengguo Canal|Zheng Bai Canal]], for irrigation purposes.|{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=347}}</blockquote>\n\nThe last great ambitious ruler of the Tang dynasty was [[Emperor Xianzong of Tang|Emperor Xianzong]] (r. 805\u2013820), whose reign was aided by the fiscal reforms of the 780s, including a government monopoly on the salt industry.{{sfn|Benn|2002|pp=14\u201315}} He also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the Army of Divine Strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=15}} Between the years 806 and 819, Emperor Xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} Under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as Xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=51}}{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} However, Xianzong's successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=16}} The eunuchs' power became unchallenged after [[Emperor Wenzong of Tang|Emperor Wenzong]]'s (r. 826\u2013840) failed [[Ganlu Incident|plot to have them overthrown]]; instead the allies of Emperor Wenzong were publicly executed in the [[Chang'an#West Central Chang'an|West Market of Chang'an]], by the eunuchs' command.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=101}}\n\n[[File:Dunhuang Zhang Yichao army.jpg|thumb|400px|A late Tang mural commemorating the victory of General [[Zhang Yichao]] over the [[Tibetan Empire|Tibetans]] in 848 AD, from [[Mogao Caves|Mogao cave]] 156]]\nHowever, the Tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former Tang territories as far west as the [[Hexi Corridor]] and [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]].

In 903 he controlled the imperial court and forced [[Emperor Zhaozong of Tang]] to move the capital to Luoyang, preparing to take the throne himself. In 904 Zhu assassinated Emperor Zhaozong to replace him with the emperor's young son [[Emperor Ai of Tang]]. In 905 Zhu executed 9 brothers of Emperor Ai as well as many officials and [[Empress He (Tang dynasty)|Empress Dowager He]]. In 907 the Tang dynasty was ended when Zhu deposed Ai and took the throne for himself (known posthumously as Emperor Taizu of Later Liang). He established the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]], which inaugurated the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]. A year later Zhu had the deposed Emperor Ai poisoned to death.\n\n==Administration and politics==\n{{see also|Administrative divisions of the Tang dynasty}}\n\n===Initial reforms===\n\nTaizong set out to solve internal problems within the government which had constantly plagued past dynasties.

There were also six ministries ({{zh|t=\u90e8|hp=b\u00f9|links=no}}) under the administrations that implemented policy, each of which was assigned different tasks. These [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] included the personnel administration, finance, rites, military, justice, and public works\u2014an administrative model which would last until the fall of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912).{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=78}}\n\nAlthough the founders of the Tang related to the glory of the earlier [[Han dynasty]] (3rd century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}\u20133rd century&nbsp;{{sc|ad}}), the basis for much of their administrative organization was very similar to the previous [[Northern and Southern dynasties]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The [[Northern Zhou]] (6th century) [[fubing system]] of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The [[equal-field system]] of the [[Northern Wei]] (4th\u20136th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}\n\nAlthough the central and local governments kept an enormous number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.{{sfn|Brook|1998|p=59}}\n\nThe center of the political power of the Tang was the capital city of [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), where the emperor maintained his large palace quarters and entertained political emissaries with music, sports, [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] stunts, poetry, paintings, and [[Pear Garden|dramatic theater performances]]. The capital was also filled with incredible amounts of riches and resources to spare. When the Chinese [[prefecture|prefectural]] government officials traveled to the capital in the year 643 to give the annual report of the affairs in their districts, Emperor Taizong discovered that many had no proper quarters to rest in and were renting rooms with merchants. Therefore, Emperor Taizong ordered the government agencies in charge of [[Township|municipal]] construction to build every visiting official his own private [[mansion]] in the capital.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=59}}\n\n===Imperial examinations===\n{{Main|Imperial examination}}\n{{Further|Imperial examination in Chinese mythology}}\n\n[[File:Civilserviceexam1.jpg|thumb|left|Civil service exam candidates gather around the wall where results had been posted. Artwork by [[Qiu Ying]].]]\n\nStudents of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] studies were potential candidates for the [[imperial examination]]s, the graduates of which could be appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, ''mingjing'' ({{lang|zh|\u660e\u7d93}}; \"illuminating the classics\") and ''jinshi'' ({{lang|zh|\u9032\u58eb}}; \"presented scholar\").{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp = 91\u201392}} The ''mingjing'' was based upon the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian classics]] and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=91\u201392}} The ''jinshi'' tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as their skills in composing [[Chinese poetry|poetry]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=92}} Candidates were also judged on their skills of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in [[calligraphy]], all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in [[rhetoric]] or fanciful writing skills.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the [[Four occupations|artisan or merchant classes]],{{sfn|Gascoigne|Gascoigne|2003|p= 95}} although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=97}} In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the [[Five Classics]] with selected commentaries.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p= 112}}\n\nThis competitive procedure was designed to draw the best talent into government. But perhaps an even greater consideration for the Tang rulers, aware that imperial dependence on powerful aristocratic families and [[warlord]]s would have destabilizing consequences, was to create a body of career officials having no autonomous territorial or functional [[Base (politics)|power base]]. The Tang law code ensured equal division of inherited property amongst legitimate heirs, allowing a bit of [[social mobility]] and preventing the families of powerful court officials from becoming [[landed nobility]] through [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=83}} As it turned out, these scholar-officials acquired status in their local communities and in family ties, while they also shared values that connected them to the imperial court. From Tang times until the end of the Qing dynasty in 1912, [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] functioned often as intermediaries between the [[grassroots]] level and the government. Yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the Song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.{{sfn |Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=95}}{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=54}} As historian Patricia Ebrey states of the Song period scholar-officials:\n{{quote|The examination system, used only on a small scale in Sui and Tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite.

In his bid for power, Li Yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the [[Taoism|Daoist]] sage [[Laozi]] ({{floruit}}&nbsp;6th century&nbsp;{{sc|bc}}).{{sfn|Graff|2000|p=79}} People bidding for office would have monks from Buddhist temples pray for them in public in return for cash donations or gifts if the person was selected. Before the persecution of Buddhism in the 9th century, Buddhism and Daoism were accepted side by side, and [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] (r. 712\u2013756) invited monks and clerics of both religions to his court. At the same time Xuanzong exalted the ancient Laozi by granting him grand titles, wrote commentary on the Daoist ''Laozi'', set up a school to prepare candidates for examinations on Daoist scriptures, and called upon the Indian monk [[Vajrabodhi]] (671\u2013741) to perform [[Vajrayana|Tantric]] rites to avert a drought in the year 726. In 742 Emperor Xuanzong personally held the incense burner during a ceremony led by [[Amoghavajra]] (705\u2013774, patriarch of the [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon school]]) reciting \"mystical incantations to secure the victory of Tang forces.\"{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=99}}\n\nWhile religion played a role in politics, politics also played a role in religion. In the year 714, Emperor Xuanzong forbade shops and vendors in the city of Chang'an to sell copied Buddhist sutras, instead giving the Buddhist clergy of the monasteries the sole right to distribute sutras to the [[laity]].{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=57}} In the previous year of 713, Emperor Xuanzong had liquidated the highly lucrative [[Chang'an#Northwestern Chang'an|Inexhaustible Treasury]], which was run by a prominent Buddhist monastery in Chang'an. This monastery collected vast amounts of money, silk, and treasures through multitudes of anonymous people's repentances, leaving the donations on the monastery's premise. Although the monastery was generous in donations, Emperor Xuanzong issued a decree abolishing their treasury on grounds that their [[History of banking in China|banking]] practices were fraudulent, collected their riches, and distributed the wealth to various other Buddhist monasteries and Daoist abbeys, and to repair statues, halls, and bridges in the city.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=61}}\n\n===Taxes and the census===\n\nThe Tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the size of their empire's population, mostly for effective taxation and matters of military conscription for each region. The early Tang government established both the grain tax and cloth tax at a relatively low rate for each household under the empire. This was meant to encourage households to enroll for taxation and not avoid the authorities, thus providing the government with the most accurate estimate possible.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} In the census of 609, the population was tallied by efforts of the government at a size of 9 million households, or about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}} The Tang census of 742 again approximated the size of China's population at about 50&nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=141}} Patricia Ebrey writes that even if a rather significant number of people had avoided the registration process of the tax census, the population size during the Tang had not grown significantly since the earlier Han dynasty (the [[History of the Han dynasty|census of the year 2]] recording a population of roughly 58 million people in China).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=91}}{{sfn|Nishijima|1986|pp=595\u2013596}} S.A.M.

After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given enormous power, including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=100}}{{sfn|Wang|2003|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Tang Pottery Warrior.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Tang dynasty tomb figures|Pottery tomb figure]] of a warrior from Duan's Tomb, [[Shaanxi]].]]\n\n===Soldiers and conscription===\n\nBy the year 737, Emperor Xuanzong discarded the policy of conscripting soldiers that were replaced every three years, replacing them with long-service soldiers who were more battle-hardened and efficient. It was more economically feasible as well, since training new recruits and sending them out to the frontier every three years drained the treasury.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=9}} By the late 7th century, the ''[[Fubing system|fubing]]'' troops began abandoning military service and the homes provided to them in the equal-field system.

In another joint invasion with Silla, the Tang army severely weakened the Goguryeo Kingdom in the north by taking out its outer forts in the year 645.

With a population of about a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal.

''Jintishi'' poetry, or regulated verse, is in the form of eight-line [[stanza]]s or seven [[Chinese characters|characters]] per line with a fixed pattern of tones that required the second and third couplets to be antithetical (although the [[antithesis]] is often lost in translation to other languages).{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=102}} Tang poems remained popular and great emulation of Tang era poetry began in the Song dynasty; in that period, Yan Yu (\u56b4\u7fbd; active 1194\u20131245) was the first to confer the poetry of the High Tang (c. 713\u2013766) era with \"canonical status within the classical poetic tradition.\" Yan Yu reserved the position of highest esteem among all Tang poets for [[Du Fu]] (712\u2013770), who was not viewed as such in his own era, and was branded by his peers as an anti-traditional rebel.{{sfn|Yu|1998|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe [[Classical Prose Movement]] was spurred in large part by the writings of Tang authors [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773\u2013819) and [[Han Yu]] (768\u2013824). This new prose style broke away from the poetry tradition of the ''piantiwen'' ({{lang|zh|\u9a19\u9ad4\u6587}}, \"parallel prose\") style begun in the Han dynasty. Although writers of the Classical Prose Movement imitated ''piantiwen'', they criticized it for its often vague content and lack of colloquial language, focusing more on clarity and precision to make their writing more direct.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=106}} This ''guwen'' (archaic prose) style can be traced back to Han Yu, and would become largely associated with [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[Neo-Confucianism]].{{sfn|Huters|1987|p=52}}\n\nShort story fiction and tales were also popular during the Tang, one of the more famous ones being ''Yingying's Biography'' by [[Yuan Zhen]] (779\u2013831), which was widely circulated in his own time and by the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279\u20131368) became the basis for plays in [[Chinese opera]].{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|pp=104\u2013105}}{{sfn|Wong|1979|p=97}} Timothy C.

Like the Rougamo in modern Chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. There were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in Chang\u2019an, and its price was also far from expensive.

The definition here was very broad, including current day wonton, noodles, and many other kinds of food that soak wheat in water.

Previous advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) and [[Ma Jun]] (fl. 3rd century), which gave the Tang mathematician, mechanical engineer, astronomer, and monk [[Yi Xing]] (683\u2013727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork [[escapement]] mechanism in 725.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=319}} This was used alongside a [[Water clock|clepsydra]] clock and [[waterwheel]] to power a rotating [[armillary sphere]] in representation of [[astronomical]] observation.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013475}} Yi Xing's device also had a mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a [[striking clock]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=473\u2013474}} Yi Xing's [[astronomical clock]] and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=475}} However, the most common type of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a [[steelyard balance]] that allowed seasonal adjustment in the [[pressure head]] of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=480}}\n\nThere were many other mechanical inventions during the Tang era. These included a 3&nbsp;ft (0.91&nbsp;m) tall mechanical wine server of the early 8th century that was in the shape of an artificial mountain, carved out of iron and rested on a [[lacquer]]ed-wooden tortoise frame. This intricate device used a hydraulic pump that siphoned wine out of metal [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed faucets, as well as tilting bowls that were timed to dip wine down, by force of [[gravity]] when filled, into an artificial lake that had intricate iron leaves popping up as trays for placing party treats.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}} Furthermore, as the historian Charles Benn describes it:\n\n{{Quote|Midway up the southern side of the mountain was a dragon\u2026the beast opened its mouth and spit brew into a goblet seated on a large [iron] lotus leaf beneath. When the cup was 80% full, the dragon ceased spewing ale, and a guest immediately seized the goblet. If he was slow in draining the cup and returning it to the leaf, the door of a pavilion at the top of the mountain opened and a mechanical wine server, dressed in a cap and gown, emerged with a wooden bat in his hand. As soon as the guest returned the goblet, the dragon refilled it, the wine server withdrew, and the doors of the pavilion closed\u2026A pump siphoned the ale that flowed into the ale pool through a hidden hole and returned the brew to the reservoir [holding more than 16 quarts/15 liters of wine] inside the mountain.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=144}}}}\n\nYet the use of a teasing mechanical puppet in this wine-serving device wasn't exactly a novel invention of the Tang, since the use of mechanical puppets in China date back to the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC). In the 3rd century [[Ma Jun]] had an entire mechanical puppet theater operated by the rotation of a waterwheel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=158}} There was also an automatic wine-server known in the ancient [[Greco-Roman]] world, a design of the Greek inventor [[Heron of Alexandria]] that employed an urn with an inner valve and a lever device similar to the one described above. There are many stories of [[automaton]]s used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}} This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny [[slot machine]].{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163 footnote c}} Other devices included one by Wang Ju, whose \"wooden otter\" could allegedly catch fish; Needham suspects a [[Spring (device)|spring trap]] of some kind was employed here.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=163}}\n\nIn the realm of structural engineering and technical [[Chinese architecture]], there were also government standard building codes, outlined in the early Tang book of the ''Yingshan Ling'' (National Building Law).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} Fragments of this book have survived in the ''Tang L\u00fc'' (The Tang Code),{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}} while the Song dynasty architectural manual of the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' (State Building Standards) by [[Architecture of the Song dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065\u20131101) in 1103 is the oldest existing technical treatise on Chinese architecture that has survived in full.{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=1}} During the reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] (712\u2013756) there were 34,850 registered [[Artisan|craftsmen]] serving the state, managed by the Agency of Palace Buildings (Jingzuo Jian).{{sfn|Guo|1998|p=3}}\n\n===Woodblock printing===\n{{Main|Woodblock printing|Playing cards|Chinese playing cards}}\n[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The [[Diamond Sutra]], printed in 868, is the world's first widely printed book to include a specific date of printing.]]\n\n[[Woodblock printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences. One of the world's oldest surviving printed documents is a miniature Buddhist ''[[dharani]]'' [[sutra]] unearthed at Xi'an in 1974 and dated roughly from 650 to 670.{{sfn|Pan|1997|pp=979\u2013980}} The ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'' is the first full-length book printed at regular size, complete with illustrations embedded with the text and dated precisely to 868.{{sfn|Temple|1986|p=112}}{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=151}} Among the earliest documents to be printed were Buddhist texts as well as calendars, the latter essential for calculating and marking which days were auspicious and which days were not.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|pp=124\u2013125}} With so many books coming into circulation for the general public, literacy rates could improve, along with the lower classes being able to obtain cheaper sources of study. Therefore, there were more lower-class people seen entering the Imperial Examinations and passing them by the later Song dynasty.{{sfn|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=159}}{{sfn|Fairbank|Goldman|2006|p=94}}{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=147}} Although the later [[Bi Sheng]]'s [[movable type]] [[printing]] in the 11th century was innovative for his period, woodblock printing that became widespread in the Tang would remain the dominant [[History of typography in East Asia|printing type in China]] until the more advanced [[printing press]] from Europe became widely accepted and used in East Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|p=227}} The first use of the [[playing card]] during the Tang dynasty was an auxiliary invention of the new age of printing.{{sfn|Needham|1986d|pp=131\u2013132}}\n\n===Cartography===\n[[File:Dunhuang star map.jpg|thumb|The [[Dunhuang map]], a [[star map]] showing the North Polar region. c. 700.{{sfn|Xi|1981|p=464}} The whole set of star maps contains over 1,300 stars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/education/astronomy_researchers/index.a4d|title=The Dunhuang Chinese Sky: A comprehensive study of the oldest known star atlas|last1=Bonnet-Bidaud |first1=J.

When the Tang chancellor [[Pei Ju]] (547\u2013627) was working for the Sui dynasty as a Commercial Commissioner in 605, he created a well-known gridded map with a [[Scale (map)|graduated scale]] in the tradition of [[Pei Xiu]] (224\u2013271).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|pp=538\u2013540, 543}} The Tang chancellor [[Xu Jingzong]] (592\u2013672) was also known for his map of China drawn in the year 658.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} In the year 785 the [[Emperor Dezong of Tang|Emperor Dezong]] had the geographer and cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730\u2013805) complete a map of China and her former colonies in Central Asia.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} Upon its completion in 801, the map was 9.1&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) in length and 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) in height, mapped out on a grid scale of one inch equaling one hundred ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' (Chinese unit of measuring distance).{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=543}} A Chinese map of 1137 is similar in complexity to the one made by Jia Dan, carved on a stone stele with a grid scale of 100 li.{{sfn|Needham|1986a|p=Plate LXXXI}} However, the only type of map that has survived from the Tang period are [[star chart]]s. Despite this, [[Chinese cartography|the earliest extant terrain maps of China]] come from the ancient [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]]; maps from the 4th century BC that were excavated in 1986.{{sfn|Hsu|1993|p=90}}\n\n===Medicine===\nThe Chinese of the Tang era were also very interested in the benefits of officially classifying all of the [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicines]] used in [[pharmacology]]. In 657, [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]] (r. 649\u2013683) commissioned the literary project of publishing an official ''[[materia medica]]'', complete with text and illustrated drawings for 833 different medicinal substances taken from different stones, minerals, metals, plants, herbs, animals, vegetables, fruits, and cereal crops.{{sfn|Benn|2002|p=235}} In addition to compiling pharmacopeias, the Tang fostered learning in medicine by upholding imperial medical colleges, state examinations for doctors, and publishing forensic manuals for physicians.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=83}} Authors of medicine in the Tang include Zhen Chuan (d. 643) and [[Sun Simiao]] (581\u2013682), the former who first identified in writing that patients with [[diabetes]] had an excess of sugar in their [[urine]], and the latter who was the first to recognize that diabetic patients should avoid consuming alcohol and [[starch]]y foods.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=132\u2013133}} As written by Zhen Chuan and others in the Tang, the [[thyroid]] glands of sheep and pigs were successfully used to treat [[goiter]]s; thyroid extracts were not used to treat patients with goiter in the West until 1890.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=134\u2013135}} The use of the [[Amalgam (dentistry)|dental amalgam]], manufactured from tin and silver, was first introduced in the medical text ''Xinxiu Bencao'' written by Su Gong in 659.<ref name=czarnetzki>{{cite journal|last=Czarnetzki|first=A.|author2=Ehrhardt S. |title=Re-dating the Chinese amalgam-filling of teeth in Europe|journal=International Journal of Anthropology|year=1990|volume=5|issue=4|pages=325\u2013332}}</ref>\n\n===Alchemy, gas cylinders, and air conditioning===\nChinese scientists of the Tang period employed complex chemical formulas for an array of different purposes, often found through experiments of [[alchemy]]. These included a [[waterproof]] and dust-repelling cream or [[varnish]] for clothes and weapons, [[fireproof]] cement for glass and porcelain wares, a waterproof cream applied to silk clothes of [[underwater diving|underwater divers]], a cream designated for polishing bronze mirrors, and many other useful formulas.{{sfn|Needham|1986e|p=452}} The vitrified, translucent ceramic known as [[porcelain]] was invented in China during the Tang, although many types of glazed ceramics preceded it.{{sfn|Adshead|2004|p=80}}{{sfn|Wood|1999|p=49}}\n\nEver since the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep [[borehole]]s to transport natural gas from [[Pipeline transport|bamboo pipelines]] to stoves where [[cast iron]] evaporation pans boiled [[brine]] to extract salt.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=78\u201379}} During the Tang dynasty, a [[gazetteer]] of Sichuan province stated that at one of these 182&nbsp;m (600&nbsp;ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}} These were essentially the first [[gas cylinder]]s; Robert Temple assumes [[Tap (valve)|some sort of tap]] was used for this device.{{sfn|Temple|1986|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nThe inventor [[Ding Huan]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 180 AD) of the Han dynasty invented a [[Fan (mechanical)|rotary fan]] for [[air conditioning]], with seven wheels 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) in diameter and manually powered.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=99, 151, 233}} In 747, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] had a \"Cool Hall\" built in the imperial palace, which the ''[[Tang Yulin]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5510\u8a9e\u6797}}) describes as having water-powered fan wheels for air conditioning as well as rising jet streams of water from fountains.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|pp=134, 151}} During the subsequent Song dynasty, written sources mentioned the air conditioning rotary fan as even more widely used.{{sfn|Needham|1986b|p=151}}\n\n==Historiography==\n{{See also|Chinese historiography}}\n\nThe first classic work about the Tang is the ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'' by Liu Xu (887\u2013946) et al. of the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Later Jin]], who redacted it during the last years of his life. This was edited into another history (labelled the ''[[New Book of Tang]]'') in order to distinguish it, which was a work by the Song historians [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007\u20131072), Song Qi (998\u20131061), et al. of the Song dynasty (between the years 1044 and 1060).

One of the surviving sources of the ''Old Book of Tang'', primarily covering up to 756, is the ''[[Tongdian]]'', which [[Du You]] presented to the emperor in 801. The Tang period was again placed into the enormous [[universal history]] text of the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'', edited, compiled, and completed in 1084 by a team of scholars under the Song dynasty Chancellor [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086). This historical text, written with three million [[Chinese characters]] in 294 volumes, covered the history of China from the beginning of the [[Warring States]] (403 BC) until the beginning of the Song dynasty (960).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China|History}}\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Chinese emperors family tree (middle)#Tang and Second Zhou Dynasties|The family tree of the Tang dynasty emperors]]\n* [[Di Renjie]]\n* [[Dongyi Protectorate]]\n* [[Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup]]\n* ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (government newspaper for officials)\n* [[List of emperors of the Tang dynasty]]\n* [[List of tributaries of Imperial China]]\n* [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]]\n* [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n* [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia]]\n* [[Tang poetry]]\n* [[Taxation in premodern China]]\n* [[Wei Zheng]]\n* [[Yan Zhenqing]]\n* [[Yijing (monk)]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = China in World History |edition=2nd |year=1995 |orig-year=1988 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] and St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-333-62132-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Adshead |first=S.A.M. |title = T'ang China: The Rise of the East in World History|year=2004|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4039-3456-7}}\n* {{citation |last=Andrew |first=Anita N. |last2=Rapp |first2=John A. |title=Autocracy and Cina's Rebel Founding Emperors: Comparing Chairman Mao and Ming Taizu |year=2000 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |location=Lanham |isbn=978-0-8476-9580-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Bai |first=Shouyi|authorlink=Bai Shouyi |title = A History of Chinese Muslim (Vol. 2)|year=2003|publisher=Zhonghua Book Company |location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-101-02890-4}}\n* {{citation |last=Ball |first=Warwick |authorlink=Warwick Ball |title = Rome in the East: Transformation of an Empire |edition=2nd |year=2016 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-72078-6}}\n* {{citation |last=Beckwith|first=Christopher I.|title=The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia|year=1987|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-02469-1}}\n* {{citation |last=Benn|first=Charles|title=China's Golden Age: Everyday Life in the Tang dynasty|year=2002|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-517665-0}}\n* {{Citation |last=Bernhardt|first=Kathryn|date=July 1995|title=The Inheritance Right of Daughters: the Song Anomaly?|journal=Modern China|pages=269\u2013309}}\n* {{citation |last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}\n* {{citation |last=Brook|first=Timothy |authorlink=Timothy Brook (historian)|title=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China|year=1998|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-22154-3|title-link=The Confusions of Pleasure: Commerce and Culture in Ming China }}\n* {{citation |last=Chen|first=Yan|title=Maritime Silk Route and Chinese-Foreign Cultural Exchanges|year=2002|publisher=Peking University Press|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-301-03029-5}}\n* {{citation |last=Cui|first=Mingde|title=The History of Chinese Heqin|year=2005|publisher=Renmin Chubanshe|location=Beijing|isbn=978-7-01-004828-4}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tang China and the Collapse of the Uighur Empire: A Documentary History |author-first=Michael R. |author-last=Drompp |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB6DEdAxLOsC |series=Brill's Inner Asian Library |year=2004 |location=Leiden |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-14129-2 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Drompp |first=Michael R. |authormask=3 |chapter=Late-Tang Foreign Relations: The Uyghur Crisis |title=Hawai'i Reader in Traditional Chinese Culture |editor1-last=Mair |editor1-first=Victor H. |editor2=Nancy S.

Today they are made by adding curtain weights sewn onto portions of two sides of fabric make it possible for flaggers to spin their props, or toys, through the air in ways similar to fan dancing.

The first such opportunity was advertised in Circuit Noize magazine in 1997\u2013 simple gold lame flags of 3 feet by 5 feet that came with a matching bag. Flags can be of almost any fabric, but silk, organza and lam\u00e9 are preponderant, with silk being the most favored.  Silk flags are usually dyed in vibrant, [[ultraviolet]] [[fluorescent]] colors, creating an almost hypnotic spectacle when spun rhythmically.\n\n==Flagging tribes in the U.S.==\nFlagger groups, known as tribes, formed in [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.|DC]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]] and [[South Florida]] in the mid 1990s, and were often part of the backdrop of the [[circuit party]] events mostly attended by [[gay men]]. These were soon followed by the formation of troupes in [[Minneapolis]], [[Seattle]], and [[Houston]] in the United States, and in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].  It is considered disrespectful to commercialize this disco art form. Many tribes continue to perform as atmosphere in clubs and at benefits worldwide.\n\n==Flagging in Brazil==\nThe origins of this art in Brazil date back to [[Belo Horizonte]], a city of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], 1998 - 1999. Due to the abundance of gay festivities in the country, the culture initially spread to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and later to [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Bras\u00edlia]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]]. Many users of social networks (Facebook, Orkut, among others) posted their photos with banners (flags) to promote and / or demonstrate the art.\nThere are some meetings in the park that are held to provide opportunities to practice, similar to those in the USA. Some of them even sponsored by the city (laws to encourage Culture, in Belo Horizonte). These are usually organized by art masters (flag masters) in some cities such as Belo Horizonte or S\u00e3o Paulo. Another city, Florianopolis, has seen an increase of flagging activities at festivals and parties since 2010. These events promote the exchange of experiences among the participants, ensuring the continued maintenance of Art and Culture with Flags on the national scene.\nOn July 9, 2011, the fourth Minas Gerais flaggers meeting took place in Belo Horizonte, where several members of the country participated. It is the second largest meeting of Flaggers in the world, second only to the community of the city of San Francisco, California. Currently, this art can be seen in electronic culture scenes such as Raves in various parts of the country. The flags are not necessarily manufactured by flag-makers originating in Brazil by the original flaggers, but flags still continue to enter the scene through outside sources.\n\n==Flagger events==\nPerformances and conferences have begun forming in various cities, including New York, San Francisco, Palm Springs, and Dallas. Conferences and workshops happen in 2 or 3 full day events, and teach construction and techniques from beginner to advanced. A short list of leaders in the community often travel to many of these events, becoming known internationally as masters in Flag Dancing.\n\nThe Texas Flagger Weekend ran from 2003 - 2009. The event consisted of growing number of flaggers from around the world, peaking in 2008 with 80+ participants. The event had various tracks, from beginners to advanced. In later years, the Weekend expanded to include multiple tracks, a [[circuit party]] and a showcase of performances, SpinOut, of their own, inspired by the [[San Francisco]] events of the same name.\n\nNew York hosted the \"World Symposium of Fanning and Flagging\" in 2005 and included movement classes, creation workshops, and performances, mostly held at [[The Center]].\n\nFlagging In The Park (FITP), started in 1997, is a fundraising gathering of flaggers, flow artists, and their supporters, happening in the [[National AIDS Memorial Grove]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]. The event was started as a celebration of life and an honoring of those who had passed by founder Jeff Kennedy; then held by a few core members of the close-knit SF Tribe; in 2002 - 2003 the event was produced in [[Dolores Park]] by Bryan Hughes; in 2005 the event moved back to the National AIDS Memorial Grove being led by Xavier Caylor; from 2014 to the present the event is being held by a group of flaggers from the Bay Area and beyond. The basic event includes: a live DJ spinning music, a time for reflection, and hat being passed to raise money for charity. The event is open to all and many flow arts forms can be seen there. One of the five events happens the last full weekend of July, on Saturday before the [[Up Your Alley Street Fair]] on Sunday, and is advertised as the (Flagger) SF Destination Weekend. The weekend offers a tie-dye opportunity (flag creation), FITP, and several opportunities to gather with and without flags, fans, hoops, poi or other flow art prop.\n\nWith so many in the community now calling Palm Springs home, 2018 was time to bring some of that magic to the desert. The [http://flagginginthedesert.com/ Flagging in the Desert] (FITD) was first held during PS Pride Weekend and then again in March 2019 with funds collected for local charities. Following the November 2019 event there are three FITD events planned for 2020.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Genre Magazine, June 2004\n*''[[New York Blade]]'', February 6, 2004\n* [http://www.edgeonthenet.com/nightlife/parties///122989/new_film_documents_history_&_artistry_of_flagging/ Edge Magazine], review of Flow Affair documentary by Jim Hauk, August 3, 2011.\n* Xavier Caylor, Producer of Flagging In The Park 1999 to present, August 2018\n\n[http://www.FlowAffair.org Flag, Fan, Poi and Floguing Dance]== References ==\n{{www.FlowAffair.org}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.FlowAffair.org/ Flow Affair]; Flagging, Fanning, Poi and Floguing Dance documentary\n*FITP\n\n{{Object manipulation}}[http://Www.flagginginthepark.org]\n[[Category:Twirling]]\n[[Category:20th-century dance]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||flagging in marching bands|Color guard (flag spinning)|Italian flagging art|Flag throwing}}\n\n{{context|date=August 2018}}\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2008}}\n[[Image:XMen Flags.jpg|frame|right|A flag dancer at a nightclub: circa 2001.]]\n[[File:Exemplo de flagger girando suas bandeiras.jpg|thumb|Example (2011)]]\n\nThe art of '''flagging dance''', often called '''flag spinning''', '''flag dancing''', or '''rag spinning''', but more commonly referred to as '''flagging''', is the undulation, spinning and waving of flags in a rhythmic fashion to music.

Silk flags are usually dyed in vibrant, [[ultraviolet]] [[fluorescent]] colors, creating an almost hypnotic spectacle when spun rhythmically.\n\n==Flagging tribes in the U.S.==\nFlagger groups, known as tribes, formed in [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, D.C.|DC]], [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]] and [[South Florida]] in the mid 1990s, and were often part of the backdrop of the [[circuit party]] events mostly attended by [[gay men]]. These were soon followed by the formation of troupes in [[Minneapolis]], [[Seattle]], and [[Houston]] in the United States, and in [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Brazil]].  It is considered disrespectful to commercialize this disco art form. Many tribes continue to perform as atmosphere in clubs and at benefits worldwide.\n\n==Flagging in Brazil==\nThe origins of this art in Brazil date back to [[Belo Horizonte]], a city of the state of [[Minas Gerais]], 1998 - 1999. Due to the abundance of gay festivities in the country, the culture initially spread to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and later to [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Bras\u00edlia]] and [[Florian\u00f3polis]]. Many users of social networks (Facebook, Orkut, among others) posted their photos with banners (flags) to promote and / or demonstrate the art.\nThere are some meetings in the park that are held to provide opportunities to practice, similar to those in the USA. Some of them even sponsored by the city (laws to encourage Culture, in Belo Horizonte). These are usually organized by art masters (flag masters) in some cities such as Belo Horizonte or S\u00e3o Paulo. Another city, Florianopolis, has seen an increase of flagging activities at festivals and parties since 2010. These events promote the exchange of experiences among the participants, ensuring the continued maintenance of Art and Culture with Flags on the national scene.\nOn July 9, 2011, the fourth Minas Gerais flaggers meeting took place in Belo Horizonte, where several members of the country participated. It is the second largest meeting of Flaggers in the world, second only to the community of the city of San Francisco, California. Currently, this art can be seen in electronic culture scenes such as Raves in various parts of the country. The flags are not necessarily manufactured by flag-makers originating in Brazil by the original flaggers, but flags still continue to enter the scene through outside sources.\n\n==Flagger events==\nPerformances and conferences have begun forming in various cities, including New York, San Francisco, Palm Springs, and Dallas. Conferences and workshops happen in 2 or 3 full day events, and teach construction and techniques from beginner to advanced. A short list of leaders in the community often travel to many of these events, becoming known internationally as masters in Flag Dancing.\n\nThe Texas Flagger Weekend ran from 2003 - 2009. The event consisted of growing number of flaggers from around the world, peaking in 2008 with 80+ participants. The event had various tracks, from beginners to advanced. In later years, the Weekend expanded to include multiple tracks, a [[circuit party]] and a showcase of performances, SpinOut, of their own, inspired by the [[San Francisco]] events of the same name.\n\nNew York hosted the \"World Symposium of Fanning and Flagging\" in 2005 and included movement classes, creation workshops, and performances, mostly held at [[The Center]].\n\nFlagging In The Park (FITP), started in 1997, is a fundraising gathering of flaggers, flow artists, and their supporters, happening in the [[National AIDS Memorial Grove]] in [[Golden Gate Park]]. The event was started as a celebration of life and an honoring of those who had passed by founder Jeff Kennedy; then held by a few core members of the close-knit SF Tribe; in 2002 - 2003 the event was produced in [[Dolores Park]] by Bryan Hughes; in 2005 the event moved back to the National AIDS Memorial Grove being led by Xavier Caylor; from 2014 to the present the event is being held by a group of flaggers from the Bay Area and beyond. The basic event includes: a live DJ spinning music, a time for reflection, and hat being passed to raise money for charity. The event is open to all and many flow arts forms can be seen there. One of the five events happens the last full weekend of July, on Saturday before the [[Up Your Alley Street Fair]] on Sunday, and is advertised as the (Flagger) SF Destination Weekend. The weekend offers a tie-dye opportunity (flag creation), FITP, and several opportunities to gather with and without flags, fans, hoops, poi or other flow art prop.\n\nWith so many in the community now calling Palm Springs home, 2018 was time to bring some of that magic to the desert. The [http://flagginginthedesert.com/ Flagging in the Desert] (FITD) was first held during PS Pride Weekend and then again in March 2019 with funds collected for local charities. Following the November 2019 event there are three FITD events planned for 2020.\n\n== Sources ==\n* Genre Magazine, June 2004\n*''[[New York Blade]]'', February 6, 2004\n* [http://www.edgeonthenet.com/nightlife/parties///122989/new_film_documents_history_&_artistry_of_flagging/ Edge Magazine], review of Flow Affair documentary by Jim Hauk, August 3, 2011.\n* Xavier Caylor, Producer of Flagging In The Park 1999 to present, August 2018\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.FlowAffair.org/ Flow Affair]; Flagging, Fanning, Poi and Floguing Dance documentary\n*FITP\n\n{{Object manipulation}}[http://Www.flagginginthepark.org]\n[[Category:Twirling]]\n[[Category:20th-century dance]]\n", "name_user": "Wolfgangbusch", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eReferences)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagging_dance"}

and  \n#'''''Engaging party''''', the entity that engages the practitioner to perform an attestation.\n\nSSAE 18 refers to two roles that are the main actors during an attestation engagement:<ref name=\"AT-C_105\"/> \n#The '''''practitioner''''', also referred to in section 320 as the '''''service auditor''''', the person performing the attestation engagement; and\n#The '''''responsible party''''', also referred to as '''''management''''' or '''''service organization''''' or '''''service provider''''', which is the party responsible for providing the statements, descriptions and/or assertions that are the subject matter of the attestation engagement.\n\nSSAE 18 identifies two subordinate roles that may be engaged by the practitioner:<ref name=\"AT-C_105\"/> \n#'''''Other practitioner''''',  who provides information that will be used as evidence by the practitioner; and\n#'''''Practitioner\u2019s specialist''''', who \"possesses expertise in a field other than accounting or attestation\", who assists in gathering evidence.\n\nSSAE 18 also identifies other relevant roles not directly engaged in the audit:<ref name=\"AT-C_105\"/> \n*'''''AICPA''''', which publishes the audit standards and code of ethics that the responsible or engaged parties are expected to follow;  \n*'''''Subservice organization''''', A service organization used by a service organization that is the responsible party; and \n*'''''Users''''', which may refer to the intended users of the practitioner's report, also referred to as the '''''Specified party''''', or the users of the services provided by the Service Provider.\n\n===Service levels===\nSections 205, 210, and 215 are intended to define the three service levels for any attestation engagement, though other applicable sections may specify additional requirements for the engagement:\n#For an '''''examination engagement''''', the objectives of the practitioner are:<ref name=\"AT-C_205\"/> \n## to obtain assurance that the subject matter is free from material misstatement, and\n## to express an opinion on whether the subject matter meets the specified criteria or the responsible party's assertion and is fairly stated. \n#For a '''''review engagement''''', the objectives of the practitioner are:<ref name=\"AT-C_210\"/> \n## to obtain limited assurance that the subject matter meets the specified criteria or the responsible party's assertion, and \n## express a conclusion on whether any modifications should be made to meet the specified criteria or assertion and be fairly stated.\n#For an '''''agreed-upon procedures engagement''''', the objective of the practitioner is:<ref name=\"AT-C_215\"/> \n## to issue a report of findings based on specified agreed-upon procedures which are applied to subject matter, where the specified parties determine the procedures used.\nSections 205, 210, and 215 also prescribe or prohibit certain attestation engagement service levels depending on the subject matter.\n\n===Report types===\nSSAE 18 section 320, titled \"Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities\u2019 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\", defines two types of report formats, type 1 and type 2, that vary in their content, which further differentiates the level of service to be performed in an attestation engagement for this subject matter:<ref name=\"AT-C_320\"/><ref name=\"Imperva\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/soc-2-compliance/\n | title = SOC 2 Compliance\n | publisher = Imperva\n | website = imperva.com\n | access-date = 25 February 2020\n}}</ref> \n*'''''Type 1''''', which includes an assessment of the design of identified controls, and \n*'''''Type 2''''', which also includes an assessment of the operating effectiveness of identified controls.\n\n===Subject matter===\nSSAE 18 states that it may be applicable to any subject matter, though the nature of the subject matter is a key factor in determining which sections of the standard are applicable and which attestation engagement service level the practitioner may perform.

and  \n#'''''Engaging party''''', the entity that engages the practitioner to perform an attestation.\n\nSSAE 18 refers to two roles that are the main actors during an attestation engagement:<ref name=\"AT-C_105/> \n#The '''''practitioner''''', also referred to in section 320 as the '''''service auditor''''', the person performing the attestation engagement; and\n#The '''''responsible party''''', also referred to as '''''management''''' or '''''service organization''''' or '''''service provider''''', which is the party responsible for providing the statements, descriptions and/or assertions that are the subject matter of the attestation engagement.\n\nSSAE 18 identifies two subordinate roles that may be engaged by the practitioner:<ref name=\"AT-C_105\"/> \n#'''''Other practitioner''''',  who provides information that will be used as evidence by the practitioner; and\n#'''''Practitioner\u2019s specialist''''', who \"possesses expertise in a field other than accounting or attestation\", who assists in gathering evidence.\n\nSSAE 18 also identifies other relevant roles not directly engaged in the audit:<ref name=\"AT-C_105\"/> \n*'''''AICPA''''', which publishes the audit standards and code of ethics that the responsible or engaged parties are expected to follow;  \n*'''''Subservice organization''''', A service organization used by a service organization that is the responsible party; and \n*'''''Users''''', which may refer to the intended users of the practitioner's report, also referred to as the '''''Specified party''''', or the users of the services provided by the Service Provider.\n\n===Service levels===\nSections 205, 210, and 215 are intended to define the three service levels for any attestation engagement, though other applicable sections may specify additional requirements for the engagement:\n#For an '''''examination engagement''''', the objectives of the practitioner are:<ref name=\"AT-C_205\"/> \n## to obtain assurance that the subject matter is free from material misstatement, and\n## to express an opinion on whether the subject matter meets the specified criteria or the responsible party's assertion and is fairly stated. \n#For a '''''review engagement''''', the objectives of the practitioner are:<ref name=\"AT-C_210\"/> \n## to obtain limited assurance that the subject matter meets the specified criteria or the responsible party's assertion, and \n## express a conclusion on whether any modifications should be made to meet the specified criteria or assertion and be fairly stated.\n#For an '''''agreed-upon procedures engagement''''', the objective of the practitioner is:<ref name=\"AT-C_215\"/> \n## to issue a report of findings based on specified agreed-upon procedures which are applied to subject matter, where the specified parties determine the procedures used.\nSections 205, 210, and 215 also prescribe or prohibit certain attestation engagement service levels depending on the subject matter.\n\n===Report types===\nSSAE 18 section 320, titled \"Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities\u2019 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\", defines two types of report formats, type 1 and type 2, that vary in their content, which further differentiates the level of service to be performed in an attestation engagement for this subject matter:<ref name=\"AT-C_320\"/><ref name=\"Imperva\">{{cite web\n | url = https://www.imperva.com/learn/data-security/soc-2-compliance/\n | title = SOC 2 Compliance\n | publisher = Imperva\n | website = imperva.com\n | access-date = 25 February 2020\n}}</ref> \n*'''''Type 1''''', which includes an assessment of the design of identified controls, and \n*'''''Type 2''''', which also includes an assessment of the operating effectiveness of identified controls.\n\n===Subject matter===\nSSAE 18 states that it may be applicable to any subject matter, though the nature of the subject matter is a key factor in determining which sections of the standard are applicable and which attestation engagement service level the practitioner may perform. All attestation engagements are predicated on the concept that the practitioner reports an opinion about a statement, description, or assertion made by the responsible party about a subject matter. \n*''Prospective financial information'', including financial forecasts and projections, is the focus of AT-C section 305.<ref name=\"AT-C_305\"/>\n*''Pro forma financial information'' is the focus of AT-C section 310.<ref name=\"AT-C_310\"/> \n*''Compliance'' or an assertion of compliance regarding laws, regulations, rules, contracts, or grants, is the focus of AT-C section 315.<ref name=\"AT-C_315\"/>\n*''Management's description of the service organization's system'', including control objectives, controls, and descriptions of fraud or non-compliance, which are likely to be relevant to the user entities\u2019 internal control over financial reporting, is the focus of section 320. <ref name=\"AT-C_320\"/>\n*''Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A)'', which are presented in annual reports to shareholders, is the focus of section 395. <ref name=\"AT-C_395\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*AICPA [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/ssae-no-18.pdf Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements 18, Attestation Standards: Clarification and Recodification] full complete text \n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00105.pdf AT-C sec. 105] Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00205.pdf AT-C sec. 205] Examination Engagements\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00210.pdf AT-C sec. 210] Review Engagements\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00215.pdf AT-C sec. 215] Agreed-Upon Procedures Engagements\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00305.pdf AT-C sec. 305] Prospective Financial Information\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00310.pdf AT-C sec. 310] Reporting on Pro Forma Financial Information\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00315.pdf AT-C sec. 315] Compliance Attestation\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00320.pdf AT-C sec. 320] Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities' Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n*AICPA ''Professional Standards'', [https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/at-c-00395.pdf AT-C sec. 395] Designated for AT Section 701, Management's Discussion and Analysis\n*AICPA [https://www.aicpa.org/InterestAreas/FRC/AssuranceAdvisoryServices/Pages/SORHome.aspx System and Organization Controls: SOC Suite of Services] Home page \n\n[[Category:Standards]]\n[[Category:Auditing]]\n[[Category:Auditing standards]]\n[[Category:Sarbanes\u2013Oxley Act]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "ref name fixedWP:REFNAME", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSAE_No._18/Temp"}

The mayor appoints numerous officials, including commissioners who head city departments, and his deputy mayors. The mayor's regulations are compiled in title 43 of the ''[[New York City Rules]]''.

For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]] in which the state's governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence|Cornelius W. Lawrence]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was elected that year.\n\n[[Gracie Mansion]] has been the official residence of the mayor since [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s administration in 1942.

It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 through the era of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] (1954\u20131965).\n\n== Deputies==\nThe mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed [[Grover Whalen]] as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. \nDeputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor.

For 156 years, the mayor was appointed and had limited power. Between 1783 and 1821 the mayor was appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]] in which the state's governor had the loudest voice. In 1821 the Common Council, which included elected members, gained the authority to choose the mayor. An amendment to the New York State Constitution in 1834 provided for the direct popular election of the mayor. [[Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence|Cornelius W. Lawrence]], a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]], was elected that year.\n\n[[Gracie Mansion]] has been the official residence of the mayor since [[Fiorello La Guardia]]'s administration in 1942. Its main floor is open to the public and serves as a small museum.\n\nThe mayor is entitled to a salary of [[United States dollar|$]]258,750 a year.<ref name=\"lwvnyc1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |title=League of Women Voters of the City of New York \u2013 About Us |publisher=Lwvnyc.org |accessdate=October 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231120643/http://www.lwvnyc.org/nycgovern.html |archivedate=December 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Michael Bloomberg]], mayor of the city from 2002 to 2013 and one of the richest people in the world,<ref name=Forbes>{{cite news|title=Forbes Profile|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/michael-bloomberg/|work=Forbes|accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref> declined the salary and instead was paid $1 yearly.\n\nIn 2000 direct control of the city's public school system was transferred to the mayor's office.

It played a major role in New York City politics into the 1960s and was a dominant player from the mayoral victory of [[Fernando Wood]] in 1854 through the era of [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.|Robert Wagner]] (1954\u20131965).\n\n== Deputies==\nThe mayor of New York City may appoint several deputy mayors to help oversee major offices within the executive branch of the city government. The powers and duties, and even the number of deputy mayors, are not defined by the City Charter. The post was created by Fiorello La Guardia (who appointed [[Grover Whalen]] as deputy mayor) to handle ceremonial events that the mayor was too busy to attend. Since then, deputy mayors have been appointed with their areas of responsibility defined by the appointing mayor. There are currently five deputy mayors, all of whom report directly to the mayor. \nDeputy mayors do not have any right to succeed to the mayoralty in the case of vacancy or incapacity of the mayor. (The order of succession is the [[New York City Public Advocate|Public Advocate of the City of New York]], then the [[New York City Comptroller|Comptroller of the City of New York]].<ref name=\"NYCRun\">{{cite book|title=What Makes New York City Run?

The Scandinavian variants are also known as ''futhark'' or ''fu\u00feark'' (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: ''[[Feoh|F]]'', ''[[Ur (rune)|U]]'', ''[[Thurisaz|\u00de]]'', ''[[Ansuz (rune)|A]]'', ''[[Raido|R]]'', and ''[[Kaunan|K]]''); the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] variant is ''[[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]'' or ''{{lang|ang|fu\u00feorc}}'' (due to sound-changes undergone in [[Old English]] by the names of those six letters).\n\n[[Runology]] is the study of the runic alphabets, [[runic inscriptions]], [[runestones]], and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] as the cultures that had used runes underwent [[Christianisation]], by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in [[northern Europe]]. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural [[Sweden]] for decorative purposes in [[Dalarna]] and on [[Runic calendar]]s.\n\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the [[Elder Futhark]] (around 150\u2013800 AD), the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]] (400\u20131100 AD), and the [[Younger Futhark]] (800\u20131100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called ''Danish'', although they were also used in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Frisia]]); short-branch or [[R\u00f6k Runestone|R\u00f6k runes]] (also called ''Swedish-Norwegian'', although they were also used in [[Denmark]]); and the ''{{lang|sv|stavl\u00f6sa}}'' or H\u00e4lsinge runes ([[staveless runes]]). The Younger Futhark developed further into the [[Medieval runes]] (1100\u20131500 AD), and the [[Dalecarlian runes]] ({{circa}} 1500\u20131800 AD).\n\nHistorically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the [[Old Italic script]]s of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic branch in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]], [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], or [[History of the Latin alphabet|Old Latin]] as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for [[epigraphy]], which would become characteristic of the runes.\n\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via [[Irminones|Elbe Germanic]] groups, while a \"[[Goths|Gothic]] hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic [[Chernyakhov culture|expansion]].\n\n==History and use==\n[[Image:R\u00f6kstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] in Sweden]]\n[[Image:Vaksalastenen.jpg|thumb|A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century [[Vaksala Runestone]] in Sweden]]\nThe runes were in use among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] from the 1st or 2nd century AD.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of [[Vimose]], [[Funen]], [[Denmark]].{{Sfn | Stoklund | 2003 | p  = 173}} The inscription reads {{lang|de|harja}}; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the [[Meldorf fibula]] in southern [[Jutland]].}}  This period corresponds to the late [[Common Germanic]] stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]].\n\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] and the [[Gothic alphabet]] as variants of ''p''; see {{lang|ang|[[peor\u00f0]]}}.)\n\nThe term ''runes'' is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek ''letters''. It is attested on a 6th-century [[Alamanni]]c runestaff as {{lang|goh|runa}} and possibly as {{lang|goh|runo}} on the 4th-century [[Einang stone]]. The name comes from the Germanic root {{lang|gem|run-}} ({{lang-got|\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf30}}, {{lang|got-Latn|runa}}), meaning \"secret\" or \"whisper\". In [[Old Irish|Old Irish Gaelic]], the word {{lang|sga|r\u00fan}} means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"intention\" or \"affectionate love.\" Similarly in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Old English]], the word {{lang|cy|rhin}} and {{lang|ang|r\u016bn}} respectively means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"secret writing\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \"miracle\" ({{lang|cy|gwyrth}}). [[Ogham]] is an older Celtic script from Ireland and Britain, similarly carved in to stone or wood. The root {{lang|bat|run-}} can also be found in the [[Baltic languages]], meaning \"speech\". In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], {{lang|lt|runoti}} means both \"to cut (with a knife)\" and \"to speak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lkz.lt/en/dze.htm |title=Dictionary of the Lithuanian Language |publisher=LKZ |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}</ref> According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|reu\u0259-}}'' \"dig\".<ref>Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache.

The historical context of the script's origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[Roman auxiliaries|Roman army]], and the Italian peninsula during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]] (1st century BC to 5th century AD).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the [[Kylver Stone]] being the first evidence of the ''futhark'' ordering as well as of the ''p'' rune.\n\n[[Image:Venetic Raetic Camunic Lepontic alphabets.png|thumb|upright 1.3|The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr\u00e8 and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic)]]\nSpecifically, the [[Old Italic script#Raetic alphabets|Raetic alphabet]] of [[Bolzano]] is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ({{script|Runr|\u16d6}} ''e'', {{script|Runr|\u16c7}} ''\u00ef'', {{script|Runr|\u16c3}} ''j'', {{script|Runr|\u16dc}} ''\u014b'', {{script|Runr|\u16c8}} ''p'') having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.{{Sfn | Mees | 2000}} Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the [[Latin alphabet]] itself over Raetic candidates.{{Sfn | Odenstedt | 1990}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1996}}<ref>{{Citation |url=http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |type=under preparation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623082749/http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |archivedate=2007-06-23 }}.</ref> A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the [[Negau helmet]] dating to the 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Markey|2001}} This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, {{Lang|gem|Harigast}}. Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]]: but since [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered [[Veneto]] after 200 BC, and then the [[Latin alphabet]] became prominent and [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] culture diminished in importance, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=VWGN6e5Rzf8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=runes+from+venetic+alphabet&source=bl&ots=OeW0SOpgNo&sig=MPh3Dia9tqPSdKyLUiADT3dGguI&hl=it&sa=X&ei=pBSIVYTzNanNygPEiL8o&ved=0CDwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=runes%20from%20venetic%20alphabet&f=false G. Bonfante, L. Bonfante, The Etruscan Language p. 119]</ref>\n\nThe angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no ''horizontal'' strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the [[Latin alphabet]] used for the [[Duenos inscription]], but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is ''written'' rather than carved runes, such as {{lang|la|[[Codex Runicus]]}}) also show horizontal strokes.\n\nThe \"[[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by [[West Germanic tribes]]. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around [[Jutland]] (the [[Vimose inscriptions]]), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars to be [[Proto-Norse]], are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as {{lang|gem|wagnija}}, {{lang|gem|ni\u00feijo}}, and {{lang|gem|harija}} are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be [[Vangiones]], the [[Nidensis]], and the [[Harii]] tribes located in the [[Rhineland]].{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} Since names ending in {{lang|gem|-io}} reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending {{lang|la|-ius}}, and the suffix {{lang|la|-inius}} was reflected by Germanic {{lang|gem|-inio-}},{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1968 |pp=135, 392ff }}{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1966\u20131967 | p = 207}} the question of the problematic ending {{lang|gem|-ijo}} in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of {{lang|gem|lagu\u00feewa}}{{Sfn | Syrett | 1994 | pp= 44ff}} may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a [[Northwest Germanic]] unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | {{Harvnb | Penzl | Hall | 1994a}} assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the [[Gallehus horns]] inscription.{{Sfn | Penzl | Hall | 1994b |p=186}}}}{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 | p=36}}}} An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by \u00c8. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic [[koine]]\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 |p=36}}\n\n===Early inscriptions===\n[[File:Pietroassa ring 1875.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ring of Pietroassa]] ({{circa|250\u2013400 AD}}) by Henri Trenk, 1875]]\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150\u2013550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in [[Elder Futhark]], but the set of letter shapes and [[bindrune]]s employed is far from standardized. Notably the ''[[j\u0113ran|j]]'', ''[[sowilo rune|s]]'', and ''[[\u16dc|\u014b]]'' runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as ''[[\u16c8|p]]'' and ''[[\u16c7|\u00ef]]'', remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the [[Kylver Stone]] ({{circa}} 400 AD).\n\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sj\u00e6lland, Jylland (Denmark), and Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden). Earlier\u2014but less reliable\u2014artifacts have been found in [[Meldorf]], S\u00fcderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the [[Meldorf fibula]], and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nTheories of the existence of separate [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the [[spearhead of Kovel]], with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped [[tiwaz rune|tiwaz]], and its rectangular [[dagaz]]). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the [[Alcuin]] manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century [[Ring of Pietroassa]].\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.<ref>{{Citation |quote=A likely theory is that the runic alphabet was developed by the Goths, a Germanic people, from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy and was perhaps also influenced by the Latin alphabet in the 1st or 2nd century BC |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512796/runic-alphabet |contribution=Runic alphabet|title-link=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}.</ref>\n\n===Magical or divinatory use===\n[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#G 205|G 205]]) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}} with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a [[swastika]], a common motif on bracteates]]\n[[File:Gummarpstenen.gif|thumb|An illustration of the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) from [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rketorpsstenen runor.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] located in [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n{{Main|Runic magic}}\nThe stanza 157 of {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}} attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life.

Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for [[divination]], there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name ''rune'' itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] warns in [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] using the word ''rune'' in both senses:\n{{Quote |{{lang|non|Haidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz.

There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the [[Franks Casket]] (AD 700) panel.\n\nCharm words, such as {{lang|non|auja}}, {{lang|non|la\u00feu}}, {{lang|non|lauka\u0280}}, and most commonly, {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}},{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=100\u201301}} appear on a number of [[Migration period]] Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as {{lang|non|salusalu}} and {{lang|non|luwatuwa}}. Further, an inscription on the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.{{Sfn|Page|2005 |p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although [[Old Norse language|Norse]] literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: [[Tacitus]]'s 1st-century {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]}}, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s 13th-century {{lang|non|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}, and [[Rimbert]]'s 9th-century {{lang|la|[[Vita Ansgari]]}}.\n\nThe first source, Tacitus's {{lang|la|Germania}}, describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings.  A second source is the {{lang|non|Ynglinga saga}}, where [[Granmar]], the king of {{lang|sv|[[S\u00f6dermanland]]|italic=no}}, goes to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] for the {{lang|non|[[bl\u00f3t]]|italic=no}}. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long ({{lang|non|F\u00e9ll honum \u00fe\u00e1 svo sp\u00e1nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa}}). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}} (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013 }}\n\nThe third source is Rimbert's {{lang|la|Vita Ansgari}}, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, [[Anund Uppsale]], first brings a Danish fleet to [[Birka]], but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking [[Birka]] would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a {{lang|non|hlautlein}} (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970|p=401}} would be used in the same manner as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}}.\n\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\n\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013}} but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\n===Medieval use===\n[[Image:CodexRunicus.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Codex Runicus]], a [[vellum]] manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the [[Scanian Law]], is written entirely in runes.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs [[Proto-Germanic]] evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent [[diphthong]]s unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect.\n\nNevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = McDermott\n|first1      = Larissa\n|year        = 2016\n|title       = Runes\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=8h08DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=%22Elder+Futhark+contains+a+total+of%22\n|publisher   = [[Lulu.com|Lulu Press]]\n|page        = 70\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9781365130724\n}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}} The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From {{circa}} 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language.\n\nSome later runic finds are on monuments ([[runestone]]s), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the [[Bryggen inscriptions]], were found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = William\n|first1      = Gareth\n|year        = 2007\n|title       = West over Sea: Studies in Scandinavian Sea-Borne Expansion and Settlement Before 1300\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=U-2vCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473&dq=%22rune-inscribed+sticks+from+bryggen%22\n|publisher   = [[Brill Publishers]]\n|page        = 473\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9789047421214\n}}</ref> These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature\u2014ranging from name tags, prayers (often in [[Latin]]), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n[[File:BM-ClogAlmanac.JPG|right|thumb|17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the [[runic calendar|clog almanacs]] (sometimes called ''Runic staff'', ''Prim'', or ''Scandinavian calendar'') of Sweden and [[Estonia]]. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\n===Runes in Eddic lore===\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin ({{lang-non|reginkunnr}}).

Stanza 138 describes how Odin received the runes through self-sacrifice:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Veit ek at ek hekk vindga mei\u00f0i a\nnetr allar n\u00edo,\ngeiri vnda\u00fer ok gefinn O\u00f0ni,\nsialfr sialfom mer,\na \u00feeim mei\u00fei, er mangi veit, hvers hann af r\u00f3tom renn.\n|\nI know that I hung on a windy tree\n[[numbers in Norse mythology|nine]] long nights,\nwounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,\nmyself to myself,\non that tree of which no man knows from where its roots run.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=34}}\n}}\n\nIn stanza 139, Odin continues:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|Vi\u00f0 hleifi mik seldo ne vi\u00fe hornigi,\nnysta ek ni\u00fer,\nnam ek vp rvnar,\nopandi nam,\nfell ek aptr \u00fea\u00f0an.\n|\nNo bread did they give me nor a [[drinking horn|drink from a horn]],\ndownwards I peered;\nI took up the runes,\nscreaming I took them,\nthen I fell back from there.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=34}}\n}}\n\nThis passage has been interpreted as a mythical representation of shamanic initial rituals in which the initiate must undergo a physical trial in order to receive mystic wisdom.<ref>{{Citation |last=Seigfried |first=Karl E.H. |date=Mar 2010 |contribution-url=http://www.norsemyth.org/2010/03/odin-runes-part-three.html |contribution=Odin & the Runes, Part Three |url=http://www.norsemyth.org/ |title=The Norse Mythology }}.</ref>\n\nIn the Poetic Edda poem {{lang|non|[[R\u00edgs\u00feula]]}} another origin is related of how the runic alphabet became known to humans. The poem relates how {{lang|non|[[R\u00edg (Norse god)|R\u00edg]]|italic=no}}, identified as {{lang|non|[[Heimdall]]|italic=no}} in the introduction, sired three sons\u2014{{lang|non|[[Thrall]]|italic=no}} (slave), {{lang|non|[[Churl]]|italic=no}} (freeman), and {{lang|non|[[Earl|Jarl]]|italic=no}} (noble)\u2014by human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, {{lang|non|R\u00edg|italic=no}} returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop {{lang|non|[[Olaus Magnus]]|italic=no}} recorded a tradition that a man named {{lang|non|[[Kettil Runske]]|italic=no}} had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\n==Runic alphabets==\n\n=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===\n[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] found on [[Jutland]], now Denmark]]\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing [[Proto-Norse]], consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an [[Norse clans#Runology|\u00c6tt]]. The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the [[Kylver Stone]] in [[Gotland]], Sweden.\n\nMost probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. [[Linguistic reconstruction|Reconstructed]] names in [[Proto-Germanic]] have been produced,{{by whom|date=July 2016}} based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the [[rune poem]]s and the linked names of the letters of the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letter /a/ was named from the runic [[Alphabet|letter]] [[Image:Runic letter ansuz.svg|20x16px]] called [[Ansuz (rune)|Ansuz]]. An asterisk before the rune names means that they are unattested reconstructions. The 24 Elder Futhark runes are:{{Sfn | Page | 2005 | pp= 8, 15\u201316}}\n{{Elder Futhark}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon runes (5th to 11th centuries) ===\n{{Main article|Anglo-Saxon runes}}\n[[Image:Anglosaxonrunes.svg|thumb|right|The Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]]\nThe futhorc (sometimes written \"fu\u00feorc\") are an extended alphabet, consisting of 29, and later 33 characters. It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in [[Frisia]] and later spread to [[England]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the [[Thames scramasax]], in the [[Vienna Codex (Anglo-Saxon)|Vienna Codex]], in [[Cotton Otho]] B.x ([[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]]) and on the [[Ruthwell Cross]].\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: {{script|Runr|\u16a0}} feoh, {{script|Runr|\u16a2}} ur, {{script|Runr|\u16a6}} \u00feorn, {{script|Runr |\u16a9}} os, {{script|Runr|\u16b1}} rad, {{script|Runr|\u16b3}} cen, {{script|Runr|\u16b7}} gyfu, {{script|Runr|\u16b9}} \u01bfynn, {{script|Runr|\u16bb}} h\u00e6gl, {{script|Runr|\u16be}} nyd, {{script|Runr |\u16c1}} is, {{script|Runr|\u16c4}} ger, {{script|Runr |\u16c7}} eoh, {{script|Runr |\u16c8}} peor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16c9}} eolh, {{script|Runr|\u16cb}} sigel, {{script|Runr|\u16cf}} tir, {{script|Runr|\u16d2}} beorc, {{script|Runr|\u16d6}} eh, {{script|Runr|\u16d7}} mann, {{script|Runr|\u16da}} lagu, {{script|Runr|\u16dd}} ing, {{script|Runr|\u16df}} \u0153thel, {{script|Runr|\u16de}} d\u00e6g, {{script|Runr|\u16aa}} ac, {{script|Runr|\u16ab}} \u00e6sc, {{script|Runr|\u16a3}} yr, {{script|Runr|\u16e1}} ior, {{script|Runr|\u16e0}} ear.\n\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include {{script|Runr|\u16e2}} cweor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16e3}} calc, {{script|Runr|\u16b8}} gar, and {{script|Runr|\u16e5}} stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in [[Pseudo-runes|manuscripts]]. Feoh, \u00feorn, and sigel stood for [f], [\u00fe], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [\u00f0], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters [[yogh]] and [[wynn]], which became [g] and [w] in [[Middle English]].\n\n===\"Marcomannic runes\" (8th to 9th centuries)===\n[[Image:Marcomannic.PNG|thumb| 310px|[[Marcomanni]]c runes]]\nA runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called ''De Inventione Litterarum'', ascribed to [[Hrabanus Maurus]] and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]] ([[Alemannia]], [[Bavaria]]). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the ''Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus'', and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the [[Marcomanni]], and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\n\n[[Wilhelm Grimm]] discussed these runes in 1821.<ref>{{Citation | last = Grimm | first = William | year = 1821 | author-link = Wilhelm Grimm | title = Ueber deutsche Runen |trans-title=Concerning German runes | language = German | chapter = 18 | pages = 149\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Younger Futhark}}\n[[Image:Yngre futharken.svg|thumb|280px|The [[Younger Futhark]]: long-branch runes and short-twig runes]]\n[[Image:Sigurd.svg|left|thumb|While also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century [[Sigurd stones#S\u00f6 101|Ramsung carving]] is a [[Sigurd stones|Sigurd stone]] that depicts the legend of [[Sigurd]].]]\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the [[Elder Futhark]], consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when [[Proto-Norse]] evolved into [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. They are found in Scandinavia and [[Viking Age]] settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\n===Medieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Medieval runes}}\n[[Image:Medeltida runor.svg|410px|right|thumb|[[Medieval runes]] ]]\n[[Image:Saleby kyrkklocka, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland.png|left|thumb|A church bell from Saleby, [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the [[Old Norse language]]. Dotted variants of [[voiceless]] signs were introduced to denote the corresponding [[voiced]] consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as ''s'', ''c'', and ''z'' often were used interchangeably.{{Sfn | Jacobsen | Moltke | 1942 | p = vii}}{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 20}}\n\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in [[Bergen (Norway)|Bergen]] since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called [[Bryggen inscriptions]]). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries. Indeed, some of the medieval runic inscriptions are written in Latin.\n\n===Dalecarlian runes (16th to 19th centuries)===\n{{Main article|Dalecarlian runes}}\n[[Image:Dalrunor.svg|410px|thumb|[[Dalecarlian runes]] ]]\nAccording to Carl-Gustav Werner, \"In the isolated province of [[Dalarna]] in Sweden a mix of runes and Latin letters developed.\"{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 7}}  The Dalecarlian runes came into use in the early 16th century and remained in some use up to the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brix |first=Lise |title=Isolated people in Sweden only stopped using runes 100 years ago |date=May 21, 2015 |url=http://sciencenordic.com/isolated-people-sweden-only-stopped-using-runes-100-years-ago |work=ScienceNordic}}</ref> Some discussion remains on whether their use was an unbroken tradition throughout this period or whether people in the 19th and 20th centuries learned runes from books written on the subject. The character inventory was used mainly for transcribing [[Elfdalian]].\n\n==Academic study==\n{{Main article |Runology}}\nThe modern study of runes was initiated during the Renaissance, by [[Johannes Bureus]] (1568\u20131652). Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] sense.\nThe study of runes was continued by [[Olof Rudbeck|Olof Rudbeck Sr]] (1630\u20131702) and presented in his collection ''Atlantica''. [[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the ''runstenar'' ([[runestone]]s).  From the  \"golden age of [[philology]]\" in the 19th century, runology formed a specialized branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\n==Body of inscriptions==\n{{Main article |Runic inscriptions}}\n[[Image:Kam-med-runer-fra-Vimose DO-4148 2000.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vimose inscriptions|Vimose Comb]] from the island of [[Funen]], Denmark, features the earliest known runic inscription (AD 150 to 200) and simply reads, \u16ba\u16a8\u16b1\u16c3\u16a8 \"Harja\", a male name.<ref>{{cite book | last= Looijenga |first= Tineke | title = Texts and Contexts of the Oldest Runic Inscriptions |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |year = 2003 | page = 160 |isbn= 978-90-04-12396-0}}</ref>]]\nThe largest group of surviving Runic inscription are [[Viking Age]] [[Younger Futhark]] runestones, commonly found in Denmark and Sweden.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = de Gruyter\n|first1      = Walter\n|year        = 2002\n|title       = The Nordic Languages, Volume 1\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=PBKxhq2p0PgC&pg=PA700&dq=%22Younger+Futhark+were+used+more%22\n|publisher   = \n|page        = 700\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9783110197051\n}}</ref> Another large group are medieval runes, most commonly found on small objects, often wooden sticks. The largest concentration of runic inscriptions are the [[Bryggen inscriptions]] found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], more than 650 in total. [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions number around 350, about 260 of which are from Scandinavia, of which about half are on [[bracteate]]s. [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main article|Modern runic writing}}\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century [[Viking revival]], in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]] ([[Gothicismus]]) and [[Germanic occultism]] in the 19th century, and in the context of the [[Fantasy]] genre and of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] in the 20th century.\n\n===Esotericism===\n\n==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism ====\n{{Further|Runosophy|Armanen runes|Wiligut runes|Runengymnastik}}\n[[File:EBay 025.jpg|thumb|Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in [[Parkend]], [[England]] ]]\n[[Image:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|thumb|180px|From 1933, [[Schutzstaffel unit insignia]] displayed two [[Sig Rune]]s]]\nThe pioneer of the ''[[Armanist]]'' branch of [[Ariosophy]] and one of the more important figures in [[esotericism in Germany and Austria]] in the late 19th and early 20th century was the [[Austria]]n occultist, mysticist, and [[v\u00f6lkisch]] author, [[Guido von List]]. In 1908, he published in ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"[[Armanen runes]]\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902.\nThe use of runes in [[Germanic mysticism]], notably List's \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"[[Wiligut runes]]\" by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], played a certain role in [[Nazi symbolism]]. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to [[Heinrich Himmler]], and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the [[SS-Ehrenring]], which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".\n\n====Modern neopaganism and esotericism====\nRunes are popular in [[Germanic neopaganism]], and to a lesser extent in other forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[New Age]] esotericism. Various systems of [[Runic divination]] have been published since the 1980s, notably by [[Ralph Blum]] (1982), [[Stephen Flowers]] (1984, onward), [[Stephan Grundy]] (1990), and [[Nigel Pennick]] (1995).\n\nThe [[Uthark theory]] originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by [[Sigurd Agrell]] in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist [[Thomas Karlsson]] popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\nThe [[Bluetooth]] logo is the combination of two runes of the [[Younger Futhark]], [[Haglaz]] and [[Berkanan]], equivalent to the letters \u00abH\u00bb and \u00abB\u00bb, that are the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand's]] name (''bluetooth'' in English), who was a king of Denmark from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]].\n[[File:BluetoothLogo.svg|thumb|224x224px|[[Bluetooth]] logo with the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand]].]]\n\n===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction===\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]. They also were used in the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but later were replaced by the [[Cirth]] rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, [[Khuzdul]].  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in [[fantasy literature]], but also in other forms of media such as [[video games]] (for example the 1992 video game ''[[Heimdall (video game)|Heimdall]]'' used it as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces).\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main article|Runic (Unicode block)}}\n[[File:Runen Schlagstempel.jpg|thumb|Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark]]\nRunic alphabets were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe [[Unicode block]] for Runic alphabets is U+16A0\u2013U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the [[Elder Futhark]], the [[Anglo-Frisian runes]], and the [[Younger Futhark]] long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"[[Universal Character Set characters|unification]]\".\n\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0\u2013U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB {{script|Runr|\u16eb}}, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC {{script|Runr|\u16ec}} and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED {{script|Runr|\u16ed}}), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern [[runic calendar]] staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic [[Arlaug]] Symbol U+16EE {{script|Runr|\u16ee}}, Runic [[Tvimadur]] Symbol U+16EF {{script|Runr|\u16ef}}, Runic [[Belgthor]] Symbol U+16F0 {{script|Runr|\u16f0}}). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to [[J. R. R.

The Scandinavian variants are also known as ''futhark'' or ''fu\u00feark'' (derived from their first six letters of the alphabet: ''[[Feoh|F]]'', ''[[Ur (rune)|U]]'', ''[[Thurisaz|\u00de]]'', ''[[Ansuz (rune)|A]]'', ''[[Raido|R]]'', and ''[[Kaunan|K]]''); the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] variant is ''[[Anglo-Saxon runes|futhorc]]'' or ''{{lang|ang|fu\u00feorc}}'' (due to sound-changes undergone in [[Old English]] by the names of those six letters).\n\n[[Runology]] is the study of the runic alphabets, [[runic inscriptions]], [[runestones]], and their history. Runology forms a specialised branch of [[Germanic linguistics]].\n\nThe earliest runic inscriptions date from around 150 AD. The characters were generally replaced by the [[Latin alphabet]] as the cultures that had used runes underwent [[Christianisation]], by approximately 700 AD in central Europe and 1100 AD in [[northern Europe]]. However, the use of runes persisted for specialized purposes in northern Europe. Until the early 20th century, runes were used in rural [[Sweden]] for decorative purposes in [[Dalarna]] and on [[Runic calendar]]s.\n\nThe three best-known runic alphabets are the [[Elder Futhark]] (around 150\u2013800 AD), the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc]] (400\u20131100 AD), and the [[Younger Futhark]] (800\u20131100 AD). The Younger Futhark is divided further into the long-branch runes (also called ''Danish'', although they were also used in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], and [[Frisia]]); short-branch or [[R\u00f6k Runestone|R\u00f6k runes]] (also called ''Swedish-Norwegian'', although they were also used in [[Denmark]]); and the ''{{lang|sv|stavl\u00f6sa}}'' or H\u00e4lsinge runes ([[staveless runes]]). The Younger Futhark developed further into the [[Medieval runes]] (1100\u20131500 AD), and the [[Dalecarlian runes]] ({{circa}} 1500\u20131800 AD).\n\nHistorically, the runic alphabet is a derivation of the [[Old Italic script]]s of antiquity, with the addition of some innovations. Which variant of the Old Italic branch in particular gave rise to the runes is uncertain. Suggestions include [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]], [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]], [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]], or [[History of the Latin alphabet|Old Latin]] as candidates. At the time, all of these scripts had the same angular letter shapes suited for [[epigraphy]], which would become characteristic of the runes.\n\nThe process of transmission of the script is unknown. The oldest inscriptions are found in Denmark and northern Germany. A \"West Germanic hypothesis\" suggests transmission via [[Irminones|Elbe Germanic]] groups, while a \"[[Goths|Gothic]] hypothesis\" presumes transmission via East Germanic [[Chernyakhov culture|expansion]].\n\n==History and use==\n[[Image:R\u00f6kstenen 1.JPG|thumb|An inscription using [[cipher runes]], the [[Elder Futhark]], and the [[Younger Futhark]], on the 9th-century [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] in Sweden]]\n[[Image:Vaksalastenen.jpg|thumb|A Younger Futhark inscription on the 12th-century [[Vaksala Runestone]] in Sweden]]\nThe runes were in use among the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic peoples]] from the 1st or 2nd century AD.{{Refn | group = \"lower-alpha\" | The oldest known runic inscription dates to around AD 150 and is found on a comb discovered in the bog of [[Vimose]], [[Funen]], [[Denmark]].{{Sfn | Stoklund | 2003 | p  = 173}} The inscription reads {{lang|de|harja}}; a disputed candidate for a 1st-century inscription is on the [[Meldorf fibula]] in southern [[Jutland]].}}  This period corresponds to the late [[Common Germanic]] stage linguistically, with a continuum of dialects not yet clearly separated into the three branches of later centuries: [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]], [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]], and [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]].\n\nNo distinction is made in surviving runic inscriptions between long and short vowels, although such a distinction was certainly present phonologically in the spoken languages of the time. Similarly, there are no signs for [[labialized velar consonant|labiovelars]] in the Elder Futhark (such signs were introduced in both the [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] and the [[Gothic alphabet]] as variants of ''p''; see {{lang|ang|[[peor\u00f0]]}}.)\n\nThe term ''runes'' is used to distinguish these symbols from Latin and Greek ''letters''. It is attested on a 6th-century [[Alamanni]]c runestaff as {{lang|goh|runa}} and possibly as {{lang|goh|runo}} on the 4th-century [[Einang stone]]. The name comes from the Germanic root {{lang|gem|run-}} ({{lang-got|\ud800\udf42\ud800\udf3f\ud800\udf3d\ud800\udf30}}, {{lang|got-Latn|runa}}), meaning \"secret\" or \"whisper\". In [[Old Irish|Old Irish Gaelic]], the word {{lang|sga|r\u00fan}} means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"intention\" or \"affectionate love.\" Similarly in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Old English]], the word {{lang|cy|rhin}} and {{lang|ang|r\u016bn}} respectively means \"mystery\", \"secret\", \"secret writing\", or sometimes in the extreme sense of the word, \"miracle\" ({{lang|cy|gwyrth}}). [[Ogham]] is an older Celtic script from Ireland and Britain, similarly carved in to stone or wood. The root {{lang|bat|run-}} can also be found in the [[Baltic languages]], meaning \"speech\". In [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], {{lang|lt|runoti}} means both \"to cut (with a knife)\" and \"to speak\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lkz.lt/en/dze.htm |title=Dictionary of the Lithuanian Language |publisher=LKZ |accessdate=2010-04-13 }}</ref> According to another theory, the Germanic root comes from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root *''{{PIE|reu\u0259-}}'' \"dig\".<ref>Friedrich Kluge, Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache.

Nykysuomen etymologinen sanakirja</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe runes developed centuries after the [[Old Italic alphabets]] from which they are probably historically derived.\nThe debate on the development of the runic script concerns the question regarding which of the Italic alphabets should be taken as their point of origin and which, if any, signs should be considered original innovations added to the letters found in the Italic scripts. The historical context of the script's origin is the cultural contact between Germanic people, who often served as [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the [[Roman auxiliaries|Roman army]], and the Italian peninsula during the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial period]] (1st century BC to 5th century AD).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The formation of the Elder Futhark was complete by the early 5th century, with the [[Kylver Stone]] being the first evidence of the ''futhark'' ordering as well as of the ''p'' rune.\n\n[[Image:Venetic Raetic Camunic Lepontic alphabets.png|thumb|upright 1.3|The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr\u00e8 and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic)]]\nSpecifically, the [[Old Italic script#Raetic alphabets|Raetic alphabet]] of [[Bolzano]] is often advanced as a candidate for the origin of the runes, with only five Elder Futhark runes ({{script|Runr|\u16d6}} ''e'', {{script|Runr|\u16c7}} ''\u00ef'', {{script|Runr|\u16c3}} ''j'', {{script|Runr|\u16dc}} ''\u014b'', {{script|Runr|\u16c8}} ''p'') having no counterpart in the Bolzano alphabet.{{Sfn | Mees | 2000}} Scandinavian scholars tend to favor derivation from the [[Latin alphabet]] itself over Raetic candidates.{{Sfn | Odenstedt | 1990}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1996}}<ref>{{Citation |url=http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |publisher=Oxford University Press |title=Dictionary of the Middle Ages |type=under preparation |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623082749/http://ariadne.uio.no/runenews/odmarune.htm |archivedate=2007-06-23 }}.</ref> A \"North Etruscan\" thesis is supported by the inscription on the [[Negau helmet]] dating to the 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Markey|2001}} This is in a northern Etruscan alphabet but features a Germanic name, {{Lang|gem|Harigast}}. Giuliano and Larissa Bonfante suggest that runes derived from some North Italic alphabet, specifically [[Old Italic alphabet#Venetic alphabet|Venetic]]: but since [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered [[Veneto]] after 200 BC, and then the [[Latin alphabet]] became prominent and [[Adriatic Veneti|Venetic]] culture diminished in importance, [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] people could have adopted the Venetic alphabet within the 3rd century BC or even earlier.<ref>[https://books.google.it/books?id=VWGN6e5Rzf8C&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=runes+from+venetic+alphabet&source=bl&ots=OeW0SOpgNo&sig=MPh3Dia9tqPSdKyLUiADT3dGguI&hl=it&sa=X&ei=pBSIVYTzNanNygPEiL8o&ved=0CDwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=runes%20from%20venetic%20alphabet&f=false G. Bonfante, L. Bonfante, The Etruscan Language p. 119]</ref>\n\nThe angular shapes of the runes are shared with most contemporary alphabets of the period that were used for carving in wood or stone. There are no ''horizontal'' strokes: when carving a message on a flat staff or stick, it would be along the grain, thus both less legible and more likely to split the wood. This characteristic is also shared by other alphabets, such as the early form of the [[Latin alphabet]] used for the [[Duenos inscription]], but it is not universal, especially among early runic inscriptions, which frequently have variant rune shapes, including horizontal strokes. Runic manuscripts (that is ''written'' rather than carved runes, such as {{lang|la|[[Codex Runicus]]}}) also show horizontal strokes.\n\nThe \"[[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] hypothesis\" speculates on an introduction by [[West Germanic tribes]]. This hypothesis is based on claiming that the earliest inscriptions of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, found in bogs and graves around [[Jutland]] (the [[Vimose inscriptions]]), exhibit word endings that, being interpreted by [[Scandinavia]]n scholars to be [[Proto-Norse]], are considered unresolved and long having been the subject of discussion. Inscriptions such as {{lang|gem|wagnija}}, {{lang|gem|ni\u00feijo}}, and {{lang|gem|harija}} are supposed to represent tribe names, tentatively proposed to be [[Vangiones]], the [[Nidensis]], and the [[Harii]] tribes located in the [[Rhineland]].{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} Since names ending in {{lang|gem|-io}} reflect Germanic morphology representing the Latin ending {{lang|la|-ius}}, and the suffix {{lang|la|-inius}} was reflected by Germanic {{lang|gem|-inio-}},{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1968 |pp=135, 392ff }}{{Sfn | Weisgerber | 1966\u20131967 | p = 207}} the question of the problematic ending {{lang|gem|-ijo}} in masculine Proto-Norse would be resolved by assuming Roman (Rhineland) influences, while \"the awkward ending -a of {{lang|gem|lagu\u00feewa}}{{Sfn | Syrett | 1994 | pp= 44ff}} may be solved by accepting the fact that the name may indeed be West Germanic\".{{Sfn | Looijenga | 1997}} In the early Runic period differences between Germanic languages are generally presumed to be small. Another theory presumes a [[Northwest Germanic]] unity preceding the emergence of Proto-Norse proper from roughly the 5th century.{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | {{Harvnb | Penzl | Hall | 1994a}} assume a period of \"Proto-Nordic-Westgermanic\" unity down to the 5th century and the [[Gallehus horns]] inscription.{{Sfn | Penzl | Hall | 1994b |p=186}}}}{{Refn |group=\"lower-alpha\" | The division between Northwest Germanic and Proto-Norse is somewhat arbitrary.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 | p=36}}}} An alternative suggestion explaining the impossibility of classifying the earliest inscriptions as either North or West Germanic is forwarded by \u00c8. A. Makaev, who presumes a \"special runic [[koine]]\", an early \"literary Germanic\" employed by the entire Late Common Germanic linguistic community after the separation of Gothic (2nd to 5th centuries), while the spoken dialects may already have been more diverse.{{Sfn | Antonsen | 1965 |p=36}}\n\n===Early inscriptions===\n[[File:Pietroassa ring 1875.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ring of Pietroassa]] ({{circa|250\u2013400 AD}}) by Henri Trenk, 1875]]\nRunic inscriptions from the 400-year period 150\u2013550 AD are described as \"Period I\". These inscriptions are generally in [[Elder Futhark]], but the set of letter shapes and [[bindrune]]s employed is far from standardized. Notably the ''[[j\u0113ran|j]]'', ''[[sowilo rune|s]]'', and ''[[\u16dc|\u014b]]'' runes undergo considerable modifications, while others, such as ''[[\u16c8|p]]'' and ''[[\u16c7|\u00ef]]'', remain unattested altogether prior to the first full futhark row on the [[Kylver Stone]] ({{circa}} 400 AD).\n\nArtifacts such as spear heads or shield mounts have been found that bear runic marking that may be dated to 200 AD, as evidenced by artifacts found across northern Europe in Schleswig (North Germany), Fyn, Sj\u00e6lland, Jylland (Denmark), and Sk\u00e5ne (Sweden). Earlier\u2014but less reliable\u2014artifacts have been found in [[Meldorf]], S\u00fcderdithmarschen, northern Germany; these include brooches and combs found in graves, most notably the [[Meldorf fibula]], and are supposed to have the earliest markings resembling runic inscriptions.\n\nTheories of the existence of separate [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes have been advanced, even identifying them as the original alphabet from which the Futhark were derived, but these have little support in archaeological findings (mainly the [[spearhead of Kovel]], with its right-to-left inscription, its T-shaped [[tiwaz rune|tiwaz]], and its rectangular [[dagaz]]). If there ever were genuinely Gothic runes, they were soon replaced by the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letters of the Gothic alphabet, however, as given by the [[Alcuin]] manuscript (9th century), are obviously related to the names of the Futhark. The names are clearly Gothic, but it is impossible to say whether they are as old as the letters themselves. A handful of Elder Futhark inscriptions were found in Gothic territory, such as the 3rd- to 5th-century [[Ring of Pietroassa]].\n\nThe ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' even suggests the original development of the runes may have been due to the Goths.<ref>{{Citation |quote=A likely theory is that the runic alphabet was developed by the Goths, a Germanic people, from the Etruscan alphabet of northern Italy and was perhaps also influenced by the Latin alphabet in the 1st or 2nd century BC |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |contribution-url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/512796/runic-alphabet |contribution=Runic alphabet|title-link=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica }}.</ref>\n\n===Magical or divinatory use===\n[[File:Brakteat von Djupbrunns.jpg|thumb|right|A [[bracteate]] ([[Alu (runic)#G 205|G 205]]) from approximately AD 400 that features the charm word {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}} with a depiction of a stylized male head, a horse, and a [[swastika]], a common motif on bracteates]]\n[[File:Gummarpstenen.gif|thumb|An illustration of the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) from [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rketorpsstenen runor.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup of the runic inscription found on the 6th- or 7th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] located in [[Blekinge]], Sweden]]\n{{Main|Runic magic}}\nThe stanza 157 of {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}} attribute to runes the power to bring that which is dead back to life.

Due to this, it is possible that the early runes were not used so much as a simple writing system, but rather as [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] signs to be used for charms. Although some say the runes were used for [[divination]], there is no direct evidence to suggest they were ever used in this way. The name ''rune'' itself, taken to mean \"secret, something hidden\", seems to indicate that knowledge of the runes was originally considered esoteric, or restricted to an elite. The 6th-century [[Bj\u00f6rketorp Runestone]] warns in [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]] using the word ''rune'' in both senses:\n{{Quote |{{lang|non|Haidzruno runu, falahak haidera, ginnarunaz.

I prophesy destruction / prophecy of destruction.<ref name=\"RUNDATADR360\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=DR 360 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref>}}\n\nThe same curse and use of the word, rune, is also found on the [[Stentoften Runestone]]. There also are some inscriptions suggesting a medieval belief in the magical significance of runes, such as the [[Franks Casket]] (AD 700) panel.\n\nCharm words, such as {{lang|non|auja}}, {{lang|non|la\u00feu}}, {{lang|non|lauka\u0280}}, and most commonly, {{lang|non|[[alu (runic)|alu]]}},{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=100\u201301}} appear on a number of [[Migration period]] Elder Futhark inscriptions as well as variants and abbreviations of them. Much speculation and study has been produced on the potential meaning of these inscriptions. Rhyming groups appear on some early bracteates that also may be magical in purpose, such as {{lang|non|salusalu}} and {{lang|non|luwatuwa}}. Further, an inscription on the [[Gummarp Runestone]] (500\u2013700 AD) gives a cryptic inscription describing the use of three runic letters followed by the Elder Futhark f-rune written three times in succession.{{Sfn|Page|2005 |p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, it has proven difficult to find unambiguous traces of runic \"oracles\": although [[Old Norse language|Norse]] literature is full of references to runes, it nowhere contains specific instructions on divination.  There are at least three sources on divination with rather vague descriptions that may, or may not, refer to runes: [[Tacitus]]'s 1st-century {{lang|la|[[Germania (book)|Germania]]}}, [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s 13th-century {{lang|non|[[Ynglinga saga]]}}, and [[Rimbert]]'s 9th-century {{lang|la|[[Vita Ansgari]]}}.\n\nThe first source, Tacitus's {{lang|la|Germania}}, describes \"signs\" chosen in groups of three and cut from \"a nut-bearing tree\", although the runes do not seem to have been in use at the time of Tacitus' writings.  A second source is the {{lang|non|Ynglinga saga}}, where [[Granmar]], the king of {{lang|sv|[[S\u00f6dermanland]]|italic=no}}, goes to [[Gamla Uppsala|Uppsala]] for the {{lang|non|[[bl\u00f3t]]|italic=no}}. There, the \"chips\" fell in a way that said that he would not live long ({{lang|non|F\u00e9ll honum \u00fe\u00e1 svo sp\u00e1nn sem hann mundi eigi lengi lifa}}). These \"chips\", however, are easily explainable as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}} (sacrificial chip), which was \"marked, possibly with sacrificial blood, shaken, and thrown down like dice, and their positive or negative significance then decided.\"{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013 }}\n\nThe third source is Rimbert's {{lang|la|Vita Ansgari}}, where there are three accounts of what some believe to be the use of runes for divination, but Rimbert calls it \"drawing lots\". One of these accounts is the description of how a renegade Swedish king, [[Anund Uppsale]], first brings a Danish fleet to [[Birka]], but then changes his mind and asks the Danes to \"draw lots\". According to the story, this \"drawing of lots\" was quite informative, telling them that attacking [[Birka]] would bring bad luck and that they should attack a Slavic town instead.  The tool in the \"drawing of lots\", however, is easily explainable as a {{lang|non|hlautlein}} (lot-twig), which according to Foote and Wilson{{Sfn|Foote|Wilson|1970|p=401}} would be used in the same manner as a {{lang|non|bl\u00f3tsp\u00e1nn}}.\n\nThe lack of extensive knowledge on historical use of the runes has not stopped modern authors from extrapolating entire systems of divination from what few specifics exist, usually loosely based on the reconstructed names of the runes and additional outside influence.\n\nA recent study of runic magic suggests that runes were used to create magical objects such as amulets,{{Sfn|MacLeod|Mees|2006}}{{Rp |needed=yes |date=March 2013}} but not in a way that would indicate that runic writing was any more inherently magical, than were other writing systems such as Latin or Greek.\n\n===Medieval use===\n[[Image:CodexRunicus.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Codex Runicus]], a [[vellum]] manuscript from approximately 1300 AD containing one of the oldest and best preserved texts of the [[Scanian Law]], is written entirely in runes.]]{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nAs [[Proto-Germanic]] evolved into its later language groups, the words assigned to the runes and the sounds represented by the runes themselves began to diverge somewhat and each culture would create new runes, rename or rearrange its rune names slightly, or stop using obsolete runes completely, to accommodate these changes. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has several runes peculiar to itself to represent [[diphthong]]s unique to (or at least prevalent in) the Anglo-Saxon dialect.\n\nNevertheless, that the Younger Futhark has 16 runes, while the Elder Futhark has 24, is not fully explained by the 600-some years of sound changes that had occurred in the North Germanic language group.<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = McDermott\n|first1      = Larissa\n|year        = 2016\n|title       = Runes\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=8h08DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA70&dq=%22Elder+Futhark+contains+a+total+of%22\n|publisher   = [[Lulu.com|Lulu Press]]\n|page        = 70\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9781365130724\n}}</ref>{{sps|date=February 2020}} The development here might seem rather astonishing, since the younger form of the alphabet came to use fewer different rune signs at the same time as the development of the language led to a greater number of different phonemes than had been present at the time of the older futhark. For example, voiced and unvoiced consonants merged in script, and so did many vowels, while the number of vowels in the spoken language increased. From {{circa}} 1100 AD, this disadvantage was eliminated in the medieval runes, which again increased the number of different signs to correspond with the number of phonemes in the language.\n\nSome later runic finds are on monuments ([[runestone]]s), which often contain solemn inscriptions about people who died or performed great deeds. For a long time it was presumed that this kind of grand inscription was the primary use of runes, and that their use was associated with a certain societal class of rune carvers.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, however, approximately 670 inscriptions, known as the [[Bryggen inscriptions]], were found in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]].<ref>{{cite book\n|last1       = William\n|first1      = Gareth\n|year        = 2007\n|title       = West over Sea: Studies in Scandinavian Sea-Borne Expansion and Settlement Before 1300\n|url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=U-2vCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA473&dq=%22rune-inscribed+sticks+from+bryggen%22\n|publisher   = [[Brill Publishers]]\n|page        = 473\n|access-date = 2018-05-22\n|isbn      = 9789047421214\n}}</ref> These inscriptions were made on wood and bone, often in the shape of sticks of various sizes, and contained inscriptions of an everyday nature\u2014ranging from name tags, prayers (often in [[Latin]]), personal messages, business letters, and expressions of affection, to bawdy phrases of a profane and sometimes even of a vulgar nature. Following this find, it is nowadays commonly presumed that, at least in late use, Runic was a widespread and common writing system.\n\n[[File:BM-ClogAlmanac.JPG|right|thumb|17th-century clog almanac collected by Sir Hans Sloane. Now in the collection of the British Museum]]\nIn the later Middle Ages, runes also were used in the [[runic calendar|clog almanacs]] (sometimes called ''Runic staff'', ''Prim'', or ''Scandinavian calendar'') of Sweden and [[Estonia]]. The authenticity of some monuments bearing Runic inscriptions found in Northern America is disputed; most of them have been dated to modern times.\n\n===Runes in Eddic lore===\nIn [[Norse mythology]], the runic alphabet is attested to a divine origin ({{lang-non|reginkunnr}}). This is attested as early as on the [[Noleby Runestone]] from {{circa|600 AD}} that reads {{lang|non|Runo fahi raginakundo toj[e'k]a...}}, meaning \"I prepare the suitable divine rune...\"<ref name=\"RUNDATAVG63\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 63 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> and in an attestation from the 9th century on the [[Sparl\u00f6sa Runestone]], which reads {{lang|non|Ok ra\u00f0 runa\u0280 \u00fea\u0280 r\u00e6gi[n]kundu}}, meaning \"And interpret the runes of divine origin\".<ref name=\"RUNDATVG119\">{{Citation |type=entry |contribution=Vg 119 |title=Rundata |edition=2.0 for Windows|title-link=Rundata }}.</ref> In the [[Poetic Edda]] poem {{lang|non|[[H\u00e1vam\u00e1l]]}}, Stanza 80, the runes also are described as {{lang|non|reginkunnr}}:\n{{Verse translation |lang=non\n|\u00deat er \u00fe\u00e1 reynt,\ner \u00fe\u00fa a\u00f0 r\u00fanum spyrr\ninum reginkunnum,\n\u00feeim er ger\u00f0u ginnregin\nok f\u00e1\u00f0i fimbul\u00feulr,\n\u00fe\u00e1 hefir hann bazt, ef hann \u00feegir.<ref name=\"H\u00e1vam\u00e1l\"/>\n|\nThat is now proved,\nwhat you asked of the runes,\nof the potent famous ones,\nwhich the great gods made,\nand the mighty sage stained,\nthat it is best for him if he stays silent.{{Sfn|Larrington|1999|p=25}}\n}}\n\nThe poem {{lang|non|H\u00e1vam\u00e1l}} explains that the originator of the runes was the major deity, [[Odin]].

The poem relates how {{lang|non|[[R\u00edg (Norse god)|R\u00edg]]|italic=no}}, identified as {{lang|non|[[Heimdall]]|italic=no}} in the introduction, sired three sons\u2014{{lang|non|[[Thrall]]|italic=no}} (slave), {{lang|non|[[Churl]]|italic=no}} (freeman), and {{lang|non|[[Earl|Jarl]]|italic=no}} (noble)\u2014by human women. These sons became the ancestors of the three classes of humans indicated by their names. When Jarl reached an age when he began to handle weapons and show other signs of nobility, {{lang|non|R\u00edg|italic=no}} returned and, having claimed him as a son, taught him the runes. In 1555, the exiled Swedish archbishop {{lang|non|[[Olaus Magnus]]|italic=no}} recorded a tradition that a man named {{lang|non|[[Kettil Runske]]|italic=no}} had stolen three rune staffs from Odin and learned the runes and their magic.\n\n==Runic alphabets==\n\n=== Elder Futhark (2nd to 8th centuries) ===\n[[Image:Inscription on Golden horn of Gallehus.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the Elder Futhark inscription on a replica of one of the 5th-century AD [[Golden Horns of Gallehus]] found on [[Jutland]], now Denmark]]\n{{Main article |Elder Futhark}}\nThe Elder Futhark, used for writing [[Proto-Norse]], consists of 24 runes that often are arranged in three groups of eight; each group is referred to as an [[Norse clans#Runology|\u00c6tt]]. The earliest known sequential listing of the full set of 24 runes dates to approximately AD 400 and is found on the [[Kylver Stone]] in [[Gotland]], Sweden.\n\nMost probably each rune had a name, chosen to represent the sound of the rune itself. The names are, however, not directly attested for the Elder Futhark themselves. [[Linguistic reconstruction|Reconstructed]] names in [[Proto-Germanic]] have been produced,{{by whom|date=July 2016}} based on the names given for the runes in the later alphabets attested in the [[rune poem]]s and the linked names of the letters of the [[Gothic alphabet]]. The letter /a/ was named from the runic [[Alphabet|letter]] [[Image:Runic letter ansuz.svg|20x16px]] called [[Ansuz (rune)|Ansuz]].

It was probably used from the 5th century onwards. There are competing theories as to the origins of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc. One theory proposes that it was developed in [[Frisia]] and later spread to [[England]],{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} while another holds that Scandinavians introduced runes to England, where the futhorc was modified and exported to Frisia.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some examples of futhorc inscriptions are found on the [[Thames scramasax]], in the [[Vienna Codex (Anglo-Saxon)|Vienna Codex]], in [[Cotton Otho]] B.x ([[Anglo-Saxon rune poem]]) and on the [[Ruthwell Cross]].\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon rune poem gives the following characters and names: {{script|Runr|\u16a0}} feoh, {{script|Runr|\u16a2}} ur, {{script|Runr|\u16a6}} \u00feorn, {{script|Runr |\u16a9}} os, {{script|Runr|\u16b1}} rad, {{script|Runr|\u16b3}} cen, {{script|Runr|\u16b7}} gyfu, {{script|Runr|\u16b9}} \u01bfynn, {{script|Runr|\u16bb}} h\u00e6gl, {{script|Runr|\u16be}} nyd, {{script|Runr |\u16c1}} is, {{script|Runr|\u16c4}} ger, {{script|Runr |\u16c7}} eoh, {{script|Runr |\u16c8}} peor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16c9}} eolh, {{script|Runr|\u16cb}} sigel, {{script|Runr|\u16cf}} tir, {{script|Runr|\u16d2}} beorc, {{script|Runr|\u16d6}} eh, {{script|Runr|\u16d7}} mann, {{script|Runr|\u16da}} lagu, {{script|Runr|\u16dd}} ing, {{script|Runr|\u16df}} \u0153thel, {{script|Runr|\u16de}} d\u00e6g, {{script|Runr|\u16aa}} ac, {{script|Runr|\u16ab}} \u00e6sc, {{script|Runr|\u16a3}} yr, {{script|Runr|\u16e1}} ior, {{script|Runr|\u16e0}} ear.\n\nExtra runes attested to outside of the rune poem include {{script|Runr|\u16e2}} cweor\u00f0, {{script|Runr|\u16e3}} calc, {{script|Runr|\u16b8}} gar, and {{script|Runr|\u16e5}} stan. Some of these additional letters have only been found in [[Pseudo-runes|manuscripts]]. Feoh, \u00feorn, and sigel stood for [f], [\u00fe], and [s] in most environments, but voiced to [v], [\u00f0], and [z] between vowels or voiced consonants. Gyfu and wynn stood for the letters [[yogh]] and [[wynn]], which became [g] and [w] in [[Middle English]].\n\n===\"Marcomannic runes\" (8th to 9th centuries)===\n[[Image:Marcomannic.PNG|thumb| 310px|[[Marcomanni]]c runes]]\nA runic alphabet consisting of a mixture of Elder Futhark with Anglo-Saxon futhorc is recorded in a treatise called ''De Inventione Litterarum'', ascribed to [[Hrabanus Maurus]] and preserved in 8th- and 9th-century manuscripts mainly from the southern part of the [[Carolingian Empire]] ([[Alemannia]], [[Bavaria]]). The manuscript text attributes the runes to the ''Marcomanni, quos nos Nordmannos vocamus'', and hence traditionally, the alphabet is called \"Marcomannic runes\", but it has no connection with the [[Marcomanni]], and rather is an attempt of Carolingian scholars to represent all letters of the Latin alphabets with runic equivalents.\n\n[[Wilhelm Grimm]] discussed these runes in 1821.<ref>{{Citation | last = Grimm | first = William | year = 1821 | author-link = Wilhelm Grimm | title = Ueber deutsche Runen |trans-title=Concerning German runes | language = German | chapter = 18 | pages = 149\u201359}}.</ref>\n\n===Younger Futhark (9th to 11th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Younger Futhark}}\n[[Image:Yngre futharken.svg|thumb|280px|The [[Younger Futhark]]: long-branch runes and short-twig runes]]\n[[Image:Sigurd.svg|left|thumb|While also featuring a runic inscription detailing the erection of a bridge for a loved one, the 11th-century [[Sigurd stones#S\u00f6 101|Ramsung carving]] is a [[Sigurd stones|Sigurd stone]] that depicts the legend of [[Sigurd]].]]\nThe Younger Futhark, also called Scandinavian Futhark, is a reduced form of the [[Elder Futhark]], consisting of only 16 characters. The reduction correlates with phonetic changes when [[Proto-Norse]] evolved into [[Old Norse language|Old Norse]]. They are found in Scandinavia and [[Viking Age]] settlements abroad, probably in use from the 9th century onward. They are divided into long-branch (Danish) and short-twig (Swedish and Norwegian) runes.  The difference between the two versions is a matter of controversy. A general opinion is that the difference between them was functional (viz., the long-branch runes were used for documentation on stone, whereas the short-twig runes were in everyday use for private or official messages on wood).\n\n===Medieval runes  (12th to 15th centuries)===\n{{Main article |Medieval runes}}\n[[Image:Medeltida runor.svg|410px|right|thumb|[[Medieval runes]] ]]\n[[Image:Saleby kyrkklocka, V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland.png|left|thumb|A church bell from Saleby, [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Sweden, containing a runic inscription from 1228 AD]]\nIn the Middle Ages, the Younger Futhark in Scandinavia was expanded, so that it once more contained one sign for each phoneme of the [[Old Norse language]]. Dotted variants of [[voiceless]] signs were introduced to denote the corresponding [[voiced]] consonants, or vice versa, voiceless variants of voiced consonants, and several new runes also appeared for vowel sounds. Inscriptions in medieval Scandinavian runes show a large number of variant rune forms, and some letters, such as ''s'', ''c'', and ''z'' often were used interchangeably.{{Sfn | Jacobsen | Moltke | 1942 | p = vii}}{{Sfn | Werner | 2004 | p = 20}}\n\nMedieval runes were in use until the 15th century. Of the total number of Norwegian runic inscriptions preserved today, most are medieval runes.  Notably, more than 600 inscriptions using these runes have been discovered in [[Bergen (Norway)|Bergen]] since the 1950s, mostly on wooden sticks (the so-called [[Bryggen inscriptions]]). This indicates that runes were in common use side by side with the Latin alphabet for several centuries.

Bureus viewed runes as holy or magical in a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] sense.\nThe study of runes was continued by [[Olof Rudbeck|Olof Rudbeck Sr]] (1630\u20131702) and presented in his collection ''Atlantica''. [[Anders Celsius]] (1701\u20131744) further extended the science of runes and travelled around the whole of Sweden to examine the ''runstenar'' ([[runestone]]s).

[[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon futhorc]] inscriptions number around 100 items.\n\n==Modern use==\n{{main article|Modern runic writing}}\nRunic alphabets have seen numerous uses since the 18th-century [[Viking revival]], in Scandinavian [[Romantic nationalism]] ([[Gothicismus]]) and [[Germanic occultism]] in the 19th century, and in the context of the [[Fantasy]] genre and of [[Germanic Neopaganism]] in the 20th century.\n\n===Esotericism===\n\n==== Germanic mysticism and Nazi symbolism ====\n{{Further|Runosophy|Armanen runes|Wiligut runes|Runengymnastik}}\n[[File:EBay 025.jpg|thumb|Runic script on an 1886 gravestone in [[Parkend]], [[England]] ]]\n[[Image:Flag Schutzstaffel.svg|thumb|180px|From 1933, [[Schutzstaffel unit insignia]] displayed two [[Sig Rune]]s]]\nThe pioneer of the ''[[Armanist]]'' branch of [[Ariosophy]] and one of the more important figures in [[esotericism in Germany and Austria]] in the late 19th and early 20th century was the [[Austria]]n occultist, mysticist, and [[v\u00f6lkisch]] author, [[Guido von List]]. In 1908, he published in ''[[Das Geheimnis der Runen]]'' (\"The Secret of the Runes\") a set of eighteen so-called, \"[[Armanen runes]]\", based on the Younger Futhark and runes of List's own introduction, which allegedly were revealed to him in a state of temporary blindness after cataract operations on both eyes in 1902.\nThe use of runes in [[Germanic mysticism]], notably List's \"Armanen runes\" and the derived \"[[Wiligut runes]]\" by [[Karl Maria Wiligut]], played a certain role in [[Nazi symbolism]]. The fascination with runic symbolism was mostly limited to [[Heinrich Himmler]], and not shared by the other members of the Nazi top echelon. Consequently, runes appear mostly in insignia associated with the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'', the paramilitary organization led by Himmler. Wiligut is credited with designing the [[SS-Ehrenring]], which displays a number of \"Wiligut runes\".\n\n====Modern neopaganism and esotericism====\nRunes are popular in [[Germanic neopaganism]], and to a lesser extent in other forms of [[Neopaganism]] and [[New Age]] esotericism. Various systems of [[Runic divination]] have been published since the 1980s, notably by [[Ralph Blum]] (1982), [[Stephen Flowers]] (1984, onward), [[Stephan Grundy]] (1990), and [[Nigel Pennick]] (1995).\n\nThe [[Uthark theory]] originally was proposed as a scholarly hypothesis by [[Sigurd Agrell]] in 1932.\nIn 2002, Swedish esotericist [[Thomas Karlsson]] popularized this \"Uthark\" runic row, which he refers to as, the \"night side of the runes\", in the context of modern occultism.\n\n=== Bluetooth ===\nThe [[Bluetooth]] logo is the combination of two runes of the [[Younger Futhark]], [[Haglaz]] and [[Berkanan]], equivalent to the letters \u00abH\u00bb and \u00abB\u00bb, that are the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand's]] name (''bluetooth'' in English), who was a king of Denmark from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]].\n[[File:BluetoothLogo.svg|thumb|224x224px|[[Bluetooth]] logo with the initials of [[Harald Bluetooth|Harald Bl\u00e5tand]].]]\n\n===J. R. R. Tolkien and contemporary fiction===\nIn [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (1937), the Anglo-Saxon runes are used on a map to emphasize its connection to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]]. They also were used in the initial drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but later were replaced by the [[Cirth]] rune-like alphabet invented by Tolkien, used to write the language of the Dwarves, [[Khuzdul]].  Following Tolkien, historical and fictional runes appear commonly in modern popular culture, particularly in [[fantasy literature]], but also in other forms of media such as [[video games]] (for example the 1992 video game ''[[Heimdall (video game)|Heimdall]]'' used it as \"magical symbols\" associated with unnatural forces).\n\n==Unicode==\n{{Main article|Runic (Unicode block)}}\n[[File:Runen Schlagstempel.jpg|thumb|Runic Steel Stamps, Elder Futhark]]\nRunic alphabets were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in September, 1999 with the release of version 3.0.\n\nThe [[Unicode block]] for Runic alphabets is U+16A0\u2013U+16FF. It is intended to encode the letters of the [[Elder Futhark]], the [[Anglo-Frisian runes]], and the [[Younger Futhark]] long-branch and short-twig (but not the staveless) variants, in cases where cognate letters have the same shape resorting to \"[[Universal Character Set characters|unification]]\".\n\nThe block as of Unicode 3.0 contained 81 symbols: 75 runic letters (U+16A0\u2013U+16EA), 3 punctuation marks (Runic Single Punctuation U+16EB {{script|Runr|\u16eb}}, Runic Multiple Punctuation U+16EC {{script|Runr|\u16ec}} and Runic Cross Punctuation U+16ED {{script|Runr|\u16ed}}), and three runic symbols that are used in early modern [[runic calendar]] staves (\"Golden number Runes\", Runic [[Arlaug]] Symbol U+16EE {{script|Runr|\u16ee}}, Runic [[Tvimadur]] Symbol U+16EF {{script|Runr|\u16ef}}, Runic [[Belgthor]] Symbol U+16F0 {{script|Runr|\u16f0}}). As of Unicode 7.0 (2014), eight characters were added, three attributed to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s mode of writing Modern English in Anglo-Saxon runes, and five for the \"cryptogrammic\" vowel symbols used in an inscription on the [[Franks Casket]].\n\n{{Unicode chart Runic}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bergakker inscription|Runic inscription in the Netherlands]]\n* [[Pentimal system]] of numerals\n* [[Runic magic]]\n* [[Runiform (disambiguation)]] for unrelated scripts sometimes described as \"runes\" or \"rune-like\"\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist | group = \"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin |2}}\n* {{Citation | first = Elmer H. | last = Antonsen | title = On Defining Stages in Prehistoric Germanic | journal = Language | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | year = 1965 | doi = 10.2307/411849 | jstor = 411849 }}.<!--\n* {{Citation | editor1-last = Bammesberger | editor1-first = A | editor2-first = G | editor2-last = Waxenberger | title = Das fu\u00feark und Seine Einzelsprachlichen Weiterentwicklungen | publisher = Walter de Gruyter | year = 2006 | isbn = 3-11-019008-7}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Blum | first = Ralph | year = 1932 | title = The Book of Runes \u2013 A Handbook for the use of Ancient Oracle: The Viking Runes | series = Oracle Books | publisher = St. Martin's Press | place = New York | isbn = 0-312-00729-9}}.\n* {{Citation | author-link = Erik Brate| last = Brate | first = Erik | year = 1922 | title = Sveriges Runinskrifter | url = http://www.runor.se/ | language = Swedish}}.\n* {{Citation | last = D\u00fcwel | first = Klaus | year = 2001 | title = Runenkunde | publisher = JB Metzler | language = German}}. -->\n* {{Citation | last1 = Foote | first1 = P.
