Their cousin George Cox staked an adjacent claim a few years later.\n\nIn 1788 Charles Prather purchased 481 acres from Friend Cox's heir, John Cox; by that year's end Alexander Wells, formerly of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and later of [[Cross Creek Township, Pennsylvania]], established a trading post (together with his Baltimore cousin Richard Owings). In 1791 the Ohio County Court incorporated the town around the post as \"Charlestown\" (after Prather's first name). On November 30, 1796 the Virginia General Assembly formed Brooke County, from parts of Ohio County, and designated \"Charlestown\" as the county seat. Across the Appalachian Continental Divide to the east in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County]], another Charlestown had previously been incorporated (it is now known as [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]]). In addition, [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] had been established at the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha rivers in 1788.\n\nAddressing this confusion, the Virginia General Assembly on December 28, 1816 changed the Brooke county seat's name from \"Charlestown\" to [[Wellsburg, West Virginia|Wellsburg]], supposedly to honor [[Charles Wells (West Virginia)|Charles Wells]], Prather's son-in-law.<ref>Nancy L.

It was under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for six years, but since December 17, 1817, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Virginia and later of West Virginia.<ref>Caldwell, p. 5</ref>\n\nThe first glass factory in Wellsburg was built in 1813, taking advantage of the relatively easy transportation on the [[Ohio River]]. When the National Road was built about five years later, its first crossing of the Ohio River was via a ferry further west. In 1818 [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] founded the first Virginia school west of the Appalachians, which the [[Virginia General Assembly]] chartered in 1840 as [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Brooke County's elected officials helped found the new state of [[West Virginia]], after their efforts to block secession failed at the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]]. Wellsburg received a new charter in 1866 from the newly established West Virginia legislature, and Samuel Marks became Wellsburg's first elected mayor.<ref>Caldwell, p. 4 et seq</ref>\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.

Their cousin George Cox staked an adjacent claim a few years later.\n\nIn 1788 Charles Prather purchased 481 acres from Friend Cox's heir, John Cox; by that year's end Alexander Wells, formerly of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and later of [[Cross Creek Township, Pennsylvania]], established a trading post (together with his Baltimore cousin Richard Owings). In 1791 the Ohio County Court incorporated the town around the post as \"Charlestown\" (after Prather's first name). On November 30, 1796 the Virginia General Assembly formed Brooke County, from parts of Ohio County, and designated \"Charlestown\" as the county seat. Across the Appalachian Continental Divide to the east in [[Jefferson County, West Virginia|Jefferson County]], another Charlestown had previously been incorporated (it is now known as [[Charles Town, West Virginia|Charles Town]]). In addition, [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] had been established at the confluence of the Elk and Kanawha rivers in 1788.\n\nAddressing this confusion, the Virginia General Assembly on December 28, 1816 changed the Brooke county seat's name from \"Charlestown\" to [[Wellsburg, West Virginia|Wellsburg]], supposedly to honor [[Charles Wells (West Virginia)|Charles Wells]], Prather's son-in-law.<ref>Nancy L.

It was under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania for six years, but since December 17, 1817, it has been under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Virginia and later of West Virginia.<ref>Caldwell, p. 5</ref>\n\nThe first glass factory in Wellsburg was built in 1813, taking advantage of the relatively easy transportation on the [[Ohio River]]. When the National Road was built about five years later, its first crossing of the Ohio River was via a ferry further west. In 1818 [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] founded the first Virginia school west of the Appalachians, which the [[Virginia General Assembly]] chartered in 1840 as [[Bethany College (West Virginia)|Bethany College]].\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Brooke County's elected officials helped found the new state of [[West Virginia]], after their efforts to block secession failed at the [[Virginia Secession Convention of 1861]]. Wellsburg received a new charter in 1866 from the newly established West Virginia legislature, and Samuel Marks became Wellsburg's first elected mayor.<ref>Caldwell, p. 4 et seq</ref>\n\nIn 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into [[civil township]]s, with the intention of encouraging local government.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, and act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest. The ship's crew cut down trees and placed them aboard ''Tirpitz'' to camouflage her.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The crew also frequently hid the entire ship from [[aerial reconnaissance]] and attacks inside a cloud of artificial fog, created using water and [[chlorosulfuric acid]].{{sfn|Hartl et. al.}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Nazi legacy found in Norwegian trees|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43727547|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=11 April 2018|last1=Amos|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> Additional anti-aircraft batteries were installed around the fjord, as were anti-torpedo nets and heavy booms in the entrance to the anchorage.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=19}} ''Tirpitz'' was known as the \"Lonely Queen of the North\" because she was so rarely deployed,<ref>Winston, George, (1 May 2018) \"[https://www.warhistoryonline.com/instant-articles/the-effects-of-the-lonely-queen.html The Effects of the Lonely Queen Still Seen Among the Trees of Norway]\", War History Online; accessed 2020.04.01.</ref> and life for her crew was very monotonous. Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting. The crew was primarily occupied with maintaining the ship and continuously manning anti-aircraft defences. Sports activities were organised to keep the crew occupied and physically fit.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=207}}\n\n=== Operations against Allied convoys ===\nSeveral factors hindered ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s freedom of operation in Norway. The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''. The two torpedo boats were also released from the operation.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} On 5&nbsp;March, [[Luftwaffe]] reconnaissance aircraft spotted PQ&nbsp;12 near [[Jan Mayen Island]]; the reconnaissance failed to note the battleship {{HMS|Duke of York|17|6}} or the battlecruiser {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}, both of which were escorting the convoy, along with four destroyers. Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April. On the night of 27\u201328 April, thirty-one Halifaxes and twelve [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]] attacked; five of the bombers were shot down. Another raid, composed of twenty-three Halifaxes and eleven Lancasters, took place the following night. Two of the bombers were shot down by the German anti-aircraft defences.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=162}}\n\nThe actions of ''Tirpitz'' and her escorting destroyers in March used up {{convert|8230|t|LT}} of [[fuel oil]], which greatly reduced the available fuel supply. It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated from [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port. Shortly after ''Tirpitz'' left Norway, the Soviet submarine [[Soviet submarine K-21|''K-21'']] fired two or four torpedoes at the ship, all of which missed.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}{{sfn|Polmar & Noot|pp=115\u2013116}} The Soviets claimed two hits on the battleship.{{sfn|Blair|p=644}} Swedish intelligence had meanwhile reported the German departures to the British [[Admiralty]], which ordered the convoy to disperse. Aware that they had been detected, the Germans aborted the operation and turned over the attack to [[U-boat]]s and the Luftwaffe. The scattered vessels could no longer be protected by the convoy escorts, and the Germans sank 21 of the 34 isolated transports. ''Tirpitz'' returned to [[Altafjord]] via the [[Lofoten Islands]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J19316, Norwegen, Schlachtschiff, Zerst\u00f6rer.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'', escorted by several destroyers, steaming in the [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] in October 1942]]\nFollowing ''R\u00f6sselsprung'', the Germans moved ''Tirpitz'' to [[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]] near Narvik. By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials. She conducted gunnery trials on 4&nbsp;January 1943 in [[Trondheim Fjord]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} On 21 February, Topp was promoted to [[Rear Admiral]] and was replaced by Captain [[Hans Karl Meyer|Hans Meyer]]; five days later the battleship ''Scharnhorst'' was ordered to reinforce the fleet in Norway. Vice Admiral [[Oskar Kummetz]] was given command of the warships stationed in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nBy the time ''Scharnhorst'' arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had temporarily ceased. To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on [[Spitzbergen]], which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German anti-aircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage anti-aircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. In late August the weather improved, allowing the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded causing superficial damage. Six planes were shot down in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=267\u2013268}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|p=28}} Goodwood IV followed on the 29th, with 34 bombers and 25 fighters from ''Formidable'' and ''Indefatigable''. Heavy fog prevented any hits from being scored.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s gunners shot down one [[Fairey Firefly|Firefly]] and a [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]]. The battleship expended 54&nbsp;rounds from her main guns, 161 from the 15&nbsp;cm guns and up to 20&nbsp;percent of her light anti-aircraft ammunition.{{sfn|Brown, ''Tirpitz''|p=39}}\n\n==== Operations Paravane and Obviate ====\n[[File:Tirpitz at Tromso fjord in November 1944.JPG|thumb|''Tirpitz'' at her mooring off the island of H\u00e5k\u00f8ya in November 1944|alt=Black and white aerial photograph showing a body of water with a large warship near the shore]]\n\n{{main|Operation Paravane|Operation Obviate}}\n\nThe ineffectiveness of the great majority of the strikes launched by the [[Fleet Air Arm]] in mid-1944 led to the task of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s destruction being transferred to the RAF's [[No. 5 Group RAF|No.&nbsp;5 Group]]. The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them. ''Tirpitz'' rapidly rolled over and buried her superstructure in the sea floor.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}\n\n[[File:Troms\u00f6, Royal Air Force Bomber Command, 1942-1945 CL2830.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' capsized]]\nIn the aftermath of the attack, 82 men trapped in the upturned hull were rescued by cutting through the exposed bottom.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Figures for the death toll vary from approximately 950 to 1,204.{{efn|John Sweetman states that 1,000 out of a crew of 1,900 were killed,{{sfn|Sweetman|p=248}} while Niklas Zetterling and Michael Tamelander estimated nearly 1,000 deaths.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|p=327}} Siegfried Breyer and [[Erich Gr\u00f6ner]] agree on 1,204 deaths,{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}}{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and Gordon Williamson gives the death toll at 971.{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} William Dulin and Robert Dulin place the number of deaths at \"about 950\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=273}}}} Approximately 200 survivors of the sinking were transferred to the heavy cruiser ''L\u00fctzow'' in January 1945.{{sfn|Prager|p=287}}\n\nThe performance of the Luftwaffe in the defence of ''Tirpitz'' was heavily criticised after her loss. Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested.

Named after Grand Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the architect of the [[Imperial German Navy|''Kaiserliche Marine'']] (Imperial Navy), the ship was laid down at the [[Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven]] in November 1936 and her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was launched two and a half years later. Work was completed in February 1941, when she was commissioned into the German fleet. Like her sister ship {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, ''Tirpitz'' was armed with a main battery of eight {{convert|38|cm|adj=on}} [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|guns]] in four twin [[Gun turret|turrets]]. After a series of wartime modifications she was 2000 tonnes heavier than ''Bismarck'', making her the heaviest battleship ever built by a European navy.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=203}}\n\nAfter completing [[sea trial]]s in early 1941, ''Tirpitz'' briefly served as the centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the [[Soviet Baltic Fleet#Great Patriotic War|Soviet Baltic Fleet]]. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway to act as a deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, ''Tirpitz'' was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the [[St Nazaire Raid]] had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. ''Tirpitz'' acted as a [[fleet in being]], forcing the British [[Royal Navy]] to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.{{sfn|Kemp|p=153}}\n\nIn September 1943, ''Tirpitz'', along with the battleship {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, bombarded Allied positions on [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]], the only time the ship used her main battery in an offensive role. Shortly thereafter, the ship was damaged in [[Operation Source|an attack by British mini-submarines]] and subsequently subjected to a series of large-scale air raids. On 12 November 1944, British [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] equipped with {{convert|12000|lb|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|\"Tallboy\" bombs]] scored two direct hits and a near miss which caused the ship to [[capsize]] rapidly. A deck fire spread to the ammunition magazine for one of the main battery turrets, which caused a large explosion. Figures for the number of men killed in the attack range from 950 to 1,204. Between 1948 and 1957, the wreck was broken up by a joint Norwegian and German salvage operation.\n\n== Design ==\n{{main|Bismarck-class battleship}}\n\nThe two {{sclass-|Bismarck|battleship}}s were designed in the mid-1930s by the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' as a counter to French naval expansion, specifically the two {{sclass-|Richelieu|battleship|1}}s France had started in 1935. Laid down after the signing of the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935, ''Tirpitz'' and her [[sister ship|sister]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} were nominally within the {{convert|35000|LT|adj=on}} limit imposed by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington regime]] that governed battleship construction in the [[interwar period]]. The ships secretly exceeded the figure by a wide margin, though before either vessel was completed, the international treaty system had fallen apart following Japan's withdrawal in 1937, allowing signatories to invoke an \"escalator clause\" that permitted displacements as high as {{convert|45000|LT}}.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=203\u2013208}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz-1.jpg|thumb|left|Recognition drawing prepared by the US Navy]]\n\n''Tirpitz'' [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{cvt|42900|t|LT|lk=on}} [[Standard displacement|as built]] and {{cvt|52600|t|LT}} [[Full-load displacement|fully loaded]], with a length of {{convert|251|m|ftin|abbr=on}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|36|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a maximum [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|10.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}.{{efn|According to naval historians Gerhard Koop and Klaus-Peter Schmolke, ''Tirpitz'' displaced {{convert|53,500|t|LT}} at full load in 1944.{{sfn|Koop & Schmolke|p=18}}}} Her standard crew numbered 103 officers and 1,962 enlisted men; during the war this was increased to 108 officers and 2,500 men. She was powered by three [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, each driving a [[screw propeller]], with steam provided by twelve oil-fired Wagner superheated [[water-tube boiler]]s. Her propulsion system developed a total of {{convert|163023|PS|shp kW|lk=on|abbr=on}} and yielded a maximum speed of {{convert|30.8|kn}} on speed trials.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|pp=33, 35}}\n\nShe was armed with eight [[38 cm SK C/34 naval gun|38&nbsp;cm SK C/34]] L/52 guns arranged in four twin [[gun turret]]s: two [[superfire|superfiring]] turrets forward\u2014Anton and Bruno\u2014and two aft\u2014Caesar and Dora.{{efn|SK stands for ''Schiffskanone'' (ship's gun), C/34 stands for ''Constructionjahr'' (Construction year) 1934, and L/52 denotes the length of the gun in terms of [[Caliber (artillery)|calibres]], meaning that the gun is 52 times long as it is in internal diameter.{{sfn|Campbell|p=219}}}} Her secondary armament consisted of twelve [[15 cm SK C/28|15&nbsp;cm L/55]] guns, sixteen [[10.5&nbsp;cm FlaK 38|10.5&nbsp;cm L/65]] and sixteen [[3.7 cm SK C/30|{{convert|3.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}]] L/83, and initially twelve [[2 cm FlaK 30|{{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} C/30]] anti-aircraft guns. The number of 2&nbsp;cm guns was eventually increased to 58. After 1942, eight {{convert|53.3|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} above-water [[torpedo tube]]s were installed in two quadruple mounts, one mount on each side of the ship.{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=35}} \n\nAs built, ''Tirpitz'' was equipped with Model 23 search radars{{efn|Named FuMO for ''Funkmessortungsger\u00e4t'' (Radio direction-finding device).{{sfn|Williamson|p=42}}}} mounted on the forward, foretop, and rear rangefinders. These were later replaced with Model 27 and then Model 26 radars, which had a larger antenna array. A Model 30 radar, known as the ''[[FuG 200 Hohentwiel|Hohentwiel]]'', was mounted in 1944 in her topmast, and a Model 213 ''[[W\u00fcrzburg radar|W\u00fcrzburg]]'' fire-control radar was added on her stern {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} Flak rangefinders.{{sfn|Williamson|p=43}}\n\nThe ship's [[belt armour|main belt]] was {{convert|320|mm|abbr=on}} thick and was covered by a pair of upper and main armoured decks that were {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|100|to|120|mm|abbr=on}} thick, respectively.

While the ship was in Kiel, Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]]. A temporary Baltic Fleet was created to prevent the breakout of the Soviet fleet based in [[Leningrad]]. ''Tirpitz'' was briefly made the [[flagship]] of the squadron, which consisted of the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}}, the [[light cruiser]]s {{ship|German cruiser|K\u00f6ln||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|N\u00fcrnberg||2}}, {{ship|German cruiser|Leipzig||2}}, and {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}, several destroyers, and two flotillas of [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=247}} The Baltic Fleet, under the command of [[Vizeadmiral|Vice Admiral]] [[Otto Ciliax]],{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=239}} patrolled off the [[Aaland Islands]] from 23 to 26 September 1941, after which the unit was disbanded and ''Tirpitz'' resumed training.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=247\u2013248}} During the training period, ''Tirpitz'' tested her primary and secondary guns on the old [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] {{SMS|Hessen||2}},{{sfn|Sweetman|p=11}} which had been converted into a radio-controlled [[target ship]].{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=20}} The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) continued to launch unsuccessful bombing raids on ''Tirpitz'' while she was stationed in Kiel.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}}\n\n=== Deployment to Norway ===\n[[File:Tirpitz camouflaged.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' camouflaged in the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]]]]\nGrand Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], the commander of the ''Kriegsmarine'', proposed on 13 November that ''Tirpitz'' be deployed to Norway. The ship would be able to attack convoys bound for the Soviet Union, and act as a [[fleet in being]] to tie down British naval assets and deter an Allied invasion of Norway. Hitler, who had forbidden an Atlantic sortie after the loss of ''Bismarck'', agreed to the proposal. The ship was taken into dock for modifications for the deployment. The ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened, and the 10.5&nbsp;cm guns on the superstructure next to the [[Aircraft catapult#Interwar and World War II|catapult]] were moved outboard to increase their field of fire. The two quadruple 53.3&nbsp;cm torpedo tube mounts were also installed during this refit.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} The ship's commander, ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]] (KzS\u2013Captain at Sea)'' [[Karl Topp]],{{sfn|Williamson|p=40}} pronounced the ship ready for combat operations on 10 January 1942.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=12}} The following day, ''Tirpitz'' left for Wilhelmshaven, a move designed to conceal her actual destination.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}}\n\nThe ship left Wilhelmshaven at 23:00 on 14 January and made for [[Trondheim]].{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=248}} British military intelligence, which was capable of decrypting the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] messages sent by the German navy, detected the departure of the vessel, but poor weather in Britain prevented action by the RAF.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=16}} Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]], the commander in chief of the British [[Home Fleet]], was not made aware of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s activities until 17 January, well after the ship had arrived in Norway.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=17}} On 16 January, British aerial reconnaissance located the ship in Trondheim. ''Tirpitz'' then moved to the [[F\u00e6ttenfjord]], just north of Trondheim.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=248\u2013250}} The movement was codenamed Operation ''Polarnacht'' (Polar Night); the battleship was escorted by the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z4 Richard Beitzen||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z5 Paul Jakobi||2}}, {{ship|German destroyer|Z8 Bruno Heinemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z29||2}} for the voyage.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} The [[Norwegian resistance movement]] transmitted the location to London.{{sfn|Ottosen|pp=39\u201341}} She was moored next to a cliff, which protected the ship from air attacks from the southwest.

Frequent fuel shortages curtailed training and kept the battleship and her escorts moored behind their protective netting.

The most pressing were shortages of fuel and the withdrawal of the German destroyer forces to support [[Operation Cerberus]], the movement of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the heavy cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the [[English Channel]]. These caused a planned attack against the outbound [[convoy PQ 8]] at the end of January to be abandoned.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} A planned British air attack at the end of January by four-engined heavy bombers was disrupted by poor weather over the target, which prevented the aircraft from finding the ship.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=23\u201324}} In early February, ''Tirpitz'' took part in the deceptions that distracted the British in the run-up to Operation ''Cerberus''. These included steaming out of the fjord and the appearance of preparations for a sortie into the [[North Sea]].{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=24\u201325}} Later that month, the ship was reinforced by the heavy cruisers ''Admiral Scheer'' and ''Prinz Eugen'' and several destroyers. ''Prinz Eugen'' had been torpedoed by a British submarine at the entrance to the F\u00e6ttenfjord, and was temporarily out of action.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n[[File:Tirpitz early.jpg|thumb|left|''Tirpitz'' under way, probably in 1941]]\nIn March 1942 ''Tirpitz'' and ''Admiral Scheer'', along with the destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z14 Friedrich Ihn||2}}, ''Z5 Paul Jakobi'', {{ship|German destroyer|Z7 Hermann Schoemann||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z25||2}} and a pair of [[torpedo boat]]s,{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=240}} were intended to attack the homebound convoy QP&nbsp;8 and the outbound [[Convoy PQ 12]] as part of [[Operation Sportpalast|''Unternehmen Sportpalast'']] (Operation Sports Palace).{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}}{{sfn|Sweetman|p=27}} ''Admiral Scheer'',{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} with a design speed of {{convert|26|kn}},{{sfn|Gr\u00f6ner|p=60}} was too slow to operate with ''Tirpitz'' and was left in port,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} as was the destroyer ''Paul Jakobi''.

Unknown to the Germans, Admiral Tovey was providing distant support to the convoys with the battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Victorious|R38|6}}, the heavy cruiser {{HMS|Berwick|65|6}}, and six destroyers. Enigma intercepts again forewarned the British of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s attack, which allowed them to reroute the convoys. Admiral Tovey attempted to pursue ''Tirpitz'' on 9&nbsp;March,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=250}} but Admiral Otto Ciliax, the commander of the German squadron, had decided to return to port the previous evening. An air attack was launched early on the 9th; twelve [[Fairey Albacore]] torpedo bombers attacked the ship in three groups, and ''Tirpitz'' successfully evaded the torpedoes. Only three men were wounded in the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=250\u2013251}} ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft gunners shot down two of the British aircraft.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=149}} After the conclusion of the attack, ''Tirpitz'' made for [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjord]], and from there to Trondheim, arriving on the evening of 13 March.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} On 30 March, thirty-three [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax bombers]] attacked the ship; they scored no hits, and five aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Rohwer|p=156}} The RAF launched a pair of unsuccessful strikes in late April.

It took the Germans three months to replenish the fuel spent in the attempt to intercept the two Allied convoys. [[Convoy PQ 17]], which left Iceland on 27 June bound for the Soviet Union, was the next convoy targeted by ''Tirpitz'' and the rest of the German fleet stationed in Norway,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} during [[Operation R\u00f6sselsprung (1942)|''Unternehmen R\u00f6sselsprung'']] ([[Knight (chess)#Movement|Operation Knight's Move]]).{{sfn|Sweetman|p=54}} Escorting the convoy were the battleships ''Duke of York'' and {{USS|Washington|BB-56|6}} and the carrier ''Victorious''.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=253}} ''Tirpitz'', {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}}, and six destroyers sortied from Trondheim, while a second task force consisting of {{ship|German cruiser|L\u00fctzow|1940|2}}, ''Admiral Scheer'', and six destroyers operated out of [[Narvik]] and Bogenfjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=253\u2013255}} ''L\u00fctzow'' and three of the destroyers struck uncharted rocks while en route to the rendezvous and had to return to port.

By this time, the ship needed a major overhaul. Hitler had forbidden the ship to make the dangerous return to Germany, and so the overhaul was conducted in Trondheim. On 23 October, the ship left Bogenfjord and returned to F\u00e6ttenfjord outside Trondheim. The defences of the anchorage were further strengthened; additional anti-aircraft guns were installed, and double anti-torpedo nets were laid around the vessel. The repairs were conducted in limited phases, so ''Tirpitz'' would remain partially operational for the majority of the overhaul. A [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]] was built around the stern to allow the replacement of the ship's rudders.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=255}} During the repair process, the British attempted to attack the battleship with two [[Chariot manned torpedo|Chariot]] [[human torpedo]]es, but before they could be launched, rough seas caused them to break away from the fishing vessel which was towing them.{{sfn|Bishop|pp=165\u2013172}} By 28 December, the overhaul had been completed, and ''Tirpitz'' began sea trials.

To give the ships an opportunity to work together, Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], who had replaced Raeder in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Barents Sea]] on 31 December 1942, ordered [[Operation Zitronella|an attack]] on [[Spitzbergen]], which housed a British weather station and refuelling base.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Spitzbergen was defended by a garrison of 152 men from the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]].{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}} The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6&nbsp;September; in a [[Ruse of war|''ruse de guerre'']], ''Tirpitz'' flew the [[white ensign]] on the approach to the island the following day.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=76}} During the bombardment, ''Tirpitz'' fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15&nbsp;cm secondaries.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=77}} This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners.{{sfn|Torkildsen|p=221}}{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=76\u201377}} By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets and headed back to their Norwegian ports.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}}\n\n=== British attacks on ''Tirpitz'' ===\n[[File:Tirpitz altafjord 2.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' in the [[Ofotfjord]]/[[Bogen, Evenes|Bogenfjord]]]]\n{{see also|List of Allied attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz}}\n\n==== Operation Source ====\n{{main|Operation Source}}\n\nThe British were determined to neutralise ''Tirpitz'' and remove the threat she posed to the [[Arctic convoys of World War II|Allied arctic convoys]]. Following the repeated, ineffectual bombing attacks and the failed Chariot attack in October 1942, the British turned to the newly designed [[X-class submarine|X Craft]] [[midget submarine]]s.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} The planned attack, [[Operation Source]], included attacks on ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'', and ''L\u00fctzow''.{{sfn|Zetterling & Tamelander|pp=195\u2013196}} The X&nbsp;Craft were towed by large submarines to their destinations, where they could slip under anti-torpedo nets and each drop two powerful two-tonne [[naval mine|mines]] onto the sea bed under the target. Ten vessels were assigned to the operation, scheduled for 20\u201325 September 1943. Only eight of them reached [[K\u00e5fjorden (Alta)|K\u00e5fjord]] in Norway for the attack, which began early on 22 September.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=258}} Three of the vessels, ''X5'', ''X6'', and ''X7'', successfully breached ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s defences, two of which\u2014''X6'' and ''X7''\u2014managed to lay their mines. ''X5'' was detected {{convert|200|m|abbr=on}} from the nets and sunk by a combination of gunfire and depth charges.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\nThe mines caused extensive damage to the ship; the first exploded abreast of turret Caesar, and the second detonated {{convert|45|to|55|m|abbr=on}} off the port bow.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=259}} A fuel oil tank was ruptured, shell plating was torn, a large indentation was formed in the bottom of the ship, and bulkheads in the [[double bottom]] buckled. Some {{convert|1430|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship in fuel tanks and void spaces in the double bottom of the port side, which caused a [[List (watercraft)|list]] of one to two degrees, which was balanced by counter-flooding on the starboard side. The flooding damaged all of the turbo-generators in generator room No. 2, and all apart from one generator in generator room No.&nbsp;1 were disabled by broken steam lines or severed power cables. Turret Dora was thrown from its bearings and could not be rotated; this was particularly significant, as there were no heavy-lift cranes in Norway powerful enough to lift the turret and place it back on its bearings.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=259\u2013261}} The ship's two [[Arado Ar 196]] floatplanes were completely destroyed. Repairs were conducted by the repair ship {{ship|German repair ship|Neumark||2}}; historians [[William Garzke]] and [[Robert Dulin]] remarked that the successful repair effort was \"one of the most notable feats of naval engineering during the Second World War\".{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=262}} Repairs lasted until 2&nbsp;April 1944; full speed trials were scheduled for the following day in Altafjord.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}}\n\n==== Operation Tungsten ====\n[[File:Fleet Air Arm attack the battleship Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' under attack by British carrier aircraft on 3 April 1944]]\n{{main|Operation Tungsten}}\n\nThe British were aware that ''Neumark'' and the repair crews left in March, which intimated ''Tirpitz'' was nearly operational.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} A major air strike\u2014[[Operation Tungsten]]\u2014involving the fleet carriers ''Victorious'' and {{HMS|Furious|47|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Emperor|D98|2}}, {{HMS|Fencer|D64|2}}, {{HMS|Pursuer|D73|2}}, and {{HMS|Searcher|D40|2}},{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} was set for 4&nbsp;April 1944, but rescheduled a day earlier when Enigma decrypts revealed that ''Tirpitz'' was to depart at 05:29 on 3&nbsp;April for sea trials.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=264}} The attack consisted of 40 [[Fairey Barracuda|Barracuda]] dive-bombers carrying {{convert|1600|lb|adj=on}} armour-piercing bombs and 40 escorting fighters in two waves, scoring fifteen direct hits and two near misses.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}}{{sfn|Brown, ''Carrier Operations''|pp=25, 27}} The aircraft achieved surprise, and only one was lost in the first wave; it took twelve to fourteen minutes for all of ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s anti-aircraft batteries to be fully manned. The first wave struck at 05:29, as tugs were preparing to assist the ship out of her mooring. The second wave arrived over the target an hour later, shortly after 06:30. Despite the alertness of the German anti-aircraft gunners, only one other bomber was shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}}\n\nThe air strikes did not penetrate the main armour but nonetheless caused significant damage to the ship's superstructure and inflicted serious casualties. [[William Garzke]] and Robert Dulin report the attack killed 122 men and wounded 316 others,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=265}} while Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz report 132 fatalities and 270 wounded men, including the ship's commander, ''KzS'' Hans Meyer.{{sfn|Hildebrand R\u00f6hr & Steinmetz|p=243}} Two of the 15&nbsp;cm turrets were destroyed by bombs, and both Ar 196 floatplanes were destroyed. Several of the bomb hits caused serious fires aboard the ship. Concussive shock disabled the starboard turbine engine, and saltwater used to fight the fires reached the boilers and contaminated the feed water. Some {{convert|2000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the ship, primarily through the two holes in the side shell created by shell splinters from near misses. Water used to fight the fires also contributed to the flooding.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|pp=265\u2013267}} D\u00f6nitz ordered the ship be repaired, regardless of the cost, despite the fact that he understood ''Tirpitz'' could no longer be used in a surface action because of insufficient fighter support. Repair work began in early May; destroyers ferried important equipment and workers from Kiel to Altafjord over the span of three days. By 2&nbsp;June, the ship was again able to steam under her own power, and by the end of the month gunnery trials were possible. During the repair process, the 15&nbsp;cm guns were modified to allow their use against aircraft, and specially-fuzed 38&nbsp;cm shells for barrage anti-aircraft fire were supplied.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}}\n\n==== Operations Planet, Brawn, Tiger Claw, Mascot and Goodwood ====\n[[File:German battleship Tirpitz partly covered by a smokescreen at Kaafjord A22634.jpg|thumb|''Tirpitz'' moored in Kaafjord, visible in a British aerial reconnaissance photograph in spite of artificial smoke generated on shore]]\n{{main|Operation Mascot|Operation Goodwood (naval)}}\n\nA series of carrier strikes was planned over the next three months, but bad weather forced their cancellation. A repeat of Operation Tungsten, codenamed Operation Planet, was scheduled for 24 April. Operation Brawn, which was to have been carried out by 27 bombers and 36 fighters from ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'', was to have taken place on 15 May, and Operation Tiger Claw was intended for 28 May. ''Victorious'' and ''Furious'' were joined by {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} for [[Operation Mascot]], which was to have been carried out on 17 July by 62 bombers and 30 fighters. In late August the weather improved, allowing the [[Operation Goodwood (naval)|Goodwood series of attacks]]. Operations Goodwood I and II were launched on 22 August; a carrier force consisting of the fleet carriers ''Furious'', ''Indefatigable'' and {{HMS|Formidable|67|2}} and the escort carriers {{HMS|Nabob|D77|2}} and {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|2}} launched a total of 38 bombers and 43 escort fighters between the two raids. The attacks failed to inflict any damage on ''Tirpitz'',{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} and three of the attacking aircraft were shot down.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=267}} Goodwood III followed on 24 August, composed of aircraft from the fleet carriers only. Forty-eight bombers and 29 fighters attacked the ship and scored two hits which caused minor damage.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} One, a 1600-pound bomb, penetrated the upper and lower armour decks and came to rest in the No.&nbsp;4 switchboard room. Its fuze had been damaged and the bomb did not detonate. The second, a {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bomb, exploded causing superficial damage.

The RAF used Lancaster bombers to carry {{convert|6|ST|adj=on}} [[Tallboy (bomb)|Tallboy bombs]] to penetrate the ship's heavy armour.{{sfn|Sweetman|pp=132\u2013139}} The first attack, [[Operation Paravane]], took place on 15 September 1944; operating from a forward base at [[Yagodnik]] in Russia, 23 Lancasters (17 each carrying one Tallboy and six each carrying twelve [[Johnny Walker (bomb)#Inventions|JW mines]]), scored a single hit on the ship's bow.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The Tallboy penetrated the ship, exited the keel, and exploded in the bottom of the fjord. {{convert|800|to|1000|t|LT|abbr=on}} of water flooded the bow and caused a serious increase in [[Glossary of nautical terms#T|trim]] forward. The ship was rendered unseaworthy and was limited to {{convert|8|to|10|kn}}. Concussive shock caused severe damage to fire-control equipment. The damage persuaded the naval command to repair the ship for use only as a floating gun battery. Repair work was estimated to take nine months, but patching of the holes could be effected within a few weeks, allowing ''Tirpitz'' to be moved further south to [[Troms\u00f8]]. On 15 October, the ship made the {{convert|200|nmi|abbr=on}} trip to Troms\u00f8 under her own power, the last voyage of her career.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}}\n\nThe RAF made a second attempt on 29 October, after the ship was moored off [[H\u00e5k\u00f8ya]] Island outside Troms\u00f8. Thirty-two Lancasters attacked the ship with Tallboys during [[Operation Obviate]].{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} As on Operation Paravane, [[No. IX Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;9 Squadron]] and [[No. 617 Squadron]] carried out the attack together, which resulted in only one near miss,{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} partially the result of bad weather over the target.{{sfn|Sweetman|p=193}} The underwater explosion damaged the port rudder and shaft and caused some flooding. ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s 38&nbsp;cm fragmentation shells proved ineffective in countering the high-level bombers; one aircraft was damaged by ground-based anti-aircraft guns.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=268}} Following the attack, the ship's anchorage was significantly improved. A large sandbank was constructed under and around the ship to prevent her from capsizing, and anti-torpedo nets were installed. ''Tirpitz'' retained a one-degree list to port from earlier damage, and this was not corrected by counter-flooding to retain as much reserve buoyancy as possible. The ship was also prepared for her role as a floating artillery platform: fuel was limited to what was necessary to power the turbo-generators, and the crew was reduced to 1,600 officers and enlisted men.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=270}}\n\n==== Operation Catechism ====\n[[File:1944-11-22 RAF Sinks Tirpitz.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=0:10|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the attack on ''Tirpitz'']]\n{{main|Operation Catechism}}\n\n[[Operation Catechism]], the final British attack on ''Tirpitz'', took place on 12 November 1944.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} The ship again used her 38&nbsp;cm guns against the bombers, which approached the battleship at 09:35; ''Tirpitz''{{'}}s main guns forced the bombers to disperse temporarily, but could not break up the attack.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}} A force of 32 Lancasters from Nos.&nbsp;9 and 617 Squadrons dropped 29 Tallboys on the ship, with two direct hits and one near miss.{{sfn|Breyer|p=26}} Several other bombs landed within the anti-torpedo net barrier and caused significant cratering of the seabed; this removed much of the sandbank that had been constructed to prevent the ship from capsizing. One bomb penetrated the ship's deck between turrets Anton and Bruno but failed to explode. A second hit [[amidships]] between the aircraft catapult and the funnel and caused severe damage. A very large hole was blown in the ship's side and bottom; the entire section of belt armour abreast of the bomb hit was completely destroyed. A third bomb may have struck the port side of turret Caesar.{{sfn|Garzke & Dulin|p=272}}\n\nThe amidships hit caused significant flooding and quickly increased the port list to between 15 and 20&nbsp;degrees. In ten minutes the list increased to 30 to 40&nbsp;degrees, and the captain issued the order to abandon ship. The list increased to 60&nbsp;degrees by 09:50; this appeared to stabilise temporarily. Eight minutes later, a large explosion rocked turret Caesar. The turret roof and part of the rotating structure were thrown {{convert|25|m|abbr=on}} into the air and into a group of men swimming to shore, crushing them.

Major [[Heinrich Ehrler]], the commander of III./[[Jagdgeschwader 5]] (3rd Group of the 5th Fighter Wing), was blamed for the Luftwaffe's failure to intercept the British bombers. He was court-martialled in Oslo and threatened with the death penalty. Evidence was presented that his unit had failed to help the Kriegsmarine when requested.

In the 1980s, he came up with an interpretation of the [[Planck length]] as the `zero-point length' of the [[spacetime]]  based on very general considerations. <ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000349168580004X]</ref> This result, established by theoretical considerations and well-chosen thought experiments <ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/4/4/007|title = Limitations on the operational definition of spacetime events and quantum gravity|year = 1987|last1 = Padmanabhan|first1 = T.|journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity|volume = 4|issue = 4|pages = L107\u2013L113}}</ref>, finds an echo in more recent results in several other candidate models for [[quantum gravity]].

He is a recognized authority in the subject of the statistical mechanics of gravitating systems<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370157390900513?via%3Dihub]</ref> and was a pioneer in the systematic application of these concepts to study the [[gravitational clustering]] in an [[expanding universe]]<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1007/3-540-45835-2_7|chapter = Statistical Mechanics of Gravitating Systems in Static and Cosmological Backgrounds|title = Dynamics and Thermodynamics of Systems with Long-Range Interactions|series = Lecture Notes in Physics|year = 2002|last1 = Padmanabhan|first1 = Thanu|volume = 602|pages = 165\u2013207|isbn = 978-3-540-44315-5}}</ref>. He has been invited to lecture twice at the Les Houches Schools (in 2002 and 2008) to a broader community about this subject.\n\nIn November 2016, Padmanabhan published research studies advocating a new [[paradigm shift]] in understanding [[gravity]]. <ref name=\"ARX-20161110\">{{cite journal |last=Padmanabhan |first=Thanu |authorlink=Thanu Padmanabhan |title=Do We really Understand the Cosmos? |arxiv=1611.03505 |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2017.02.001 |volume=18 |issue=3\u20134 |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |pages=275\u2013291|bibcode=2017CRPhy..18..275P }}</ref><ref name=\"ENS-20161115\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Research shows paradigm shift in understanding of gravity |url=http://epaper.indianexpress.com/c/14675133 |date=November 15, 2016 |work=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=November 19, 2016 }}</ref> A key question in quantum gravity lies in understanding the primordial, pre-geometric phase of the universe, from which the classical, geometric phase described by Einstein's equations emerges along with the notions of space and time themselves. \nPadmanabhan introduced the notion of Cosmic Information (called 'CosmIn') which allows to connect these two phases in a fascinating manner. CosmIn, which is a [[conserved quantity]], measures the total information transferred from the quantum gravitational phase to the classical phase of the universe. Quantum gravitational considerations advocate an astonishingly simple value for CosmIn: 4\u03c0, the number of information 'bits' on the surface of a sphere of unit radius. Using these considerations, CosmIn was able to relate the numerical value of the [[cosmological constant]] - possibly the deepest unsolved problem in [[theoretical physics]] today - to the energy scale at which the universe made the quantum-to-classical transition.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269317306408?via%3Dihub]</ref> This is the first time that a model with no adjustable parameters is able to provide a holistic explanation for both these observations, which has far-reaching implications for the quantum structure of spacetime.

He has been invited to lecture twice at the Les Houches Schools (in 2002 and 2008) to a broader community about this subject.\n\nIn November 2016, Padmanabhan published research studies advocating a new [[paradigm shift]] in understanding [[gravity]]. <ref name=\"ARX-20161110\">{{cite journal |last=Padmanabhan |first=Thanu |authorlink=Thanu Padmanabhan |title=Do We really Understand the Cosmos? |arxiv=1611.03505 |year=2017 |doi=10.1016/j.crhy.2017.02.001 |volume=18 |issue=3\u20134 |journal=Comptes Rendus Physique |pages=275\u2013291|bibcode=2017CRPhy..18..275P }}</ref><ref name=\"ENS-20161115\">{{cite news |author=Staff |title=Research shows paradigm shift in understanding of gravity |url=http://epaper.indianexpress.com/c/14675133 |date=November 15, 2016 |work=[[The Indian Express]] |accessdate=November 19, 2016 }}</ref> A key question in quantum gravity lies in understanding the primordial, pre-geometric phase of the universe, from which the classical, geometric phase described by Einstein's equations emerges along with the notions of space and time themselves. \nPadmanabhan introduced the notion of Cosmic Information (called 'CosmIn') which allows to connect these two phases in a fascinating manner. CosmIn, which is a [[conserved quantity]], measures the total information transferred from the quantum gravitational phase to the classical phase of the universe. Quantum gravitational considerations advocate an astonishingly simple value for CosmIn: 4\u03c0, the number of information 'bits' on the surface of a sphere of unit radius. Using these considerations, CosmIn was able to relate the numerical value of the [[cosmological constant]] - possibly the deepest unsolved problem in [[theoretical physics]] today - to the energy scale at which the universe made the quantum-to-classical transition.<ref>[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370269317306408?via%3Dihub]</ref> This is the first time that a model with no adjustable parameters is able to provide a holistic explanation for both these observations, which has far-reaching implications for the quantum structure of spacetime.

It is a [[metal]] that belongs to the [[first transition series]] and [[group 8 element|group 8]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is by mass the most common element on [[Earth]], forming much of Earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]]. It is the fourth most common [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in the Earth's crust]].\n\nIn its metallic state, iron is rare in the [[Earth's crust]], limited to deposition by [[meteorites]]. [[Iron ore]]s, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires [[kiln]]s or [[furnace]]s capable of reaching {{convert|1500|C|F}} or higher, about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C (900&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than what is enough to [[smelting|smelt]] [[copper]]. Humans started to master that process in [[Eurasia]] only about 2000 BCE{{Not in body|date=April 2019}}, and the use of iron [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s began to displace [[list of copper alloys|copper alloys]], in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]]. In the [[modern world]], iron alloys, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel|inox]], [[cast iron]] and [[alloy steel|special steels]] are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their mechanical properties and low cost.\n\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with [[oxygen]] and [[water]] to give brown to black [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]]s, commonly known as [[rust]]. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.\n\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]]. These two [[protein]]s play essential roles in [[vertebrate]] [[metabolism]], respectively [[oxygen transport]] by [[blood]] and oxygen storage in [[muscle]]s. To maintain the necessary levels, [[human iron metabolism]] requires a minimum of iron in the diet.

Iron shares many properties of other [[transition metal]]s, including the other [[group 8 element]]s, [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]]. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of [[oxidation state]]s, \u22122 to +7. Iron also forms many [[coordination compound]]s; some of them, such as [[ferrocene]], [[potassium ferrioxalate|ferrioxalate]], and [[Prussian blue]], have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Allotropes===\n{{main|Allotropes of iron}}\n[[File:Iron-alpha-pV.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Molar volume vs. pressure for \u03b1 iron at room temperature]]\nAt least four allotropes of iron (differing atom arrangements in the solid) are known, conventionally denoted \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5.\n[[File:Pure iron phase diagram (EN).png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Low-pressure [[phase diagram]] of pure iron]]\n\nThe first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C, it crystallizes into its \u03b4 allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) [[crystal structure]]. As it cools further to 1394&nbsp;\u00b0C, it changes to its \u03b3-iron allotrope, a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) crystal structure, or [[austenite]]. At 912&nbsp;\u00b0C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc \u03b1-iron allotrope.<ref name=Greenwood1075/>\n\nThe physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, \u03b1-iron changes into another [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure, which is also known as [[hexaferrum|\u03b5-iron]]. The higher-temperature \u03b3-phase also changes into \u03b5-iron, but does so at higher pressure.\n\nSome controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable \u03b2 phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K.

This stage yields an alloy -- [[pig iron]]\u2014that contains relatively large amounts of carbon.<!--\"Alternatively, it may be directly reduced.\" - what does this mean?--> In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.<ref name=Greenwood1073>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1073</ref><!--https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVPNtRagDkC--> Other metals can be added at this stage to form [[alloy steel]]s.\n[[File:Chinese Fining and Blast Furnace.jpg|thumb|17th century Chinese illustration of workers at a blast furnace, making wrought iron from pig iron<ref name=song>[[Song Yingxing]] (1637): The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia.</ref>]] [[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|How iron was extracted in the 19th century]]\n\n====Blast furnace processing====\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nThe blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually [[hematite]] {{chem2|Fe2O3}} or [[magnetite]] {{chem2|Fe3O4}}, together with coke ([[coal]] that has been separately baked to remove volatile components). Air pre-heated to 900 \u00b0C is blown through the mixture, in sufficient amount to turn the carbon into [[carbon monoxide]]:<ref name=Greenwood1073/> \n:2 C + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO\nThis reaction raises the temperature to about 2000 \u00b0C The carbon monoxide reduces the iron ore to metallic iron<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 CO \u2192 2 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\nSome iron in the high-temperature lower region of the furnace reacts directly with the coke:<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n:2 Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3 C \u2192 4 Fe + 3 CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nA [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] such as [[limestone]] ([[calcium carbonate]]) or [[Dolomite (mineral)|dolomite]] (calcium-magnesium carbonate) is also added to the furnace's load. Its purpose is to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. The heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to [[calcium oxide]], which reacts with any excess [[silica]] to form a [[slag]] composed of [[calcium silicate]] {{chem2|CaSiO3}} or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with the slag on top), that are then easily separated.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\nThe slag can be used as a material in [[road]] construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n[[File:LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.]]\n\n====Steelmaking====\n{{Main|Steelmaking|Ironworks}}\n[[File:Melted raw-iron.jpg|thumb|right|A pot of molten iron being used to make steel]]\n<!-- Several other articles cover the material that might go into this section: please do not expand it excessively. This article concerns all aspects of the element iron, and should thus NOT be overburdened with details of metallurgy... Agree. Should be a summary. -->\nIn general, the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to 4\u20135% carbon, with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. The high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002\u20132.1% by mass produces [[steel]], which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variety of steel articles can then be made by [[cold working]], [[hot rolling]], [[forging]], [[machining]], etc. Removing the other impurities, instead, results in cast iron, which is used to cast articles in [[foundry|foundries]]; for example stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n\nSteel products often undergo various [[heat treatment]]s after they are forged to shape. [[annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] consists of heating them to 700\u2013800&nbsp;\u00b0C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.<ref name=Verhoeven>Verhoeven, J.D. (1975) ''Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy'', Wiley, New York, p. 326</ref>\n<!--why is this in production of iron?Steel may be hardened by [[cold working]]. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.\n\n[[Heat treatment]] is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n\nSometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called [[case hardening]] may be used. Steel is heated to about 900&nbsp;\u00b0C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.\n\nIron may be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by dipping it into a concentrated [[nitric acid]] solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4}}</ref>-->\n\n=== Direct iron reduction ===\nOwing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"[[Direct reduced iron|Direct iron reduction]]\" [[Sponge iron reaction|reduces iron ore]] to a ferrous lump called [[sponge iron|\"sponge\" iron]] or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.<ref name=\"Biddle\" /> Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:\n\nNatural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):<ref name=Biddle/>\n:2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO + 4 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:<ref name=Biddle/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 Fe + CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n[[Silica]] is removed by adding a [[limestone]] flux as described above.<ref name=Biddle/>\n\n===Thermite process===\n{{Main|Thermite}}\nIgnition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the [[thermite reaction]]:\n\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al \u2192 2 Fe + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nAlternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various processes have been used for this, including [[finery forge]]s, [[Puddling (metallurgy)|puddling]] furnaces, [[Bessemer converter]]s, [[open hearth furnace]]s, [[basic oxygen furnace]]s, and [[electric arc furnace]]s. In all cases, the objective is to oxidize some or all of the carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.<ref name=Greenwood1072/><!-- why is this in production? The hardness of the steel depends upon its carbon content: the higher the percentage of carbon, the greater the hardness and the lesser the malleability. The properties of the steel can also be changed by several methods.-->\n\n==Applications==\n\n===As structural material===\nIron is the most widely used of all the metals, accounting for over 90% of worldwide metal production.<!-- The UGSG gives a production of iron including recycling with 998Mt, while aluminium (39Mt), copper (18Mt), zinc (11Mt) and lead (8.6Mt) add up to 77 Mt, all including recycling. This more like 8% than 5.--> Its low cost and high strength often make it the material of choice material to withstand stress or transmit forces, such as the construction of machinery and [[machine tool]]s, [[track (rail transport)|rails]], [[automobile]]s, [[hull (ship)|ship hulls]], [[rebar|concrete reinforcing bars]], and the load-carrying framework of buildings.

Pig iron is not a saleable product, but rather an intermediate step in the production of cast iron and steel. The reduction of contaminants in pig iron that negatively affect material properties, such as sulfur and phosphorus, yields cast iron containing 2\u20134% carbon, 1\u20136% silicon, and small amounts of [[manganese]].<ref name=Greenwood1073/> Pig iron has a [[melting point]] in the range of 1420\u20131470&nbsp;K, which is lower than either of its two main components, and makes it the first product to be melted when carbon and iron are heated together.<ref name=Greenwood1075/> Its mechanical properties vary greatly and depend on the form the carbon takes in the alloy.<ref name=Greenwood1074/>\n\n\"White\" cast irons contain their carbon in the form of [[cementite]], or iron carbide (Fe<sub>3</sub>C).<ref name=Greenwood1074/> This hard, brittle compound dominates the mechanical properties of white cast irons, rendering them hard, but unresistant to shock. The broken surface of a white cast iron is full of fine facets of the broken iron carbide, a very pale, silvery, shiny material, hence the appellation. Cooling a mixture of iron with 0.8% carbon slowly below 723&nbsp;\u00b0C to room temperature results in separate, alternating layers of cementite and \u03b1-iron, which is soft and malleable and is called [[pearlite]] for its appearance. Rapid cooling, on the other hand, does not allow time for this separation and creates hard and brittle [[martensite]]. The steel can then be tempered by reheating to a temperature in between, changing the proportions of pearlite and martensite.

It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion about 55&nbsp;picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nWhen deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a [[hydrogen bond]] with it. This results in the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe\u2013O\u2013O bond angle of around 120\u00b0 that avoids the formation of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013O<sub>2</sub>\u2013Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> As described by the [[Bohr effect]] (named after [[Christian Bohr]], the father of [[Niels Bohr]]), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n[[File:Carboxyhemoglobin from 1AJ9.png|thumb|right|A heme unit of human [[carboxyhemoglobin]], showing the [[carbonyl ligand]] at the apical position, ''trans'' to the histidine residue.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Acta Crystallogr.

Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of [[cyanide]], but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a [[methionine]] sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen \u2013 with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in [[adenosine triphosphate]]. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n:4 Cytc<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 8H{{su|p=+|b=inside}} \u2192 4 Cytc<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H{{su|p=+|b=outside}}\n\nAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the [[iron-sulfur protein]]s are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is [[rubredoxin]], which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from [[cysteine]] residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the [[ferredoxin]]s, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nThe ability of sea [[mussel]]s to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] iron-based bonds in their protein-rich [[cuticle]]s.

High blood levels of free ferrous iron react with [[peroxide]]s to produce highly reactive [[free radical]]s that can damage [[DNA]], [[proteins]], [[lipids]], and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of [[transferrin]] to bind the iron. Damage to the cells of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels.

It is a [[metal]] that belongs to the [[first transition series]] and [[group 8 element|group 8]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is by mass the most common element on [[Earth]], forming much of Earth's [[outer core|outer]] and [[inner core]]. It is the fourth most common [[abundance of elements in Earth's crust|element in the Earth's crust]].\n\nIn its metallic state, iron is rare in the [[Earth's crust]], limited to deposition by [[meteorites]]. [[Iron ore]]s, by contrast, are among the most abundant in the Earth's crust, although extracting usable metal from them requires [[kiln]]s or [[furnace]]s capable of reaching {{convert|1500|C|F}} or higher, about 500&nbsp;\u00b0C (900&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than what is enough to [[smelting|smelt]] [[copper]]. Humans started to master that process in [[Eurasia]] only about 2000 BCE{{Not in body|date=April 2019}}, and the use of iron [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s began to displace [[list of copper alloys|copper alloys]], in some regions, only around 1200 BCE. That event is considered the transition from the [[Bronze Age]] to the [[Iron Age]]. In the [[modern world]], iron alloys, such as [[steel]], [[stainless steel|inox]], [[cast iron]] and [[alloy steel|special steels]] are by far the most common industrial metals, because of their high mechanical properties and low cost.\n\nPristine and smooth pure iron surfaces are mirror-like silvery-gray. However, iron reacts readily with [[oxygen]] and [[water]] to give brown to black [[hydrate]]d [[iron oxide]]s, commonly known as [[rust]]. Unlike the oxides of some other metals, that form [[passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] layers, rust occupies more volume than the metal and thus flakes off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.\n\nThe body of an adult human contains about 4 grams (0.005% body weight) of iron, mostly in [[hemoglobin]] and [[myoglobin]]. These two [[protein]]s play essential roles in [[vertebrate]] [[metabolism]], respectively [[oxygen transport]] by [[blood]] and oxygen storage in [[muscle]]s. To maintain the necessary levels, [[human iron metabolism]] requires a minimum of iron in the diet.

Iron shares many properties of other [[transition metal]]s, including the other [[group 8 element]]s, [[ruthenium]] and [[osmium]]. Iron forms compounds in a wide range of [[oxidation state]]s, \u22122 to +7. Iron also forms many [[coordination compound]]s; some of them, such as [[ferrocene]], [[potassium ferrioxalate|ferrioxalate]], and [[Prussian blue]], have substantial industrial, medical, or research applications.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n===Allotropes===\n{{main|Allotropes of iron}}\n[[File:Iron-alpha-pV.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Molar volume vs. pressure for \u03b1 iron at room temperature]]\nAt least four allotropes of iron (differing atom arrangements in the solid) are known, conventionally denoted \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03b4, and \u03b5.\n[[File:Pure iron phase diagram (EN).png|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Low-pressure [[phase diagram]] of pure iron]]\n\nThe first three forms are observed at ordinary pressures. As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538&nbsp;\u00b0C, it crystallizes into its \u03b4 allotrope, which has a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) [[crystal structure]]. As it cools further to 1394&nbsp;\u00b0C, it changes to its \u03b3-iron allotrope, a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) crystal structure, or [[austenite]]. At 912&nbsp;\u00b0C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc \u03b1-iron allotrope.<ref name=Greenwood1075/>\n\nThe physical properties of iron at very high pressures and temperatures have also been studied extensively, because of their relevance to theories about the cores of the Earth and other planets. Above approximately 10 GPa and temperatures of a few hundred kelvin or less, \u03b1-iron changes into another [[hexagonal close-packed]] (hcp) structure, which is also known as [[hexaferrum|\u03b5-iron]]. The higher-temperature \u03b3-phase also changes into \u03b5-iron, but does so at higher pressure.\n\nSome controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable \u03b2 phase at pressures above 50 GPa and temperatures of at least 1500 K.

Thus a macroscopic piece of iron will have a nearly zero overall magnetic field.\n\nApplication of an external magnetic field causes the domains that are magnetized in the same general direction to grow at the expense of adjacent ones that point in other directions, reinforcing the external field. This effect is exploited in devices that needs to channel magnetic fields, such as [[electrical transformer]]s, [[magnetic recording]] heads, and [[electric motor]]s. Impurities, [[lattice defect]]s, or grain and particle boundaries can \"pin\" the domains in the new positions, so that the effect persists even after the external field is removed -- thus turning the iron object into a (permanent) [[magnet]].<ref name=cullity/>\n\nSimilar behavior is exhibited by some iron compounds, such as the ferrites and the mineral [[magnetite]], a crystalline form of the mixed iron(II,III) oxide {{chem2|Fe3O4}} (although the atomic-scale mechanism, [[ferrimagnetism]], is somewhat different). Pieces of magnetite with natural permanent magnetization ([[lodestone]]s) provided the earliest [[compass]]es for navigation.

The latter tend to be rather more unstable than iron(II) complexes and often dissociate in water. Many Fe\u2013O complexes show intense colors and are used as tests for [[phenol]]s or [[enol]]s. For example, in the [[ferric chloride test]], used to determine the presence of phenols, [[iron(III) chloride]] reacts with a phenol to form a deep violet complex:<ref name=Greenwood1088/>\n\n:3 ArOH + FeCl<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Fe(OAr)<sub>3</sub> + 3 HCl (Ar = [[aryl]])\n\nAmong the halide and pseudohalide complexes, fluoro complexes of iron(III) are the most stable, with the colorless [FeF<sub>5</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)]<sup>2\u2212</sup> being the most stable in aqueous solution. Chloro complexes are less stable and favor tetrahedral coordination as in [FeCl<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup>; [FeBr<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> and [FeI<sub>4</sub>]<sup>\u2212</sup> are reduced easily to iron(II). [[Thiocyanate]] is a common test for the presence of iron(III) as it forms the blood-red [Fe(SCN)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub>]<sup>2+</sup>. Like manganese(II), most iron(III) complexes are high-spin, the exceptions being those with ligands that are high in the [[spectrochemical series]] such as [[cyanide]]. An example of a low-spin iron(III) complex is [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>. The cyanide ligands may easily be detached in [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>3\u2212</sup>, and hence this complex is poisonous, unlike the iron(II) complex [Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4\u2212</sup> found in Prussian blue,<ref name=Greenwood1088/> which does not release [[hydrogen cyanide]] except when dilute acids are added.<ref name=Greenwood1091/> Iron shows a great variety of electronic [[spin states (d electrons)|spin states]], including every possible spin quantum number value for a d-block element from 0 (diamagnetic) to {{frac|5|2}} (5 unpaired electrons).

In the first stage, iron ore is [[redox|reduced]] with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] in a [[blast furnace]], and the molten metal is separated from gross impurities such as [[silicate mineral]]s. This stage yields an alloy -- [[pig iron]]\u2014that contains relatively large amounts of carbon.<!--\"Alternatively, it may be directly reduced.\" - what does this mean?--> In the second stage, the amount of carbon in the pig iron is lowered by oxidation to yield wrought iron, steel, or cast iron.<ref name=Greenwood1073>Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 1073</ref><!--https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVPNtRagDkC--> Other metals can be added at this stage to form [[alloy steel]]s.\n[[File:Chinese Fining and Blast Furnace.jpg|thumb|17th century Chinese illustration of workers at a blast furnace, making wrought iron from pig iron<ref name=song>[[Song Yingxing]] (1637): The ''Tiangong Kaiwu'' encyclopedia.</ref>]] [[File:Iron-Making.jpg|thumb|How iron was extracted in the 19th century]]\n\n====Blast furnace processing====\n{{Main|Blast furnace}}\nThe blast furnace is loaded with iron ores, usually [[hematite]] {{chem2|Fe2O3}} or [[magnetite]] {{chem2|Fe3O4}}, together with coke ([[coal]] that has been separately baked to remove volatile components).

Its purpose is to remove silicaceous minerals in the ore, which would otherwise clog the furnace. The heat of the furnace decomposes the carbonates to [[calcium oxide]], which reacts with any excess [[silica]] to form a [[slag]] composed of [[calcium silicate]] {{chem2|CaSiO3}} or other products. At the furnace's temperature, the metal and the slag are both molten. They collect at the bottom as two immiscible liquid layers (with the slag on top), that are then easily separated.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\nThe slag can be used as a material in [[road]] construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for [[agriculture]].<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n[[File:LightningVolt Iron Ore Pellets.jpg|thumb|This heap of iron ore pellets will be used in steel production.]]\n\n====Steelmaking====\n{{Main|Steelmaking|Ironworks}}\n[[File:Melted raw-iron.jpg|thumb|right|A pot of molten iron being used to make steel]]\n<!-- Several other articles cover the material that might go into this section: please do not expand it excessively. This article concerns all aspects of the element iron, and should thus NOT be overburdened with details of metallurgy... Agree. Should be a summary. -->\nIn general, the pig iron produced by the blast furnace process contains up to 4\u20135% carbon, with small amounts of other impurities like sulfur, magnesium, phosphorus, and manganese. The high level of carbon makes it relatively weak and brittle. Reducing the amount of carbon to 0.002\u20132.1% by mass produces [[steel]], which may be up to 1000 times harder than pure iron. A great variety of steel articles can then be made by [[cold working]], [[hot rolling]], [[forging]], [[machining]], etc. Removing the other impurities, instead, results in cast iron, which is used to cast articles in [[foundry|foundries]]; for example stoves, pipes, radiators, lamp-posts, and rails.<ref name=Greenwood1073/>\n\nSteel products often undergo various [[heat treatment]]s after they are forged to shape. [[annealing (metallurgy)|Annealing]] consists of heating them to 700\u2013800&nbsp;\u00b0C for several hours and then gradual cooling. It makes the steel softer and more workable.<ref name=Verhoeven>Verhoeven, J.D. (1975) ''Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy'', Wiley, New York, p. 326</ref>\n<!--why is this in production of iron?Steel may be hardened by [[cold working]]. The metal is bent or hammered into its final shape at a relatively cool temperature. Cold forging is the stamping of a piece of steel into shape by a heavy press. Wrenches are commonly made by cold forging. Cold rolling, which involves making a thinner but harder sheet, and cold drawing, which makes a thinner but stronger wire, are two other methods of cold working. To harden the steel, it is heated to red-hot and then cooled by quenching it in the water. It becomes harder and more brittle. If it is too hardened, it is then heated to a required temperature and allowed to cool. The steel thus formed is less brittle.\n\n[[Heat treatment]] is another way to harden steel. The steel is heated red-hot, then cooled quickly. The iron carbide molecules are decomposed by the heat, but do not have time to reform. Since the free carbon atoms are stuck, it makes the steel much harder and stronger than before.<ref name=\"Biddle\" />\n\nSometimes both toughness and hardness are desired. A process called [[case hardening]] may be used. Steel is heated to about 900&nbsp;\u00b0C then plunged into oil or water. Carbon from the oil can diffuse into the steel, making the surface very hard. The surface cools quickly, but the inside cools slowly, making an extremely hard surface and a durable, resistant inner layer.\n\nIron may be [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]] by dipping it into a concentrated [[nitric acid]] solution. This forms a protective layer of oxide on the metal, protecting it from further corrosion.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.euro-inox.org/pdf/map/Passivating_Pickling_EN.pdf |title=Picking and passivating stainless steel, Materials and Application Series, Volume 4 |publisher=Euro Inox |year=2007 |edition=2nd |isbn=978-2-87997-224-4}}</ref>-->\n\n=== Direct iron reduction ===\nOwing to environmental concerns, alternative methods of processing iron have been developed. \"[[Direct reduced iron|Direct iron reduction]]\" [[Sponge iron reaction|reduces iron ore]] to a ferrous lump called [[sponge iron|\"sponge\" iron]] or \"direct\" iron that is suitable for steelmaking.<ref name=\"Biddle\" /> Two main reactions comprise the direct reduction process:\n\nNatural gas is partially oxidized (with heat and a catalyst):<ref name=Biddle/>\n:2 CH<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 CO + 4 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nIron ore is then treated with these gases in a furnace, producing solid sponge iron:<ref name=Biddle/>\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 Fe + CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n[[Silica]] is removed by adding a [[limestone]] flux as described above.<ref name=Biddle/>\n\n===Thermite process===\n{{Main|Thermite}}\nIgnition of a mixture of aluminium powder and iron oxide yields metallic iron via the [[thermite reaction]]:\n\n:Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 2 Al \u2192 2 Fe + Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\n\nAlternatively pig iron may be made into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron).

It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion about 55&nbsp;picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nWhen deoxyhemoglobin picks up an oxygen molecule, this histidine residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached to form a [[hydrogen bond]] with it. This results in the Fe<sup>2+</sup> ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe\u2013O\u2013O bond angle of around 120\u00b0 that avoids the formation of Fe\u2013O\u2013Fe or Fe\u2013O<sub>2</sub>\u2013Fe bridges that would lead to electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup> to Fe<sup>3+</sup>, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when deoxyhemoglobin takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than that of myoglobin, which oxygenates even at low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> As described by the [[Bohr effect]] (named after [[Christian Bohr]], the father of [[Niels Bohr]]), the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin diminishes in the presence of carbon dioxide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n[[File:Carboxyhemoglobin from 1AJ9.png|thumb|right|A heme unit of human [[carboxyhemoglobin]], showing the [[carbonyl ligand]] at the apical position, ''trans'' to the histidine residue.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Acta Crystallogr.

Hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide is known as [[carboxyhemoglobin]]. This effect also plays a minor role in the toxicity of [[cyanide]], but there the major effect is by far its interference with the proper functioning of the electron transport protein cytochrome a.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> The cytochrome proteins also involve heme groups and are involved in the metabolic oxidation of glucose by oxygen. The sixth coordination site is then occupied by either another imidazole nitrogen or a [[methionine]] sulfur, so that these proteins are largely inert to oxygen \u2013 with the exception of cytochrome a, which bonds directly to oxygen and thus is very easily poisoned by cyanide.<ref name=Greenwood1098/> Here, the electron transfer takes place as the iron remains in low spin but changes between the +2 and +3 oxidation states. Since the reduction potential of each step is slightly greater than the previous one, the energy is released step-by-step and can thus be stored in [[adenosine triphosphate]]. Cytochrome a is slightly distinct, as it occurs at the mitochondrial membrane, binds directly to oxygen, and transports protons as well as electrons, as follows:<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\n:4 Cytc<sup>2+</sup> + O<sub>2</sub> + 8H{{su|p=+|b=inside}} \u2192 4 Cytc<sup>3+</sup> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H{{su|p=+|b=outside}}\n\nAlthough the heme proteins are the most important class of iron-containing proteins, the [[iron-sulfur protein]]s are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is [[rubredoxin]], which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from [[cysteine]] residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the [[ferredoxin]]s, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does not belong to either of these classes.<ref name=Greenwood1098/>\n\nThe ability of sea [[mussel]]s to maintain their grip on rocks in the ocean is facilitated by their use of [[organometallic chemistry|organometallic]] iron-based bonds in their protein-rich [[cuticle]]s. Based on synthetic replicas, the presence of iron in these structures increased [[elastic modulus]] 770 times, [[tensile strength]] 58 times, and [[toughness]] 92 times.
