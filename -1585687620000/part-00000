The population was 53 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. It is part of the [[Boise, Idaho|Boise City]]&ndash;[[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], Idaho [[Boise metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2020}}\n\nPlacerville received its name because of [[placer deposits|placer mining]] in the vicinity. The [[ghost town]]<ref>http://www.ptdla.org/journal/2003hertel</ref> is located 17 miles east of [[Horseshoe Bend, Idaho|Horseshoe Bend]]. The townsite was selected December 1, 1862; and by December 16 there were six cabins in the camp. By the early summer of 1863, the town had 300 buildings and a population of 5,000. At the meeting of the first legislature held in Lewiston in 1863, the citizens obtained a charter for their city. Father Mesplie, a Catholic priest, held the first church service January 4, 1864, and in that same year a stage line was established between the Basin and [[Wallula, Washington|Wallua]] to carry Wells Fargo express. It ran every other day from Placerville and went through in four days. By July 1864, 4500 claims had been recorded in the district.<ref>*{{cite book\n  | last = Fisher\n  | first = Vardis\n  | authorlink = Vardis Fisher\n  | last2 = Federal Writers' Project\n  | first2 = \n  | author2-link = Federal Writers' Project\n  | title = '''Idaho Encyclopedia'''     \n  | publisher = Caxton Printers, Ltd\n  | year = 1938\n  | location = [[Caldwell, Idaho]]\n  | oclc = 962624\n  | pages = 98\u2013114\n  | chapter = Section II Historical  Ghost Towns}}\n</ref>\n\nUnlike the earlier [[North Central Idaho|northern]] Idaho mining areas of Florence (northeast of [[Riggins, Idaho|Riggins]]) and [[Pierce, Idaho|Pierce]], the Boise Basin mines provided good returns over a period of many years, the peak years being 1863-66, during and immediately after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. For that reason the Boise Basin rush was significant an early Idaho settlement, bringing a substantial number of people who stayed to establish towns and providing a population base for retailing and agricultural settlement in the [[Treasure Valley|Boise Valley]]. Boise Basin had a higher percentage of families than did most mining areas, and the major towns, like Placerville and Idaho City, acquired substantial buildings, lodges, churches, schools, and post offices. Placerville was unusual in that it even had a street grid and a town square, known locally as the \"plaza.\" Additionally it had an Episcopal church-which is still in use currently, thirteen saloons, seven restaurants, five butcher shops, five blacksmith shops, as well as hotels, druggists, express agents, bakeries, livery barns, carpenters, sawmills, and \u2013attesting to the presence of women\u2014dressmakers and a millinery shop.\n\nMining in Placerville began with placer workings for gold, but miners soon turned to [[quartz]] mining as well. By 1864, a stamp mill was working in the area. Hydraulic giants were also used. By 1870, however, much of the excess population of the region had been drained off to other mining rushes and returns on claims had fallen somewhat. The population in Placerville shrank from 2500 in 1864 to 318 in 1870. By that time a good percentage of the population was [[China|Chinese]], as the Chinese were allowed to work the less rewarding claims that the white miners would not touch. The Chinese also established services like laundries and restaurants.\n\nOnly few early buildings remain in Placerville: as was the case in most mining towns, Placerville suffered more than once from fires that burned a large part of the town. The fire that is most remembered is the 1899 fire, which practically destroyed the town. The streetscape remaining today dates mostly from the rebuilding immediately after that fire and another fire that burned several buildings ten months later.\n\nDuring the war years Placerville just maintained like the rest of the nation. Wartime restrictions included a suspension of the mining industry. There was no growth \u2014 only a feeling of \"things have to get better.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s the upper lots were auctioned off creating what was and are now known as the \"upper subdivision.\" There were both permanent and vacation homes built on these lots. Then as now there was only one business in Placerville, the city store.\n\nPlacerville continues to survive with the few full-time residents and some part-time residents. The Village Market store has closed but Donna's Place II is open. The tourism industry which includes among others, history seekers, hunters and ATV and snowmobile recreationalists also continue to add life to the small city. The incorporated city is governed by a mayor and city council which meets regularly at City Hall. The city is served by the Placerville Fire Department which has its fire station located adjacent to the city plaza and the East Boise County ambulance service. There are two city museums which are maintained by public donation and volunteers and are open weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day and by special request.\n\nIn 1984, the settled areas of the city were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]], the \"Placerville Historic District.\"<ref name=nris />\n\n==Geography==\nPlacerville is located at {{coord|43|56|36|N|115|56|47|W|type:city}} (43.943287, -115.946444).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 426\n|1900= 230\n|1910= 187\n|1930= 116\n|1940= 146\n|1950= 17\n|1960= 12\n|1970= 14\n|1980= 20\n|1990= 14\n|2000= 60\n|2010= 53\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=55\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> of 2010, there were 53 people, 25 households, and 16 families residing in the city.

By that time a good percentage of the population was [[China|Chinese]], as the Chinese were allowed to work the less rewarding claims that the white miners would not touch. The Chinese also established services like laundries and restaurants.\n\nOnly few early buildings remain in Placerville: as was the case in most mining towns, Placerville suffered more than once from fires that burned a large part of the town. The fire that is most remembered is the 1899 fire, which practically destroyed the town. The streetscape remaining today dates mostly from the rebuilding immediately after that fire and another fire that burned several buildings ten months later.\n\nDuring the war years Placerville just maintained like the rest of the nation. Wartime restrictions included a suspension of the mining industry. There was no growth \u2014 only a feeling of \"things have to get better.\"\n\nIn the early 1970s the upper lots were auctioned off creating what was and are now known as the \"upper subdivision.\" There were both permanent and vacation homes built on these lots. Then as now there was only one business in Placerville, the city store.\n\nPlacerville continues to survive with the few full-time residents and some part-time residents. The Village Market store has closed but Donna's Place II is open. The tourism industry which includes among others, history seekers, hunters and ATV and snowmobile recreationalists also continue to add life to the small city. The incorporated city is governed by a mayor and city council which meets regularly at City Hall. The city is served by the Placerville Fire Department which has its fire station located adjacent to the city plaza and the East Boise County ambulance service. There are two city museums which are maintained by public donation and volunteers and are open weekends from Memorial Day to Labor Day and by special request.\n\nIn 1984, the settled areas of the city were listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as a [[historic district (United States)|historic district]], the \"Placerville Historic District.\"<ref name=nris />\n\n==Geography==\nPlacerville is located at {{coord|43|56|36|N|115|56|47|W|type:city}} (43.943287, -115.946444).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|1.01|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=2012-01-25}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 426\n|1900= 230\n|1910= 187\n|1930= 116\n|1940= 146\n|1950= 17\n|1960= 12\n|1970= 14\n|1980= 20\n|1990= 14\n|2000= 60\n|2010= 53\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=55\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=March 16, 2020}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> of 2010, there were 53 people, 25 households, and 16 families residing in the city.

As early as 1485, Pristina artisans also started producing gunpowder. Trade was thriving and there was a growing colony of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] traders (from modern day [[Dubrovnik]]) providing the link between Pristina's craftsmen and the outside world.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The first mosque was constructed in the late 14th century while still under Serbian rule.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The 1487 defter recorded 412 Christian and 94 Muslim households in Pristina, which at the time was administratively part of the [[Sanjak of Vu\u010ditrn]].\nIn the early Ottoman era, [[Islam]] was an urban phenomenon and only spread slowly with increasing urbanization. The travel writer [[Evliya Celebi]], visiting Pristina in the 1660s was impressed with its fine gardens and vineyards.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />  In those years, Pristina was part of the V\u0131\u00e7\u0131t\u0131r\u0131n Sanjak and its 2,000 families enjoyed the peace and stability of the Ottoman era. Economic life was controlled by the guild system (''esnafs'') with the tanners' and bakers' guild controlling prices, limiting unfair competition and acting as banks for their members. Religious life was dominated by religious charitable organizations often building mosques or fountains and providing charity to the poor.\nDuring the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683\u20131699)|Austro-Turkish War]] in the late 17th century, Pristina citizens under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. Under Austrian occupation, the Fatih Mosque (''Mbretit Mosque'') was briefly converted to a [[Jesuit]] church.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> Following the Austrian defeat in January 1690, Pristina's inhabitants were left at the mercy of Ottoman and [[Tatar]] troops who took revenge against the local population as punishment for their co-operation with the Austrians. A French officer traveling to Pristina noted soon afterwards that \"Pristina looked impressive from a distance but close up it is a mass of muddy streets and houses made of earth\".<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Modern===\n\n[[File:Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Monument of '''[[Brotherhood and Unity]]''' in the centre.

That year the railway between [[Salonika]] and [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] started operations and the seat of the vilayet of Prizren was relocated to Pristina. This privileged position as capital of the Ottoman vilayet lasted only for a short while. from January until August 1912, Pristina was liberated from Ottoman rule by Albanian rebel forces led by [[Hasan Prishtina]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Bogdanovi\u0107\n| first      = Dimitrije\n| authorlink = Dimitrije Bogdanovi\u0107\n| editor        = Antonije Isakovi\u0107\n| title         = Knjiga o Kosovu\n| url           = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/index.html\n| accessdate    = January 9, 2011\n| volume    = 2\n| origyear  = 1984\n|date=November 2000\n| publisher = [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n| location  = Belgrade\n| language  = Serbian\n| chapter   = Albanski pokreti 1908\u20131912.\n|trans-chapter=| chapterurl    = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/bogdanovic-kosovo_2.html\n| quote         =...&nbsp;ustanici su uspeli da&nbsp;... ovladaju celim kosovskim vilajetom do polovine avgusta 1912, \u0161to zna\u010di da su tada imali u svojim rukama Pri\u0161tinu, Novi Pazar, Sjenicu pa \u010dak i Skoplje&nbsp;...

The Yugoslav communist slogan at the time was '''uni\u0161ti stari graditi novi''' (destroy the old, build the new). In a misguided effort to modernize the town, communists set out to destroy the Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center, including mosques, catholic churches and Ottoman houses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> A second agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953 led to the exodus of several hundreds more Albanian families from Pristina. They left behind their homes, properties and businesses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> However, this policy changed under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|new constitution]] ratified in 1974. Few of the Ottoman town houses survived the communists' modernization drive, with the exception of those that were nationalized like today's Emin Gjiku Museum or the building of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs capital city and seat of the government, Pristina creamed off a large share of Yugoslav development funds channeled into Kosovo. As a result, the city's population and its economy changed rapidly. In 1966, Pristina had few paved roads, the old town houses had running water and [[cholera]] was still a problem. [[Prizren]] continued to be the largest town in Kosovo. Massive investments in state institutions like the newly founded [[University of Pristina (1969\u20131999)|University of Pristina]], the construction of new high-rise socialist apartment blocks and a new industrial zone on the outskirts of Pristina attracted large number of internal migrants. This ended a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]] and gave a major boost to Albanian-language education and culture in Kosovo. The Albanians were also allowed to use the Albanian flag.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWithin a decade, Pristina nearly doubled its population from about 69,514 in 1971 to 109,208 in 1981.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> This golden age of externally financed rapid growth was cut short by Yugoslavia's economic collapse and the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|1981 student revolts]]. Pristina, like the rest of Kosovo slid into a deepening economic and social crisis. The year 1989 saw the revocation of Kosovo's autonomy under [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the rise of [[Serb nationalism]] and mass dismissal of ethnic Albanians.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n\n[[File:089 albanian graves kosovo.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Graves of those who died in the [[Kosovo War]] in Pristina.]]\n[[File:War-Torn Pristina, Kosovo.jpg|upright|thumb|160px|right|War-torn Pristina.]]\n\nFollowing the reduction of Kosovo's autonomy by [[President of Serbia|Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1989, a harshly repressive regime was imposed throughout Kosovo by the Yugoslav government with Albanians largely being purged from state industries and institutions.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The LDK's{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} role meant, that when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] began to attack Serbian and Yugoslav forces from 1996 onwards, Pristina remained largely calm until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo War]] in March 1999. Pristina was spared large scale destruction compared to towns like [[Gjakova]] or [[Pe\u0107]] that suffered heavily at the hands of Serbian forces. For their strategic importance, however, a number of military targets were hit in Pristina during NATO's aerial campaign, including the post office, police headquarters and army barracks (today's [[Adem Jashari]] garrison on the road to [[Kosovo Polje]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWidespread violence broke out in Pristina. Serbian and Yugoslav forces shelled several districts and, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale expulsions of ethnic Albanians accompanied by widespread looting and destruction of Albanian properties.

With the development of culture and especially after the last war in 1999, Pristina had a progress on holding these kinds of events. Every year various types of trade fairs take place in the capital city. The essence of these fairs is usually temporary; some last only an afternoon while others may last around 3 days, a week or even longer. They have grown in size and importance over the years.

The old town stretching out between the Vellusha and Prishtevka rivers which are both covered over today, became an important crafts and trade center. Pristina was famous for its annual trade fairs (''Panair'')<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> and its goat hide and goat hair articles. Around 50 different crafts were practiced from tanning to leather dying, belt making and silk weaving, as well as crafts related to the military \u2013 armorers, smiths, and saddle makers. As early as 1485, Pristina artisans also started producing gunpowder. Trade was thriving and there was a growing colony of [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] traders (from modern day [[Dubrovnik]]) providing the link between Pristina's craftsmen and the outside world.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The first mosque was constructed in the late 14th century while still under Serbian rule.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The 1487 defter recorded 412 Christian and 94 Muslim households in Pristina, which at the time was administratively part of the [[Sanjak of Vu\u010ditrn]].\nIn the early Ottoman era, [[Islam]] was an urban phenomenon and only spread slowly with increasing urbanization. The travel writer [[Evliya Celebi]], visiting Pristina in the 1660s was impressed with its fine gardens and vineyards.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />  In those years, Pristina was part of the V\u0131\u00e7\u0131t\u0131r\u0131n Sanjak and its 2,000 families enjoyed the peace and stability of the Ottoman era. Economic life was controlled by the guild system (''esnafs'') with the tanners' and bakers' guild controlling prices, limiting unfair competition and acting as banks for their members. Religious life was dominated by religious charitable organizations often building mosques or fountains and providing charity to the poor.\nDuring the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683\u20131699)|Austro-Turkish War]] in the late 17th century, Pristina citizens under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]] pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. Under Austrian occupation, the Fatih Mosque (''Mbretit Mosque'') was briefly converted to a [[Jesuit]] church.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> Following the Austrian defeat in January 1690, Pristina's inhabitants were left at the mercy of Ottoman and [[Tatar]] troops who took revenge against the local population as punishment for their co-operation with the Austrians. A French officer traveling to Pristina noted soon afterwards that \"Pristina looked impressive from a distance but close up it is a mass of muddy streets and houses made of earth\".<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Modern===\n\n[[File:Monument of Brotherhood and Unity in Pristina.jpg|thumb|left|190px|The Monument of '''[[Brotherhood and Unity]]''' in the centre.

That year the railway between [[Salonika]] and [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]] started operations and the seat of the vilayet of Prizren was relocated to Pristina. This privileged position as capital of the Ottoman vilayet lasted only for a short while. from January until August 1912, Pristina was liberated from Ottoman rule by Albanian rebel forces led by [[Hasan Prishtina]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Bogdanovi\u0107\n| first      = Dimitrije\n| authorlink = Dimitrije Bogdanovi\u0107\n| editor        = Antonije Isakovi\u0107\n| title         = Knjiga o Kosovu\n| url           = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/index.html\n| accessdate    = January 9, 2011\n| volume    = 2\n| origyear  = 1984\n|date=November 2000\n| publisher = [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]\n| location  = Belgrade\n| language  = Serbian\n| chapter   = Albanski pokreti 1908\u20131912.\n|trans-chapter=| chapterurl    = http://www.kosovo.net/sk/rastko-kosovo/istorija/knjiga_o_kosovu/bogdanovic-kosovo_2.html\n| quote         =...&nbsp;ustanici su uspeli da&nbsp;... ovladaju celim kosovskim vilajetom do polovine avgusta 1912, \u0161to zna\u010di da su tada imali u svojim rukama Pri\u0161tinu, Novi Pazar, Sjenicu pa \u010dak i Skoplje&nbsp;...

The Yugoslav communist slogan at the time was '''uni\u0161ti stari graditi novi''' (destroy the old, build the new). In a misguided effort to modernize the town, communists set out to destroy the Ottoman bazaar and large parts of the historic center, including mosques, catholic churches and Ottoman houses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> A second agreement signed between Yugoslavia and Turkey in 1953 led to the exodus of several hundreds more Albanian families from Pristina. They left behind their homes, properties and businesses.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> However, this policy changed under the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|new constitution]] ratified in 1974. Few of the Ottoman town houses survived the communists' modernization drive, with the exception of those that were nationalized like today's Emin Gjiku Museum or the building of the Institute for the Protection of Monuments.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAs capital city and seat of the government, Pristina creamed off a large share of Yugoslav development funds channeled into Kosovo. As a result, the city's population and its economy changed rapidly. In 1966, Pristina had few paved roads, the old town houses had running water and [[cholera]] was still a problem. [[Prizren]] continued to be the largest town in Kosovo. Massive investments in state institutions like the newly founded [[University of Pristina (1969\u20131999)|University of Pristina]], the construction of new high-rise socialist apartment blocks and a new industrial zone on the outskirts of Pristina attracted large number of internal migrants. This ended a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]] and gave a major boost to Albanian-language education and culture in Kosovo. The Albanians were also allowed to use the Albanian flag.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWithin a decade, Pristina nearly doubled its population from about 69,514 in 1971 to 109,208 in 1981.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> This golden age of externally financed rapid growth was cut short by Yugoslavia's economic collapse and the [[1981 protests in Kosovo|1981 student revolts]]. Pristina, like the rest of Kosovo slid into a deepening economic and social crisis. The year 1989 saw the revocation of Kosovo's autonomy under [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], the rise of [[Serb nationalism]] and mass dismissal of ethnic Albanians.<ref name=\"Warrander\" />\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n\n[[File:089 albanian graves kosovo.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Graves of those who died in the [[Kosovo War]] in Pristina.]]\n[[File:War-Torn Pristina, Kosovo.jpg|upright|thumb|160px|right|War-torn Pristina.]]\n\nFollowing the reduction of Kosovo's autonomy by [[President of Serbia|Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in 1989, a harshly repressive regime was imposed throughout Kosovo by the Yugoslav government with Albanians largely being purged from state industries and institutions.<ref name=\"Warrander\" /> The LDK's{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} role meant, that when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] began to attack Serbian and Yugoslav forces from 1996 onwards, Pristina remained largely calm until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo War]] in March 1999. Pristina was spared large scale destruction compared to towns like [[Gjakova]] or [[Pe\u0107]] that suffered heavily at the hands of Serbian forces. For their strategic importance, however, a number of military targets were hit in Pristina during NATO's aerial campaign, including the post office, police headquarters and army barracks (today's [[Adem Jashari]] garrison on the road to [[Kosovo Polje]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nWidespread violence broke out in Pristina.

With the development of culture and especially after the last war in 1999, Pristina had a progress on holding these kinds of events.

Previously, the members were part of Local 644 of the [[Conference of Studio Unions]] (CSU) working in film and theater. The overwhelming majority of Local 644's membership, however, had been made up of set painters and paperhangers and included set designers as well. It was not until the dissolution of the CSU after a long series of bitterly contested strikes that the scenic artists were able to organize exclusively. Those artists had been pioneers in their field, responsible for devising and developing the methods used to create representational scenery unsurpassed anywhere in the world.\n\nThe size and strength of the local grew with the inclusion of television contracts in the early 1950s. Television, at that time, was in effect an extension of live theater and required a lot of painted two-dimensional scenery instead of the three-dimensional sets used in film. As the nature of television scenery changed, the responsibilities of the television scenic artist broadened to include those of the set painter. Local 816 was the only local in the entertainment industry that worked in all three major areas of the business: film, television and theater.\n\nIn January 2003, the 850 members of ADG merged with the 650 member '''Scenic, Title and Graphic Artists''' to form the '''Art Directors Guild & Scenic, Title and Graphic Artists'''.\n\n====Illustrators, Storyboard Artists and Matte Artists====\n\nIn the 1930s, the Illustrators and Matte Artists were part of the Federation of Motion Picture Crafts.

From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later [[automobiles]], earning it the nickname \"Vehicle City\". [[General Motors]] (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|automobile manufacturing powerhouse]] for GM's [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]] divisions, especially [[Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Post-World_War_II_prosperity:_1945\u20131973|after]] [[World War II]] up until the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|early 1980s recession]].

The city sank into a deep [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved from 196,940 to 102,434.

The [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwa burial grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/ancestral_remains_recovered_fr.html|title=Ancestral remains recovered from American Indian burial ground in Flint|work=MLive.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===\nIn 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwas on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the [[Saginaw Trail|overland route]] between Detroit and [[Saginaw]], Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. [[Buick Motor Company]], after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  AC Spark Plug (now part of [[Delphi Automotive|Delphi]]) originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the [[Dort Motor Car Company|Dort]], [[Little (automobile)|Little]], [[Flint (automobile)|Flint]], and [[Mason Truck|Mason]] brands.  Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Buick]]s were built in Flint.\n\n===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===\n{{Main|Flint, Michigan auto industry|History of General Motors}}\nIn 1904, local entrepreneur [[William C. Durant]] was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html General Motors | Corporate Information \u2013 History | GM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221410/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended [[Louis Chevrolet]] and founded [[Chevrolet]], which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.\n\nThe city's mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor [[William H. McKeighan]] in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK lead the recall effort and supported [[Judson L. Transue|Judson Transue]], Cutbertson's elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief.  McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928.<ref>{{cite news |first=James M. |last=Miller |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Crackdowns on 'reds,' booze didn't silence decade's roar |url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html |work=[[Flint Journal]]:  Journal of the 20th Century |publisher=Booth Newspapers |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527003224/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html|archivedate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes which angered city leaders enough to push for changes in the city charter.<ref name=fj20c>{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kim|title=Flint mayor commanded attention from \u2013 voters, police|url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|accessdate=October 24, 2014|work=Journal of the 20th Century|publisher=The Flint Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109020208/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|archivedate=November 9, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government.

The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the [[Flint Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day. On June 8, 1953, The [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado]], a large F5 [[tornado]], struck the city, killing 116 people.\n\n===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===\nSince the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from [[disinvestment]], [[deindustrialization]], [[depopulation]], [[urban decay]], as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of \"[[white flight]]\" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports.\n\nIn the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]], increased [[automation]], and moving jobs to non-[[Labor unions in the United States|union]] facilities.\n\nThis decline was highlighted in the film ''[[Roger & Me]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] (the title refers to [[Roger B. Smith]], the CEO of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished [[AutoWorld (theme park)|AutoWorld]]) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\nand ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''\n[[File:Buickcityflint.JPG|thumb|250px|The demolition site of Buick City, for many years [[General Motors]]' flagship factory on the North side.]]\n\n===21st century===\n\n====First financial emergency: 2002\u20132004====\nBy 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.<ref name=fj2>{{cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time?

The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, [[Darnell Earley]], in the city administrator position.\n\nIn August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor [[James W. Rutherford|James Rutherford]] to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency [[demolition]]s.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that Emergency Financial Managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nEmergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September 2003, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in [[sewerage|sewer]] and road projects. [[Don Williamson]] was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003\u20132004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nWith pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the Mayor's pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004\u201305 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.<ref name=fj2/>\n\n====Redevelopment====\n[[File:First National Bank and Trust Company Building - Flint Michigan.jpg|thumb|Renovated First National Bank building in downtown Flint.]]\nIn November 2013, [[American Cast Iron Pipe Company]] (ACIPCO), a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former [[Buick City]] site purchasing the property from the [[RACER Trust]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20131113/BUSINESS0101/311130151/Flint-Buick-City-American-Cast-Iron-Pipe-Co-General-Motors-RACER-GM Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property] ''Detroit Free Press'', November 13, 2013</ref>\n\nCommercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.

From the late 19th century to the mid 20th century, the city was a leading manufacturer of carriages and later [[automobiles]], earning it the nickname \"Vehicle City\". [[General Motors]] (GM) was founded in Flint in 1908, and the city grew into an [[Flint, Michigan auto industry|automobile manufacturing powerhouse]] for GM's [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]] divisions, especially [[Economic_history_of_the_United_States#Post-World_War_II_prosperity:_1945\u20131973|after]] [[World War II]] up until the [[Early 1980s recession in the United States|early 1980s recession]]. Flint was also the home of the [[Flint Sit-Down Strike]] of 1936\u201337 that played a vital role in the formation of the [[United Automobile Workers]].\n\nSince the late 1960s, Flint has faced several crises. The city sank into a deep [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] after GM significantly downsized its workforce in the area from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. From 1960 to 2010, the population of the city nearly halved from 196,940 to 102,434.

The [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] had several convenient fords which became points of contention among rival tribes, as attested by the presence of arrowheads and burial mounds near it. Some of the city currently resides atop ancient Ojibwa burial grounds.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2009/12/ancestral_remains_recovered_fr.html|title=Ancestral remains recovered from American Indian burial ground in Flint|work=MLive.com|access-date=July 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===19th century: lumber and the beginnings of the automobile industry===\nIn 1819, Jacob Smith, a fur trader on cordial terms with both the local Ojibwas and the territorial government founded a trading post at the Grand Traverse of the Flint River. On several occasions, Smith negotiated land exchanges with the Ojibwas on behalf of the U.S. government, and he was highly regarded on both sides. Smith apportioned many of his holdings to his children. As the ideal stopover on the [[Saginaw Trail|overland route]] between Detroit and [[Saginaw]], Flint grew into a small but prosperous village, and incorporated in 1855.  The 1860 U.S. census indicated that Genesee County had a population of 22,498 of Michigan's 750,000.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Flint became a center of the Michigan lumber industry.  Revenue from lumber funded the establishment of a local carriage-making industry.  As horse-drawn carriages gave way to the automobiles, Flint then naturally grew into a major player in the nascent auto industry. [[Buick Motor Company]], after a rudimentary start in Detroit, soon moved to Flint.  AC Spark Plug (now part of [[Delphi Automotive|Delphi]]) originated in Flint.  These were followed by several now-defunct automobile marques such as the [[Dort Motor Car Company|Dort]], [[Little (automobile)|Little]], [[Flint (automobile)|Flint]], and [[Mason Truck|Mason]] brands.  Chevrolet's first (and for many years, main) manufacturing facility was also in Flint, although the Chevrolet headquarters were in Detroit.  For a brief period, all [[Chevrolet]]s and [[Buick]]s were built in Flint.\n\n===Early and mid-20th century: the auto industry takes shape===\n{{Main|Flint, Michigan auto industry|History of General Motors}}\nIn 1904, local entrepreneur [[William C. Durant]] was brought in to manage Buick, which became the largest manufacturer of automobiles by 1908. In 1908, Durant founded [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], filing incorporation papers in New Jersey, with headquarters in Flint. GM moved its headquarters to Detroit in the mid-1920s.<ref>[http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html General Motors | Corporate Information \u2013 History | GM<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610221410/http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1900.html |date=June 10, 2011 }}</ref> Durant lost control of GM twice during his lifetime. On the first occasion, he befriended [[Louis Chevrolet]] and founded [[Chevrolet]], which was a runaway success. He used the capital from this success to buy back share control. He later lost decisive control again, permanently. Durant experienced financial ruin in the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and subsequently ran a bowling alley in Flint until the time of his death in 1947.\n\nThe city's mayors were targeted for recall twice, Mayor David Cuthbertson in 1924 and Mayor [[William H. McKeighan]] in 1927. Recall supporters in both cases were jailed by the police. Cuthbertson had angered the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] by the appointment of a Catholic police chief. The KKK lead the recall effort and supported [[Judson L. Transue|Judson Transue]], Cutbertson's elected successor. Transue however did not remove the police chief.  McKeighan survived his recall only to face conspiracy charges in 1928.<ref>{{cite news |first=James M. |last=Miller |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Crackdowns on 'reds,' booze didn't silence decade's roar |url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html |work=[[Flint Journal]]:  Journal of the 20th Century |publisher=Booth Newspapers |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527003224/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920main.html|archivedate=May 27, 2011}}</ref> McKeighan was under investigation for a multitude of crimes which angered city leaders enough to push for changes in the city charter.<ref name=fj20c>{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Kim|title=Flint mayor commanded attention from \u2013 voters, police|url=http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|accessdate=October 24, 2014|work=Journal of the 20th Century|publisher=The Flint Journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041109020208/http://www.flintjournal.com/20thcentury/1920/1920flintmayor.html|archivedate=November 9, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the city adopted a new city charter with a council-manager form of government.

The decades of the 1950s and 1960s are seen as the height of Flint's prosperity and influence.  They culminated with the establishment of many local institutions, most notably including the [[Flint Cultural Center]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flintcultural.org/ |title=Flint Cultural Center |publisher=Flintcultural.org |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>  This landmark remains one of the city's chief commercial and artistic draws to this day. On June 8, 1953, The [[1953 Flint-Beecher tornado]], a large F5 [[tornado]], struck the city, killing 116 people.\n\n===Late 20th century: deindustrialization and demographic changes===\nSince the late 1960s through the end of the 20th century, Flint has suffered from [[disinvestment]], [[deindustrialization]], [[depopulation]], [[urban decay]], as well as high rates of crime, unemployment and poverty. Initially, this took the form of \"[[white flight]]\" that afflicted many urban industrialized American towns and cities.  Given Flint's role in the automotive industry, this decline was exacerbated by the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the U.S. auto industry's subsequent loss of market share to imports.\n\nIn the 1980s, the rate of deindustrialization accelerated again with local GM employment falling from a 1978 high of 80,000 to under 8,000 by 2010. Only 10% of the manufacturing work force from its height remains in Flint. Many factors have been blamed, including [[outsourcing]], [[offshoring]], increased [[automation]], and moving jobs to non-[[Labor unions in the United States|union]] facilities.\n\nThis decline was highlighted in the film ''[[Roger & Me]]'' by [[Michael Moore]] (the title refers to [[Roger B. Smith]], the CEO of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] during the 1980s). Also highlighted in Moore's documentary was the failure of city officials to reverse the trends with entertainment options (e.g. the now-demolished [[AutoWorld (theme park)|AutoWorld]]) during the 1980s. Moore, a native of [[Davison, Michigan|Davison]] (a Flint suburb), revisited Flint in his later movies, including ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'', ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''\nand ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''\n[[File:Buickcityflint.JPG|thumb|250px|The demolition site of Buick City, for many years [[General Motors]]' flagship factory on the North side.]]\n\n===21st century===\n\n====First financial emergency: 2002\u20132004====\nBy 2002, Flint had accrued $30 million in debt.<ref name=fj2>{{cite news|last=Mostafavi|first=Beata|title=What happened last time?

The emergency financial manager displaced the temporary mayor, [[Darnell Earley]], in the city administrator position.\n\nIn August 2002, city voters elected former Mayor [[James W. Rutherford|James Rutherford]] to finish the remainder of Stanley's term of office.  On September 24,  Kurtz commissioned a salary and wage study for top city officials from an outside accounting and consulting firm.  The financial manager then installed a new code enforcement program for annual rental inspections and emergency [[demolition]]s.  On October 8, Kurtz ordered cuts in pay for the mayor (from $107,000 to $24,000) and the City Council members (from $23,000 to $18,000).  He also eliminated insurance benefits for most officials.  After spending $245,000 fighting the takeover, the City Council ended the lawsuits on October 14.  Immediately thereafter on October 16, a new interim financial plan was put in place by the manager.  This plan initiated controls on hiring, overnight travel and spending by city employees.  On November 12, Kurtz directed the city's retirement board to stop unusual pension benefits, which had decreased some retiree pensions by 3.5%.  Kurtz sought the return of overpayments to the pension fund.  However, in December, the state attorney general stated that Emergency Financial Managers do not have authority over the retirement system.  With contract talks stalled, Kurtz stated that there either need to be cuts or layoffs to union employees.  That same month, the city's recreation centers were temporarily closed.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nEmergency measures continued in 2003.  In May, Kurtz increased water and sewer bills by 11% and shut down operations of the ombudsman's office.  In September 2003, a 4% pay cut was agreed to by the city's largest union.  In October, Kurtz moved in favor of infrastructure improvements, authorizing $1 million in [[sewerage|sewer]] and road projects. [[Don Williamson]] was elected a full-term mayor and sworn in on November 10.  In December, city audits reported nearly $14 million in reductions in the city deficit.  For the 2003\u20132004 budget year, estimates decreased that amount to between $6 million and $8 million.<ref name=fj2/>\n\nWith pressure from Kurtz for large layoffs and replacement of the board on February 17, 2004, the City Retirement Board agreed to four proposals reducing the amount of the city's contribution into the system.  On March 24, Kurtz indicated that he would raise the City Council's and the Mayor's pay and in May, Kurtz laid off 10 workers as part of 35 job cuts for the 2004\u201305 budget.  In June 2004, Kurtz reported that the financial emergency was over.<ref name=fj2/>\n\n====Redevelopment====\n[[File:First National Bank and Trust Company Building - Flint Michigan.jpg|thumb|Renovated First National Bank building in downtown Flint.]]\nIn November 2013, [[American Cast Iron Pipe Company]] (ACIPCO), a [[Birmingham, Alabama]] based company, became the first to build a production facility in Flint's former [[Buick City]] site purchasing the property from the [[RACER Trust]].<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20131113/BUSINESS0101/311130151/Flint-Buick-City-American-Cast-Iron-Pipe-Co-General-Motors-RACER-GM Pipe maker to add 60 jobs at Flint's Buick City property] ''Detroit Free Press'', November 13, 2013</ref>\n\nCommercially, local organizations have attempted to pool their resources in the central business district and to expand and bolster higher education at four local institutions.

The episode aired on March 30, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy and Kim marry; with spousal privilege, Jimmy can tell Kim about his cases without lying.\n\nLalo is charged with murder. Jimmy represents him at his arraignment and Lalo is remanded. He directs Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so he will not go to trial, promising that if successful, Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\". Jimmy tests his new relationship with Kim by telling her about Lalo, including his intent not to fight for Lalo's release.\n\nRich and Kim meet with Kevin and apologize for the outcome of Acker's case, and Kevin indicates he will let them know whether he decides to retain them. Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office and tells him he consistently ignored their advice. She tells Kevin that whether he retains them or obtains new lawyers, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by telling Kim and Rich he will see them at their regular Thursday meeting.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is past the problem that caused his recent anger. Nacho tells Mike Lalo wants Nacho to burn down Gus's main Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant. Gus and other subsidiary owners provide reports to Peter, Madrigal's CEO, in Houston. Gus later meets with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab and warns them that Lalo remains a threat even while incarcerated. Peter panics, and Gus calms him by reminding him of their shared experience in Santiago. On his return, Gus and Nacho protect Nacho's role as the mole inside the Salamanca organization by vandalizing Gus's flagship restaurant, then setting a delayed explosion that burns it.\n\nGus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Jimmy details about the investigative work he did under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the information at the bail hearing to accuse police of witness tampering. The judge grants bail of {{USD|7 million}} cash, which Lalo tells a shocked Jimmy he can pay.\n\nHoward approaches Jimmy about working at HHM and Jimmy says he is still considering it. Howard realizes Jimmy has been toying with him, including damaging his car and disrupting his recent lunch, and rescinds the offer. Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says he has grown too big for the constraints of an HHM job.\n\n==Production==\n\"JMM\" is the directorial debut of Melissa Bernstein, an executive producer on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]''.<ref name=\"rs review\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-7-jmm-974534/ |title='Better Call Saul' Recap: Just Make Money |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=March 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] to ''Breaking Bad'' were included in this episode.
