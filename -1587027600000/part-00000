In the local dialect the name is ''Kowelenz''.</ref> before 1926, is a [[Germany|German]] city situated on both banks of the [[Rhine]] where it is joined by the [[Moselle]].\n\nKoblenz was established as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military post by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] around 8 B.C. Its name originates from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|(ad) c\u014dnfluent\u0113s}}'', meaning \"(at the) [[confluence]]\"<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coblenz|volume=6|page=612}}</ref> of the two rivers. The actual confluence is today known as the \"[[Deutsches Eck|German Corner]]\", a symbol of the [[unification of Germany]] that features an [[Emperor William monuments|equestrian statue of Emperor William I]]. The city celebrated its 2000th anniversary in 1992.\n\nAfter [[Mainz]] and [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]], it is the third-largest city in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], with a population of around 112,000 (2015). Koblenz lies in the [[Rhineland]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Koblenz history}}{{Historical populations|1469|1,193|1663|1,409|1800|7,992|1836|13,307|1871|24,902|1900|45,147|1910|56,487|1919|56,676|1925|58,161|1933|65,257|1939|91,098|1950|66,444|1961|99,240|1970|101,374|1987|108,246|2011|107,825|2018|114,024|align=right|footnote=Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions.\nsource:<ref>[http://www.statistik.rlp.de/de/regional/geowebdienste/bevoelkerung/ Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland Pfalz]</ref>}}[[File:Koblenz braun hogenberg.jpeg|thumb|Koblenz in the 16th century]]\n[[File:Kurf\u00fcrstliches Schloss.JPG|thumb|Palace of the archbishop-electors of [[Archbishop-Electorate of Trier|Trier]].]]\n[[File:Separatisten der Rheinischen Republik vor dem Kurf\u00fcrstlichen Schloss in Koblenz, 22 November 1923.jpg|thumb|[[Josef Friedrich Matthes]] in 1923 in Koblenz during the short lived [[Rhenish Republic]]]]\n\n===Ancient era===\nAround 1000 BC, early fortifications were erected on the [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein]] hill on the opposite side of the Moselle. In 55 BC, Roman troops commanded by [[Julius Caesar]] reached the Rhine and built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge]] between Koblenz and [[Andernach]]. About 9 BC, the ''\"Castellum apud Confluentes\"'', was one of the military posts established by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]].\n\nRemains of a large bridge built in 49 AD by the Romans are still visible. The Romans built two castles as protection for the bridge, one in 9 AD and another in the 2nd century, the latter being destroyed by the [[Franks]] in 259. North of Koblenz was a temple of Mercury and [[Rosmerta]] (a Gallo-Roman deity), which remained in use up to the 5th century.\n\n[[File:Mayen Koblenz.jpg|thumb|Map of the Koblenz region.|left]]\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was conquered by the Franks and became a royal seat. After the division of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire, it was included in the lands of his son [[Louis the Pious]] (814). In 837, it was assigned to [[Charles the Bald]], and a few years later it was here that Carolingian heirs discussed what was to become the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), by which the city became part of [[Lotharingia]] under [[Lothair I]]. In 860 and 922, Koblenz was the scene of ecclesiastical synods. At the first synod, held in the Liebfrauenkirche, the reconciliation of [[Louis the German]] with his half-brother Charles the Bald took place. The city was sacked and destroyed by the [[Norsemen]] in 882. In 925, it became part of the eastern German Kingdom, later the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Koblenz castle and building.jpg|left|thumb|Fortress (Festung) [[Ehrenbreitstein]] in the background.]]\n\nIn 1018, the city was given by the emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] to the archbishop-elector of Trier after receiving a charter. It remained in the possession of his successors until the end of the 18th century, having been their main residence since the 17th century. Emperor [[conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was elected here in 1138. In 1198, the battle between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] took place nearby. In 1216, prince-bishop [[Theoderich von Wied]] donated part of the lands of the basilica and the hospital to the [[Teutonic Knights]], which later became the ''Deutsches Eck''.\n\nIn 1249\u20131254, Koblenz was given new walls by Archbishop [[Arnold II of Isenburg]]; and it was partly to overawe the turbulent citizens that successive archbishops built and strengthened the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein that still dominates the city.\n\n===Modern era===\nThe city was a member of the league of the Rhenish cities which rose in the 13th century. The [[Teutonic Knights]] founded the [[Bailiwick of Koblenz]] in or around 1231. Koblenz attained great prosperity and it continued to advance until the disaster of the [[Thirty Years' War]] brought about a rapid decline. After [[Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern|Philip Christopher, elector of Trier]], surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French, the city received an imperial garrison in 1632. However, this force was soon expelled by the Swedes, who in their turn handed the city over again to the French. Imperial forces finally succeeded in retaking it by storm in 1636.\n\nIn 1688, Koblenz was besieged by the French under [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Boufflers|Marshal de Boufflers]], but they only succeeded in bombing the Old City (''Altstadt'') into ruins, destroying among other buildings the Old Merchants' Hall (''Kaufhaus''), which was restored in its present form in 1725. The city was the residence of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|archbishop-electors of Trier]] from 1690 to 1801. \n[[File:Buga 2011 Koblenz - Rheinseilbahn 07-2010.jpg|thumb|Since 2010 the [[Koblenz cable car]] has been Germany's biggest aerial tramway]]\nIn 1786, the last archbishop-elector of Trier, [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony]], greatly assisted the extension and improvement of the city, turning the [[Ehrenbreitstein]] into a magnificent baroque palace. After the fall of the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] in 1789, the city became, through the invitation of the archbishop-elector's chief minister, Ferdinand Freiherr von Duminique, one of the principal rendezvous points for French [[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]. The archbishop-elector approved of this because he was the uncle of the persecuted king of France, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Among the many royalist French refugees who flooded into the city were [[Louis XVI]]'s two younger brothers, the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]] and the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]]. In addition, [[Louis XVI]]'s cousin, Prince [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9]], arrived and formed an army of young aristocrats willing to fight the [[French Revolution]] and restore the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. The ''[[Army of Cond\u00e9]]'' joined with an allied army of Prussian and Austrian soldiers led by Duke [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand]] of [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]] in an unsuccessful invasion of France in 1792. This drew down the wrath of the [[First French Republic]] on the archbishop-elector; in 1794, Coblenz was taken by the French Revolutionary army under [[Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9verin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]] (who was killed during the siege), and, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801) it was made the capital of the new French [[d\u00e9partment]] of [[Rhin-et-Moselle]]. In 1814, it was occupied by the [[Russia]]ns. The [[Congress of Vienna]] assigned the city to [[Prussia]], and in 1822, it was made the seat of government for the Prussian [[Rhine Province]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]], France [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied]] the area once again. In defiance of the French, the German populace of the city insisted on using the more German spelling of '''Koblenz''' after 1926. During [[World War II]] it was the location of the command of German [[Army Group B]] and like many other German cities, it was heavily bombed and rebuilt afterwards. Between 1947 and 1950, it served as the [[Seat of government#Seat of government|seat of government]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].\n\nThe [[Rhine Gorge]] was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2002, with Koblenz marking the northern end. \n[[File:Koblenz im Buga-Jahr 2011 - Festung Ehrenbreitstein 45.jpg|center|thumb|500px|Fortress Ehrenbreitstein as seen from Koblenz.]]\n[[File:Koblenz hdr Panorama.jpg|center|thumb|700px|HDR Panorama of Koblenz from Metternich.]]\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Largest groups of foreign residents'''\n|-\\\n!Nationality || Population (2017)\n|-\n|{{flag|Turkey}} || 1,505\n|-\n|{{flag|Poland}} || 1,278\n|-\n|{{flag|Bulgaria}} || 996\n|-\n|{{flag|Romania}} || 780\n|-\n|{{flag|Ukraine}} || 627\n|-\n|{{flag|Italy}} || 613\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}} || 600\n|-\n|{{flag|Syria}} || 595\n|}\n\n==Main sights==\n===Fortified cities===\n[[File:Koblenz - Basilika St. Kastor Westfassade.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of St. Castor]]]]\n[[File:Schloss Stolzenfels 01 Koblenz 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Stolzenfels Castle]]]]\n[[File:US-Luftangriff Koblenz 19-09-1944.jpg|thumb|US Air Force bombing in 1944]]\n[[File:Koblenz - Panorama von Festung Ehrenbreitstein.jpg|thumb|Panoramic View at Koblenz with monument at [[Deutsches Eck]]]]\n{{main|Koblenz Fortress}}\nIts defensive works are extensive, and consist of strong forts crowning the hills encircling the city to the west, and the citadel of [[Ehrenbreitstein]] on the opposite bank of the Rhine. The old city was triangular in shape, two sides being bounded by the Rhine and Mosel and the third by a line of fortifications. The latter were razed in 1890, and the city was permitted to expand in this direction. The [[Koblenz Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) was built on a spacious site outside the former walls at the junction of the [[Linke Rheinstrecke|Cologne-Mainz railway]] and the strategic [[Cannons Railway|Metz-Berlin line]]. In April 2011 [[Koblenz-Stadtmitte station]] was opened in the inner city to coincide with the opening of the [[Federal Garden Show 2011]]. The Rhine is crossed by the [[Pfaffendorf Bridge]], originally the location of a rail bridge, but now a road bridge and, a mile south of city, by the [[Horchheim Railway Bridge]], consisting of two wide and lofty spans carrying the [[Lahn Valley Railway]], part of the Berlin railway referred to above. The Moselle is spanned by a Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, erected in 1344, two modern road bridges and also by two railway bridges.\n\nSince 1890, the city has consisted of the Altstadt (old city) and the Neustadt (new city) or Klemenstadt. Of these, the Altstadt is closely built and has only a few fine streets and squares, while the Neustadt possesses numerous broad streets and a handsome frontage along the Rhine.\n\n===Other sights===\nIn the more ancient part of Koblenz stand several buildings which have a historical interest. Prominent among these, near the point of confluence of the rivers, is the [[Basilica of St. Castor]] or ''Kastorkirche'', dedicated to [[Castor of Karden]], with four towers. The church was founded in 836 by [[Louis the Pious]], but the present [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building was completed in 1208, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] vaulted roof dating from 1498. In front of the church of Saint Castor stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to commemorate Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Not long after, Russian troops occupied Koblenz; and St. Priest, their commander, added in irony these words: \"Vu et approuv\u00e9 par nous, Commandant russe de la Ville de Coblence: Janvier 1er, 1814.\"\n\nIn this quarter of the city, too, is the ''Liebfrauenkirche'', a fine church (nave 1250, choir 1404\u20131431) with lofty late Romanesque towers; the castle of the electors of [[Trier]], erected in 1280, which now contains the municipal picture gallery; and the family house of the Metternichs, where [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Austrian statesman, was born in 1773. Also notable is the church of St. Florian, with a two towers fa\u00e7ade from c. 1110.\n\nThe former Jesuit College is a Baroque edifice by J.C. Sebastiani (1694\u20131698) serves as the current City Hall.\n\nNear Koblenz is the [[Lahneck Castle]] near Lahnstein, open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October.\n\nThe city is close to the [[Bronze Age]] [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] at [[Goloring]], a possible [[Urnfield]] calendar constructed some 3000 years ago.\n\n===Electoral palace===\n{{main|Electoral Palace (Koblenz)}}\nIn the modern part of the city lies the palace (''Residenzschloss''), with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt. It was built in 1778\u20131786 by [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony|Clemens Wenceslaus]], the last elector of Trier, following a design by the French architect P.M. d'Ixnard. In 1833, the palace was used as a barracks, and became a terminal post for the [[Prussian semaphore system|optical telecommunications system]] that originated in Potsdam. Today, the elector's former palace is a museum. Among other exhibits, it contains some [[Gobelin]] tapestries. From it some gardens and promenades (Kaiserin Augusta Anlagen) stretch along the bank of the Rhine, and in them is a memorial to the poet [[Max von Schenkendorf]]. A statue to the empress Augusta, whose favourite residence was Coblenz, stands in the Luisenplatz.\n\n===William I monument===\nThe [[Teutonic Knights]] were given an area for their [[Deutschherrenhaus]] [[Bailiwick]] right at the confluence of the Rhine and Mosel, which became known as ''German Corner'' ([[Deutsches Eck]]).\n\nIn 1897, a monument to [[German Emperor]] [[William I of Germany]], mounted on a 14-metre-high horse, was inaugurated there by his grandson [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]. The architect was [[Bruno Schmitz]], who was responsible for a number of nationalistic German monuments and memorials. The ''German Corner'' is since associated with this monument, the (re) foundation of the German Empire and the German refusal of any French claims to the area, as described in the song \"[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]\" together with the \"Wacht am Rhein\" called \"[[Niederwalddenkmal]]\" some {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=off}} upstream.\n\nDuring World War II, the statue was destroyed by US artillery. The French occupation administration intended the complete destruction of the monument and wanted to replace it with a new one.\n\nIn 1953, Bundespr\u00e4sident [[Theodor Heuss]] re-dedicated the monument to [[German reunification|German unity]], adding the signs of the remaining western federal states as well as the ones of the lost areas in the East. A [[Flag of Germany]] has flown there since. The [[Saarland]] was added four years later after the population had voted to join Germany.\n\nIn the 1980s, a film clip of the monument was often shown on late night TV when the national anthem was played to mark the end of the day, a practise which was discontinued when nonstop broadcasting became common.\nOn 3 October 1990, the very day the former GDR states joined, their signs were added to the monument.\n\nAs German unity was considered complete and the areas under Polish administration were ceded to Poland, the monument lost its official active purpose, now only reminding of history. In 1993, the flag was replaced by a copy of the statue, donated by a local couple. The day chosen for the reinstatement of the statue, however, caused controversy as it coincided with [[Sedantag]] (Sedan Day) (2 September 1870) a day of celebration remembering Germany's victory over France in the Battle of Sedan.<ref>Jefferies, Matthew, ''Imperial Culture in Germany, 1871\u20131918'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2003)</ref> The event was widely celebrated from the 1870s until the 1910s.\n\n== Incorporated villages ==\nFormerly separate villages now incorporated into the jurisdiction of the city of Koblenz\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

In the local dialect the name is ''Kowelenz''.</ref> before 1926, is a [[Germany|German]] city situated on both banks of the [[Rhine]] where it is joined by the [[Moselle]].\n\nKoblenz was established as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military post by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] around 8 B.C. Its name originates from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|(ad) c\u014dnfluent\u0113s}}'', meaning \"(at the) [[confluence]]\"<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coblenz|volume=6|page=612}}</ref> of the two rivers. The actual confluence is today known as the \"[[Deutsches Eck|German Corner]]\", a symbol of the [[unification of Germany]] that features an [[Emperor William monuments|equestrian statue of Emperor William I]]. The city celebrated its 2000th anniversary in 1992.\n\nAfter [[Mainz]] and [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]], it is the third-largest city in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], with a population of around 112,000 (2015). Koblenz lies in the [[Rhineland]].\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Koblenz history}}{{Historical populations|1469|1,193|1663|1,409|1800|7,992|1836|13,307|1871|24,902|1900|45,147|1910|56,487|1919|56,676|1925|58,161|1933|65,257|1939|91,098|1950|66,444|1961|99,240|1970|101,374|1987|108,246|2011|107,825|2018|114,024|align=right|footnote=Population size may be affected by changes in administrative divisions.\nsource:<ref>[http://www.statistik.rlp.de/de/regional/geowebdienste/bevoelkerung/ Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland Pfalz]</ref>}}[[File:Koblenz braun hogenberg.jpeg|thumb|Koblenz in the 16th century]]\n[[File:Kurf\u00fcrstliches Schloss.JPG|thumb|Palace of the archbishop-electors of [[Archbishop-Electorate of Trier|Trier]].]]\n[[File:Separatisten der Rheinischen Republik vor dem Kurf\u00fcrstlichen Schloss in Koblenz, 22 November 1923.jpg|thumb|[[Josef Friedrich Matthes]] in 1923 in Koblenz during the short lived [[Rhenish Republic]]]]\n\n===Ancient era===\nAround 1000 BC, early fortifications were erected on the [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein]] hill on the opposite side of the Moselle. In 55 BC, Roman troops commanded by [[Julius Caesar]] reached the Rhine and built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge]] between Koblenz and [[Andernach]]. About 9 BC, the ''\"Castellum apud Confluentes\"'', was one of the military posts established by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]].\n\nRemains of a large bridge built in 49 AD by the Romans are still visible. The Romans built two castles as protection for the bridge, one in 9 AD and another in the 2nd century, the latter being destroyed by the [[Franks]] in 259. North of Koblenz was a temple of Mercury and [[Rosmerta]] (a Gallo-Roman deity), which remained in use up to the 5th century.\n\n[[File:Mayen Koblenz.jpg|thumb|Map of the Koblenz region.|left]]\n\n===Middle Ages===\nWith the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was conquered by the Franks and became a royal seat. After the division of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire, it was included in the lands of his son [[Louis the Pious]] (814). In 837, it was assigned to [[Charles the Bald]], and a few years later it was here that Carolingian heirs discussed what was to become the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), by which the city became part of [[Lotharingia]] under [[Lothair I]]. In 860 and 922, Koblenz was the scene of ecclesiastical synods. At the first synod, held in the Liebfrauenkirche, the reconciliation of [[Louis the German]] with his half-brother Charles the Bald took place. The city was sacked and destroyed by the [[Norsemen]] in 882. In 925, it became part of the eastern German Kingdom, later the [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Koblenz castle and building.jpg|left|thumb|Fortress (Festung) [[Ehrenbreitstein]] in the background.]]\n\nIn 1018, the city was given by the emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] to the archbishop-elector of Trier after receiving a charter. It remained in the possession of his successors until the end of the 18th century, having been their main residence since the 17th century. Emperor [[conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was elected here in 1138. In 1198, the battle between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] took place nearby. In 1216, prince-bishop [[Theoderich von Wied]] donated part of the lands of the basilica and the hospital to the [[Teutonic Knights]], which later became the ''Deutsches Eck''.\n\nIn 1249\u20131254, Koblenz was given new walls by Archbishop [[Arnold II of Isenburg]]; and it was partly to overawe the turbulent citizens that successive archbishops built and strengthened the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein that still dominates the city.\n\n===Modern era===\nThe city was a member of the league of the Rhenish cities which rose in the 13th century. The [[Teutonic Knights]] founded the [[Bailiwick of Koblenz]] in or around 1231. Koblenz attained great prosperity and it continued to advance until the disaster of the [[Thirty Years' War]] brought about a rapid decline. After [[Philipp Christoph von S\u00f6tern|Philip Christopher, elector of Trier]], surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French, the city received an imperial garrison in 1632. However, this force was soon expelled by the Swedes, who in their turn handed the city over again to the French. Imperial forces finally succeeded in retaking it by storm in 1636.\n\nIn 1688, Koblenz was besieged by the French under [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Boufflers|Marshal de Boufflers]], but they only succeeded in bombing the Old City (''Altstadt'') into ruins, destroying among other buildings the Old Merchants' Hall (''Kaufhaus''), which was restored in its present form in 1725. The city was the residence of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|archbishop-electors of Trier]] from 1690 to 1801. \n[[File:Buga 2011 Koblenz - Rheinseilbahn 07-2010.jpg|thumb|Since 2010 the [[Koblenz cable car]] has been Germany's biggest aerial tramway]]\nIn 1786, the last archbishop-elector of Trier, [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony]], greatly assisted the extension and improvement of the city, turning the [[Ehrenbreitstein]] into a magnificent baroque palace. After the fall of the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] in 1789, the city became, through the invitation of the archbishop-elector's chief minister, Ferdinand Freiherr von Duminique, one of the principal rendezvous points for French [[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]]. The archbishop-elector approved of this because he was the uncle of the persecuted king of France, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Among the many royalist French refugees who flooded into the city were [[Louis XVI]]'s two younger brothers, the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]] and the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]]. In addition, [[Louis XVI]]'s cousin, Prince [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9]], arrived and formed an army of young aristocrats willing to fight the [[French Revolution]] and restore the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]. The ''[[Army of Cond\u00e9]]'' joined with an allied army of Prussian and Austrian soldiers led by Duke [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand]] of [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]] in an unsuccessful invasion of France in 1792. This drew down the wrath of the [[First French Republic]] on the archbishop-elector; in 1794, Coblenz was taken by the French Revolutionary army under [[Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9verin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]] (who was killed during the siege), and, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801) it was made the capital of the new French [[d\u00e9partment]] of [[Rhin-et-Moselle]]. In 1814, it was occupied by the [[Russia]]ns. The [[Congress of Vienna]] assigned the city to [[Prussia]], and in 1822, it was made the seat of government for the Prussian [[Rhine Province]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]], France [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied]] the area once again. In defiance of the French, the German populace of the city insisted on using the more German spelling of '''Koblenz''' after 1926. During [[World War II]] it was the location of the command of German [[Army Group B]] and like many other German cities, it was heavily bombed and rebuilt afterwards. Between 1947 and 1950, it served as the [[Seat of government#Seat of government|seat of government]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].\n\nThe [[Rhine Gorge]] was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2002, with Koblenz marking the northern end. \n[[File:Koblenz im Buga-Jahr 2011 - Festung Ehrenbreitstein 45.jpg|center|thumb|500px|Fortress Ehrenbreitstein as seen from Koblenz.]]\n[[File:Koblenz hdr Panorama.jpg|center|thumb|700px|HDR Panorama of Koblenz from Metternich.]]\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|colspan=\"2\"|'''Largest groups of foreign residents'''\n|-\\\n!Nationality || Population (2017)\n|-\n|{{flag|Turkey}} || 1,505\n|-\n|{{flag|Poland}} || 1,278\n|-\n|{{flag|Bulgaria}} || 996\n|-\n|{{flag|Romania}} || 780\n|-\n|{{flag|Ukraine}} || 627\n|-\n|{{flag|Italy}} || 613\n|-\n|{{flag|Russia}} || 600\n|-\n|{{flag|Syria}} || 595\n|}\n\n==Main sights==\n===Fortified cities===\n[[File:Koblenz - Basilika St. Kastor Westfassade.jpg|thumb|[[Basilica of St. Castor]]]]\n[[File:Schloss Stolzenfels 01 Koblenz 2015.jpg|thumb|[[Stolzenfels Castle]]]]\n[[File:US-Luftangriff Koblenz 19-09-1944.jpg|thumb|US Air Force bombing in 1944]]\n[[File:Koblenz - Panorama von Festung Ehrenbreitstein.jpg|thumb|Panoramic View at Koblenz with monument at [[Deutsches Eck]]]]\n{{main|Koblenz Fortress}}\nIts defensive works are extensive, and consist of strong forts crowning the hills encircling the city to the west, and the citadel of [[Ehrenbreitstein]] on the opposite bank of the Rhine. The old city was triangular in shape, two sides being bounded by the Rhine and Mosel and the third by a line of fortifications. The latter were razed in 1890, and the city was permitted to expand in this direction. The [[Koblenz Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) was built on a spacious site outside the former walls at the junction of the [[Linke Rheinstrecke|Cologne-Mainz railway]] and the strategic [[Cannons Railway|Metz-Berlin line]]. In April 2011 [[Koblenz-Stadtmitte station]] was opened in the inner city to coincide with the opening of the [[Federal Garden Show 2011]]. The Rhine is crossed by the [[Pfaffendorf Bridge]], originally the location of a rail bridge, but now a road bridge and, a mile south of city, by the [[Horchheim Railway Bridge]], consisting of two wide and lofty spans carrying the [[Lahn Valley Railway]], part of the Berlin railway referred to above. The Moselle is spanned by a Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, erected in 1344, two modern road bridges and also by two railway bridges.\n\nSince 1890, the city has consisted of the Altstadt (old city) and the Neustadt (new city) or Klemenstadt. Of these, the Altstadt is closely built and has only a few fine streets and squares, while the Neustadt possesses numerous broad streets and a handsome frontage along the Rhine.\n\n===Other sights===\nIn the more ancient part of Koblenz stand several buildings which have a historical interest. Prominent among these, near the point of confluence of the rivers, is the [[Basilica of St. Castor]] or ''Kastorkirche'', dedicated to [[Castor of Karden]], with four towers. The church was founded in 836 by [[Louis the Pious]], but the present [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building was completed in 1208, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] vaulted roof dating from 1498. In front of the church of Saint Castor stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to commemorate Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Not long after, Russian troops occupied Koblenz; and St. Priest, their commander, added in irony these words: \"Vu et approuv\u00e9 par nous, Commandant russe de la Ville de Coblence: Janvier 1er, 1814.\"\n\nIn this quarter of the city, too, is the ''Liebfrauenkirche'', a fine church (nave 1250, choir 1404\u20131431) with lofty late Romanesque towers; the castle of the electors of [[Trier]], erected in 1280, which now contains the municipal picture gallery; and the family house of the Metternichs, where [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Austrian statesman, was born in 1773. Also notable is the church of St. Florian, with a two towers fa\u00e7ade from c. 1110.\n\nThe former Jesuit College is a Baroque edifice by J.C. Sebastiani (1694\u20131698) serves as the current City Hall.\n\nNear Koblenz is the [[Lahneck Castle]] near Lahnstein, open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October.\n\nThe city is close to the [[Bronze Age]] [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] at [[Goloring]], a possible [[Urnfield]] calendar constructed some 3000 years ago.\n\n===Electoral palace===\n{{main|Electoral Palace (Koblenz)}}\nIn the modern part of the city lies the palace (''Residenzschloss''), with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt. It was built in 1778\u20131786 by [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony|Clemens Wenceslaus]], the last elector of Trier, following a design by the French architect P.M. d'Ixnard. In 1833, the palace was used as a barracks, and became a terminal post for the [[Prussian semaphore system|optical telecommunications system]] that originated in Potsdam. Today, the elector's former palace is a museum. Among other exhibits, it contains some [[Gobelin]] tapestries. From it some gardens and promenades (Kaiserin Augusta Anlagen) stretch along the bank of the Rhine, and in them is a memorial to the poet [[Max von Schenkendorf]]. A statue to the empress Augusta, whose favourite residence was Coblenz, stands in the Luisenplatz.\n\n===William I monument===\nThe [[Teutonic Knights]] were given an area for their [[Deutschherrenhaus]] [[Bailiwick]] right at the confluence of the Rhine and Mosel, which became known as ''German Corner'' ([[Deutsches Eck]]).\n\nIn 1897, a monument to [[German Emperor]] [[William I of Germany]], mounted on a 14-metre-high horse, was inaugurated there by his grandson [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]. The architect was [[Bruno Schmitz]], who was responsible for a number of nationalistic German monuments and memorials. The ''German Corner'' is since associated with this monument, the (re) foundation of the German Empire and the German refusal of any French claims to the area, as described in the song \"[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]\" together with the \"Wacht am Rhein\" called \"[[Niederwalddenkmal]]\" some {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=off}} upstream.\n\nDuring World War II, the statue was destroyed by US artillery. The French occupation administration intended the complete destruction of the monument and wanted to replace it with a new one.\n\nIn 1953, Bundespr\u00e4sident [[Theodor Heuss]] re-dedicated the monument to [[German reunification|German unity]], adding the signs of the remaining western federal states as well as the ones of the lost areas in the East. A [[Flag of Germany]] has flown there since. The [[Saarland]] was added four years later after the population had voted to join Germany.\n\nIn the 1980s, a film clip of the monument was often shown on late night TV when the national anthem was played to mark the end of the day, a practise which was discontinued when nonstop broadcasting became common.\nOn 3 October 1990, the very day the former GDR states joined, their signs were added to the monument.\n\nAs German unity was considered complete and the areas under Polish administration were ceded to Poland, the monument lost its official active purpose, now only reminding of history. In 1993, the flag was replaced by a copy of the statue, donated by a local couple. The day chosen for the reinstatement of the statue, however, caused controversy as it coincided with [[Sedantag]] (Sedan Day) (2 September 1870) a day of celebration remembering Germany's victory over France in the Battle of Sedan.<ref>Jefferies, Matthew, ''Imperial Culture in Germany, 1871\u20131918'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2003)</ref> The event was widely celebrated from the 1870s until the 1910s.\n\n== Incorporated villages ==\nFormerly separate villages now incorporated into the jurisdiction of the city of Koblenz\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building. In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard).

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financing difficulties & an ongoing recession which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled resulted in the building's ownership was reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 and with the structure reaming abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

There is also an east\u2013west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network. The Galleria also doubles as a historical museum by displaying numerous artifacts from the old Canada Post building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcl.com/Projects-that-Inspire/Pages/Air-Canada-Centre.aspx|title=Air Canada Centre|work=PCL Constructors|access-date=November 15, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nIn its first ten years of operation, the new arena had an estimated economic benefit of $2.4&nbsp;billion. This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30&nbsp;million for 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>.

By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financing difficulties & an ongoing recession which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled resulted in the building's ownership was reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 and with the structure reaming abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

There is also an east\u2013west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30&nbsp;million for 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>.
