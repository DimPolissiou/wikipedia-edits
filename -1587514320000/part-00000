Its name was derived from the Portuguese phrase ''{{lang|pt|terra achanada}}'' which means ''flatland'' and was first mentioned by the historian Father [[Gaspar Frutuoso]] in '''''Saudades da Terra'''''. These lands were originally occupied and administered by Ant\u00e3o Rodrigues da C\u00e2mara, a descendant of the third Capitain-Donat\u00e1rio of S\u00e3o Miguel, but were sold, then tilled and sold to other settlers.\n\nBy 1526 the village had its own parochial church to the invocation of ''Nossa Senhora da Anuncia\u00e7\u00e3o'' (English: ''Our Lady of the Annunciation'') where members of the religious orders resided locally. The temple was the result of various remodeling projects starting at the end of 1782 until 1984.\n\nSince the 16th century, Achada has been a religious (later civil) parish, but it was only annexed into the municipality of Nordeste in 1820 (having previously pertained to the municipality of Ribeira Grande).\n\n==Economy==\nIts fertile lands, which extend the length of the Achada plain, have been the source of the region's economy. Agriculture and dairy production is typical in this area, including cereal crops and tubers.

{"title_page": "Scots property law", "text_new": "{{Scots law}}'''Scots property law''' governs the rules relating to [[property]] found in the legal jurisdiction of [[Scotland]]. As a hybrid legal system with both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] heritage, Scots property law is similar, but not identical, to property law in [[South African property law|South Africa]] and the American state of [[Law of Louisiana|Louisiana]].    \n\nThe term 'property' is wide-ranging but in this article, as in Scots law and many other jurisdictions, it does not solely describe land. Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules. In Scots property law, all 'things' can be classified according to their nature, discussed below, with four classes of property as a result:     \n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\nEach class of property has rules concerning the rights ''in rem'' (or [[Scots property law#The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The Numerus Clausus|real rights]]) an individual may have in that property.     \n\n== Legal Sources of Scots Property Law ==\nPrior to the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Kingdom of England|England & Wales]] unification as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], Scots Property law was largely governed by [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of Scotland]] and common law decisions by the [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scottish judiciary]]. Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5.</ref> Patrimonial rights that a person holds in a 'thing' or object are the focus of property law and Scots law distinguishes these 'rights in a 'thing<nowiki>''</nowiki> (in Latin: ''a jus in rem (Lit: a right in a thing)'') from any other rights that an individual may hold.\n\nThe recognised rights ''in rem'' a person can have in Scots law are<ref name=\":1\" />:\n\n* [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|ownership]]\n* [[Lease in Scots Law|Lease]] of heritable property.\n* Right in [[Security in Scots Property Law|Security]]\n* [[Servitudes in Scots law|Servitude]]\n* [[Real burdens in Scots law|Real burdens]]\n* [[Liferent in Scots law|Liferent]]\n\nOwnership is the main real right, with all other real rights subordinate to ownership<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Personal Rights and Real Rights ===\nScots law follows the [[Roman law]] classification of rights falling into either of two categories:  a ''jus in personam'' or a ''jus in rem'', which Nicholas describes as: \n\n\"Any claim is either i''n rem'' or ''in personam'', and there is an unbridgeable division between them. '''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B. Akkermans, ''The Principle of Numerus Clausus in European Property Law'' (Intersentia, 2008) vol 75, 75.</ref> that only real rights within the ''numerus clausus'' (closed number) are competent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Swadling|first=William|date=2000|title='Opening the numerus clausus'|url=|journal=Law Quarterly Review|volume=116|pages=354|via=}}</ref> Without the valid creation of a recognised real right, an individual only holds a personal right against another. This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B. Edgeworth, 'The Numerus Clausus Principle in Contemporary Australian Property Law' (2006) 32 Monash U L Rev 387, 387.</ref> \n\nIn Scots property law, the real rights falling within the ''numerus clausus'' have never been formally codified, but it is considered that the primary real right is ownership and subordinate to it are the lesser real rights<ref name=\":0\">''Erskine'' II,1,1, 'inferior real rights'.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n== Public Property in Scotland ==\n\n=== Property Owned by Public Sector Organisations, excluding the [[The Crown|Crown]] ===\nAny property owned by a public sector organisation, such as a [[Local government in Scotland|local authority]], [[Scottish Government|Scottish government]] or [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]] agency or entity. However, the exercise of that body's real rights in property is subject to [[United Kingdom administrative law|public and administrative law]]. \n\n=== 'Common Good' Property ===\nAnother type of public property is Common Good land. The Scottish Government's Land Reform Review Group's ''The land of Scotland and the common good: report'' (2004) succinctly summarises common good property: <blockquote>\"'''Section 14: Common Good Lands'''\n\n'''1.''' A special type of property owned by local authorities in Scotland, which is legally distinct from all the other property which they own, is Common Good Funds. These Funds are of ancient origin and consist of property that previously belonged to one of Scotland's burghs. They include both moveable property (for example, cash, securities, civic regalia) and heritable property (land and buildings). By far the largest component of Common Good Funds is heritable property and while this mainly consists of public buildings and public spaces, such as parks, it also includes in some cases farm land and other heritable property, such as salmon fishings.\n\n'''2''' The ownership of these Common Good Funds has undergone a series of changes as a result of local government reforms in Scotland since the Second World War. Common Good Funds were owned by 196 burghs at the time of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1947, when the burghs became managed by Town Councils. Subsequently, when the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 abolished Scotland's Town Councils, legal title to Common Good Funds was transferred to the new District Councils and then, in 1996, to Scotland's current local authorities under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1993.\n\n'''3''' This combined value [of common good property] is less than 1% of the value of the property assets owned by Scotland's Councils, which was reported to be \u00a335 billion in 2011. [3] However, the long history of Common Good lands, the locations and character of the properties and their local importance make them, as the Scottish Government has commented, \" ''an important part of the community landscape in many places''\". However, as is also very clear, the legal framework governing Common Good Funds as a very distinctive component of Scotland's system of land ownership, is archaic and not fit for purpose.\n\n'''4''' The origins of these Common Good Funds go back to the establishment of Scotland's Royal Burghs in the 11th century. Royal charters by the Crown granted these burghs special rights and privileges, as well as tracts of land which typically extended for some distance around the medieval town. Then, in the 15th century in response to maladministration, the Scottish Parliament passed the Common Good Act 1491. This Act which remains in force today, stipulated that the common good of the Royal Burghs \"be observed and kept for the common good of the town\". \n\n'''5''' Despite that legislation, much Common Good land was lost by Scotland's burghs between then and the 1830s. Reforms at that time meant the burghs began to expand and some of the land owners who sold land to the growing towns, gifted land to the Common Good for parks and other public purposes. While there has been little research on the fate of Common Good lands between then and local government reform in the 1970s, \" ''what is clear from even a cursory examination of the evidence is that the depredations did continue''\". The major re-structuring of local government in 1975, poor record keeping and the further re-organisation in 1996, have all added to the uncertainty over the full extent of the properties that are part of the Common Good, and the loss of some because they were not recognised as such.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.scot/publications/land-reform-review-group-final-report-land-scotland-common-good/pages/36/|title=The land of Scotland and the common good: report - gov.scot|website=www.gov.scot|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref></blockquote>'''Current Law'''\n\nCommon good property continues to exist under the ownership of the local authorities of Scotland.<ref>For full authoritative discussion see Ferguson, Andrew C., ''Common Good Law'' (Avizandum, 2006)</ref> The current law on common good law is found in various statutes including: the [[Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997|Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 194]]7, the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994|Local Government (Scotland) Act 1994]], the  [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2015/6/part/8/enacted Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015] and common law decisions.

The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. In Scotland, crown vassals could be given \"''the highest and most privileged tenure of land known to the Scottish Feudal System\" ,'' a Barony title, with the ability of the holder to be called a ''[[Baron]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/79RM/pages/76155367/L33+Barony+Titles|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I.

The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]'').

These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].''

Instead, in Scots law, the term 'a person's property' is used when describing objects or 'things' (in Latin: ''rem'') that an individual holds a right of ownership in. It is the rights that an individual holds in a 'thing' that are the subject matter of Scots property law.    \n\nThe terms objects or 'things' is also a wide ranging definition, and is based on Roman law principles.  Objects (or things) can be physical (such as land, a house, a car, a statue or a keyring) or they can also be unseen but still capable of being owned, (eg: a person can have a right to payment under a contract, a person can have a lease in a house, or they may have intellectual property rights in relation to works they have produced). <ref>Badenhorst, PJ, Juanita M. Pienaar, and Hanri Mostert. ''Silberberg and Schoeman's The Law of Property''. 5th Edition. Durban: LexisNexis/Butterworths, 2006, p. 9.</ref> While this may appear to encompass a wide range of 'things', they can be classified and sorted according to a legal system's rules.

Its roots predominantly lay in Roman law and the ''[[Jus commune|ius commune]]'', however feudalism was also introduced into Scots property law as a result of the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century so the legal system developed a distinct property law. In the 17th and 18th century, a group of academics, now called the [[Scots law|institutional writers,]] wrote authoritative texts on large areas of Scots law, including property law, which came to be regarded as a formal [[Sources of law|source of law]] from the 19th century onwards. \n\nFollowing the [[Acts of Union 1707]], [[Scots law#Private law|Scots Law]] and its courts, such as the [[Court of Session]], continued to operate as a separate legal system in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] under the terms of Article XIX (19) of the [[Treaty of Union]]. The jurisdiction retained its independence following the creation of subsequent United Kingdom states in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|1801]] and [[United Kingdom|1922]],  although Scots law was subject to modification by Acts of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]], and latterly, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliaments of the United Kingdoms]], and from judgments of the [[Appellate Committee of the House of Lords]] in appeals from the Court of Session.\n\nToday, Scots property law is part of Scots private law and as such is a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] competence of the [[Scottish Parliament]] under the [[Scotland Act 1998]]<ref>[[Scotland Act 1998]] s.126.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/visitandlearn/12506.aspx|title=What are the powers of the Scottish Parliament?|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Parliament|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. The Scottish Parliament has introduced key pieces of legislation in relating to property law: notably the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]], the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000]] and the [[Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012]]. However, large areas of Scots property law still remain governed by pre-existing legal authority predating the creation of the Scottish Parliament on 12 May 1999, so its '''current''' [[sources of law]] include: \n\n* The works of the [[Scots law#Academic writings|Institutional Writers]].\n*[[Common law]] decisions of the Scottish courts, including [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|judgments of the House of Lords]] (and its successor, the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]), in civil appeals from the Court of Session.\n*[[List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland to 1707|Acts of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland]].\n*[[Act of Parliament (UK)|Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, latterly Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]].\n*[[Act of the Scottish Parliament|Acts of the Scottish Parliament.]]\n\n== Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nIndividuals (both human and [[Legal person|juristic]]) have a patrimony, also known as 'estate', containing all the individual's rights (ie: their legal entitlements) with an economic value (termed ''patrimonial rights'') and all their liabilities.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession'' 2nd edn. (London, 2016), page 5. </ref>   This definition is wide ranging so will encompass all the rights, such as the right of ownership or contractual rights, an individual may have. Most individuals will only have one patrimony, but in the case of a [[trustee]], an individual may have two separate patrimonies.<ref>G. Grettton & A. Steven, ''Property, Trusts and Succession''2nd edn.

'''An action ''in rem'' asserts a relationship between a person and a thing, an action ''in personam'' a relationship between persons'''. The Romans think in terms of actions not of rights, but in substance one action asserts a right over a thing, the other a right against a person, and hence comes the modern dichotomy between rights ''in rem'' and rights ''in personam.'' Obviously there cannot be a dispute between a person and a thing, and therefore even in an action ''in rem'' there must be a defendant, but he is there not because he is alleged to be under any duty to the plaintiff but because by some act he is denying the alleged right of the plaintiff.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Nicholas|first=Barry|title=An Introduction to Roman Law|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1962|isbn=9780198760634|location=London|pages=100}}</ref>\n\n=== Identifying Personal or Real Rights ===\nIn Scots law, a personal right typically is created in [[contract|contractual agreements]] (eg: a contract for sale, a contract of loan, a contract of hire, etc.) or as a result of an individual committing a [[Delict (Scots law)|delict]] (eg: breach of a duty of care). With personal rights, the pursuer (in other jurisdictions this is termed the ''[[plaintiff]]'' or ''[[Plaintiff|claimant]]'') can bring to a Scottish court an action against an individual. A real right is held in the property itself and is enforceable against the world, a pursuer can sue in relation to a real right where the defender interferes with the pursuer's real right.<ref>''Burnett's Trustees v Grainger'' [2004] UKHL 8, per Lord Rodger of Earlsferry at para 87.</ref> <blockquote>Example 1: A contracts with B to purchase a piece of land. B backs out of the deal but A still wants to buy the land. A has a contractual (personal) right to sue B because they had entered into a contract. A does not have a real right in the thing because no real right had been [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|transferred to him validly]].  A sues B in the Sheriff Court for breach of contract under her personal right.  \n\nExample 2: D is hit by E's car while riding his bike, committing a delict by breaching his duty of care to other road users. D now has a right in delict (a personal right) for E to pay D's damages for his injuries.  D sues E in the Court of Session.  \n\nExample 3: F owns (a real right) a bike. G steals F's bike. F sees G with the bike and wants it back. F, as well as remedies available in [[Scottish criminal law|criminal law]], can raise an action in the courts against G for G's interference with F's right of ownership.  </blockquote>Accordingly, within Scots Private law, personal rights belong to the '''[[law of obligations]]''' whereas '''real rights fall within the law of property'''.<ref>B. Nicholas, ''An Introduction to Roman Law'' (Oxford, 1962), page 101. In Scots law, see Scotland Act 1998 s.126(4).</ref> However, any real right an individual may have in property must be <u>recognised and valid</u> in Scots law in order to be a true real right. \n\n=== The Recognised Real Rights in Scotland: The ''Numerus Clausus''===\nScots law only recognises a defined number of real rights, which follows the legal principle shared with other jurisdictions,<ref>For a comparative discussion, see B.

This means that where an individual contracts to purchase property from another, they only hold a contractual right to the property not a right ''in rem.'' The principle of ''[[Numerus clausus (law)|numerus clausus]]'' is explained in an Australian context by Edgeworth as: \n\n\"In essence, the principle holds that landowners are not at liberty to customise land rights, in the sense of reworking them in an entirely novel way to suit their particular individual needs and circumstances. Rather, <u>any new rights must fit within firmly established pigeonholes, of which the law permits only a small and finite number.</u> The principle applies regardless of the terms of any agreement that parties might reach for the purpose of creating such an interest, so it is irrelevant that a specific contractual arrangement to create a wholly novel interest might be free and\n\nfair.\"<ref>B.

This creates classes of property with different respective legal rules governing each class of property. There are two distinctions that are made in Scots law: \n\n# The distinction between corporeal and incorporeal property.  \n# The distinction between moveable and heritable property.  \n\n=== Distinction between Corporeal and Incorporeal Property ===\nThis distinction existed in Roman law,<ref>Justinian ''Institutes'' II,2,1\u20133</ref> it divides property (things) between:  \n\n'''1)''' Property which can be seen physically (''corpus'') '''corporeal property,''' (eg: a house, a piece of land, a car, a chair, etc.)''';''' and  \n\n'''2)''' Property which cannot be seen physically is known as '''incorporeal''' property (eg: a right to payment under a contract, a lease in a house, a right in [[delict]] for payment for damages, [[copyright]], etc.). \n\n=== Distinction between Heritable (Immoveable) and Moveable Property ===\nThis distinction separates property between: \n\n'''1) Heritable (also termed 'immoveable'),''' which is land and the buildings and structures upon it;<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012, s.113.\n\n\"\u201cland\u201d includes\u2014\n\n(a) buildings and other structures,\n\n(b) the seabed of the territorial sea of the United Kingdom adjacent to Scotland (including land within the ebb and flow of the tide at ordinary spring tides), and\n\n(c) other land covered with water,\"</ref> and  \n\n'''2) Moveable''' property is property which can be physically moved.  Bell, the institutional writer, defines moveables as: \"''Whatever moves, or is capable of being moved from place to place without injury or change of nature in itself, or in the subject with which it is connected, is moveable''\"<ref>Bell, ''Principles of the Law of Scotland'', 10th edn., (1899), 1472. </ref> \n\nThe distinction between moveable and immoveable (heritable) can be difficult when dealing with corporeal property, such as where corporeal moveable property (eg: a factory machine, shelves, fixtures & fittings, etc.) has been affixed to the land around it (which is heritable property). In this situation, the law of [[Accession in Scots property law|accession]] must apply to determine whether the moveable property has acceeded to (ie: become part of) the heritable property (land). The distinction between heritable and moveable property is also important in relation to [[Diligence (Scots law)|Scots insolvency and diligence law]] and [[Intestacy|succession and inheritance law]] in Scotland, as different rules apply to each class. \n\nAll property belongs to one of each distinction, resulting in four classes of property in Scots law, each with their own specific rules, these are:\n\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Corporeal Heritable Property (Land)|Corporeal heritable property]] (eg: land, building, apartment etc)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal heritable property]] (eg: a lease, a right in a contract for sale of a house, a liferent etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|Corporeal moveable property]] (eg: furniture, car, books, etc.)\n*[[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Ownership of Incorporeal Property|Incorporeal moveable property]] (eg: intellectual property rights, rights of payment arising from contract or delict, etc.)\n\n\n'''Public Property in Scots Law''' \n\n[Section in Edit]\n\n== Other Legal Regimes Relating to Corporeal Heritable Property in Scotland ==\n\n===Feudal law===\n[[Feudalism]] had been the system of land (corporeal heritable property) ownership in Scots law for 800 years from the [[Davidian Revolution]] until the commencement of the Abolition of Feudal Tenure (Scotland) Act 2000.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BBC News|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|work=BBC News Scotland|access-date=12 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==== Operation of the Feudal System ====\nThe feudal system operated by vesting the ownership of all land in Scotland in the [[Crown Estate Scotland|Crown]] (ie: [[List of Scottish monarchs|The King/Queen of Scots]]). The Crown could make feudal grants of land vesting ownership in a Crown vassal. In Scotland, crown vassals could be given \"''the highest and most privileged tenure of land known to the Scottish Feudal System\" ,'' a Barony title, with the ability of the holder to be called a ''[[Baron]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/79RM/pages/76155367/L33+Barony+Titles|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The Crown vassals, could then divide up their land and make further grants of land, such as by a holding called ''feufarm'', to sub-vassals, in a process called ''sub-infeudation. T''hese sub-vassals could make further grants, through ''sub-infeudation'', to sub-sub-vassals. The sub-infeudation process could carry on indefinitely, leading to a long complex chain of ownership leading ultimately back to the Crown. Vassals had obligations to their superiors, known as [[wiktionary:reddendo|re''ddendo'']] and typically were monetary in nature such as the ''[[feu duty]].'' Historically vassals could be called upon for military service, such as the ''wardholding'' until its abolishment after the [[Jacobite risings|Jacobite revolution]].<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</ref> Over time the most common form of feudal grants became the ''feufarm'' which carried with it the obligation pay a ''feuduty''.<ref>I. Duffus, Archivist of The Nine Incorporated Trades of Dundee, <nowiki>http://ninetradesofdundee.co.uk/download/scottish_history/scottish_history_documents_and_pictures/history/Land%20Ownership.pdf</nowiki></ref>  Alternatively, a vassal could substitute their place in the feudal chain with another individual by a disposition.<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503''.''</ref> \n\nThe feudal system was starkly different from the Civilian law \"bedrock\"<ref>Steven, A. and Gretton, G. (2017) ''Property, Trusts and Succession,'' 503. </ref> that Scots law had operated on before its introduction. The result was a hybrid of feudal/civilian law whereby:<blockquote>\"the granter of a feu disposition retained an interest in the property - the superiority (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium directum]]''). This interest gave the granter the right to enforce conditions over the property. The grantee had the right to possess the property (or ''[[Dominium directum et utile|dominium utile]]''), providing that they did not breach any of the conditions set by the granter.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rosdev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/2ARM/pages/58690451/Historic+Deed+Types|title=Registers of Scotland Manuals|website=rosdev.atlassian.net|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>One of the most important conditions in property law that a superior could make was the use of [[Real burdens in scots law|real burdens]], restrictions which were placed on the use of the land. These feudal burdens are still of limited applicability under the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.\n\n==== Feudal Reform and Abolition ====\nOver the 800 years of its usage, feudal law was subject to various reforms limiting the powers of superiors and reforming the system in favour of the ''dominium utile'' as ownership of land became wider. In 1924, a legal commentator noted that Scots property law: <blockquote>\n\"is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.\"<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 </ref></blockquote>\nBy the late-20th century, the passage of the Conveyancing and Feudal Reform (Scotland) Act 1974 had mitigated the payments system of ''dominium utile'' owners of feu to their ''[[feudal superior]]'' (''dominium directum'') in the form of a ''[[feu duty]].'' However, ''a''round 10% of landowners in Scotland still had to make ''feu duty'' payments by 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> This enabled feudal superiors such as the [[Church of Scotland]], who historically were feudal superiors of large tracts of land, to receive ''feu duty'' revenue amounting to \u00a330,000 a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=2004-11-28|access-date=2020-04-12|language=en-GB}}</ref> With feudalism deemed \"outdated and archaic\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/381941.stm|title=BBC News {{!}} UK Politics {{!}} Feudal system faces axe|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> by the new [[Scottish Government|Scottish Executive]], a major package of land reform (the [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]], the [[Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003]] and the [[Tenements (Scotland) Act 2004]]) was passed by the newly-sitting [[Scottish Parliament]] which eliminated the feudal system.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4048529.stm|title=Age-old Scots property rights end|date=28 November 2004|newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}</ref> Section 1 of the 2000 Act is unequivocal:<blockquote>\"The feudal system of land tenure, that is to say the entire system whereby land is held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior is, on the appointed day, abolished.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/1/data.htm|title=Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref> </blockquote>The 2000 Act provided that ''dominium utile'' ownership would convert into full ownership on the appointed day,<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(1).</ref> and that any other feudal estate (such as superiorities or ''dominium directum)'' in Scotland would cease to exist.<ref>Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, s.2(2)</ref> The appointed day was 28 November 2004,<ref>Scottish Government, ''Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 guidance,'' https://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/law/17975/Abolition</ref> the delay between [[royal assent]] of the 2000 Act and its commencement was due to the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before feudalism's final abolition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|publisher=Hart Publishing|year=2002|page=287}}</ref> However, on 28 November 2004, feudalism in Scotland ended and its relevance will diminish over time. \n\n===Shetland and Orkney Islands: Udal Law===\nThe [[Northern Isles]] became part of Scotland as a result of two [[Security in Scots Property Law|pledge]]<nowiki/>s for outstanding payments made by [[Christian I of Denmark|Christian I]] to [[James III of Scotland]] under an agreement for the marriage of [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], Christian I's daughter to James III in 1468 ([[Orkney|the Orkney Isles]]) and 1469 (the [[Shetland]] Isles).<ref>B.Crawford, 'The Pawning of Orkney and Shetland' (1969) ''Scottish Historical Review'' 35\u201353, Appendix.<br /></ref> However the Northern Isles had their own legal system, [[udal law]], and its own system of [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law|land ownership]][[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#An Absolute Right of Ownership|,]] unlike the rest of Scotland's feudal system.
