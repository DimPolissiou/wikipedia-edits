A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

He said Republicans were using busing as a scare tactic to court Southern white votes, and along with Boggs voiced opposition to a [[House of Representatives]] constitutional amendment banning busing.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|page=214}} In 1974, Biden voted to table an amendment to an omnibus education bill promoted by [[Edward Gurney]] (R-FL) that contained anti-busing measures and anti-school desegregation clauses. In May, Senator [[Robert P. Griffin|Robert Griffin]] (R-MI) attempted to revive an amended version of the amendment.

The crowd was unconvinced, and heckled him until he yielded the microphone.{{sfn|Gadsen|2012|pages=2\u20133}} This, along with the prospect of a busing plan in Wilmington, led Biden to align himself with civil rights opponent Senator [[Jesse Helms]] (R-NC) in opposing busing.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Biden is the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|presumptive Democratic nominee]] for [[President of the United States|president]] in the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 election]]. He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in [[Joe Biden 1988 presidential campaign|1988]] and in [[Joe Biden 2008 presidential campaign|2008]]. \n\nBiden was raised in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], and [[New Castle County, Delaware]]. He studied at the [[University of Delaware]] before receiving his law degree from [[Syracuse University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joe-Biden|title=Joe Biden &#124; Biography & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He became a lawyer in 1969 and was elected to the [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle]] [[County Council]] in 1970. He was [[1972 United States Senate election in Delaware|elected]] to the [[List of United States senators from Delaware|U.S. Senate from Delaware]] in 1972 when he became the sixth-youngest senator in American history. Biden was reelected six times and was the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|fourth-most senior senator]] when he resigned to assume the vice presidency in 2009.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was a longtime member and eventually chairman of the [[Foreign Relations Committee]]. He opposed the [[Gulf War]] in 1991 but advocated for U.S. and [[NATO]] intervention in the [[Bosnian War]] in 1994 and 1995, expanding NATO in the 1990s, and the 1999 bombing of [[Serbia]] during the [[Kosovo War]]. He argued and voted for the [[Iraq War Resolution|resolution authorizing the Iraq War]] in 2002 but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of U.S. troops]] in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, as well as the contentious [[U.S. Supreme Court]] nominations of [[Robert Bork]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]. Biden led the efforts to pass the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] and the [[Violence Against Women Act]].\n\nIn [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], Biden was the [[running mate]] of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]]. As vice president, he oversaw [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009#Infrastructure Investment|infrastructure spending]] to counteract the [[Great Recession]] and helped formulate U.S. policy toward [[Iraq]] through the [[Withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq (2007\u20132011)#Full withdrawal (2011)|withdrawal of U.S. troops in 2011]]. His negotiations with congressional [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] helped the Obama administration pass legislation including the [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]], which resolved a taxation deadlock; the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], which resolved that year's [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling crisis]]; and the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]], which addressed the impending [[United States fiscal cliff|fiscal cliff]]. Obama and Biden were [[2012 United States presidential election|reelected in 2012]].\n\nIn October 2015, after months of speculation, Biden announced he would not seek the presidency in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]]. In January 2017, Obama awarded Biden the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] with distinction.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-medal-freedom.html|title=Obama Surprises Joe Biden With Presidential Medal of Freedom|last=Shear|first=Michael D.|date=January 12, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 24, 2018|language=en}}</ref> After completing his second term as vice president, Biden joined the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he was named the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Professor of Presidential Practice.<ref name=\"BidenUPenn\">{{cite news |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-has-a-new-job-2017-2 |title=Here's what Joe Biden will do after 8 years as vice president |last=Berke |first=Jeremy |date=February 7, 2017 |website=Business Insider |access-date=February 8, 2017 |quote=}}</ref> He announced his [[Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign|2020 candidacy for president]] on April 25, 2019, joining a large [[2020 Democratic Party presidential candidates|field of Democratic candidates]] pursuing the party nomination.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/biden-2020.html|title=Joe Biden's 2020 Plan Is Almost Complete.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times.

Nevertheless, Koli pirates were notorious and a challenge for maritime powers.

In 1750, there was a battle at ''Kurla River'' which resulted in defeat for the Kolis and the capture of 23 armed vessels. After this fight, Koli piracy was silenced for long time.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities. Some of them engaged in marketing as [[Vaishya]] and a large number engaged in agriculture and as soldier. They have gained prominence from islamic india and were political strong and petty rulers from koli community were vested the titles of [[Thakor]] and [[Girasia]] which means ''Girasdar'' or collector of tax from his territory.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite book|last=Bayly|first=Susan|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=HbAjKR_iHogC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Caste, Society and Politics in India from the Eighteenth Century to the Modern Age|date=2001-02-22|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79842-6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mughal time, kolis were most notorious for rulers. so a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] chronicler mentioned that the kolis of gujarat raised against mughal rule.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree of the major uprisings of kolis were in the years of 1694, 1721 and 1729 against muslim rule, the kolis of gujarat continually challenged the mighal authority. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] Muhammad Mubariz Khan (ancestor of [[Junagadh State]] family) of pasthoon tribe was appointed as governor of the [[Vadnagar]] and ordered to control the koli's turbulent activities. Kolis were in rebellion against muslim rule so Mubariz khan commanded the imperial army against kolis of sampra was but he was killed by kolis of that village.\n\nsecond in 1721,the kolis of [[Pethapur State|Pethapur]] challenged the mughal authority. They plundered the merchants and villages. The governor of [[Kheda]] was ordered to subdue the kolis but in the batyle at pethapur in 1721 kolis killed governor ''Kasim Ali Khan'' in action. Third in 1729, the kolis of [[Radhanpur]] revolted against the mughals in gujarat. A [[Babi dynasty|Babi]] of radhanpur assisted the mughals in gujarat and he was appointed as the governor of Radhanpur with the title of ''Jawan Marad Khan'' and founded the [[Radhanpur State]] as independent ruler. Kolis of his territory were in revolt wind already against mughals. Kolis infested the roads, blocked the minor ways, plundered the villages and challenged the authority. The first [[Nawab]] of radhanpur Jawan Marad Khan was ordered by sultan to put down the kolis. Khan marched against kolis of ''Balor'' in his territory and happened a critical struggle between nawab and kolis. But nawab was killed in action by the kolis of balor.<ref name=\":24\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurrence, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis.

THE ERA HAS NO DEFINITIVE BEGINNING.-->during the late 1990s. WWF's programming, branded as \"WWF Attitude\", featured adult-oriented content, which included an increase in the level of depicted violence, profanity and sexual content. This era was part of a wider surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as television ratings and [[pay-per-view]] buy-rates for WWF and its rival promotions saw record highs.\n\nThe Attitude Era marked the rise of many WWF male singles wrestlers, including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Mick Foley]] (in various personas), [[The Undertaker]], [[Triple H]], and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/wwe-attitude-era-superstars-article-1.2470329|author=Hau Chu|title=Where are they now?

While most of the company's female talent such as [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]], [[Sunny (wrestler)|Sunny]] and later [[Trish Stratus]] and [[Stacy Keibler]] during this time period were marketed as sex symbols and often booked in sexually provocative gimmick matches (for example \"bra and panty\" matches, bikini matches, etc) in an effort to draw more male viewership, prominent female stars such as [[Chyna]], [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]], [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]], and [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]] among others were presented as legitimate wrestlers in legitimate wrestling matches. It was also the resurgence of [[tag team]] wrestling, namely [[The Hardy Boyz]], [[The Dudley Boyz]], and [[Edge & Christian]] who were featured in several destructive, physical and stunt-filled [[Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]]es during this era. Distinguished stables established in this era, such as [[D-Generation X]], [[Nation of Domination|The Nation of Domination]], [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], [[The Ministry of Darkness]], [[The Corporate Ministry]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] among others developed major rivalries among each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/features/from-federation-to-entertainment-wwes-journey-is-mirrored-in-wrestling-games-644652|title=From Federation to Entertainment, WWE's Journey is Mirrored in Wrestling Games|website=NDTV Gadgets 360}}</ref>\n\n==Initiation==\n[[File:Vince Russo at the Family Arena.jpg|thumb|140px|Vince Russo]]\nDuring the [[Monday Night Wars]]\u200a\u2014\u200aa ratings battle between WWF's ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' and WCW's ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''\u200a\u2014\u200athe WWF transformed itself from a long history of family-friendly programming into a more adult oriented product. The creative side of the product during the early stages of the era was spearheaded by Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] and head writer [[Vince Russo]], who drastically changed the way professional wrestling television was written. Russo's [[Professional wrestling booker|booking]] style was often referred to as Crash TV&nbsp;\u2014 short matches, backstage vignettes, and shocking angles.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} While the [[WWE Network]] describes the December 15, 1997, episode of ''[[Raw Is War]]'' as being the first from the Attitude Era, WWE themselves have stated that [[Survivor Series 1997]], which took place over a month beforehand, marked the beginning of the era.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/inside/wwefeaturepage/attitude-era|title = A special look at the Attitude Era| publisher =[[WWE]]| accessdate = 2012-03-03}}</ref> They have also said that [[King of the Ring 1996]],<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/stonecoldsteveaustin|title = WWE Hall of Fame Inductees \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin Biography| publisher =[[WWE]]| accessdate = 2011-04-07}}</ref> and [[WrestleMania XIV]] on March 29, 1998,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/30445413|title = WWE Championship - Stone Cold| publisher =[[WWE.com]]| accessdate = 2011-12-29}}</ref> were the starting point.\n\nSeveral miscellaneous events outside the major benchmarks have been credited with helping transition to the Attitude Era. A few years after the Hulkamania era, WWF needed more sales. In his book, Russo mentions the debut of the character [[Goldust]] in 1995 as a turning point. Goldust portrayed an [[androgynous]] wrestler was also viewed as a shift to a more adult oriented product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/goldust-dustin-runnels-implants/|title=Goldust &#124; How The Bizarre One Tried to Get Breast Implants|first=Rob|last=Irel|date=September 20, 2018|website=ProWrestlingStories.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/goldust-wwe-attitude-era/|title=Goldust Believes He Helped Launch WWE\u2019s Attitude Era Over 20 Years Ago|date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> [[Brian Pillman]]'s \"loose cannon\" persona and the \"[[Pillman's got a gun]]\" segment from 1996 when he pulled a gun on Austin, has also been credited.

Mr. McMahon, who did not want Austin to be the WWF Champion, would stop at nothing to put an end to Stone Cold, and Austin would do anything to beat Vince. On the ''Raw'' after Austin won the WWF Championship, Mr. McMahon presented him with the newly designed WWF Championship belt and informed him he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that if he did not conform to society and become his image of what a WWF Champion should be, Austin would face severe consequences. Austin gave his answer in the form of a Stone Cold Stunner to McMahon. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to agree to McMahon's terms, appearing in a [[Suit (clothing)#Suit etiquette for men|suit and tie]], with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and Austin, his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin, who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, telling McMahon it was the last time he'd ever be seen dressed like this. Austin punched McMahon in the [[Testicles|'corporate grapefruits']] and took another picture with McMahon writhing in pain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe following week on April 13, 1998, Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a [[No contest (professional wrestling)|no contest]] when [[Mick Foley]] (as Dude Love) interrupted the entire contest. On that night ''Raw'' defeated ''Nitro'' in the ratings for the first time since June 10, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTheir rivalry continued throughout the Attitude Era, bringing increased revenue and attention to the company. The rivalry got more intense as time went on, with McMahon trying to sabotage Austin whenever he could to stop him from being the WWF Champion. Austin often exacted revenge on McMahon, such as attacking McMahon with a bedpan while he was in the hospital, stealing a cement mixer and driving it into the arena, then filling up one of McMahon's Corvette cars with cement,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gLjQiYBPQI|title=\"Stone Cold\" pours cement into Mr. McMahon's corvette|first=|last=WWE|date=11 October 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> driving a Zamboni to the ring before attacking McMahon leading to Austin's arrest once again,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRv1FVAvsI|title=Stone Cold' drives a zamboni to the ring|first=|last=WWE|date=27 September 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> kidnapping Vince in a wheelchair, wheeling him down to the ring at gunpoint which ended up actually being a toy gun with a scroll that reads \"Bang 3:16!\" which frightened McMahon so much he urinated himself, or driving a beer truck to the ring and using a fire hose to spray Vince, Shane McMahon and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] with beer. Austin wrestled McMahon in 1999 at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in a steel cage, which he won when the debuting [[Big Show]] accidentally threw him through the cage wall, thus earning a world title shot at [[WrestleMania XV]]. Through the rivalry, McMahon founded two heel [[Professional wrestling stable|factions]]: [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] and [[Corporate Ministry|The Corporate Ministry]], using several wrestlers to face Austin, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane and Big Show.\n\n==The Rock==\n[[Dwayne Johnson]], a third-generation wrestler, made his debut at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]] as \"Rocky Maivia\", naming himself after his grandfather [[Peter Maivia]] and his father [[Rocky Johnson]]. Despite being a babyface with an impressive winning streak and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] reign, he was frequently met with negative reception from live audiences: loud boos, \"Rocky sucks!\" chants, and even crowd signs that read \"Die Rocky Die\".\n\n===Nation of Domination===\n[[Image:WWE - Sheffield 020499 (49).jpg|right|thumb|190px|The Rock was one of the top stars and biggest names of the Attitude Era]]\nMaivia joined the [[Nation of Domination]] in 1997 and renamed himself \"The Rock\", an egotistical jock who referred to himself in third person and often cut colorful promos insulting rival wrestlers as well as fans who did not support him. As a member of the Nation of Domination, The Rock won the Intercontinental title for a second time. The Rock eventually overthrew [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] to become the leader of the Nation.\n\n===The People's Champion===\nAfter the Nation disbanded, The Rock referred to himself as the \"People's Champion\" and began to receive the support of the audience, which led Vince McMahon and the Corporation to target him. After battling McMahon's goons for the chance to go to the Survivor Series, the Rock entered the tournament and made it to the finals against McMahon's chosen representative, Mankind. [[Survivor Series 1998]] was the first PPV headlined by The Rock. During the match, a double turn occurred with the help of McMahon, similar to the previous year's Survivor Series, revealing that Rock was working with The Corporation all along. The Rock officially joined McMahon as the crown jewel of The Corporation, abandoning his previous moniker as \"The People's Champion\" and declaring himself \"The Corporate Champion\".\n\n===The Corporation===\nAs a member of The Corporation, The Rock's persona changed yet again, to an even more callous attitude. The Rock had a lengthy feud with Mankind, with a rematch at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House|Rock Bottom]], where Rock retained the title due to a technicality, even though he lost the match. Mankind, however, won the title on ''Raw Is War''. The reign was short lived, as the Rock got his rematch at the 1999 Royal Rumble, in an I Quit Match. The Rock won the I Quit Match and became the WWF Champion yet again. A rematch, known as \"Half-Time Heat\", took place during halftime of the Super Bowl, and Mankind won the match and the title, after pinning the Rock underneath a forklift. The Rock got a rematch at St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in a last man standing match for the chance to headline [[WrestleMania XV]] as the WWF Champion. The bout ended in a draw after both men were unable to stand at the ten count. Despite Mankind being the WWF Champion, he gave the Rock one more shot at the title in a ladder match on ''Raw''. This was their final match, as the Big Show interfered in the match and chokeslammed Mankind off the ladder, leaving the Rock all by himself to win the match and headline WrestleMania XV as WWF Champion.\n\nAt WrestleMania XV The Rock, the WWF Champion faced off against the challenger, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Vince McMahon interfered in the match attacking Stone Cold to try and stop him but was unsuccessful. Austin won the match and seemingly defeated The Corporation and McMahon. Austin, after winning the title, described the belt as not being good enough, using his personalized Smoking Skull Belt. McMahon, who was in possession of the belt, ordered Shane McMahon to give it to Austin, seemingly ending their feud. But Shane had other plans, as he went against his father's wishes and gave the belt to The Rock. This was the basis for The Rock's rematch at Backlash for the WWF Championship. In order for Stone Cold to reclaim his Smoking Skull belt, he had to defeat the Rock at Backlash. With the WWF Championship on the line, The Rock lost the rematch and the Smoking Skull belt. The night after Backlash, after failing to beat Austin for a second time, Shane McMahon turned on The Rock and fired him from the Corporation.\n\n===Return as The People's Champion===\nAfter being fired from the Corporation, The Rock once again declared himself the People's Champion and went on a number of small feuds during the latter part of 1999. It was during this time The Rock's popularity began to flourish once again, and he joined his former rival Mankind to create the tag team, [[The Rock 'n' Sock Connection]]. The team won the WWF Tag Team titles. After the Rock 'n' Sock connection broke up, The Rock went back into the main event picture of the WWF, battling the likes of [[Triple H]] and his stable, the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. Late in the Attitude Era, The Rock faced Stone Cold Steve Austin again at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] for the WWF Championship. Stone Cold once again defeated The Rock to regain the title and also joined forces with his nemesis Mr. McMahon.\n\n==The Undertaker==\n[[The Undertaker]] was one of only a handful of top performers who never left the WWF before and during the Monday Night Wars. His gimmick, a horror-themed, macabre entity who employed scare tactics and held links to the supernatural, allowed the WWF to push the envelope from a creative perspective during this era.\n\n===The Brothers of Destruction===\n{{main|The Brothers of Destruction}}\nAt [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]] in 1996, The Undertaker became embroiled in a feud with his former manager [[Paul Bearer]]. During the course of their conflict, Bearer threatened The Undertaker with the threat of revealing his 'secret', calling him a \"murderer\" and accusing him of killing his parents and brother. In the following weeks on ''Raw'', Bearer revealed that his brother [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] was actually still alive. Kane debuted at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]], wearing a mask and interfering in the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Undertaker and [[Shawn Michaels]]. Following a series of taunts from Bearer and Kane, who cost him the WWF World Heavyweight Title at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]], he agreed to face Kane at [[WrestleMania XIV]]. The Undertaker won the match at WrestleMania and the first ever [[Inferno Match]] at [[Unforgiven (1998)|Unforgiven]]. Following the conclusion of this storyline, The Undertaker and Kane united to form a tag team that became known as The Brothers of Destruction.\n\n===The Ministry of Darkness===\n[[File:WWE - Newcastle Arena 030499 (2).jpg|thumb|Edge and Christian as members of the Brood]]\n{{main|The Ministry of Darkness}}\nIn late 1998, The Undertaker turned on Kane and realigned himself with Paul Bearer. Now proclaiming himself as the \"Lord of Darkness\", he began taking a more macabre and darker persona, claiming that a \"plague of evil\" would hit WWF. During the weeks that followed, he reignited his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he blamed for costing him the WWF title. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated the Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with the help of Kane, writing him off of WWF television for a month.\n\nUpon his return, a much scarier, darker, druid-like Undertaker introduced his Ministry of Darkness, a satanic-themed stable which consisted of [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] ([[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]], [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]). The storyline continued over the weeks that followed, as the Undertaker announced his intentions of taking over WWF and claimed he was working for a \"higher power\". He began a feud with [[Vince McMahon]] and his daughter [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]], with the Ministry burning Undertaker's symbol in the McMahon family yard.\n\nAt [[Backlash: In Your House]] on April 25, Mr. McMahon had [[Ken Shamrock]] face The Undertaker, but his plan backfired and Shamrock was attacked by Bradshaw after the match. Later, The Undertaker commandeered Stephanie's limo and drove off into the night with a screaming Stephanie in tow as Backlash went off the air. The Undertaker attempted to marry her the next night on ''Raw Is War'' by holding a \"Black Wedding\" for himself and Stephanie in a bid to take control of the company. The ceremony was successfully ruined by Steve Austin, after two attempts by Corporation members [[Big Show]] and Ken Shamrock failed.\n\n=== The Corporate Ministry ===\n{{main|The Corporate Ministry}}\nOn the very first ever episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', The Undertaker joined forces with Shane McMahon, in turn gaining control of The Corporation and merging his Ministry with it to form [[The Corporate Ministry]]. The Undertaker, with the help of Shane, defeated Austin at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge 1999]] and won the [[WWF Championship]]. However, after Mr. McMahon was revealed as its \"Greater Power\", The Corporate Ministry eventually dissolved.\n\nThe Undertaker formed a new \"Unholy Alliance\" with Big Show, Mideon and Viscera, which led to two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Big Show and Undertaker. This group came to an end when The Undertaker suffered a [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Legit|legit]] injury in September and was written out by quitting, rather than taking a match ordered by Mr. McMahon.<ref name=\"WWF SmackDown! - 09/23/1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/smackdown/990923.htm|title=WWF SmackDown results|publisher=PWWEW.net|accessdate=March 21, 2013|date=September 23, 1999}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Mick Foley==\n[[File:Mick Foley 2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mick Foley]]]]\n[[Mick Foley]] played three different personas during this era: Mankind, Dude Love and Cactus Jack. While Mankind was his main persona in WWF and Cactus Jack was previously used in his days in WCW, Japan and independent circuits, Dude Love was inspired by a character Foley created when he and his high school friends did [[backyard wrestling]] in his home area of [[Long Island, New York]]. Foley debuted both Dude Love and Cactus Jack in the WWF in mid-1997, while Mankind was debuted at Foley's first ever WWF event on April 1, 1996 during the ''Raw'' event right after [[WrestleMania 12]]. Foley's creative versatility allowed him to create distinct and different characteristics for each character and he would prepare for each role by putting himself in each character's respective comfort zone, much like an actor would when preparing for a role on film or stage. Although his general move-set stayed the same, Foley would have different motions and even different catchphrases for each character (Cactus Jack: \"Bang Bang!\", Mankind: \"Have a Nice Day!\", Dude Love: \"Owwww, Have Mercy!\").\n\nWhen developing the Mankind character he would spend whole nights under the wrestling ring or in that week's arena's boiler room. In addition, as he had been in his previous days in different wrestling circuits, Foley, the \"Hardcore Legend\" was often involved in the Attitude Era's most violent and dangerous matches, including no-disqualification matches that took place outside the ring and [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore matches]] with sharp objects such barbed wire, thumbtacks, broken glass and also various blunt objects- and most of Foley\u2019s matches included at least one dangerous bump. The image of Foley being thrown and falling 20 feet from the top of the third Hell in a Cell match by The Undertaker at the [[1998 Hell in a Cell match|1998 King of the Ring]] is synonymous with the era, along with [[Jim Ross]]' commentary of \"as God is my witness, he is broken in half!\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn January 4, 1999 on ''Raw Is War'', he won his first WWF Championship from The Rock with the help of Stone Cold Steve Austin. This match is also known as the turning point in ratings of the [[Monday Night Wars]] as it favored WWF until the end of the wars and led to the downfall of WCW. That night, WCW attempted to sabotage ''Raw''{{'}}s rating by announcing the result of the match on ''Nitro'', but their plan backfired when Nielsen ratings indicated that over 600,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in WWF's favor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Foley is Good: And the Real World is Faker Than Wrestling|url=https://archive.org/details/foleyisgoodrealw00fole|url-access=registration|publisher=HarperCollins |date=2001-07-01|isbn=0-00-714508-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/foleyisgoodrealw00fole/page/9 9]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=WrestleCrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy|publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Owen Hart==\n[[File:Owen Hart 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Owen Hart in 1997]]\nNear the beginning of the Attitude Era in late 1997, [[Bret Hart]] left WWF due to a contract dispute and joined WCW. He was soon followed by family members [[Jim Neidhart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]], leaving younger brother [[Owen Hart]] as the sole remaining member of [[the Hart Family]] employed by WWF. He remained off-camera during the tumult following the [[Montreal Screwjob]] and later reappeared using the nicknames \"Black Hart\" and \"Lone Hart\".\n\nOwen Hart was aligned with the [[Nation of Domination]] for much of 1998, winning the European Title along the way. After the dissolution of the stable, Hart began teaming with [[Jeff Jarrett]]. In the storyline, Hart quit the WWF after accidentally injuring [[Dan Severn]], but he quickly re-emerged as the [[comic relief|joke character]] \"The Blue Blazer\", reprising a gimmick that Hart had employed early in his career.\n\nHart died on May 23, 1999 at the [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] pay-per-view event. In an elaborate entrance routine that he had performed before, Hart (as The Blue Blazer) was to be lowered to the ring slowly from the rafters, with intent to perform a pratfall from a few feet above the ring. When the harness failed, Hart instead fell 78 feet into the ring, striking the top rope with his chest, leading to his death minutes later from internal bleeding as a result of blunt force trauma. The company made the controversial decision to continue the event to its completion after the incident. On the next evening's ''Raw Is War'', all storylines were suspended and the entire show was presented as a tribute to Hart, with other superstars sharing their memories of him between exhibition matches.\n\n==The women's division==\n\n===Sable===\n[[File:Sable in Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sable during a WWF tour in England in April 1998]]\n[[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] made her World Wrestling Federation debut at [[WrestleMania XII]] in March 1996, escorting [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] to the ring as he took on the returning [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]]. Sable's first major angle involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at WrestleMania XII as \"Wildman\" [[Marc Mero]]. Sable, however, quickly eclipsed both her husband and real-life rival Sunny in popularity, leading to the reinstatement of the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] as well as the promotion's hiring of more female wrestlers. Sable became the first WWF female to refer to herself as a \"Diva\" during the April 19 edition of ''Raw Is War'' in 1999; the term would be coined and shortly thereafter becoming the official title for WWF's female performers, be they managers or wrestlers. . According to Stephanie McMahon, Sable's popularity led to a shift in the role of women in the WWF, as the promotion began to rely less on its female performers as mere eye candy and placed a greater emphasis on female athletes who actually competed in matches and storylines. Sable was one of the first females to compete in such specialty matches as evening gown matches, inter-gender tag team matches, and strap matches, competed in the first-ever WWF bikini contest against [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]], and was also the first female talent to be a Playboy cover girl. Unlike Jacqueline, [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]], [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]], and [[Luna Vachon|Luna]], the more physical Divas and experienced wrestlers at the time, Sable later admitted that it was written in her contract that she was not allowed to take bumps. Despite not being allowed to take bumps, Sable is 3-0 at WrestleMania. [[Kevin Nash]] would later admit that rival promotion, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], were more concerned with Sable's appearance than the superstars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/.ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=9;t=019067|title=WrestlingClassics.com Message Board: Bringing In Sable Was A Good Thing, Not A Bad Thing|website=wrestlingclassics.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://photogallery.indiatimes.com/celebs/celeb-themes/sports-stars-bare-all/articleshow/29536705.cms|title=Sports stars bare all|website=photogallery.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Lita===\n[[File:Lita as Women's Champion.jpg|thumb|right|Lita as [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Champion]] in 2000]]\n[[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] made her WWF debut as a valet for luchador [[Mr. \u00c1guila|Essa Rios]] on the February 13, 2000 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', where Rios was [[Booking (professional wrestling)|booked]] to win the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Gillberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podcastone.com/Talk-Is-Jericho|title=PodcastOne: Talk Is Jericho|first=Chris|last=Jericho|authorlink=Chris Jericho|website=[[PodcastOne]]}}</ref> During the match, Lita mimicked Rios' moves, notably the [[moonsault]] and [[hurricanrana]].

On-screen, Triple H claimed that he was taking over D-Generation X (DX) and had ejected the absent Michaels for \"dropping the ball\" over the Tyson incident and had recruited the [[New Age Outlaws]] ([[Road Dogg|\"Road Dogg\" Jesse James]] and [[Billy Gunn|\"Bad Ass\" Billy Gunn]]) and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] into the \"DX Army\". On April 28, 1998, ''Nitro'' was held at the [[Norfolk Scope]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], while ''Raw'' was held nearby at the [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. With the ongoing war between WWF and WCW, the DX Army decided to initiate an immediate \"invasion\" of ''Nitro''. The DX Army drove to the Norfolk Scope in an army [[Jeep]], challenging WCW head [[Eric Bischoff]]. Soon after, the DX Army appeared at [[CNN Center]] (as well as WCW's stand-alone Atlanta offices) to call out WCW owner [[Ted Turner]]. The stable's popularity continued to grow, and they were eventually [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] as [[antihero]] fan favorites, much like their contemporaries Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock.

Triple H won the match, and afterwards, Stephanie turned on her father to align with her new husband.\n\nThe next night on ''Raw Is War'', Triple H and Stephanie announced the inception of the McMahon-Helmsley Era. His capture of the WWF Championship soon thereafter, coupled with his [[The New Age Outlaws|allies']] dominance of the [[tag team]] division helped cement the Faction's power. With Mr. McMahon injured and the absence of Shane and [[Linda McMahon]], Stephanie was the sole remaining shareholder so she and Triple H assumed control of the WWF. They were immediately opposed by [[Mick Foley]] as his Mankind persona. The Rock came to his defense, but Triple H forced them to face each other in a match where the loser would be [[kayfabe|fired]]. The Rock won the match, which inadvertently caused Foley to be fired.\n\nThe Faction interfered in title matches where Triple H might lose his WWF Championship, either intentionally causing a disqualification or attacking opponents behind the referee's back. The Faction evolved during the period of its existence and dominance into an alliance between the stable, D-Generation X and a resurrected Corporation. Mid-card and lower card Superstars, such as the Hardy Boyz, became targets of the faction as part of their efforts to protect Road Dogg and Billy Gunn's WWF Tag Team Championship. The group also helped Stephanie win the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]] from Jacqueline and assisted X-Pac in his ongoing feud against Kane.\n\nSteve Austin's return in September 2000 serve as a catalyst for the dismantling of the Faction, and by late 2000 the Faction had effectively lost relevance. However, the following year saw Austin joined Triple H, Stephanie and Mr. McMahon to form [[The Power Trip]]. On May 21, 2001, Triple H was sidelined by a tear in his left [[quadriceps muscle]], which kept him out of action for a year and kept him out of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline.\n\n==Defections of WCW talent to the WWF==\nMany WCW wrestlers, who were unhappy with the disorganization, backstage environment and [[workplace politics]] of the promotion, jumped ship to the WWF once the latter began gaining ground in the ratings war.\n\n===The Big Show===\n[[Big Show|Paul Wight]], who wrestled as \"The Giant\" starting in 1995, allowed his WCW contract to expire on February 8, 1999 when [[Eric Bischoff]] denied his request for a pay increase.<ref name=\"The Monday Night War\">''The Monday Night War'' DVD</ref> He signed with WWF a day later and debuted at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]] as \"The Big Show\" Paul Wight, Mr. McMahon's enforcer in The Corporation. After a falling out with The Corporation, The Big Show had feuds with The Undertaker and the [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] before winning the WWF Championship at the [[Survivor Series (1999)|1999 Survivor Series]].\n\n===Chris Jericho===\nFrustrated over WCW's refusal to give him a chance to wrestle [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], [[Chris Jericho]] signed with the WWF on June 30, 1999. On the August 9 episode of ''Raw Is War'', he made his debut, referring to himself as \"Y2J\" (a play on the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K bug]]) and began feuds with The Rock, Chyna, [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]] while capturing the Intercontinental and [[WWE European Championship|European]] championships on several occasions in the era. On the April 17, 2000 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Jericho defeated Triple H for the WWF Championship, but the decision was reversed by referee [[Earl Hebner]] under pressure from Triple H. Jericho continued to feud with Triple H throughout 2000 leading to a Last Man Standing match at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] which Triple H won. Jericho later defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock on the same night at [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance 2001]], becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion in the process.\n\n===The Radicalz===\nIn January 2000, [[Chris Benoit]], [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]] left WCW for the WWF. Benoit had just defeated [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sid Vicious]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Souled Out 2000]] on January 17, but the decision was reversed after it was revealed that Sid's foot was under the ropes while he tapped out to the [[Crippler Crossface]]. The quartet made their TV debut on the January 31 episode of ''Raw'' as audience members and backstage guests of Mick Foley before attacking the New Age Outlaws. They were offered a chance to \"win\" contracts by defeating members of D-Generation X in a series of three matches. Despite losing all three matches, they were \"given\" WWF contracts by Triple H in exchange for betraying Foley. The quartet became known as [[The Radicalz]].\n\n==Tables, ladders and chairs matches==\n[[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy]], dubbed as members of \"[[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The New Brood]]\" faced off against Edge and Christian in the first-ever tag team ladder match, dubbed the \"Terri Invitational Tournament\" at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] in October 1999. The Hardys won the match and the services of [[Terri Runnels]] as their manager. The Hardys then declared that they were no longer the New Brood \u2013 they were \"[[The Hardy Boyz]]\".\n\nThe [[Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley|Bubba Ray]] and [[D-Von Dudley|D-Von]]) debuted in WWF in the summer of 1999 following their departure from ECW. They were initially villains and were responsible for bringing the use of tables into wrestling mainstream. Bubba Ray became notorious for his penchant for slamming women through tables during this era, including the 77-year old [[Mae Young]]. In January 2000 the Dudleys faced off against The Hardy Boyz in the first-ever tag team Table match at the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], which the Hardys won.\n\nEventually, the three teams were brought together in a triangle ladder match at [[WrestleMania 2000]] for the WWF Tag Team Championship, in what would be the forerunner of the TLC in terms of the spots involved. Edge and Christian won the match and the titles. Edge and Christian later developed the \"[[One man con-chair-to|con-chair-to]]\" (a play on the word \"concerto\") finishing move, which involved the two hitting an opponent's head simultaneously, on opposite sides, with chairs (which simulated the clashing of [[cymbal]]s). This led to then-WWF Commissioner Mick Foley to bring the three teams together for the first-ever [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]], or TLC match, at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]] in August 2000. Edge and Christian won the match. The following year, a second TLC match, dubbed \"TLC II\", occurred at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], and is regarded as one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. This match, which Edge & Christian won also featured interference [[Rhyno]], [[Spike Dudley]] and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] and a popular spot where Edge standing on a ladder speared Jeff Hardy midair from the top of another ladder.\n\n==End of the era==\nThe company ceased its \"Attitude\" promotion on May 6, 2002 when usage of the initials \"WWF\", which were prominent within the logo, became prohibited as the result of a legal battle between the company and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] over the rights to legally use those initials. World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. officially became World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) and replaced its \"Attitude\" promotion with a \"Get the F out\" marketing campaign. Shortly thereafter the company transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression era, this period still featured many elements of its predecessor, including the level of violence and amount of profanity but there was less sexual and politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe company's \"WWF Attitude\" branding proved to be a huge marketing success, drawing in a previously unaccounted for young adult demographic that allowed them to successfully defeat their competition, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the ratings war. By 2001, WCW had lost its [[Prime time|primetime]] [[television]] deal. During this same period, the WWF had become so financially powerful and WCW had devalued so badly that McMahon was able to [[buyout|buy]] WCW's trademarks, logos, copyrights, video archived library, and several wrestler contracts from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] at a dramatically reduced valuation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Home video===\nOn November 20, 2012, a three-disc documentary set simply entitled ''The Attitude Era'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray disc]].

The video game first entitled ''[[WWE 2K14]]'' featured some of the four WrestleMania matches based on the Attitude Era as well, with [[WrestleMania XIV]] and XV having previously appeared in ''[[WWE Legends of WrestleMania]]'' prior to their appearances in ''WWE '13'' and ''WWE 2K14''.

THE ERA HAS NO DEFINITIVE BEGINNING.-->during the late 1990s. WWF's programming, branded as \"WWF Attitude\", featured adult-oriented content, which included an increase in the level of depicted violence, profanity and sexual content. This era was part of a wider surge in the popularity of professional wrestling in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] as television ratings and [[pay-per-view]] buy-rates for WWF and its rival promotions saw record highs.\n\nThe Attitude Era marked the rise of many WWF male singles wrestlers, including [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], [[Mick Foley]] (in various personas), [[The Undertaker]], [[Triple H]], and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/wwe-attitude-era-superstars-article-1.2470329|author=Hau Chu|title=Where are they now?

It was also the resurgence of [[tag team]] wrestling, namely [[The Hardy Boyz]], [[The Dudley Boyz]], and [[Edge & Christian]] who were featured in several destructive, physical and stunt-filled [[Tables, Ladders and Chairs match]]es during this era. Distinguished stables established in this era, such as [[D-Generation X]], [[Nation of Domination|The Nation of Domination]], [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], [[The Ministry of Darkness]], [[The Corporate Ministry]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] among others developed major rivalries among each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/features/from-federation-to-entertainment-wwes-journey-is-mirrored-in-wrestling-games-644652|title=From Federation to Entertainment, WWE's Journey is Mirrored in Wrestling Games|website=NDTV Gadgets 360}}</ref>\n\n==Initiation==\n[[File:Vince Russo at the Family Arena.jpg|thumb|140px|Vince Russo]]\nDuring the [[Monday Night Wars]]\u200a\u2014\u200aa ratings battle between WWF's ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' and WCW's ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]''\u200a\u2014\u200athe WWF transformed itself from a long history of family-friendly programming into a more adult oriented product. The creative side of the product during the early stages of the era was spearheaded by Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] and head writer [[Vince Russo]], who drastically changed the way professional wrestling television was written.

A few years after the Hulkamania era, WWF needed more sales. In his book, Russo mentions the debut of the character [[Goldust]] in 1995 as a turning point. Goldust portrayed an [[androgynous]] wrestler was also viewed as a shift to a more adult oriented product.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prowrestlingstories.com/pro-wrestling-stories/goldust-dustin-runnels-implants/|title=Goldust &#124; How The Bizarre One Tried to Get Breast Implants|first=Rob|last=Irel|date=September 20, 2018|website=ProWrestlingStories.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/goldust-wwe-attitude-era/|title=Goldust Believes He Helped Launch WWE\u2019s Attitude Era Over 20 Years Ago|date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> [[Brian Pillman]]'s \"loose cannon\" persona and the \"[[Pillman's got a gun]]\" segment from 1996 when he pulled a gun on Austin, has also been credited.

Mr. McMahon, who did not want Austin to be the WWF Champion, would stop at nothing to put an end to Stone Cold, and Austin would do anything to beat Vince. On the ''Raw'' after Austin won the WWF Championship, Mr. McMahon presented him with the newly designed WWF Championship belt and informed him he did not approve of his rebellious nature and that if he did not conform to society and become his image of what a WWF Champion should be, Austin would face severe consequences. Austin gave his answer in the form of a Stone Cold Stunner to McMahon. This led to a segment a week later where Austin had pledged a few days prior in a meeting to agree to McMahon's terms, appearing in a [[Suit (clothing)#Suit etiquette for men|suit and tie]], with a beaming McMahon taking a picture of himself and Austin, his new corporate champion. The entire thing was a ruse by Austin, who in the course of the segment proceeded to tear off the suit, telling McMahon it was the last time he'd ever be seen dressed like this. Austin punched McMahon in the [[Testicles|'corporate grapefruits']] and took another picture with McMahon writhing in pain.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe following week on April 13, 1998, Austin and McMahon were going to battle out their differences in an actual match, but the match was declared a [[No contest (professional wrestling)|no contest]] when [[Mick Foley]] (as Dude Love) interrupted the entire contest. On that night ''Raw'' defeated ''Nitro'' in the ratings for the first time since June 10, 1996.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nTheir rivalry continued throughout the Attitude Era, bringing increased revenue and attention to the company. The rivalry got more intense as time went on, with McMahon trying to sabotage Austin whenever he could to stop him from being the WWF Champion. Austin often exacted revenge on McMahon, such as attacking McMahon with a bedpan while he was in the hospital, stealing a cement mixer and driving it into the arena, then filling up one of McMahon's Corvette cars with cement,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gLjQiYBPQI|title=\"Stone Cold\" pours cement into Mr. McMahon's corvette|first=|last=WWE|date=11 October 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> driving a Zamboni to the ring before attacking McMahon leading to Austin's arrest once again,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpRv1FVAvsI|title=Stone Cold' drives a zamboni to the ring|first=|last=WWE|date=27 September 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> kidnapping Vince in a wheelchair, wheeling him down to the ring at gunpoint which ended up actually being a toy gun with a scroll that reads \"Bang 3:16!\" which frightened McMahon so much he urinated himself, or driving a beer truck to the ring and using a fire hose to spray Vince, Shane McMahon and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] with beer. Austin wrestled McMahon in 1999 at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in a steel cage, which he won when the debuting [[Big Show]] accidentally threw him through the cage wall, thus earning a world title shot at [[WrestleMania XV]]. Through the rivalry, McMahon founded two heel [[Professional wrestling stable|factions]]: [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]] and [[Corporate Ministry|The Corporate Ministry]], using several wrestlers to face Austin, including The Rock, The Undertaker, Kane and Big Show.\n\n==The Rock==\n[[Dwayne Johnson]], a third-generation wrestler, made his debut at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]] as \"Rocky Maivia\", naming himself after his grandfather [[Peter Maivia]] and his father [[Rocky Johnson]]. Despite being a babyface with an impressive winning streak and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] reign, he was frequently met with negative reception from live audiences: loud boos, \"Rocky sucks!\" chants, and even crowd signs that read \"Die Rocky Die\".\n\n===Nation of Domination===\n[[Image:WWE - Sheffield 020499 (49).jpg|right|thumb|190px|The Rock was one of the biggest stars of the Attitude Era]]\nMaivia joined the [[Nation of Domination]] in 1997 and renamed himself \"The Rock\", an egotistical jock who referred to himself in third person and often cut colorful promos insulting rival wrestlers as well as fans who did not support him. As a member of the Nation of Domination, The Rock won the Intercontinental title for a second time. The Rock eventually overthrew [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] to become the leader of the Nation.\n\n===The People's Champion===\nAfter the Nation disbanded, The Rock referred to himself as the \"People's Champion\" and began to receive the support of the audience, which led Vince McMahon and the Corporation to target him. After battling McMahon's goons for the chance to go to the Survivor Series, the Rock entered the tournament and made it to the finals against McMahon's chosen representative, Mankind. [[Survivor Series 1998]] was the first PPV headlined by The Rock. During the match, a double turn occurred with the help of McMahon, similar to the previous year's Survivor Series, revealing that Rock was working with The Corporation all along. The Rock officially joined McMahon as the crown jewel of The Corporation, abandoning his previous moniker as \"The People's Champion\" and declaring himself \"The Corporate Champion\".\n\n===The Corporation===\nAs a member of The Corporation, The Rock's persona changed yet again, to an even more callous attitude. The Rock had a lengthy feud with Mankind, with a rematch at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House|Rock Bottom]], where Rock retained the title due to a technicality, even though he lost the match. Mankind, however, won the title on ''Raw Is War''. The reign was short lived, as the Rock got his rematch at the 1999 Royal Rumble, in an I Quit Match. The Rock won the I Quit Match and became the WWF Champion yet again. A rematch, known as \"Half-Time Heat\", took place during halftime of the Super Bowl, and Mankind won the match and the title, after pinning the Rock underneath a forklift. The Rock got a rematch at St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in a last man standing match for the chance to headline [[WrestleMania XV]] as the WWF Champion. The bout ended in a draw after both men were unable to stand at the ten count. Despite Mankind being the WWF Champion, he gave the Rock one more shot at the title in a ladder match on ''Raw''. This was their final match, as the Big Show interfered in the match and chokeslammed Mankind off the ladder, leaving the Rock all by himself to win the match and headline WrestleMania XV as WWF Champion.\n\nAt WrestleMania XV The Rock, the WWF Champion faced off against the challenger, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Vince McMahon interfered in the match attacking Stone Cold to try and stop him but was unsuccessful. Austin won the match and seemingly defeated The Corporation and McMahon. Austin, after winning the title, described the belt as not being good enough, using his personalized Smoking Skull Belt. McMahon, who was in possession of the belt, ordered Shane McMahon to give it to Austin, seemingly ending their feud. But Shane had other plans, as he went against his father's wishes and gave the belt to The Rock. This was the basis for The Rock's rematch at Backlash for the WWF Championship. In order for Stone Cold to reclaim his Smoking Skull belt, he had to defeat the Rock at Backlash. With the WWF Championship on the line, The Rock lost the rematch and the Smoking Skull belt. The night after Backlash, after failing to beat Austin for a second time, Shane McMahon turned on The Rock and fired him from the Corporation.\n\n===Return as The People's Champion===\nAfter being fired from the Corporation, The Rock once again declared himself the People's Champion and went on a number of small feuds during the latter part of 1999. It was during this time The Rock's popularity began to flourish once again, and he joined his former rival Mankind to create the tag team, [[The Rock 'n' Sock Connection]]. The team won the WWF Tag Team titles. After the Rock 'n' Sock connection broke up, The Rock went back into the main event picture of the WWF, battling the likes of [[Triple H]] and his stable, the [[McMahon-Helmsley Faction]]. Late in the Attitude Era, The Rock faced Stone Cold Steve Austin again at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] for the WWF Championship. Stone Cold once again defeated The Rock to regain the title and also joined forces with his nemesis Mr. McMahon.\n\n==The Undertaker==\n[[The Undertaker]] was one of only a handful of top performers who never left the WWF before and during the Monday Night Wars. His gimmick, a horror-themed, macabre entity who employed scare tactics and held links to the supernatural, allowed the WWF to push the envelope from a creative perspective during this era.\n\n===The Brothers of Destruction===\n{{main|The Brothers of Destruction}}\nAt [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]] in 1996, The Undertaker became embroiled in a feud with his former manager [[Paul Bearer]]. During the course of their conflict, Bearer threatened The Undertaker with the threat of revealing his 'secret', calling him a \"murderer\" and accusing him of killing his parents and brother. In the following weeks on ''Raw'', Bearer revealed that his brother [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] was actually still alive. Kane debuted at [[Badd Blood: In Your House]], wearing a mask and interfering in the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Undertaker and [[Shawn Michaels]]. Following a series of taunts from Bearer and Kane, who cost him the WWF World Heavyweight Title at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]], he agreed to face Kane at [[WrestleMania XIV]]. The Undertaker won the match at WrestleMania and the first ever [[Inferno Match]] at [[Unforgiven (1998)|Unforgiven]]. Following the conclusion of this storyline, The Undertaker and Kane united to form a tag team that became known as The Brothers of Destruction.\n\n===The Ministry of Darkness===\n[[File:WWE - Newcastle Arena 030499 (2).jpg|thumb|Edge and Christian as members of the Brood]]\n{{main|The Ministry of Darkness}}\nIn late 1998, The Undertaker turned on Kane and realigned himself with Paul Bearer. Now proclaiming himself as the \"Lord of Darkness\", he began taking a more macabre and darker persona, claiming that a \"plague of evil\" would hit WWF. During the weeks that followed, he reignited his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin, whom he blamed for costing him the WWF title. At [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]], Austin defeated the Undertaker in a Buried Alive match with the help of Kane, writing him off of WWF television for a month.\n\nUpon his return, a much scarier, darker, druid-like Undertaker introduced his Ministry of Darkness, a satanic-themed stable which consisted of [[The Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] ([[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]] and [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]], [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]] and [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]], [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]). The storyline continued over the weeks that followed, as the Undertaker announced his intentions of taking over WWF and claimed he was working for a \"higher power\". He began a feud with [[Vince McMahon]] and his daughter [[Stephanie McMahon|Stephanie]], with the Ministry burning Undertaker's symbol in the McMahon family yard.\n\nAt [[Backlash: In Your House]] on April 25, Mr. McMahon had [[Ken Shamrock]] face The Undertaker, but his plan backfired and Shamrock was attacked by Bradshaw after the match. Later, The Undertaker commandeered Stephanie's limo and drove off into the night with a screaming Stephanie in tow as Backlash went off the air. The Undertaker attempted to marry her the next night on ''Raw Is War'' by holding a \"Black Wedding\" for himself and Stephanie in a bid to take control of the company. The ceremony was successfully ruined by Steve Austin, after two attempts by Corporation members [[Big Show]] and Ken Shamrock failed.\n\n=== The Corporate Ministry ===\n{{main|The Corporate Ministry}}\nOn the very first ever episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'', The Undertaker joined forces with Shane McMahon, in turn gaining control of The Corporation and merging his Ministry with it to form [[The Corporate Ministry]]. The Undertaker, with the help of Shane, defeated Austin at [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge 1999]] and won the [[WWF Championship]]. However, after Mr. McMahon was revealed as its \"Greater Power\", The Corporate Ministry eventually dissolved.\n\nThe Undertaker formed a new \"Unholy Alliance\" with Big Show, Mideon and Viscera, which led to two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Big Show and Undertaker. This group came to an end when The Undertaker suffered a [[Glossary of professional wrestling#Legit|legit]] injury in September and was written out by quitting, rather than taking a match ordered by Mr. McMahon.<ref name=\"WWF SmackDown! - 09/23/1999\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/tv/smackdown/990923.htm|title=WWF SmackDown results|publisher=PWWEW.net|accessdate=March 21, 2013|date=September 23, 1999}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Mick Foley==\n[[File:Mick Foley 2008.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mick Foley]]]]\n[[Mick Foley]] played three different personas during this era: Mankind, Dude Love and Cactus Jack. While Mankind was his main persona in WWF and Cactus Jack was previously used in his days in WCW, Japan and independent circuits, Dude Love was inspired by a character Foley created when he and his high school friends did [[backyard wrestling]] in his home area of [[Long Island, New York]]. Foley debuted both Dude Love and Cactus Jack in the WWF in mid-1997, while Mankind was debuted at Foley's first ever WWF event on April 1, 1996 during the ''Raw'' event right after [[WrestleMania 12]]. Foley's creative versatility allowed him to create distinct and different characteristics for each character and he would prepare for each role by putting himself in each character's respective comfort zone, much like an actor would when preparing for a role on film or stage. Although his general move-set stayed the same, Foley would have different motions and even different catchphrases for each character (Cactus Jack: \"Bang Bang!\", Mankind: \"Have a Nice Day!\", Dude Love: \"Owwww, Have Mercy!\").\n\nWhen developing the Mankind character he would spend whole nights under the wrestling ring or in that week's arena's boiler room. In addition, as he had been in his previous days in different wrestling circuits, Foley, the \"Hardcore Legend\" was often involved in the Attitude Era's most violent and dangerous matches, including no-disqualification matches that took place outside the ring and [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore matches]] with sharp objects such barbed wire, thumbtacks, broken glass and also various blunt objects- and most of Foley\u2019s matches included at least one dangerous bump. The image of Foley being thrown and falling 20 feet from the top of the third Hell in a Cell match by The Undertaker at the [[1998 Hell in a Cell match|1998 King of the Ring]] is synonymous with the era, along with [[Jim Ross]]' commentary of \"as God is my witness, he is broken in half!\".{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn January 4, 1999 on ''Raw Is War'', he won his first WWF Championship from The Rock with the help of Stone Cold Steve Austin. This match is also known as the turning point in ratings of the [[Monday Night Wars]] as it favored WWF until the end of the wars and led to the downfall of WCW. That night, WCW attempted to sabotage ''Raw''{{'}}s rating by announcing the result of the match on ''Nitro'', but their plan backfired when Nielsen ratings indicated that over 600,000 households changed the channel to watch the victory and shifted the ratings for the night in WWF's favor.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foley|first=Mick|title=Foley is Good: And the Real World is Faker Than Wrestling|url=https://archive.org/details/foleyisgoodrealw00fole|url-access=registration|publisher=HarperCollins |date=2001-07-01|isbn=0-00-714508-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/foleyisgoodrealw00fole/page/9 9]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|title=WrestleCrap: True Stories of the World's Maddest Wrestlers|isbn=1-84454-071-5|author2=Baer, Randy|publisher=Blake Publishing|date=2004-10-01|page=201}}</ref>\n\n==Owen Hart==\n[[File:Owen Hart 1997.jpg|thumb|right|Owen Hart in 1997]]\nNear the beginning of the Attitude Era in late 1997, [[Bret Hart]] left WWF due to a contract dispute and joined WCW. He was soon followed by family members [[Jim Neidhart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith]], leaving younger brother [[Owen Hart]] as the sole remaining member of [[the Hart Family]] employed by WWF. He remained off-camera during the tumult following the [[Montreal Screwjob]] and later reappeared using the nicknames \"Black Hart\" and \"Lone Hart\".\n\nOwen Hart was aligned with the [[Nation of Domination]] for much of 1998, winning the European Title along the way. After the dissolution of the stable, Hart began teaming with [[Jeff Jarrett]]. In the storyline, Hart quit the WWF after accidentally injuring [[Dan Severn]], but he quickly re-emerged as the [[comic relief|joke character]] \"The Blue Blazer\", reprising a gimmick that Hart had employed early in his career.\n\nHart died on May 23, 1999 at the [[Over the Edge (1999)|Over the Edge]] pay-per-view event. In an elaborate entrance routine that he had performed before, Hart (as The Blue Blazer) was to be lowered to the ring slowly from the rafters, with intent to perform a pratfall from a few feet above the ring. When the harness failed, Hart instead fell 78 feet into the ring, striking the top rope with his chest, leading to his death minutes later from internal bleeding as a result of blunt force trauma. The company made the controversial decision to continue the event to its completion after the incident. On the next evening's ''Raw Is War'', all storylines were suspended and the entire show was presented as a tribute to Hart, with other superstars sharing their memories of him between exhibition matches.\n\n==The women's division==\n\n===Sable===\n[[File:Sable in Manchester.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sable during a WWF tour in England in April 1998]]\n[[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] made her World Wrestling Federation debut at [[WrestleMania XII]] in March 1996, escorting [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]] to the ring as he took on the returning [[The Ultimate Warrior|Ultimate Warrior]]. Sable's first major angle involved her then real-life husband, who debuted at WrestleMania XII as \"Wildman\" [[Marc Mero]]. Sable, however, quickly eclipsed both her husband and real-life rival Sunny in popularity, leading to the reinstatement of the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] as well as the promotion's hiring of more female wrestlers. Sable became the first WWF female to refer to herself as a \"Diva\" during the April 19 edition of ''Raw Is War'' in 1999; the term would be coined and shortly thereafter becoming the official title for WWF's female performers, be they managers or wrestlers. . According to Stephanie McMahon, Sable's popularity led to a shift in the role of women in the WWF, as the promotion began to rely less on its female performers as mere eye candy and placed a greater emphasis on female athletes who actually competed in matches and storylines. Sable was one of the first females to compete in such specialty matches as evening gown matches, inter-gender tag team matches, and strap matches, competed in the first-ever WWF bikini contest against [[Jacqueline Moore|Jacqueline]], and was also the first female talent to be a Playboy cover girl. Unlike Jacqueline, [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]], [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]], and [[Luna Vachon|Luna]], the more physical Divas and experienced wrestlers at the time, Sable later admitted that it was written in her contract that she was not allowed to take bumps. Despite not being allowed to take bumps, Sable is 3-0 at WrestleMania. [[Kevin Nash]] would later admit that rival promotion, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], were more concerned with Sable's appearance than the superstars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/.ubb/ultimatebb.php?ubb=get_topic;f=9;t=019067|title=WrestlingClassics.com Message Board: Bringing In Sable Was A Good Thing, Not A Bad Thing|website=wrestlingclassics.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://photogallery.indiatimes.com/celebs/celeb-themes/sports-stars-bare-all/articleshow/29536705.cms|title=Sports stars bare all|website=photogallery.indiatimes.com}}</ref>\n\n===Lita===\n[[File:Lita as Women's Champion.jpg|thumb|right|Lita as [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Champion]] in 2000]]\n[[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] made her WWF debut as a valet for luchador [[Mr. \u00c1guila|Essa Rios]] on the February 13, 2000 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', where Rios was [[Booking (professional wrestling)|booked]] to win the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]] from [[Gillberg (wrestler)|Gillberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://podcastone.com/Talk-Is-Jericho|title=PodcastOne: Talk Is Jericho|first=Chris|last=Jericho|authorlink=Chris Jericho|website=[[PodcastOne]]}}</ref> During the match, Lita mimicked Rios' moves, notably the [[moonsault]] and [[hurricanrana]]. Lita eventually left Rios' side and allied with the [[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy]], and the trio formed a [[Stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] known as [[The Hardy Boyz#Team Xtreme (2000\u20132002)|Team Xtreme]].

On-screen, Triple H claimed that he was taking over D-Generation X (DX) and had ejected the absent Michaels for \"dropping the ball\" over the Tyson incident and had recruited the [[New Age Outlaws]] ([[Road Dogg|\"Road Dogg\" Jesse James]] and [[Billy Gunn|\"Bad Ass\" Billy Gunn]]) and [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] into the \"DX Army\". On April 28, 1998, ''Nitro'' was held at the [[Norfolk Scope]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], while ''Raw'' was held nearby at the [[Hampton Coliseum]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. With the ongoing war between WWF and WCW, the DX Army decided to initiate an immediate \"invasion\" of ''Nitro''. The DX Army drove to the Norfolk Scope in an army [[Jeep]], challenging WCW head [[Eric Bischoff]]. Soon after, the DX Army appeared at [[CNN Center]] (as well as WCW's stand-alone Atlanta offices) to call out WCW owner [[Ted Turner]]. The stable's popularity continued to grow, and they were eventually [[Push (professional wrestling)|pushed]] as [[antihero]] fan favorites, much like their contemporaries Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. [[Chyna]] the sole female wrestler of the stable has been cited as most dominant female wrestler of all time and participated in several inter gender matches and is the only woman to have won the men's prestigious [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]].<ref>https://www.wwe.com/inside/top25/impactfulwomen/page-24</ref>\n\n==The McMahon-Helmsley Faction==\n[[File:Sephanie_WWF_-_King_of_the_Ring_2000_cropped.jpg|thumb|170px|Stephanie McMahon with the WWF Women's Championship during the [[King of the Ring (2000)|2000 King of the Ring PPV Event]]]]\n{{main|The McMahon-Helmsley Faction}}\nOn the November 29, 1999 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw Is War]]'', Stephanie McMahon was set to [[kayfabe|marry]] [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], but Triple H interrupted the ceremony. He played a video on the ''[[Jumbotron|titantron]]'' showing himself marrying a drugged Stephanie at a drive-through chapel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. This led to a match at [[Armageddon (1999)|Armageddon]] between Triple H and Mr. McMahon with the stipulations being that if Triple H won, he would receive a WWF Championship title shot on ''Raw Is War'', whereas, if Vince was victorious, Triple H would sign an [[annulment]]. Triple H won the match, and afterwards, Stephanie turned on her father to align with her new husband.\n\nThe next night on ''Raw Is War'', Triple H and Stephanie announced the inception of the McMahon-Helmsley Era. His capture of the WWF Championship soon thereafter, coupled with his [[The New Age Outlaws|allies']] dominance of the [[tag team]] division helped cement the Faction's power. With Mr. McMahon injured and the absence of Shane and [[Linda McMahon]], Stephanie was the sole remaining shareholder so she and Triple H assumed control of the WWF. They were immediately opposed by [[Mick Foley]] as his Mankind persona. The Rock came to his defense, but Triple H forced them to face each other in a match where the loser would be [[kayfabe|fired]]. The Rock won the match, which inadvertently caused Foley to be fired.\n\nThe Faction interfered in title matches where Triple H might lose his WWF Championship, either intentionally causing a disqualification or attacking opponents behind the referee's back. The Faction evolved during the period of its existence and dominance into an alliance between the stable, D-Generation X and a resurrected Corporation. Mid-card and lower card Superstars, such as the Hardy Boyz, became targets of the faction as part of their efforts to protect Road Dogg and Billy Gunn's WWF Tag Team Championship. The group also helped Stephanie win the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|Women's Championship]] from Jacqueline and assisted X-Pac in his ongoing feud against Kane.\n\nSteve Austin's return in September 2000 serve as a catalyst for the dismantling of the Faction, and by late 2000 the Faction had effectively lost relevance. However, the following year saw Austin joined Triple H, Stephanie and Mr. McMahon to form [[The Power Trip]]. On May 21, 2001, Triple H was sidelined by a tear in his left [[quadriceps muscle]], which kept him out of action for a year and kept him out of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] storyline.\n\n==Defections of WCW talent to the WWF==\nMany WCW wrestlers, who were unhappy with the disorganization, backstage environment and [[workplace politics]] of the promotion, jumped ship to the WWF once the latter began gaining ground in the ratings war.\n\n===The Big Show===\n[[Big Show|Paul Wight]], who wrestled as \"The Giant\" starting in 1995, allowed his WCW contract to expire on February 8, 1999 when [[Eric Bischoff]] denied his request for a pay increase.<ref name=\"The Monday Night War\">''The Monday Night War'' DVD</ref> He signed with WWF a day later and debuted at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House]] as \"The Big Show\" Paul Wight, Mr. McMahon's enforcer in The Corporation. After a falling out with The Corporation, The Big Show had feuds with The Undertaker and the [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]] before winning the WWF Championship at the [[Survivor Series (1999)|1999 Survivor Series]].\n\n===Chris Jericho===\nFrustrated over WCW's refusal to give him a chance to wrestle [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]], [[Chris Jericho]] signed with the WWF on June 30, 1999. On the August 9 episode of ''Raw Is War'', he made his debut, referring to himself as \"Y2J\" (a play on the [[Year 2000 problem|Y2K bug]]) and began feuds with The Rock, Chyna, [[Kurt Angle]] and [[Chris Benoit]] while capturing the Intercontinental and [[WWE European Championship|European]] championships on several occasions in the era. On the April 17, 2000 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Jericho defeated Triple H for the WWF Championship, but the decision was reversed by referee [[Earl Hebner]] under pressure from Triple H. Jericho continued to feud with Triple H throughout 2000 leading to a Last Man Standing match at [[Fully Loaded (2000)|Fully Loaded]] which Triple H won. Jericho later defeated Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock on the same night at [[Vengeance (2001)|Vengeance 2001]], becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion in the process.\n\n===The Radicalz===\nIn January 2000, [[Chris Benoit]], [[Eddie Guerrero]], [[Dean Malenko]] and [[Perry Saturn]] left WCW for the WWF. Benoit had just defeated [[Sid Vicious (wrestler)|Sid Vicious]] for the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Souled Out 2000]] on January 17, but the decision was reversed after it was revealed that Sid's foot was under the ropes while he tapped out to the [[Crippler Crossface]]. The quartet made their TV debut on the January 31 episode of ''Raw'' as audience members and backstage guests of Mick Foley before attacking the New Age Outlaws. They were offered a chance to \"win\" contracts by defeating members of D-Generation X in a series of three matches. Despite losing all three matches, they were \"given\" WWF contracts by Triple H in exchange for betraying Foley. The quartet became known as [[The Radicalz]].\n\n==Tables, ladders and chairs matches==\n[[Matt Hardy|Matt]] and [[Jeff Hardy]], dubbed as members of \"[[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The New Brood]]\" faced off against Edge and Christian in the first-ever tag team ladder match, dubbed the \"Terri Invitational Tournament\" at [[No Mercy (1999)|No Mercy]] in October 1999. The Hardys won the match and the services of [[Terri Runnels]] as their manager. The Hardys then declared that they were no longer the New Brood \u2013 they were \"[[The Hardy Boyz]]\".\n\nThe [[Dudley Boyz]] ([[Bubba Ray Dudley|Bubba Ray]] and [[D-Von Dudley|D-Von]]) debuted in WWF in the summer of 1999 following their departure from ECW. They were initially villains and were responsible for bringing the use of tables into wrestling mainstream. Bubba Ray became notorious for his penchant for slamming women through tables during this era, including the 77-year old [[Mae Young]]. In January 2000 the Dudleys faced off against The Hardy Boyz in the first-ever tag team Table match at the [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]], which the Hardys won.\n\nEventually, the three teams were brought together in a triangle ladder match at [[WrestleMania 2000]] for the WWF Tag Team Championship, in what would be the forerunner of the TLC in terms of the spots involved. Edge and Christian won the match and the titles. Edge and Christian later developed the \"[[One man con-chair-to|con-chair-to]]\" (a play on the word \"concerto\") finishing move, which involved the two hitting an opponent's head simultaneously, on opposite sides, with chairs (which simulated the clashing of [[cymbal]]s). This led to then-WWF Commissioner Mick Foley to bring the three teams together for the first-ever [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]], or TLC match, at [[SummerSlam (2000)|SummerSlam]] in August 2000. Edge and Christian won the match. The following year, a second TLC match, dubbed \"TLC II\", occurred at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], and is regarded as one of the greatest wrestling matches of all time. This match, which Edge & Christian won also featured interference [[Rhyno]], [[Spike Dudley]] and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] and a popular spot where Edge standing on a ladder speared Jeff Hardy midair from the top of another ladder.\n\n==End of the era==\nThe company ceased its \"Attitude\" promotion on May 6, 2002 when usage of the initials \"WWF\", which were prominent within the logo, became prohibited as the result of a legal battle between the company and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] over the rights to legally use those initials. World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. officially became World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) and replaced its \"Attitude\" promotion with a \"Get the F out\" marketing campaign. Shortly thereafter the company transitioned into its Ruthless Aggression era, this period still featured many elements of its predecessor, including the level of violence and amount of profanity but there was less sexual and politically incorrect content, and a further emphasis on wrestling was showcased.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe company's \"WWF Attitude\" branding proved to be a huge marketing success, drawing in a previously unaccounted for young adult demographic that allowed them to successfully defeat their competition, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the ratings war. By 2001, WCW had lost its [[Prime time|primetime]] [[television]] deal. During this same period, the WWF had become so financially powerful and WCW had devalued so badly that McMahon was able to [[buyout|buy]] WCW's trademarks, logos, copyrights, video archived library, and several wrestler contracts from [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]] at a dramatically reduced valuation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Home video===\nOn November 20, 2012, a three-disc documentary set simply entitled ''The Attitude Era'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray disc]]. The video cover is a collage of WWF Superstars and celebrities of that era, designed as a parody of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt.

(video game)|WWF SmackDown!]]'', ''[[WWF SmackDown! 2: Know Your Role]]'', ''[[WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It]]'' and ''[[WWF Raw (2002 video game)|WWF Raw]]''.\n\nA video game entitled ''[[WWE '13]]'', which was released in October 2012, paid tribute to the era with its \"Attitude Era\" mode, which allows the player to re-enact WWF matches and storytelling from [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in August 1997 to [[WrestleMania XV]] in March 1999. The video game first entitled ''[[WWE 2K14]]'' featured some of the four WrestleMania matches based on the Attitude Era as well, with [[WrestleMania XIV]] and XV having previously appeared in ''[[WWE Legends of WrestleMania]]'' prior to their appearances in ''WWE '13'' and ''WWE 2K14''. The video game entitled ''[[WWE 2K16]]'' featured some events of the Attitude Era specifically related to [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was also on the game's cover.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of professional wrestling in the United States]]\n* [[History of WWE]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{World Wrestling Entertainment}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Attitude Era}}\n[[Category:History of WWE]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling controversies]]\n", "name_user": "219.74.157.84", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eThe Rock)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_Era"}
