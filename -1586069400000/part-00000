Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

In the early 15th century it was granted [[city rights]], but remained a rather small and insubstantial town. It was the property of [[Kuyavia]]n bishops and clergy until the end of the 18th century, when \u0141\u00f3d\u017a was annexed by [[Prussia]] as a result of the [[second partition of Poland]]. Following the collapse of the independent [[Duchy of Warsaw]], the city became part of [[Congress Poland]], a client state of the [[Russian Empire]]. It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced a rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population due to the inflow of migrants, most notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has struggled with many difficulties such as [[Multinational state|multinationalism]] and social inequality, which were vividly documented in the novel ''[[The Promised Land (novel)|The Promised Land]]'' written by Polish [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont]]. The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city, where luxurious mansions coexisted with redbrick factories and dilapidated tenement houses.<ref name=\"staypoland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/about_lodz.htm|title=Lodz \u2013 Tourism {{!}} Tourist Information \u2013 Lodz, Poland| publisher=eTravel S.A.| date=|website=staypoland.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter Poland regained its [[National Independence Day|independence]] in 1918, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a grew to be one of the largest Polish cities and one of the most multicultural and industrial centers in [[Europe]]. The interbellum period saw rapid development in education and healthcare. After the [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] captured the city and renamed it ''Litzmannstadt'' in honour of the German general [[Karl Litzmann]], who was victorious near the area during [[World War I]]. The city's large Jewish population was forced into a walled zone known as the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto]], from which they were sent to German [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration and extermination camps]].

In 1423 King [[Jogaila|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o]] officially granted [[Magdeburg rights|city rights]] to the village of ''\u0141\u00f3d\u017a''. From then until the 18th century the town remained a small settlement on a [[trade route]] between the provinces of [[Masovia]] and [[Silesia]]. In the 16th century the town had fewer than 800 inhabitants, mostly working on the surrounding grain farms.\n\nWith the [[Second Partition of Poland|second partition of Poland]] in 1793, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]'s province of [[South Prussia]], and was known in German as ''Lodsch''. In 1798 the Prussians nationalised the town, and it lost its status as a town of the bishops of [[Kuyavia]]. In 1806 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a joined the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and in 1810 it had approximately 190 inhabitants.

However, countless small companies still provide a significant output of textiles, mostly for export to Russia and other countries of the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]]. \u0141\u00f3d\u017a is no longer a significant industrial centre, but it has become a major hub for the business services sector in Poland owing to the availability of highly-skilled workers and active cooperation between local universities and the business sector.<ref>{{cite report |author=Association of Business Service Leaders (ABSL) |date=2019 |title=Business Services Sector in Poland 2019 |url=https://absl.pl/storage/app/uploads/public/5d0/7a1/406/5d07a140668f0191663458.pdf |publisher=ABSL |pages=28, 55}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Izraela Pozna\u0144skiego \u0141\u00f3d\u017a ogr\u00f3d.JPG|thumb|right|[[Izrael Pozna\u0144ski Palace]]]]\n\nThe city benefits from its central location in Poland.

It was then that \u0141\u00f3d\u017a experienced rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population due to the inflow of migrants, most notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has struggled with many difficulties such as [[Multinational state|multinationalism]] and social inequality, which were vividly documented in the novel ''[[The Promised Land (novel)|The Promised Land]]'' written by Polish [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont]].

Known for his [[surrealism|surrealist]] films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\"{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|pp=109 & 192}} and is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous [[sound design]]. The surreal and, in many cases, violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=245}}\n\nLynch's [[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]] includes short and feature-length films, music videos, documentaries and television episodes, while his involvement in these ranges from direction, production and screenwriting to acting and sound design. Lynch's first project was the 1967 short ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'', an animated film which blended elements of sculpture and painting into its animation.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=19\u201320}} His first feature-length project, 1977's ''[[Eraserhead]]'', became a [[cult film]] and launched his commercial career.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=31}} It also marked his first collaboration with [[Jack Nance]], an actor who would appear in many more of Lynch's productions until his death in 1996.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=129}} Lynch's other feature films include the critically successful ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), all of which went on to earn [[Academy Award]] nominations,<ref name=\"oscar 2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2002 |title=74th Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"oscar 1987\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1987 |title=59th Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"oscar 1980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1981 |title=53rd Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> and the commercial flop ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=51}}\n\nLynch has also branched out into television, and later, internet-based series.

Known for his [[surrealism|surrealist]] films, he has developed his own unique cinematic style which has been dubbed \"Lynchian\"{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|pp=109 & 192}} and is characterized by its dream imagery and meticulous [[sound design]]. The surreal and, in many cases, violent elements to his films have earned them the reputation that they \"disturb, offend or mystify\" their audiences.{{sfn|Rodley|Lynch|2005|p=245}}\n\nLynch's [[wikt:oeuvre|oeuvre]] includes short and feature-length films, music videos, documentaries and television episodes, while his involvement in these ranges from direction, production and screenwriting to acting and sound design. Lynch's first project was the 1967 short ''[[Six Men Getting Sick (Six Times)]]'', an animated film which blended elements of sculpture and painting into its animation.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=19\u201320}} His first feature-length project, 1977's ''[[Eraserhead]]'', became a [[cult film]] and launched his commercial career.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=31}} It also marked his first collaboration with [[Jack Nance]], an actor who would appear in many more of Lynch's productions until his death in 1996.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=129}} Lynch's other feature films include the critically successful ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' (1980), ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' (1986) and ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]'' (2001), all of which went on to earn [[Academy Award]] nominations,<ref name=\"oscar 2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2002 |title=74th Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"oscar 1987\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1987 |title=59th Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"oscar 1980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1981 |title=53rd Academy Awards Winners {{!}} Oscar Legacy |publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=August 13, 2012}}</ref> and the commercial flop ''[[Dune (1984 film)|Dune]]''.{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|p=51}}\n\nLynch has also branched out into television, and later, internet-based series. His first foray into the medium was ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', a joint venture with [[Mark Frost]]. ''Twin Peaks'' became a cult success,{{sfn|Odell|Le Blanc|2007|pp=69\u201374}} leading to Lynch and Frost working together on a number of other projects, including ''[[On the Air (TV series)|On the

{"title_page": "Difference of two squares", "text_new": "{{short description|Mathematical formula}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''difference of two squares''' is a [[Square (algebra)|squared]] (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number. Every difference of squares may be factored according to the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]\n\n:<math>a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>\n\nin [[elementary algebra]].\n\n==Proof==\nThe [[mathematical proof|proof]] of the factorization identity is straightforward. Starting from the [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side]], apply the [[distributive law]] to get \n:<math>(a+b)(a-b) = a^2+ba-ab-b^2</math>\nBy the [[commutative law]], the middle two terms cancel:\n:<math>ba - ab = 0</math>\nleaving\n:<math>(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2</math>\nThe resulting identity is one of the most commonly used in mathematics. Among many uses, it gives a simple proof of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]] in two variables.\n\nThe proof just given indicates the scope of the identity in [[abstract algebra]]: it will hold in any [[commutative ring]] ''R''.\n\nConversely, if this identity holds in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' for all pairs of elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the ring, then ''R'' is commutative.   To see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the original equation and get\n:<math>a^2 + ba - ab - b^2</math>\n\nand for this to be equal to <math>a^2 - b^2</math>, we must have\n\n:<math>ba - ab = 0</math>\n\nfor all pairs ''a'', ''b'' of elements of ''R'', so the ring ''R'' is commutative.\n\n==Geometrical demonstrations==\n[[Image:Difference of two squares.svg|right|170px]]\n\nThe difference of two squares can also be illustrated geometrically as the difference of two square areas in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. In the diagram, the shaded part represents the difference between the areas of the two squares, i.e. <math>a^2 - b^2</math>.  The area of the shaded part can be found by adding the areas of the two rectangles; <math>a(a-b) + b(a-b)</math>, which can be factorized to <math>(a+b)(a-b)</math>.  Therefore, <math>a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>.\n\nAnother geometric proof proceeds as follows: We start with the figure shown in the first diagram below, a large square with a smaller square removed from it. The side of the entire square is a, and the side of the small removed square is b. The area of the shaded region is <math>a^2-b^2</math>. A cut is made, splitting the region into two rectangular pieces, as shown in the second diagram. The larger piece, at the top, has width a and height a-b. The smaller piece, at the bottom, has width a-b and height b. Now the smaller piece can be detached, rotated, and placed to the right of the larger piece. In this new arrangement, shown in the last diagram below, the two pieces together form a rectangle, whose width is <math>a+b</math> and whose height is <math>a-b</math>. This rectangle's area is <math>(a+b)(a-b)</math>. Since this rectangle came from rearranging the original figure, it must have the same area as the original figure. Therefore, <math>a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>.\n[[Image:Difference of two squares geometric proof.png]]\n\n==Uses==\n===Factorization of polynomials and simplification of expressions===\nThe formula for the difference of two squares can be used for factoring [[polynomial]]s that contain the square of a first quantity minus the square of a second quantity. For example, the polynomial <math>x^4 - 1</math> can be factored as follows:\n\n:<math>x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)</math>\n\nAs a second example, the first two terms of <math>x^2 - y^2 + x - y</math> can be factored as <math>(x + y)(x - y)</math>, so we have:\n\n:<math>x^2 - y^2 + x - y = (x + y)(x - y) + x - y = (x - y)(x + y + 1)</math>\n\nMoreover, this formula can also be used for simplifying expressions:\n\n:<math>(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2=(a+b+a-b)(a+b-a+b)=(2a)(2b)=4ab</math>\n\n===Complex number case: sum of two squares===\nThe difference of two squares is used to find the [[linear factors]] of the ''sum'' of two squares, using [[complex number]] coefficients.\n\nFor example, the complex roots of <math>z^2 + 4</math> can be found using difference of two squares:\n\n:<math>z^2 + 4</math>\n:<math> = z^2 - i^2 \\cdot 4</math>    (since <math>i^2 = -1</math>)\n:<math> = z^2 - (2 i)^2</math>\n:<math> = (z + 2 i)(z - 2 i)</math>\n\nTherefore, the linear factors are <math>(z + 2 i)</math> and <math>(z - 2 i)</math>.\n\nSince the two factors found by this method are [[complex conjugate]]s, we can use this in reverse as a method of multiplying a complex number to get a real number. This is used to get real denominators in complex fractions.<ref>[http://www.themathpage.com/alg/complex-numbers.htm#conjugates Complex or imaginary numbers] TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011</ref>\n\n===Rationalising denominators===\nThe difference of two squares can also be used in the [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalising]] of [[irrational number|irrational]] [[denominator]]s.<ref>[http://www.themathpage.com/alg/multiply-radicals.htm Multiplying Radicals] TheMathPage.com, retrieved 22 December 2011</ref> This is a method for removing [[Nth root|surds]] from expressions (or at least moving them), applying to division by some combinations involving [[square root]]s.\n\nFor example:\nThe denominator of <math>\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{3} + 4}</math> can be rationalised as follows:\n\n:<math>\\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{3} + 4}</math>\n\n:<math> = \\dfrac{5}{\\sqrt{3} + 4} \\times \\dfrac{\\sqrt{3} - 4}{\\sqrt{3} - 4}</math>\n\n:<math> = \\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{(\\sqrt{3} + 4)(\\sqrt{3} - 4)}</math>\n\n:<math> = \\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{\\sqrt{3}^2 - 4^2}</math>\n\n:<math> = \\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{3 - 16}</math>\n\n:<math> = -\\dfrac{5(\\sqrt{3} - 4)}{13}.</math>\n\nHere, the irrational denominator <math>\\sqrt{3} + 4</math> has been rationalised to <math>13</math>.\n\n===Mental arithmetic===\n{{Main|Multiplication algorithm#Quarter square multiplication}}\nThe difference of two squares can also be used as an arithmetical short cut.  If two numbers (whose average is a number which is easily squared) are multiplied, the difference of two squares can be used to give you the product of the original two numbers.\n\nFor example: \n:<math> 27 \\times 33 = (30 - 3)(30 + 3)</math>\n\nUsing the difference of two squares, <math>27 \\times 33</math> can be restated as\n \n:<math>a^2 - b^2</math> which is <math>30^2 - 3^2 = 891</math>.\n\n===Difference of two consecutive perfect squares===\n\nThe difference of two consecutive [[square number|perfect square]]s is the sum of the two [[base (exponentiation)|base]]s ''n'' and ''n''+1. This can be seen as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n (n+1)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+1)+n)((n+1)-n) \\\\\n           & = & 2n+1\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. Similarly, the difference of two arbitrary perfect squares is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n (n+k)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+k)+n)((n+k)-n) \\\\\n           & = & k(2n+k)\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the difference of two even perfect squares is a multiple of 4 and the difference of two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8.\n\n===Factorization of integers===\n\nSeveral algorithms in number theory and cryptography use differences of squares to find factors of integers and detect composite numbers. A simple example is the [[Fermat factorization method]], which considers the sequence of numbers <math>x_i:=a_i^2-N</math>, for <math>a_i:=\\left\\lceil \\sqrt{N}\\right\\rceil+i</math>. If one of the <math>x_i</math> equals a perfect square <math>b^2</math>, then <math>N=a_i^2-b^2=(a_i+b)(a_i-b)</math> is a (potentially non-trivial) factorization of <math>N</math>.\n\nThis trick can be generalized as follows. If <math>a^2\\equiv b^2</math> mod <math>N</math> and <math>a\\not\\equiv \\pm b</math> mod <math>N</math>, then <math>N</math> is composite with non-trivial factors <math>\\gcd(a-b,N)</math> and <math>\\gcd(a+b,N)</math>. This forms the basis of several factorization algorithms (such as the [[quadratic sieve]]) and can be combined with the [[Fermat primality test]] to give the stronger [[Miller\u2013Rabin primality test]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n[[Image:Rhombus understood analytically.svg|thumb|right|Vectors {{math|'''a'''}}&nbsp;(purple), {{math|'''b'''}}&nbsp;(cyan) and {{math|'''a''' + '''b'''}}&nbsp;(blue) are shown with [[arrow (symbol)|arrows]]]]\nThe identity also holds in [[inner product space]]s over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[real numbers]], such as for [[dot product]] of [[Euclidean vector]]s:\n:<math>{\\mathbf a}\\cdot{\\mathbf a} - {\\mathbf b}\\cdot{\\mathbf b} = ({\\mathbf a}+{\\mathbf b})\\cdot({\\mathbf a}-{\\mathbf b})</math>\nThe proof is identical.

Every difference of squares may be factored according to the [[identity (mathematics)|identity]]\n\n:<math>a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>\n\nin [[elementary algebra]].\n\n==Proof==\nThe [[mathematical proof|proof]] of the factorization identity is straightforward. Starting from the [[Sides of an equation|left-hand side]], apply the [[distributive law]] to get \n:<math>(a+b)(a-b) = a^2+ba-ab-b^2</math>\nBy the [[commutative law]], the middle two terms cancel:\n:<math>ba - ab = 0</math>\nleaving\n:<math>(a+b)(a-b) = a^2-b^2</math>\nThe resulting identity is one of the most commonly used in mathematics. Among many uses, it gives a simple proof of the [[AM\u2013GM inequality]] in two variables.\n\nThe proof just given indicates the scope of the identity in [[abstract algebra]]: it will hold in any [[commutative ring]] ''R''.\n\nConversely, if this identity holds in a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' for all pairs of elements ''a'' and ''b'' of the ring, then ''R'' is commutative.   To see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the original equation and get\n:<math>a^2 + ba - ab - b^2</math>\n\nand for this to be equal to <math>a^2 - b^2</math>, we must have\n\n:<math>ba - ab = 0</math>\n\nfor all pairs ''a'', ''b'' of elements of ''R'', so the ring ''R'' is commutative.\n\n==Geometrical demonstrations==\n[[Image:Difference of two squares.svg|right|170px]]\n\nThe difference of two squares can also be illustrated geometrically as the difference of two square areas in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. In the diagram, the shaded part represents the difference between the areas of the two squares, i.e. <math>a^2 - b^2</math>.  The area of the shaded part can be found by adding the areas of the two rectangles; <math>a(a-b) + b(a-b)</math>, which can be factorized to <math>(a+b)(a-b)</math>.  Therefore, <math>a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>.\n\nAnother geometric proof proceeds as follows: We start with the figure shown in the first diagram below, a large square with a smaller square removed from it. The side of the entire square is a, and the side of the small removed square is b. The area of the shaded region is <math>a^2-b^2</math>. A cut is made, splitting the region into two rectangular pieces, as shown in the second diagram. The larger piece, at the top, has width a and height a-b. The smaller piece, at the bottom, has width a-b and height b. Now the smaller piece can be detached, rotated, and placed to the right of the larger piece. In this new arrangement, shown in the last diagram below, the two pieces together form a rectangle, whose width is <math>a+b</math> and whose height is <math>a-b</math>. This rectangle's area is <math>(a+b)(a-b)</math>. Since this rectangle came from rearranging the original figure, it must have the same area as the original figure. Therefore, <math>a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)</math>.\n[[Image:Difference of two squares geometric proof.png]]\n\n==Uses==\n===Factorization of polynomials and simplification of expressions===\nThe formula for the difference of two squares can be used for factoring [[polynomial]]s that contain the square of a first quantity minus the square of a second quantity. For example, the polynomial <math>x^4 - 1</math> can be factored as follows:\n\n:<math>x^4 - 1 = (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = (x^2 + 1)(x + 1)(x - 1)</math>\n\nAs a second example, the first two terms of <math>x^2 - y^2 + x - y</math> can be factored as <math>(x + y)(x - y)</math>, so we have:\n\n:<math>x^2 - y^2 + x - y = (x + y)(x - y) + x - y = (x - y)(x + y + 1)</math>\n\nMoreover, this formula can also be used for simplifying expressions:\n\n:<math>(a+b)^2-(a-b)^2=(a+b+a-b)(a+b-a+b)=(2a)(2b)=4ab</math>\n\n===Complex number case: sum of two squares===\nThe difference of two squares is used to find the [[linear factors]] of the ''sum'' of two squares, using [[complex number]] coefficients.\n\nFor example, the complex roots of <math>z^2 + 4</math> can be found using difference of two squares:\n\n:<math>z^2 + 4</math>\n:<math> = z^2 - i^2 \\cdot 4</math>    (since <math>i^2 = -1</math>)\n:<math> = z^2 - (2 i)^2</math>\n:<math> = (z + 2 i)(z - 2 i)</math>\n\nTherefore, the linear factors are <math>(z + 2 i)</math> and <math>(z - 2 i)</math>.\n\nSince the two factors found by this method are [[complex conjugate]]s, we can use this in reverse as a method of multiplying a complex number to get a real number.

This can be seen as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n (n+1)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+1)+n)((n+1)-n) \\\\\n           & = & 2n+1\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. Similarly, the difference of two arbitrary perfect squares is calculated as follows:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{array}{lcl}\n (n+k)^2 - n^2 & = & ((n+k)+n)((n+k)-n) \\\\\n           & = & k(2n+k)\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the difference of two even perfect squares is a multiple of 4 and the difference of two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8.\n\n===Factorization of integers===\n\nSeveral algorithms in number theory and cryptography use differences of squares to find factors of integers and detect composite numbers.
