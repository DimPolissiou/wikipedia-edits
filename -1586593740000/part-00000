In one of his letters to [[Martin K\u00e4mpchen]] he wrote, \u201cThe hospitality I received there goes beyond all praise. It is something I shall never forget and for which I shall be forever grateful.\u201d He plunged into his teaching career, preparing students for the BA examination of the University of Calcutta. He was a voracious reader and tried to understand the Eastern mind. He played the piano and listened to music with [[Satyajit Ray]], then an art student at Visva Bharati. He contributed book reviews and articles for Santiniketan's official journals, ''Visva Bharati Quarterly'' and ''Visva Bharati News''. In time, he emerged as one of the most prolific writers from Santiniketan of that period.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Aronson suddenly became an \u201cenemy alien\u201d for the British colonial rulers in India. He was sent to an internment camp first at [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] and then to [[Ahmednagar]]. With the repeated intervention of Tagore, he was able to return after two months. However, it was a traumatic experience for him.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\nTagore had a vast collection of newspaper clippings that had been collected during his foreign tours. He asked Aronson to put them in order. With many months of dedication and hard work, he classified the newspaper articles and correspondence, and laid the foundations of the archives at Santiniketan. With the wealth of information, he had, Aronson wrote a book ''Rabindranath Through Western Eyes''. It was published in 1943, after Tagore's death. It became an iconic book that has been mentioned and quoted till the present times. Tagore's impact outside India was seen in a totally unromantic, unsentimental and critically sober manner. It obviously did not go down well with the Santiniketan intelligentia. In 1944, he wrote ''The Story of a Conscience'', a book on Tagore's friend, [[Romain Rolland]]. Jointly with [[Krishna Kripalani]] he edited ''Rolland and Tagore'', a collection of letters and essays.  In 2000, Visva Bharati published ''Dear Mr. Tagore'', a collection of letters from well known writers, scholars and public figures in Europe and America. It was a major archival contribution of Aronson. In 1946, he wrote, ''Europe looks at India, a study in Cultural Relations''. This book on Europe's cultural response to India opened Aronson's horizon beyond Tagore.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\n==Israel==\nAronson worked in the University of Dhaka for two years before immigrating to Palestine. He took up different teaching assignments. After establishment of [[Israel]] he joined the English department at [[Tel Aviv University]] and finally settled in [[Haifa]]. He continued writing \u2013 ''Music and the Novel'', two books on Shakespeare, one on twentieth century diaries and three volumes of his autobiography.<ref name=\"fusion\"/><ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\n==Awards==\n[[Visva Bharati University]] conferred on him its highest award, Desikottama (D Litt), in 1993.

In one of his letters to [[Martin K\u00e4mpchen]] he wrote, \u201cThe hospitality I received there goes beyond all praise. It is something I shall never forget and for which I shall be forever grateful.\u201d He plunged into his teaching career, preparing students for the BA examination of the University of Calcutta. He was a voracious reader and tried to understand the Eastern mind. He played the piano and listened to music with [[Satyajit Ray]], then an art student at Visva Bharati. He contributed book reviews and articles for Santiniketan's official journals, ''Visva Bharati Quarterly'' and ''Visva Bharati News''. In time, he emerged as one of the most prolific writers from Santiniketan of that period.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\nWith the outbreak of World War II, Aronson suddenly became an \u201cenemy alien\u201d for the British colonial rulers in India. He was sent to an internment camp first at [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] and then to [[Ahmednagar]]. With the repeated intervention of Tagore, he was able to return after two months. However, it was a traumatic experience for him.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\nTagore had a vast collection of newspaper clippings that had been collected during his foreign tours. He asked Aronson to put them in order. With many months of dedication and hard work, he classified the newspaper articles and correspondence, and laid the foundations of the archives at Santiniketan. With the wealth of information, he had, Aronson wrote a book ''Rabindranath Through Western Eyes''. It was published in 1943, after Tagore's death. It became an iconic book that has been mentioned and quoted till the present times. Tagore's impact outside India was seen in a totally unromantic, unsentimental and critically sober manner. It obviously did not go down well with the Santiniketan intelligentia. In 1944, he wrote ''The Story of a Conscience'', a book on Tagore's friend, [[Romain Rolland]]. Jointly with [[Krishna Kripalani]] he edited ''Rolland and Tagore'', a collection of letters and essays.  In 2000, Visva Bharati published ''Dear Mr. Tagore'', a collection of letters from well known writers, scholars and public figures in Europe and America. It was a major archival contribution of Aronson. In 1946, he wrote, ''Europe looks at India, a study in Cultural Relations''. This book on Europe's cultural response to India opened Aronson's horizon beyond Tagore.<ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\n==Israel==\nAronson worked in the University of Dhaka for two years before immigrating to Palestine. He took up different teaching assignments. After establishment of [[Israel]] he joined the English department at [[Tel Aviv University]] and finally settled in [[Haifa]]. He continued writing \u2013 ''Music and the Novel'', two books on Shakespeare, one on twentieth century diaries and three volumes of his autobiography.<ref name=\"fusion\"/><ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\n==Awards==\n[[Visva Bharati University]] conferred on him its highest award, Desikottama (D Litt), in 1993. At the request of the vice-chancellor, Martin K\u00e4mpchen went and delivered the Insignia of Desikottama at his home on the slopes of Mountain Carmel, overlooking Haifa.<ref name=\"fusion\"/><ref name=\"statesman\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:People associated with Santiniketan]]\n[[Category:English-language writers]]\n[[Category:1912 births]]\n[[Category:1995 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Fayenatic london", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moving fromCategory:English-language writerstoCategory:English-language writers from GermanyusingCat-a-lot", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Aronson_(author)"}

He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of [[Cacophony Society]], to take on central organizing functions. In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 [[Bad Day at Black Rock|film of the same name]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/ |title=What is Burning Man?: Early Years |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMichael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus the seed of Black Rock City was germinated, as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. \n<!-- Remove this sentence because it is a duplicate:\nDrawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night. \n-->\n\nThe three most well-known founders and present partners in ownership of its name and trademark (Law, Michael Mikel, and Larry Harvey)<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24775092/john_law_origins_of_burning_man\n| title = Rogue Burner is Ready to Talk\n| last = Kane\n| first = Jenny\n| date = 2017-08-16\n| newspaper = [[Reno Gazette-Journal]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-23\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nwere known as \"The Temple of the Three Guys\".<ref name=\"Doherty2006\"/>\n\n[[File:John Law Night School Endgames Improv.jpg|left|thumb|John Law, center, guest on Night School, a show at Endgames Improv]]\n\n===Artistic contributions===\nLaw, a neon sculptor and artist, originated the concept and design of installing neon on the Man at Burning Man<ref name=\"Amato1993\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24774465/john_law_neon_in_kensington\n| last = Amato\n| first = Mia\n| title = Gardens in a New Light \n| date = 1993-12-19\n| newspaper =  [[San Francisco Examiner]]\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\n, an act which at once created an invaluable navigation aid and an indelible, omnipresent symbol. At an event which at that time had no streets, street signs, fences, or any other artificially imposed boundaries, and which took place in the virtually featureless deep playa (on which it was very easy to lose one's bearings or misjudge distances and wind up stranded alone in the desert), this navigation aid certainly saved a lot of people a lot of trouble, and may well have saved lives. The early years of the festival allowed driving throughout the city but eventually curbed the practice back to only [[art car]]s. The symbol of the Burning Man, which had been added to the desert event later and was not part of its initial inception, became more and more identified with the event, in part because with the addition of the neon it was always universally visible, becoming the single unchanging reference point psychologically as well as physically.\n\n===Founders' conflict===\nThe last year John Law attended Burning Man was in 1996 when his friend, Michael Furey died in a motorcycle crash\n<ref name=\"Doherty2006\">{{cite book \n| last = Doherty\n| first = Brian \n| title = This Is Burning Man \n| publisher = [[Benbella Books]] \n| date = July 2006 \n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&lpg=PP1&dq=This%20is%20burning%20man&pg=PT65#v=onepage&q=Furey&f=false\n| accessdate = 2018-10-21\n| isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0}}</ref>\nwhile setting up the event and a couple were run over in a tent by an inattentive driver attempting to get to the distant rave camp.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.sfweekly.com/1996-09-11/music/samples/\n| title = Samples\n| last = Stark\n| first = Jeff\n| date = 1996-09-11\n| newspaper = [[SF Weekly]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24774670/burning_man_too_popular_in_1997\n| title = A Hot Issue: Burning Man Festival Getting Too Popular\n| last = Williams\n| first = Joe\n| newspaper = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]\n| date = 1997-08-31\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nAfter Law and Larry Harvey had fierce disagreements about these incidents and other issues, he left in disgust proclaiming that the event should not continue.\n\nIn 2007, the three partners were engaged in a legal struggle over control of the name and symbol of Burning Man.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16569253/ns/us_news-life/t/founders-burning-man-mired-dispute\n| title = Founders of Burning Man mired in dispute\n| agency = Associated Press\n| date = 2007-01-11\n| access-date = 2018-10-26}}</ref>\nLaw's response to this struggle was to take legal action to dissolve the controlling partnership and release the name and symbol into the public domain.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24743495/burning_man_cofounder_files_lawsuit\n| last = Wohlsen\n| first = Marcus\n| title = Burning Man co-founder files lawsuit over name\n| date = 2007-01-11\n| newspaper = [[Reno Gazette-Journal]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-22\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nThe final outcome was settled out of court in 2008<ref>{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd8yCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124\n| title = Music Festivals and the Politics of Participation\n| first = Roxy\n| last = Robinson\n| page = 124\n| publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.\n| year = 2015\n| access-date = 2018-10-25| isbn = 9781409457763\n}}</ref>\nwith Law\u2019s interest being bought out by the current organizers which also ended the \"Temple of the Three Guys\" partnership.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n* \"The Space Between\" (2009, Furnace Press; {{ISBN|978-0977274246}}).

He asked John Law, who also had experience on the dry lake and was a defining founder of [[Cacophony Society]], to take on central organizing functions. In the Cacophony Society's newsletter, it was announced as Zone No. 4, A Bad Day at Black Rock (inspired by the 1955 [[Bad Day at Black Rock|film of the same name]]).\n\nMeanwhile, the beach burn was interrupted by the park police for not having a permit. After striking a deal to raise the Man but not to burn it, event organizers disassembled the effigy and returned it to the vacant lot where it had been built. Shortly thereafter, the legs and torso of the Man were chain-sawed and the pieces removed when the lot was unexpectedly leased as a parking lot. The effigy was reconstructed, led by Dan Miller, Harvey's then-housemate of many years, just in time to take it to Zone Trip No. 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/1986_1996/ |title=What is Burning Man?: Early Years |publisher=Burning Man |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nMichael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, realized that a group unfamiliar with the environment of the dry lake would be helped by knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus the seed of Black Rock City was germinated, as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. \n<!-- Remove this sentence because it is a duplicate:\nDrawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night. \n-->\n\nThe three most well-known founders and present partners in ownership of its name and trademark (Law, Michael Mikel, and Larry Harvey)<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24775092/john_law_origins_of_burning_man\n| title = Rogue Burner is Ready to Talk\n| last = Kane\n| first = Jenny\n| date = 2017-08-16\n| newspaper = [[Reno Gazette-Journal]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-23\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nwere known as \"The Temple of the Three Guys\".<ref name=\"Doherty2006\"/>\n\n[[File:John Law Night School Endgames Improv.jpg|left|thumb|John Law, center, guest on Night School, a show at Endgames Improv]]\n\n===Artistic contributions===\nLaw, a neon sculptor and artist, originated the concept and design of installing neon on the Man at Burning Man<ref name=\"Amato1993\">{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24774465/john_law_neon_in_kensington\n| last = Amato\n| first = Mia\n| title = Gardens in a New Light \n| date = 1993-12-19\n| newspaper =  [[San Francisco Examiner]]\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\n, an act which at once created an invaluable navigation aid and an indelible, omnipresent symbol. At an event which at that time had no streets, street signs, fences, or any other artificially imposed boundaries, and which took place in the virtually featureless deep playa (on which it was very easy to lose one's bearings or misjudge distances and wind up stranded alone in the desert), this navigation aid certainly saved a lot of people a lot of trouble, and may well have saved lives. The early years of the festival allowed driving throughout the city but eventually curbed the practice back to only [[art car]]s. The symbol of the Burning Man, which had been added to the desert event later and was not part of its initial inception, became more and more identified with the event, in part because with the addition of the neon it was always universally visible, becoming the single unchanging reference point psychologically as well as physically.\n\n===Founders' conflict===\nThe last year John Law attended Burning Man was in 1996 when his friend, Michael Furey died in a motorcycle crash\n<ref name=\"Doherty2006\">{{cite book \n| last = Doherty\n| first = Brian \n| title = This Is Burning Man \n| publisher = [[Benbella Books]] \n| date = July 2006 \n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=799JDtofMpEC&lpg=PP1&dq=This%20is%20burning%20man&pg=PT65#v=onepage&q=Furey&f=false\n| accessdate = 2018-10-21\n| isbn = 978-1-932100-86-0}}</ref>\nwhile setting up the event and a couple were run over in a tent by an inattentive driver attempting to get to the distant rave camp.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.sfweekly.com/1996-09-11/music/samples/\n| title = Samples\n| last = Stark\n| first = Jeff\n| date = 1996-09-11\n| newspaper = [[SF Weekly]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24774670/burning_man_too_popular_in_1997\n| title = A Hot Issue: Burning Man Festival Getting Too Popular\n| last = Williams\n| first = Joe\n| newspaper = [[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]\n| date = 1997-08-31\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nAfter Law and Larry Harvey had fierce disagreements about these incidents and other issues, he left in disgust proclaiming that the event should not continue.\n\nIn 2007, the three partners were engaged in a legal struggle over control of the name and symbol of Burning Man.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16569253/ns/us_news-life/t/founders-burning-man-mired-dispute\n| title = Founders of Burning Man mired in dispute\n| agency = Associated Press\n| date = 2007-01-11\n| access-date = 2018-10-26}}</ref>\nLaw's response to this struggle was to take legal action to dissolve the controlling partnership and release the name and symbol into the public domain.<ref>{{cite news\n| url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24743495/burning_man_cofounder_files_lawsuit\n| last = Wohlsen\n| first = Marcus\n| title = Burning Man co-founder files lawsuit over name\n| date = 2007-01-11\n| newspaper = [[Reno Gazette-Journal]]\n| access-date = 2018-10-22\n| via = [[Newspapers.com]]}} {{free access}}</ref>\nThe final outcome was settled out of court in 2008<ref>{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd8yCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA124\n| title = Music Festivals and the Politics of Participation\n| first = Roxy\n| last = Robinson\n| page = 124\n| publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.\n| year = 2015\n| access-date = 2018-10-25| isbn = 9781409457763\n}}</ref>\nwith Law\u2019s interest being bought out by the current organizers which also ended the \"Temple of the Three Guys\" partnership.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications==\n* \"The Space Between\" (2009, Furnace Press; {{ISBN|978-0977274246}}).

There was speculation that the assassinations were carried out either by pro-Turkish perpetrators, given the hostility between Turkey and HTS in Idlib, or by supporters of Johani's ''[who?]'' attempt to turn the organization away from hardline Salafi-jihadi positions.

The page includes a dedication to the [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Saxon Elector]] and a list of voices and instruments.]]\n'''Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733''', [[BWV]]&nbsp;232 I (early version), is a [[Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass]] in [[B&nbsp;minor]], composed in 1733 by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''{{lang|de|Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733}}''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

He wrote more than 200 [[Church cantata (Bach)|cantatas for the liturgy]], most of them in [[Leipzig]] from 1723 to 1726 at the beginning of his tenure as ''[[Thomaskantor]]'', responsible for the music at the major churches. In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733. He had converted to the [[Catholic Church]] in order to ascend to the throne of Poland in 1697. During a period of mourning, no cantata performances were permitted in Leipzig, interrupting Bach's normal work of a weekly cantata performance. Bach was free to compose a Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass for the court of Dresden,<ref name=\"Leipzig\" /><ref name=\"Leisinger\" /> where the successor was the later [[Augustus III of Poland]]. Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza Credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

It is an extended [[missa brevis]] ({{lang de|Kurzmesse}}, {{literal translation|short [[Mass (music)|Mass]]}}) consisting of a [[Kyrie]] in three [[movement (music)|movement]]s and a [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] in nine movements. Bach started to compose it, partly based on earlier work, after the death of his sovereign [[Augustus the Strong]] (1&nbsp;February 1733), dedicating it to the latter's son and successor, [[Frederick August II]], in a letter dated 27&nbsp;July 1733. At the time, Bach was in his tenth year as [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church musician in [[Leipzig]], while the [[Catholic]] court of the sovereign [[Electors of Saxony#Saxony-Poland|Elector of Saxony]] was located in [[Dresden]]. Bach sent performance parts of his {{lang|la|Missa}} to Dresden while he kept the [[autograph score]] in Leipzig. Upon arrival in Dresden, the Mass was not added to the repertoire of the Catholic [[court chapel]], but instead the parts, and Bach's dedication letter, were archived in the sovereign's library.\n\nThe composition, also known as Bach's '''Mass for the Dresden court''', is an unusually extended work scored for five-part [[SATB|SSATB]] soloists and choir with an orchestra having a broad [[Wind instrument|winds section]]. After reusing some of its music in a cantata he composed around 1745 ([[BWV 191]]), Bach finally [[Mass in B minor structure|incorporated the 1733 ''Missa'' as the first of four parts]] of his [[Mass in B&nbsp;minor]], composed/assembled in the last years of his life, around 1748\u20131749. It seems unlikely that the 1733 Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass, either in its original form or as part of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor, was ever performed during Bach's lifetime.\n\nThe Kyrie\u2013Gloria Mass was not assigned a separate number in the [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis|BWV catalogue]], but in order to distinguish it from the later complete mass ({{nowrap|[[BWV 232]]}}), numbers like '''{{nowrap|BWV 232a}}''' and {{nowrap|'''BWV 232<sup>I</sup>'''}} are in use.<ref name=\"Laurson\" />{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In 2005 [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the Mass in the [[New Bach Edition]] series as '''Missa, {{nowrap|BWV 232 I,}} Fassung von 1733''' (i.e. 1733 version of [[Missa, BWV&nbsp;232&nbsp;I]]), in a volume of early versions of the Mass in B&nbsp;minor.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> That volume also contained early versions of the Credo (BWV 232 II) and Sanctus (BWV 232 III) of the later Mass.<ref name=\"B\u00e4renreiter\" /> Bach's Mass for the Dresden court is also referred to as '''''{{nowrap|Missa 1733}}'''''<ref name=\"Grob\" /> and \"The {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733\".<ref name=\"Butt\" /> The [[Bach Digital]] website refers to the work as \"BWV 232/I (Fr\u00fchfassung)\", i.e. early version of [[Mass in B minor#I.

In Leipzig, a university city where Latin was understood, musical settings of the traditional Latin texts were performed on festive holidays. Bach composed [[Bach's church music in Latin|works on Latin texts]], for example a [[Magnificat in E-flat major, BWV 243a|Magnificat]] in 1723, performed both on the Marian feast [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and Christmas that year, and in 1724 a [[Sanctus]] for Christmas, which he later integrated into his [[Mass in B minor structure#Sanctus|Mass in B minor]].<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref name=\"Steinitz\" /> Both works were exceptional settings: the Magnificat extended to five vocal parts and the Sanctus to six voices, when four-part singing was common in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Rathey\" />\n\n=== Bach's intentions with the composition ===\n[[Augustus the Strong]], [[List of Polish monarchs#Elective Kings of Poland (Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth)|King of Poland]] and [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]], died on 1 February 1733.

Bach presented the parts of the works to him with a note dated 27 July 1733, in the hope of obtaining the title \"Saxon Electoral Court Composer\":\n{{quote|In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.<ref name=\"Talbeck\" />}}\nA different translation of this polite understatement{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} is \"an insignificant product of the skill I have attained in music.\"<ref name=\"WDL\" /> In the note, Bach also complained that he had \"innocently suffered one injury or another\" in [[Leipzig]].<ref>An English translation of the letter is given in Hans T.

At least the panache with which Bach showed off as a versatile composer, only six years after openly choosing the Lutheran side at the death of the new elector's mother, must be admired.\n\nFor the music, Bach borrowed extensively from his previous cantata compositions.{{sfn|Wolff|2013|p=11}} Bach may have had the capabilities of the singers and instrumentalists of the Dresden [[court chapel]] (which served the Hofkirche) in mind when composing the piece: at the time these included [[Johann Georg Pisendel]] (violinist and [[concert master]]), Johann Christian Richter (oboist), and the flautists [[Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin]] and Johann Joachim Quantz.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|pp=46-47}} These performers, versed in the French as well as Italian performance styles, were the best of what could be found anywhere in Europe.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> The new elector's taste for the operatic genre was no secret either.<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" /> For church music the [[Neapolitan mass]] came closest to that genre, and this was the preferred Mass type at the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} Bach was no doubt aware that apart from the excellent instrumentalists, the Dresden Hofkapelle (\"court chapel\") also had vocal soloists at its disposal (such as [[Faustina Bordoni]], the wife of [[Johann Adolph Hasse]]) who could excel in the type of arias that was customary in operas and Neapolitan masses.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}<ref name=\"Zelenka-Hasse\" />\n\nThe score Bach sent to Dresden consisted of the separate parts for [[Soprano]] I, Soprano II, [[Alto]], [[Tenor]], [[Bass (voice type)|Bass]], [[Trumpet]] I, Trumpet II, Trumpet III, [[Timpani]], [[Corno da caccia|Corno da Caccia]], [[Flauto traverso]] I, Flauto traverso II, [[Oboe]] ([[Oboe d'amore|d'amore]]) I, Oboe (d'amore) II, Oboe (d'amore) III, [[Violin]]s I (2 copies), Violins II, [[Viola]], [[Cello]], [[Bassoon]] and [[Basso continuo]]. Most of these copies were written by Bach himself, but for the last movements of both Kyrie and Gloria his sons [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] (soprano parts), [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] (violino I parts), and his wife [[Anna Magdalena Bach|Anna Magdalena]] (cello parts) helped, along with an anonymous copyist (oboe and basso continuo parts).<ref>[http://www.bach-digital.de/receive/BachDigitalSource_source_00002721 D-Dl Mus.2405-D-21] at Dresden, S\u00e4chsische Landesbibliothek \u2013 Staats- und Universit\u00e4tsbibliothek (University library), available online at {{url|bach-digital.de}}</ref> Performance material for the choir was not included, nor was the basso continuo part very elaborated.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=53}} All these parts appear to have been copied directly from the full score, which Bach kept in Leipzig.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> Bach supplied the parts for single performers with many details that are not in the score he kept.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n[[File:Dresden Inneres der Hofkapelle 1719.jpg|thumb|500px|Interior of the Hofkirche (Hofkapelle){{efn|Court chapel: in this instance referring to the church building; other instances of Hofkapelle/court chapel in this article generally refer to [[chapel (music)|chapel as an ensemble of musicians]], directed by a [[chapel master]] (Kapellmeister).}} in 1719<ref>Hubert Ermisch.

Dresden: Baensch, 1888.</ref>]]\nAlthough some commentators suggest other liturgical and worldly venues where Bach may have anticipated a performance of the {{lang|la|Missa}},{{sfn|Stockigt|2013|p=41}} there seems little doubt that Bach intended to tailor the piece so that it could be performed at the Dresden Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\n=== Reception at the Dresden court ===\nWhen the composition arrived in Dresden its format wasn't very unusual compared to other works performed at the time at the Hofkirche. The repertoire performed there included over thirty masses consisting of only a Kyrie and Gloria. Many of these were composed or acquired by the court composer at the time [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]]; and in most cases, as also happened with Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}}, these were later expanded into a complete mass ([[missa tota]]), or at least a Mass with all the usual Mass sections except the Credo ([[missa senza Credo]]). Nor the fact that Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} was composed for virtuoso performers, nor that it was a composition requiring a [[SATB|SSATB]] choir could be considered exceptional at the time and place.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nThe [[key signature]] of the mass was somewhat exceptional: the Hofkirche 1765 catalogue<ref>Janice B. Stockigt. \"\u201cCATALOGO (THEMATICO) [SIC] DELLA MUSICA DI CHIESA (CATHOLICA [SIC] IN DRESDA) COMPOSTA DA DIVERSI AUTORI \u2013 SECONDO L\u2019ALFABETTO '''1765'''\u201d: AN INTRODUCTION\"</ref> contains only one Missa in B minor, by [[Antonio Caldara]]. [[D major]], the relative major key of B minor (i.e. with the same accidentals), was the most usual key for festive music including trumpets, because of the Saxon [[natural trumpet]]: all of Zelenka's solemn masses were in that key, but also 6 of the 12 movements of Bach's {{lang|la|Missa}} (including the Christe eleison and the opening and closing movements of the Gloria) have that same key signature. The most exceptional feature of Bach's mass appears to have been its duration, which largely exceeded what was usual compared to similar compositions at the time in Dresden. This seems the most likely reason why the composition was filed in the Royal Library upon arrival in Dresden, instead of being added to the repertoire of the Hofkirche.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}}\n\nAs for the result of his petition to the new ruler in Dresden: some three years after his request Bach received the title of Royal Court Composer.{{sfn|Stockigt|2013}} In the intermediate period the Elector had other business to attend to: the [[War of the Polish Succession#Poland|War of the Polish Succession]].\n\n=== Performance history before being integrated in the Mass in B minor, BWV 232 ===\n[[File:Dresden Sophienkirche Lithographie.jpg|thumb|[[Sophienkirche, Dresden]], possibly the location of a first performance]]\nIt is debated if the {{lang|la|Missa}} was performed at the time.<ref name=\"Butt\" /> If it was performed, the most likely venue was the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where Bach's son [[Wilhelm Friedemann Bach|Wilhelm Friedemann]] had been organist since June.<ref name=\"Butt\" /><ref>The details added in this section are from Christoph Wolff \"Bach\", III, 7 (\u00a7&nbsp;8), ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Music Online]]'' ed., L.

Bach made changes{{vague|date=November 2014}} to that score when he completed the mass.<ref name=\"Leisinger Interview\" />\n\nThe work is scored for five vocal parts, two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], and an [[Baroque instruments|orchestra]] of three trumpets, timpani, corno da caccia, two flauti traversi, two oboes, two oboes d'amore, two bassoons, two violins, viola, and basso continuo.\n\nThe [[Mass in B minor structure#Parts and movements|Kyrie]] is structured in three movements. Two different choral movements frame a duet for two sopranos. The [[Mass in B minor structure#Gloria|Gloria]] is structured in nine movements in a symmetric arrangement around a duet of soprano and tenor.\n\nThe {{lang|la|Missa}} of 1733 forms a considerable part of the Mass in B minor which publisher [[Hans Georg N\u00e4geli]] described in 1818 as \"the greatest musical art work of all times and nations\" when he tried a first publication.<ref name=\"WDL\" />\n\n== Publication ==\n\nIn 2005, [[B\u00e4renreiter]] published the work, titled \"Missa, BWV 232 I, Fassung von 1733\", as part of the [[Neue Bach Ausgabe]].

A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days. The work of laying out the city of Washington, with its streets and major buildings, was completed and stands today as a monument to Banneker's genius.}}\n*{{cite book |year=1970|first=Claude |last=Lewis |url=https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi|url-access=registration|title=Chapter 9: Planning the Nation's Capital|work=Benjamin Banneker: The Man Who Saved Washington |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=[https://archive.org/details/benjaminbanneker00lewi/page/79 79]\u201395|oclc=72113 |lccn=79092101 |accessdate=2019-09-19|quote=He probably does, Mr. Secretary.

Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.]<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

He appointed Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant who had served in the Continental Army in the Corps of Engineers, to be in charge of building the new city. Major Andrew Ellicott, one of the Ellicott boys, was named Chief Surveyor. At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers.

His work displays a nostalgia for [[Folklore of the United States|American folk culture]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.\n\nCrumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the [[underground comix]] movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, ''[[Zap Comix]]'', contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the ''[[East Village Other]]'' and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] icons [[Fritz the Cat]] and [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], and the images from his ''[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]'' strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into [[scatology|scatological]] and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'' anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily [[Hatching|crosshatched]] pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'' (1981\u20131993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the [[alternative comics]] era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.\n\nIn 1991, Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry's [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. He is married to cartoonist [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]], with whom he has frequently collaborated. Their daughter [[Sophie Crumb]] has also followed a cartooning career.\n\n==Early life (1943\u20131966)==\n\nRobert Crumb was born 30 August 1943 in [[Philadelphia]] to a [[Catholic]] household{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, spending his early years in [[West Philadelphia]] and [[Upper Darby]].<ref>https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/01/13/how-quirky-was-berkeley-r-crumb-the-underground-comix-artist-was-here</ref><ref>Crumb, Robert ''Crumb Family Comics''.

Crumb, authored the book ''Training People Effectively'',{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} and was a combat illustrator for twenty years in the [[United States Marine Corps]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} His mother Beatrice was a housewife who reportedly [[Substance abuse|abused]] diet pills and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]]. Charles and Beatrice's marriage was unhappy and the children were frequent witnesses to their parents' arguments.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Crumb, Maxon |title=Crumb Family Comics|date=1998|publisher=Last Gasp|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=0867194278|pages=105, 129}}</ref><ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-odyssey-of-r-crumb-1432742178</ref>  The couple had four other children: sons [[Charles Crumb|Charles]] Junior (1942\u201392) and [[Maxon Crumb|Maxon]] (b.&nbsp;1944), both of whom suffered from mental illness, and daughters Carol (b.&nbsp;1940) and Sandra (1946-1998).{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1a2=Smith|1y=2013|1p=158|2a1=Goldstein|2y=2013|2p=517}}<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Still-in-the-shadows-an-artist-in-his-own-right-2487551.php#page-3</ref> The family moved to [[Milford, Delaware]], when Crumb was twelve and where he was an average student whose teachers discouraged from cartooning.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=29}}\n\nInspired by [[Walt Kelly]], [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer Brothers]] animation and others, Crumb and his brothers drew their own comics.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} His cartooning developed as his older brother Charles pushed him and provided feedback. In 1958 the brothers self-published three issues of ''Foo'' in imitation of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s satirical ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' which they sold door-to-door with little success, souring the young Crumb on the comic-book business.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|pp=29\u201330}} At fifteen, Crumb collected classical jazz and blues records from the 1920s to the 1940s.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} At age 16 he lost his Catholic faith.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work (1962\u20131966)===\n\nCrumb's father gave him $40 when he left home after high school.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}  His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for [[American Greetings]]{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}} in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=30}}  In Cleveland he met a group of young [[bohemians]] such as [[Buzzy Linhart]], Liz Johnston, and [[Harvey Pekar]]. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work.  In 1965, cartoonist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''.  Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but ''Help!'' ceased publication shortly after.  Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for [[Topps]] before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}}\n\nCrumb married Dana Morgan in 1964.  Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food.{{sfn|Burgess|2000}}  The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b.&nbsp;1965).{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=518}}\n[[File:Fritz the Cat front cover.jpg|thumb|Front cover of ''Fritz the Cat''.]]\nIn 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of [[Fritz the Cat]] strips published in the men's magazine ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''.  Fritz had appeared in Crumb's work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=30}}\n\nCrumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], a [[psychedelic drug]] that was then still legal.  He had both good and [[bad trip]]s.  One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966.{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=46\u201347}}  Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], [[Angelfood McSpade]], and the [[Snoid]].{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=47}}\n\n===''Zap'' and {{not a typo|underground comix}} (1967\u20131979)===\n\nIn January 1967 Crumb came across two friends in a bar who were about to leave for San Francisco; Crumb was interested in the work of San Francisco-based psychedelic poster artists, and on a whim asked if he could join them.{{sfn|Holm|2005|p=47}}  There, he contributed upbeat LSD-inspired countercultural work to [[Underground press|underground newspapers]].  The work was popular, and Crumb was flooded with requests, including to illustrate a full issue of [[Philadelphia]]'s ''[[Yarrowstalks]]''.{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=47\u201348}}\n\nIndependent publisher [[Don Donahue]] invited Crumb to make a comic book; Crumb drew up two issues of ''[[Zap Comix]]'', and Donahue published the first{{sfn|Holm|2005|pp=47\u201348}} in February 1968 under the publisher name [[Apex Novelties]].  Crumb had difficulty at first finding retailers who would stock it, and at first his wife took to selling the first run herself out of a baby carriage.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}}\n\nCrumb met cartoonist [[S. Clay Wilson]], an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque.  Wilson's attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open, uncensored self-expression; in particular, his work soon became sexually explicit, as in the pornographic ''Snatch'' he and Wilson produced late in 1968.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}}\n\nThe second issue of ''Zap'' appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists [[Victor Moscoso]] and [[Rick Griffin]].  In December, Donahue published the still-unreleased issue as {{No.}}0 and a new third issue with [[Gilbert Shelton]] joining the roster of regulars.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}} ''Zap'' was financially successful, and developed a market for underground comix.\n\nCrumb was a prolific cartoonist in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at his peak point of output he produced 320 pages over two years.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}  He produced much of his best-known work then,{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=160}} including his ''[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]'' strip, and strips featuring characters such as the bohemian [[Fritz the Cat]], spiritual guru [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], and oversexed African-American stereotype [[Angelfood McSpade]].<ref>Dowd, Douglas B.; Hignite, Todd (2006).

His earlier work shows this more restrained style. In Crumb's own words, it was a lengthy drug trip on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] that \"left him fuzzy for two months\" and led to him adopting the surrealistic, [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] style for which he has become known.\n[[File:Robert Crumb 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Crumb in 2010]]\n\nCrumb has been acclaimed for his attention to detail and satirical edge, but has also generated a significant amount of controversy for his graphic and very disturbing portrayals of sexuality and psychology. There exists a feminist backlash against his comics because they became more \"violently misogynistic, as he graphically poured what were essentially his masturbatory fantasies onto the printed page.  Women were raped, dismembered, mutilated, and murdered, sometimes all at once.\"<ref>\"[http://www.popmatters.com/feature/no-girls-allowed-crumb-and-the-comix-counterculture/ No Girls Allowed - Crumb and the Comix Counterculture]\", ''PopMatters''</ref>\n\nA peer in the underground comics field, [[Victor Moscoso]], commented about his first impression of Crumb's work, in the mid-1960s, before meeting Crumb in person: \"I couldn't tell if it was an old man drawing young, or a young man drawing old.\"<ref>[http://www.tcj.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=267&Itemid=48 ''The Comics Journal'' #246]</ref> Robert Crumb's cartooning style has drawn on the work of cartoon artists from earlier generations, including [[Billy DeBeck]] ([[Barney Google and Snuffy Smith|Barney Google]]), [[C.

(Many other underground comix published in the late 1960s-early 1970s feature similar depictions.) Crumb often utilized African American characters as \"tokens,\" appearing as re-used tropes such as clowns, tribesmen, athletes, etc. Researcher Edward Shannon interpreted the themes of Crumb's story containing marginalized Africans in \"When the Niggers Take Over America\" (published in 1993 in ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'') like this: \"Crumb ... explores both the American Dream and its nightmare reflection; in this ... strip ''all-American'' white middle class children are depicted as cannibals eager to devour the devalued and dehumanized ''other.''\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shannon|first=Edward|date=2010|title=Something Black in the American Psyche: Formal Innovation and Freudian Imagery in the Comics of Winsor McCay and Robert Crumb|url=|journal=Canadian Review of American Studies|volume=40|pages=203|via=Project MUSE}}</ref> Crumb has responded to criticism by claiming that he did not invent racist caricatures like Angelfood, but that they were part of the American culture in which he was raised.<ref name='ch1995'>Holm, 2004.</ref><ref name='hux2001'>Huxley 2001.</ref> He sees the character as a criticism of the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the [[hippie]]/intellectual audiences who read his work in the late 1960s were not racists and would understand his intentions.<ref name='ch1995'/><ref name='lo2009'>Lopes, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Bibliography (selection)==\n\n=== Comics ===\n*''[[Zap Comix]]'' issues from 1 and 0 (1968) through at least 9 (1978) and several more ([[Apex Novelties]], [[Print Mint]], [[Last Gasp]] and other transient brand names, generally under Crumb's control, 1968\u20132016) \u2014 #0 and #1 are all drawn by Crumb, the rest have stories by others also\n*''Snatch Comics'' issues 1\u20133 (Apex Novelties/Print Mint, late 1968\u2013Aug. 1969) \u2014 #1 by Crumb and [[S.

His work displays a nostalgia for [[Folklore of the United States|American folk culture]] of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.\n\nCrumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the [[underground comix]] movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, ''[[Zap Comix]]'', contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the ''[[East Village Other]]'' and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including [[Counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural]] icons [[Fritz the Cat]] and [[Mr. Natural (comics)|Mr. Natural]], and the images from his ''[[Keep on Truckin' (comics)|Keep on Truckin']]'' strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into [[scatology|scatological]] and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the ''[[Arcade (comics magazine)|Arcade]]'' anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily [[Hatching|crosshatched]] pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, ''[[Weirdo (comics)|Weirdo]]'' (1981\u20131993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the [[alternative comics]] era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.\n\nIn 1991, Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry's [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]]. He is married to cartoonist [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]], with whom he has frequently collaborated. Their daughter [[Sophie Crumb]] has also followed a cartooning career.\n\n==Early life (1943\u20131966)==\n\nRobert Crumb was born 30 August 1943 in [[Philadelphia]] to a [[Catholic]] household{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} of English and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent, spending his early years in [[West Philadelphia]] and [[Upper Darby]].<ref>https://www.berkeleyside.com/2020/01/13/how-quirky-was-berkeley-r-crumb-the-underground-comix-artist-was-here</ref><ref>Crumb, Robert ''Crumb Family Comics''.

Crumb, authored the book ''Training People Effectively'',{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} and was a combat illustrator for twenty years in the [[United States Marine Corps]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} His mother Beatrice was a housewife who reportedly [[Substance abuse|abused]] diet pills and [[Substituted amphetamine|amphetamines]]. Charles and Beatrice's marriage was unhappy and the children were frequent witnesses to their parents' arguments.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Crumb, Maxon |title=Crumb Family Comics|date=1998|publisher=Last Gasp|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=0867194278|pages=105, 129}}</ref><ref>https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-odyssey-of-r-crumb-1432742178</ref>  The couple had four other children: sons [[Charles Crumb|Charles]] Junior (1942\u201392) and [[Maxon Crumb|Maxon]] (b.&nbsp;1944), both of whom suffered from mental illness, and daughters Carol (b.&nbsp;1940) and Sandra (1946-1998).{{sfnm|1a1=Duncan|1a2=Smith|1y=2013|1p=158|2a1=Goldstein|2y=2013|2p=517}}<ref>http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Still-in-the-shadows-an-artist-in-his-own-right-2487551.php#page-3</ref> The family moved to [[Milford, Delaware]], when Crumb was twelve and where he was an average student whose teachers discouraged from cartooning.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=29}}\n\nInspired by [[Walt Kelly]], [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer Brothers]] animation and others, Crumb and his brothers drew their own comics.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} His cartooning developed as his older brother Charles pushed him and provided feedback. In 1958 the brothers self-published three issues of ''Foo'' in imitation of [[Harvey Kurtzman]]'s satirical ''[[Humbug (magazine)|Humbug]]'' and ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' which they sold door-to-door with little success, souring the young Crumb on the comic-book business.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|pp=29\u201330}} At fifteen, Crumb collected classical jazz and blues records from the 1920s to the 1940s.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=158}} At age 16 he lost his Catholic faith.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early work (1962\u20131966)===\n\nCrumb's father gave him $40 when he left home after high school.{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=517}}  His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for [[American Greetings]]{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}} in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].  He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company's Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career.{{sfn|Maremaa|2004|p=30}}  In Cleveland he met a group of young [[bohemians]] such as [[Buzzy Linhart]], Liz Johnston, and [[Harvey Pekar]]. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work.  In 1965, cartoonist [[Harvey Kurtzman]] printed some of Crumb's work in the humor magazine he edited, ''[[Help! (magazine)|Help!]]''.  Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but ''Help!'' ceased publication shortly after.  Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for [[Topps]] before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.{{sfn|Duncan|Smith|2013|p=159}}\n\nCrumb married Dana Morgan in 1964.  Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food.{{sfn|Burgess|2000}}  The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son Jesse (b.&nbsp;1965).{{sfn|Goldstein|2013|p=518}}\n[[File:Fritz the Cat front cover.jpg|thumb|Front cover of ''Fritz the Cat''.]]\nIn 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of [[Fritz the Cat]] strips published in the men's magazine ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''.

Clay Wilson]], an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque.  Wilson's attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open, uncensored self-expression; in particular, his work soon became sexually explicit, as in the pornographic ''Snatch'' he and Wilson produced late in 1968.{{sfn|Harvey|1996|p=195}}\n\nThe second issue of ''Zap'' appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists [[Victor Moscoso]] and [[Rick Griffin]].

Therefore, they are phonetically [[diphthong]]s.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gussmann|2007|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Biedrzycki|1963}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Biedrzycki|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wierzchowska|1971|p=135}}.</ref> (For nasality following other vowel nuclei, see [[#Allophony|\u00a7&nbsp;Allophony]] below.) {{IPA|/\u025b \u0268 \u0254 \u025b\u0303 \u0254\u0303/}} are also less commonly transcribed {{IPA|/e \u026a o \u1ebd \u00f5/}} respectively, such as by the PWN-Oxford Polish-English Dictionary.{{sfnp|Linde-Usiekniewicz et al.|2011|p=1430}}\n\n===Distribution===\nThe vowels {{IPA|/\u0268/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} have largely [[complementary distribution]]. Either vowel may follow a [[labial consonant|labial]] consonant, as in ''mi'' ('to me') and ''my'' ('we'). Elsewhere, however, {{IPA|/i/}} is usually restricted to word-initial position and positions after [[palatal consonant]]s and the palatalized [[velar consonant|velar]]s, while {{IPA|/\u0268/}} cannot appear in those positions (see [[#Hard and soft consonants|\u00a7&nbsp;Hard and soft consonants]] below). In some phonological descriptions of Polish that make a phonemic distinction between palatized and unpalatized labials, {{IPA|[\u0268]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} may thus be treated as [[allophone]]s of a single [[phoneme]]. However {{IPA|/i/}} appears outside its usual positions in some foreign-derived words, as in ''czipsy'' ('[[potato chip]]s') and ''tir'' ('large lorry', see [[TIR Treaty|TIR]]). In the past, {{IPA|/\u0268/}} was closer to {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, which is acoustically more similar to {{IPA|[i]}}.\n\nNasal vowels do not occur except before a [[fricative]] and in word-final position. When the letters ''\u0105'' and ''\u0119'' appear before [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate]]s, they indicate an oral {{IPAslink|\u0254}} or {{IPAslink|\u025b}} followed by a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] [[homorganic]] with the following consonant. For example, ''k\u0105t'' is {{IPA|[k\u0254nt]}} ('angle'), ''g\u0119ba'' ('mouth') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u025bmba]}}, and ''pi\u0119\u0107'' ('five') is {{IPA|[pj\u025b\u0272t\u0361\u0255]}},{{sfnp|Gussmann|2007|pp=2\u20133}} as if they were spelled ''*kont'', ''*gemba'', and ''*pie\u0144\u0107''. Before {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, nasality is lost altogether and the vowels are pronounced as oral {{IPAblink|\u0254}} or {{IPAblink|\u025b}}. It is also very common to denasalize {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} to {{IPAblink|\u025b}} in word-final position, as in {{wikt-lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119}} {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025bn.d\u025b/}} \"I will be\".\n\nAn alternative analysis postulates that nasal vowels no longer exist in Standard Polish as independent phonemes because they are realized as actual nasal consonants before stops and affricates, and their nasal-diphthong realization before fricatives can be analyzed as allophonical realization of the sequences {{IPA|/on/}}, {{IPA|/om/}} or {{IPA|/o\u0272/}} likewise. Moreover, studies indicate that the nasalization of the presumed nasal diphthongs ''\u0105'' {{IPA|[\u0254w\u0303]}} and ''\u0119'' {{IPA|[\u025bw\u0303]}} is no longer distinctive to native speakers in word-final position either and is retained only in emphatic, hypercorrect or artificial speech.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zag\u00f3rska Brooks|1968}}</ref>\n\n===Historical development===\nDistinctive [[vowel length]] was inherited from late [[Proto-Slavic]], with some changes (for example, stressed acute and circumflex vowels, and some long vowels occurring after the stress, were shortened). Additional vowel lengths were introduced in Proto-Polish (as in other [[West Slavic languages]]) as a result of [[compensatory lengthening]] when a [[yer]] in the next syllable disappeared. If a yer (or other vowel) disappeared, the preceding vowel became long (unless it was also a yer, in which case it became a short ''e'').\n\nThis system of vowel lengths is well preserved in [[Czech language|Czech]] and to a lesser degree in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. In the emerging modern Polish, however, the long vowels were shortened again but sometimes (depending on dialect) with a change in quality (the vowels tended to become [[high vowel|higher]]). The latter changes came to be incorporated into the standard language only in the case of long ''o'' and the long nasal vowel, mostly for vowels located before [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s. The [[vowel shift]] may thus be presented as follows:\n* long oral {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/a/}} (certain dialects: {{IPA|/\u0252/}})\n* long oral {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/\u025b/}} (certain dialects: {{IPA|/\u0268/}} or {{IPA|/i/}})\n* long oral {{IPA|/\u0268\u02d0/}} or {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/\u0268/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}\n* long oral {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/u/}}, written ''\u00f3''\n* long oral {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/u/}}, written ''u''\n* long nasal {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0/}} \u2192 short nasal {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}, written ''\u0105''\n\nNote that the {{IPA|/u/}} that was once a long {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} is still distinguished in script as ''\u00f3''. Former long {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} was written ''\u00e9'' until the 19th century (''\u00e1'' for long {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} was already in disuse).\n\nIn most circumstances, consonants were [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] when followed by an original front vowel, including the [[soft sign|soft yer]] (\u044c) that was often later lost. For example: ''*d\u044cn\u044c'' became ''dzie\u0144'' ('day'), while ''*d\u044cn\u044cm\u044a'' became ''dniem'' ('day' [[instrumental case|instr.]]).\n\nNasal vowels ''*\u0119'' and ''*\u01eb'' of late Proto-Slavic merged (''*\u0119'' leaving a trace by palatalizing the preceding consonant) to become the medieval Polish vowel {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, written ''\u00f8''. Like other Polish vowels, it developed long and short variants. The short variant developed into present-day {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} ''\u0119'', while the long form became {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}, written ''\u0105'', as described above. Overall:\n* Proto-Slavic ''*\u0119'' \u2192 ''i\u0119'' when short, ''i\u0105'' when long (where the ''i'' represents palatalization of the preceding consonant)\n* Proto-Slavic ''*\u01eb'' \u2192 ''\u0119'' when short, ''\u0105'' when long\n\nThe historical shifts are the reason for the [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]s ''o'':''\u00f3'' and ''\u0119'':''\u0105'' commonly encountered in Polish morphology: ''*rog\u044a'' ('horn') became ''r\u00f3g'' due to the loss of the following [[yer]] (originally pronounced with a long ''o'', now with /u/), and the instrumental case of the same word went from ''*rog\u044am\u044a'' to ''rogiem'' (with no lengthening of the ''o''). Similarly, ''*d\u01ebb\u044a'' ('oak') became ''d\u0105b'' (originally with the long form of the nasal vowel), and in the instrumental case, ''*d\u01ebb\u044am\u044a'' the vowel remained short, causing the modern ''d\u0119bem''.\n\n===Dialectal variation===\n[[Polish dialects]] differ particularly in their realization of nasal vowels, both in terms of whether and when they are decomposed to an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant and in terms of the quality of the vowels used.\n\nAlso, some dialects preserve nonstandard developments of historical long vowels (see previous section); for example, ''a'' may be pronounced with {{IPA|[\u0254]}} in words in which it was historically long.\n\n== Consonants ==\nThe Polish [[consonant]] system is more complicated; its characteristic features include the series of [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants that resulted from four Proto-Slavic [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Polish are as follows:{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=130\u2013181}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Dental consonant|Dental]],<br/>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n! {{small|plain}}\n! {{small|[[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}}\n| {{IPA link|n\u032a|n}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0272}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Plosive]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|p}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a|t}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|k}}\n| {{IPAlink|k\u031f|k\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|b}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a|d}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0261}}\n| {{IPAlink|\u0261\u02d6|\u0261\u02b2}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a\u0361s\u032a|t\u0361s}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0282}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0255}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a\u0361z\u032a|d\u0361z}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0290}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|f}}\n| {{IPA link|s\u032a|s}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0282}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0255}}\n| {{IPA link|x}}\n| {{IPA link|x\u031f|x\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|v}}\n| {{IPA link|z\u032a|z}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0290}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Tap and flap consonants|Tap]]/[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n| {{IPA link|r}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n| {{IPA link|l}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|j}}\n| {{IPA link|w}}\n|\n|}\n\nAlveolar {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|n}} {{IPAplink|t}} {{IPAplink|d}}]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/n t d/}} before {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0282 d\u0361\u0290/}}.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=136, 179}} Denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|l\u032a}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} before dental consonants. {{IPA|/r/}} has been traditionally classified as a trill, with a tap {{IPAblink|\u027e}} supposedly only occurring as an allophone or in fast speech {{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|p=132}} however, more recent studies show that /r/ is predominantly realized as a tap, sometimes as an approximant or a fricative, but almost never as a trill.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Szpyra-Koz\u0142owska|first=Jolanta|date=2018|title=The rhotic in fake and authentic Polish-accented English|url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-doi-10_17951_lsmll_2018_42_1_81|journal=Lublin Studies in Modern Languages and Literature|language=EN|volume=42|issue=1|pages=81|doi=10.17951/lsmll.2018.42.1.81|issn=2450-4580|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270267157|title=On the phonetic instability of the Polish rhotic /r/ {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref> One study found that in an intervocalic context a trilled [r] occurs in less than 3% of cases, while a tapped [\u027e] occurred in approximately 95% of cases.

Unlike languages such as [[Czech language|Czech]], Polish does not have [[syllabic consonant]]s: the nucleus of a [[syllable]] is always a vowel.\n\nThe consonant {{IPA|/j/}} is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede ''i'' or ''y''. (For other restrictions on consonants appearing before ''i'' or ''y'', see [[#Distribution|\u00a7&nbsp;Distribution]] above.)\n\n===Voicing and devoicing===\nPolish [[obstruent]]s (stops, affricates and fricatives) are subject to [[consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing and devoicing]] in certain positions. This leads to [[neutralization (linguistics)|neutralization]] of voiced/voiceless pairs in those positions (or equivalently, restrictions on the distribution of voiced and voiceless consonants). The phenomenon applies in word-final position and in [[consonant cluster]]s.\n\nIn Polish consonant clusters, including across a word boundary, the obstruents are all voiced or all voiceless. To determine (based on the spelling of the words) whether a given cluster has voiced or voiceless obstruents, the ''last'' obstruent in the cluster, excluding ''w'' or ''rz'' (but including ''\u017c''), should be examined to see if appears to be voiced or voiceless. The consonants ''n, m, \u0144, r, j, l, \u0142'' do not represent obstruents and so do not affect the voicing of other consonants; they are also usually not subject to devoicing except when surrounded by unvoiced consonants.{{sfnp|Urba\u0144czyk|1992|p=369}} Some examples follow (click the words to hear them spoken):\n* {{Audio|Pl-\u0142\u00f3dka.ogg|''\u0142\u00f3dka''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8wutka]}} ('boat'), {{IPA|/d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t]}} before the voiceless ''k''\n* {{Audio|Pl-kawka-2.ogg|''kawka''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8kafka]}} ('jackdaw'), {{IPA|/v/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[f]}} before the voiceless ''k''\n* {{Audio|Pl-tak\u017ce.ogg|''tak\u017ce''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ta\u0261\u0290\u025b]}} ('also'), {{IPA|/k/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before the voiced ''\u017c''\n* {{Audio|Pl-jakby.ogg|''jakby''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ja\u0261b\u0268]}} ('as if'), {{IPA|/k/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before the voiced ''b''\n* {{Audio|Pl-krzak-2.ogg|''krzak''|help=no}} {{IPA|[k\u0282ak]}} ('bush'), {{IPA|/\u0290/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0282]}}; ''rz'' does not determine the voicing of the cluster\n* {{Audio|Pl-odtworzy\u0107.ogg|''odtworzy\u0107''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u0254t\u02c8tf\u0254\u0290\u0268t\u0361\u0255]}} ('to replay'), {{IPA|/d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t]}} & {{IPA|/v/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[f]}}; ''w'' does not determine the voicing of the cluster\n* ''dach domu'' {{IPA|[da\u0263 d\u0254mu]}} ('roof of the house'), {{IPA|/x/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0263]}}; the rule still applies across a word boundary\n\nIn some dialects of [[Greater Poland|Wielkopolska]] and the [[Kresy|eastern borderlands]], {{IPA|/v/}} remains voiced after voiceless consonants.\n\nThe above rule does not apply to [[sonorant]]s: a consonant cluster may contain voiced sonorants and voiceless obstruents, as in {{Audio|Pl-kr\u00f3l-2.ogg|'''''kr'''\u00f3l''|help=no}} {{IPA|[krul]}}, {{Audio|Pl-wart.ogg|''wa'''rt'''''|help=no}} {{IPA|[vart]}}, '''''s\u0142'''o\u0144'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sw\u0254\u0272]}}, '''''tn'''\u0105c'' {{IPA|[\u02c8tn\u0254nt\u0361s]}}.\n\nAt the end of a word, obstruents are pronounced voiceless (unless followed by a word beginning with a voiced obstruent, when the above cluster rules apply). For example, the {{IPA|/\u0261/}} in ''b\u00f3g'' ('god') is pronounced {{IPA|[k]}}, and the {{IPA|/zd/}} in ''zajazd'' ('inn') represents a pronunciation like {{IPA|[st]}}. However, in some regional dialects, especially in western and southern Poland, final obstruents are voiced if the following word starts with a [[sonorant]] (here, for example, the {{IPA|/t/}} in ''brat ojca'' 'father's brother' would be pronounced as {{IPA|[d]}}).\n\n===Hard and soft consonants===\nMultiple [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s and some depalatalizations that took place in the history of Proto-Slavic and Polish have created quite a complex system of what are often called 'soft' and 'hard' consonants. These terms are useful in describing some [[inflection]] patterns and other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes, but exact definitions of 'soft' and 'hard' may differ somewhat.\n\n'Soft' generally refers to the [[palatal consonant|palatal]] nature of a consonant. The alveolo-palatal sounds ''\u0144, \u015b, \u017a, \u0107, d\u017a'' are considered soft, as normally is the palatal ''j''. The ''l'' sound is also normally classed as a soft consonant: like the preceding sounds, it cannot be followed by ''y'' but takes ''i'' instead. The palatalized velars {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b2/}} and {{IPA|/x\u02b2/}} might also be regarded as soft on this basis.\n\nConsonants not classified as soft are dubbed 'hard'. However, a subset of hard consonants, ''c, dz, sz, \u017c/rz, cz, d\u017c'', often derive from historical palatalizations (for example, ''rz'' usually represents a historical palatalized ''r'') and behaves like the soft consonants in some respects (for example, they normally take ''e'' in the nominative plural). These sounds may be called 'hardened' or 'historically soft' consonants.\n\nIn some phonological descriptions of Polish, however, a greater number of consonants, including especially the labials ''m, p, b, f, w'',  are regarded as occurring in 'hard' and 'soft' pairs. In this approach, for example, the word ''pies'' ('dog') is analysed not as {{IPA|/pj\u025bs/}} but as {{IPA|/p\u02b2\u025bs/}}, with a soft {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}}. These consonants are then also analysed as soft when they precede the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''pi\u0107'' {{IPA|/p\u02b2it\u0361\u0255/}} 'to drink'), although here the palatalization is hardly audible. Unlike their equivalents in [[Russian language|Russian]], these consonants cannot retain their softness in the [[syllable coda]] (when not followed by a vowel). For example, the word for 'carp' has the inflected forms ''karpia'', ''karpie'' etc., with soft {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}} (or {{IPA|/pj/}}, depending on the analysis), but the nominative singular is ''karp'', with a hard {{IPA|/p/}}.\n\nThe consonants ''t, d, r'' (and some others) can also be regarded as having hard and soft forms according to the above approach, although the soft forms occur only in [[loanwords]] such as ''tir'' {{IPA|/t\u02b2ir/}} ('large lorry'; see [[TIR Treaty|TIR]]). If the distinction is made for all relevant consonants, then ''y'' and ''i'' can be regarded as [[allophone]]s of a single phoneme, with ''y'' following hard consonants and ''i'' following soft ones (and in initial position).\n\nThe historical palatalized forms of some consonants have developed in Polish into noticeably different sounds: historical palatalized ''t, d, r'' have become the sounds now represented by ''\u0107, d\u017a, rz'' respectively. Similarly palatalized ''s, z, n'' became the sounds ''\u015b, \u017a, \u0144''. The palatalization of labials has resulted (according to the main phonological analysis given in the sections above) in the addition of {{IPAl-pl|j}}, as in the example ''pies'' just given. These developments are reflected in some [[Polish grammar#Regular morphological alternation|regular morphological changes]] in Polish grammar, such as in noun declension.\n\n===Glottal stop===\nIn more contemporary Polish, a phonetic [[glottal stop]] may appear as the onset of a vowel-initial word (e.g. ''Ala'' {{IPA|[\u0294ala]}}), though this can be hard to detect.<ref>Magdalena Osowicka-Kondratowicz, \"Zwarcie krtaniowe \u2013 rodzaj fonacji czy artykulacji?\" , Rocznik Slawistyczny, t. LXVII, 2018 {{doi|10.24425/rslaw.2018.124590}}, p. 41</ref> It may also appear following word-final vowels to connotate particular affects; for example, ''nie'' ('no') is normally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b]}}, but may instead be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b\u0294]}} or in a prolonged interrupted {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b\u0294\u025b]}}. This intervocalic glottal stop may also break up a vowel hiatus, even when one appears morpheme-internally, as in ''poeta'' ('poet') {{IPA|[p\u0254\u0294\u025bta]}} or Ukraina ('Ukraine') {{IPA|[\u0294ukra\u0294ina]}}. A relatively new phenomenon  in Polish is the expansion of the usage of glottal stops. In the past, initial vowels were pronounced with an initial [[voiceless glottal fricative]] (so that ''Ala'' was pronounced {{IPA|[hala]}}), pre-[[iotation]] (so that ''ig\u0142a'' 'needle' was pronounced {{IPA|[ji\u0261u\u032fa]}}), or pre-[[labialization]] (so that ''oko'' 'eye' was pronounced {{IPA|[u\u032f\u0254k\u0254]}}).<ref>Osowicka-Kondratowicz, 2018 p. 40</ref>\n\n===Dialectal variation===\nIn some [[Polish dialects]] (found in the [[Kresy|eastern borderlands]] and in [[Upper Silesia]]) there is an additional [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0266/}}, represented by the letter {{angbr|h}}. In standard Polish, both {{angbr|h}} and {{angbr|ch}} represent {{IPA|/x/}}.\n\nSome eastern dialects also preserve the [[velarized dental lateral approximant]], {{IPA|[\u026b\u032a]}}, which corresponds with {{IPA|[w]}} in standard Polish. Those dialects also can palatalize {{IPA|/l/}} ({{IPA|[l\u02b2]}}) in every position, but standard Polish does so only allophonically before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|p=130}} {{IPA|[\u026b\u032a]}} and {{IPA|[l\u02b2]}} are also common realizations in native speakers of Polish from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Roc\u0142awski|1976}} notes that students of Polish philology were hostile towards the lateral variant of {{angbr|\u0142}}, saying that it sounded \"unnatural\" and \"awful\". Some of the students also said that they perceived the lateral {{angbr|\u0142}} as a variant of {{angbr|l}}, which, he further notes, along with the necessity of deciding from context whether the sound meant was {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, made people hostile towards the sound.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=130\u2013131}} On the other hand, some Poles view the lateral variant with nostalgia, associating it with the elegant culture of [[History of Poland (1918\u201339)|interwar Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.bialystok.pl/reportaz/index/id/25909|title=S\u0142ynne g\u0142adkie \u0142|publisher=Radio Bia\u0142ystok|accessdate=27 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630205328/http://www.radio.bialystok.pl/reportaz/index/id/25909|archivedate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Masurian dialect]] and some neighbouring dialects, ''[[mazurzenie]]'' occurs: retroflex {{IPA|/\u0282, \u0290, t\u0361\u0282, d\u0361\u0290/}} merge with the corresponding dentals {{IPA|/s, z, t\u0361s, d\u0361z/}} unless {{IPA|/\u0290/}} is spelled {{angbr|rz}} (a few centuries ago, it represented a palatalized trill {{IPA|/r\u02b2/}}, distinct from {{IPA|/\u0290/}}; only the latter sound occurs in modern Polish).\n\n== Prosody ==\nThe predominant [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern in Polish is penultimate: the second-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress: in a four-syllable word, if the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gussmann|2007|p=8}}, deferring to {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|Booij|1985}} for further discussion.</ref>\n\nEach vowel represents one syllable although the letter ''i'' normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents {{IPA|/j/}}, palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis; see [[Polish orthography]] and the above). Also, the letters ''u'' and ''i'' sometimes represent only semivowels after another vowel, as in ''autor'' {{IPA|/\u02c8awt\u0254r/}} ('author'), mostly in loanwords (so not in native ''nauka'' {{IPA|/na\u02c8u.ka/}} 'science, the act of learning', for example, nor in nativized ''Mateusz'' {{IPA|/ma\u02c8te.u\u0282/}}  'Matthew').\n\nSome [[loanword]]s, particularly from [[classical languages]], have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-last) syllable. For example, ''fizyka'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8fiz\u0268ka/}}) ('physics') is stressed on the first syllable. That may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement: ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/\u02c8muz\u0268ka/}} 'music' vs. ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/mu\u02c8z\u0268ka/}} - genitive singular of ''muzyk'' 'musician'. When additional syllables are added to such words through [[inflection]] or [[suffix]]ation, the stress normally becomes regular: ''uniwersytet'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272i\u02c8v\u025brs\u0268t\u025bt/}}, 'university') has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive ''uniwersytetu'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272iv\u025brs\u0268\u02c8t\u025btu/}}) and derived adjective ''uniwersytecki'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272iv\u025brs\u0268\u02c8t\u025bt\u0361sk\u02b2i/}}) have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Over time, loanwords become nativized to have a penultimate stress.{{sfnp|Gussmann|2007|p=9}}\n\nAnother class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings ''-by, -bym, -by\u015bmy'' etc. Those endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress: '''''zro'''bi\u0142bym'' ('I would do') is stressed on the first syllable and ''zro'''bi'''liby\u015bmy'' ('we would do') on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings ''-\u015bmy, -\u015bcie'' although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so ''zro'''bi'''li\u015bmy'' 'we did' is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as ''zrobi'''li'''\u015bmy'').<ref>[http://phonetik.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/uploads/tx_sibibtex/Oliver_Grice_ICPhS2003-1_01.pdf Phonetics and Phonology of lexical stress in Polish verbs], Dominika Oliver, Martine Grice, Institute of Phonetics, Saarland University, Germany</ref> The irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable [[clitic]]s rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of '''''ko'''go zoba'''czy'''li\u015bcie?'' ('whom did you see?') it is possible to say '''''ko'''go\u015bcie zoba'''czy'''li?'' \u2013 here ''kogo'' retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.\n\nSome common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. That applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as '''''do''' niej'' ('to her'), '''''na''' nas'' ('on us'), ''prze'''ze''' mnie'' ('because of me'), all stressed on the bolded syllable.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Evolution of the Polish language]]\n* [[Polish alphabet]]\n* [[Polish orthography]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Polish]] (a guide to pronunciation of Polish words as represented in Wikipedia articles)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Biedrzycki\n|first=Leszek\n|language=Polish\n|year=1963\n|title=Fonologiczna interpretacja polskich g\u0142osek nosowych\n|trans-title=Phonological interpretation of Polish nasal vowels\n|journal=Biuletyn Polskiego Towarzystwa J\u0119zykoznawczego\n|volume=22\n|pages=25\u201345\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|last=Biedrzycki\n|first=Leszek\n|language=Polish\n|year=1978\n|title=Fonologia angielskich i polskich rezonant\u00f3w.

Therefore, they are phonetically [[diphthong]]s.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gussmann|2007|p=2}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Biedrzycki|1963}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Biedrzycki|1978}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Wierzchowska|1971|p=135}}.</ref> (For nasality following other vowel nuclei, see [[#Allophony|\u00a7&nbsp;Allophony]] below.) {{IPA|/\u025b \u0268 \u0254 \u025b\u0303 \u0254\u0303/}} are also less commonly transcribed {{IPA|/e \u026a o \u1ebd \u00f5/}} respectively, such as by the PWN-Oxford Polish-English Dictionary.{{sfnp|Linde-Usiekniewicz et al.|2011|p=1430}}\n\n===Distribution===\nThe vowels {{IPA|/\u0268/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} have largely [[complementary distribution]]. Either vowel may follow a [[labial consonant|labial]] consonant, as in ''mi'' ('to me') and ''my'' ('we'). Elsewhere, however, {{IPA|/i/}} is usually restricted to word-initial position and positions after [[palatal consonant]]s and the palatalized [[velar consonant|velar]]s, while {{IPA|/\u0268/}} cannot appear in those positions (see [[#Hard and soft consonants|\u00a7&nbsp;Hard and soft consonants]] below). In some phonological descriptions of Polish that make a phonemic distinction between palatized and unpalatized labials, {{IPA|[\u0268]}} and {{IPA|[i]}} may thus be treated as [[allophone]]s of a single [[phoneme]]. However {{IPA|/i/}} appears outside its usual positions in some foreign-derived words, as in ''czipsy'' ('[[potato chip]]s') and ''tir'' ('large lorry', see [[TIR Treaty|TIR]]). In the past, {{IPA|/\u0268/}} was closer to {{IPAblink|\u026a}}, which is acoustically more similar to {{IPA|[i]}}.\n\nNasal vowels do not occur except before a [[fricative]] and in word-final position. When the letters ''\u0105'' and ''\u0119'' appear before [[stop consonant|stops]] and [[affricate]]s, they indicate an oral {{IPAslink|\u0254}} or {{IPAslink|\u025b}} followed by a [[nasal stop|nasal consonant]] [[homorganic]] with the following consonant. For example, ''k\u0105t'' is {{IPA|[k\u0254nt]}} ('angle'), ''g\u0119ba'' ('mouth') is {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0261\u025bmba]}}, and ''pi\u0119\u0107'' ('five') is {{IPA|[pj\u025b\u0272t\u0361\u0255]}},{{sfnp|Gussmann|2007|pp=2\u20133}} as if they were spelled ''*kont'', ''*gemba'', and ''*pie\u0144\u0107''. Before {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}, nasality is lost altogether and the vowels are pronounced as oral {{IPAblink|\u0254}} or {{IPAblink|\u025b}}. It is also very common to denasalize {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} to {{IPAblink|\u025b}} in word-final position, as in {{wikt-lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119}} {{IPA|/\u02c8b\u025bn.d\u025b/}} \"I will be\".\n\nAn alternative analysis postulates that nasal vowels no longer exist in Standard Polish as independent phonemes because they are realized as actual nasal consonants before stops and affricates, and their nasal-diphthong realization before fricatives can be analyzed as allophonical realization of the sequences {{IPA|/on/}}, {{IPA|/om/}} or {{IPA|/o\u0272/}} likewise. Moreover, studies indicate that the nasalization of the presumed nasal diphthongs ''\u0105'' {{IPA|[\u0254w\u0303]}} and ''\u0119'' {{IPA|[\u025bw\u0303]}} is no longer distinctive to native speakers in word-final position either and is retained only in emphatic, hypercorrect or artificial speech.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zag\u00f3rska Brooks|1968}}</ref>\n\n===Historical development===\nDistinctive [[vowel length]] was inherited from late [[Proto-Slavic]], with some changes (for example, stressed acute and circumflex vowels, and some long vowels occurring after the stress, were shortened). Additional vowel lengths were introduced in Proto-Polish (as in other [[West Slavic languages]]) as a result of [[compensatory lengthening]] when a [[yer]] in the next syllable disappeared. If a yer (or other vowel) disappeared, the preceding vowel became long (unless it was also a yer, in which case it became a short ''e'').\n\nThis system of vowel lengths is well preserved in [[Czech language|Czech]] and to a lesser degree in [[Slovak language|Slovak]]. In the emerging modern Polish, however, the long vowels were shortened again but sometimes (depending on dialect) with a change in quality (the vowels tended to become [[high vowel|higher]]). The latter changes came to be incorporated into the standard language only in the case of long ''o'' and the long nasal vowel, mostly for vowels located before [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[obstruent]]s. The [[vowel shift]] may thus be presented as follows:\n* long oral {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/a/}} (certain dialects: {{IPA|/\u0252/}})\n* long oral {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/\u025b/}} (certain dialects: {{IPA|/\u0268/}} or {{IPA|/i/}})\n* long oral {{IPA|/\u0268\u02d0/}} or {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/\u0268/}} or {{IPA|/i/}}\n* long oral {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/u/}}, written ''\u00f3''\n* long oral {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}} \u2192 short oral {{IPA|/u/}}, written ''u''\n* long nasal {{IPA|/\u00e3\u02d0/}} \u2192 short nasal {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}, written ''\u0105''\n\nNote that the {{IPA|/u/}} that was once a long {{IPA|/o\u02d0/}} is still distinguished in script as ''\u00f3''. Former long {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} was written ''\u00e9'' until the 19th century (''\u00e1'' for long {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} was already in disuse).\n\nIn most circumstances, consonants were [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]] when followed by an original front vowel, including the [[soft sign|soft yer]] (\u044c) that was often later lost. For example: ''*d\u044cn\u044c'' became ''dzie\u0144'' ('day'), while ''*d\u044cn\u044cm\u044a'' became ''dniem'' ('day' [[instrumental case|instr.]]).\n\nNasal vowels ''*\u0119'' and ''*\u01eb'' of late Proto-Slavic merged (''*\u0119'' leaving a trace by palatalizing the preceding consonant) to become the medieval Polish vowel {{IPA|/\u00e3/}}, written ''\u00f8''. Like other Polish vowels, it developed long and short variants. The short variant developed into present-day {{IPA|/\u025b\u0303/}} ''\u0119'', while the long form became {{IPA|/\u0254\u0303/}}, written ''\u0105'', as described above. Overall:\n* Proto-Slavic ''*\u0119'' \u2192 ''i\u0119'' when short, ''i\u0105'' when long (where the ''i'' represents palatalization of the preceding consonant)\n* Proto-Slavic ''*\u01eb'' \u2192 ''\u0119'' when short, ''\u0105'' when long\n\nThe historical shifts are the reason for the [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]s ''o'':''\u00f3'' and ''\u0119'':''\u0105'' commonly encountered in Polish morphology: ''*rog\u044a'' ('horn') became ''r\u00f3g'' due to the loss of the following [[yer]] (originally pronounced with a long ''o'', now with /u/), and the instrumental case of the same word went from ''*rog\u044am\u044a'' to ''rogiem'' (with no lengthening of the ''o''). Similarly, ''*d\u01ebb\u044a'' ('oak') became ''d\u0105b'' (originally with the long form of the nasal vowel), and in the instrumental case, ''*d\u01ebb\u044am\u044a'' the vowel remained short, causing the modern ''d\u0119bem''.\n\n===Dialectal variation===\n[[Polish dialects]] differ particularly in their realization of nasal vowels, both in terms of whether and when they are decomposed to an oral vowel followed by a nasal consonant and in terms of the quality of the vowels used.\n\nAlso, some dialects preserve nonstandard developments of historical long vowels (see previous section); for example, ''a'' may be pronounced with {{IPA|[\u0254]}} in words in which it was historically long.\n\n== Consonants ==\nThe Polish [[consonant]] system is more complicated; its characteristic features include the series of [[affricate consonant|affricate]]s and [[palatal consonant|palatal]] consonants that resulted from four Proto-Slavic [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s and two further palatalizations that took place in Polish and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]].\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Polish are as follows:{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=130\u2013181}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\"  colspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Dental consonant|Dental]],<br/>[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n! {{small|plain}}\n! {{small|[[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalized]]}}\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n| {{IPA link|m}}\n| {{IPA link|n\u032a|n}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0272}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Stop consonant|Plosive]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|p}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a|t}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|k}}\n| {{IPAlink|k\u031f|k\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|b}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a|d}}\n|\n|\n| {{IPA link|\u0261}}\n| {{IPAlink|\u0261\u02d6|\u0261\u02b2}}\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|t\u032a\u0361s\u032a|t\u0361s}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0282}}\n| {{IPA link|t\u0361\u0255}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|d\u032a\u0361z\u032a|d\u0361z}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0290}}\n| {{IPA link|d\u0361\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n! {{small|[[voicelessness|voiceless]]}}\n| {{IPA link|f}}\n| {{IPA link|s\u032a|s}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0282}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0255}}\n| {{IPA link|x}}\n| {{IPA link|x\u031f|x\u02b2}}\n|-\n! {{small|[[voice (phonetics)|voiced]]}}\n| {{IPA link|v}}\n| {{IPA link|z\u032a|z}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0290}}\n| {{IPA link|\u0291}}\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Tap and flap consonants|Tap]]/[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|\n| {{IPA link|r}}\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|\n| {{IPA link|l}}\n|\n| {{IPA link|j}}\n| {{IPA link|w}}\n|\n|}\n\nAlveolar {{IPA|[{{IPAplink|n}} {{IPAplink|t}} {{IPAplink|d}}]}} are allophones of {{IPA|/n t d/}} before {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0282 d\u0361\u0290/}}.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=136, 179}} Denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|l\u032a}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} before dental consonants. {{IPA|/r/}} has been traditionally classified as a trill, with a tap {{IPAblink|\u027e}} supposedly only occurring as an allophone or in fast speech {{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|p=132}} however, more recent studies show that /r/ is predominantly realized as a tap, sometimes as an approximant or a fricative, but almost never as a trill.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Szpyra-Koz\u0142owska|first=Jolanta|date=2018|title=The rhotic in fake and authentic Polish-accented English|url=http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.ojs-doi-10_17951_lsmll_2018_42_1_81|journal=Lublin Studies in Modern Languages and Literature|language=EN|volume=42|issue=1|pages=81|doi=10.17951/lsmll.2018.42.1.81|issn=2450-4580|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270267157|title=On the phonetic instability of the Polish rhotic /r/ {{!}} Request PDF|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2019-09-09}}</ref> One study found that in an intervocalic context a trilled [r] occurs in less than 3% of cases, while a tapped [\u027e] occurred in approximately 95% of cases.

Unlike languages such as [[Czech language|Czech]], Polish does not have [[syllabic consonant]]s: the nucleus of a [[syllable]] is always a vowel.\n\nThe consonant {{IPA|/j/}} is restricted to positions adjacent to a vowel. It also cannot precede ''i'' or ''y''. (For other restrictions on consonants appearing before ''i'' or ''y'', see [[#Distribution|\u00a7&nbsp;Distribution]] above.)\n\n===Voicing and devoicing===\nPolish [[obstruent]]s (stops, affricates and fricatives) are subject to [[consonant voicing and devoicing|voicing and devoicing]] in certain positions. This leads to [[neutralization (linguistics)|neutralization]] of voiced/voiceless pairs in those positions (or equivalently, restrictions on the distribution of voiced and voiceless consonants). The phenomenon applies in word-final position and in [[consonant cluster]]s.\n\nIn Polish consonant clusters, including across a word boundary, the obstruents are all voiced or all voiceless. To determine (based on the spelling of the words) whether a given cluster has voiced or voiceless obstruents, the ''last'' obstruent in the cluster, excluding ''w'' or ''rz'' (but including ''\u017c''), should be examined to see if appears to be voiced or voiceless. The consonants ''n, m, \u0144, r, j, l, \u0142'' do not represent obstruents and so do not affect the voicing of other consonants; they are also usually not subject to devoicing except when surrounded by unvoiced consonants.{{sfnp|Urba\u0144czyk|1992|p=369}} Some examples follow (click the words to hear them spoken):\n* {{Audio|Pl-\u0142\u00f3dka.ogg|''\u0142\u00f3dka''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8wutka]}} ('boat'), {{IPA|/d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t]}} before the voiceless ''k''\n* {{Audio|Pl-kawka-2.ogg|''kawka''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8kafka]}} ('jackdaw'), {{IPA|/v/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[f]}} before the voiceless ''k''\n* {{Audio|Pl-tak\u017ce.ogg|''tak\u017ce''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ta\u0261\u0290\u025b]}} ('also'), {{IPA|/k/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before the voiced ''\u017c''\n* {{Audio|Pl-jakby.ogg|''jakby''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u02c8ja\u0261b\u0268]}} ('as if'), {{IPA|/k/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0261]}} before the voiced ''b''\n* {{Audio|Pl-krzak-2.ogg|''krzak''|help=no}} {{IPA|[k\u0282ak]}} ('bush'), {{IPA|/\u0290/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0282]}}; ''rz'' does not determine the voicing of the cluster\n* {{Audio|Pl-odtworzy\u0107.ogg|''odtworzy\u0107''|help=no}} {{IPA|[\u0254t\u02c8tf\u0254\u0290\u0268t\u0361\u0255]}} ('to replay'), {{IPA|/d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[t]}} & {{IPA|/v/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[f]}}; ''w'' does not determine the voicing of the cluster\n* ''dach domu'' {{IPA|[da\u0263 d\u0254mu]}} ('roof of the house'), {{IPA|/x/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0263]}}; the rule still applies across a word boundary\n\nIn some dialects of [[Greater Poland|Wielkopolska]] and the [[Kresy|eastern borderlands]], {{IPA|/v/}} remains voiced after voiceless consonants.\n\nThe above rule does not apply to [[sonorant]]s: a consonant cluster may contain voiced sonorants and voiceless obstruents, as in {{Audio|Pl-kr\u00f3l-2.ogg|'''''kr'''\u00f3l''|help=no}} {{IPA|[krul]}}, {{Audio|Pl-wart.ogg|''wa'''rt'''''|help=no}} {{IPA|[vart]}}, '''''s\u0142'''o\u0144'' {{IPA|[\u02c8sw\u0254\u0272]}}, '''''tn'''\u0105c'' {{IPA|[\u02c8tn\u0254nt\u0361s]}}.\n\nAt the end of a word, obstruents are pronounced voiceless (unless followed by a word beginning with a voiced obstruent, when the above cluster rules apply). For example, the {{IPA|/\u0261/}} in ''b\u00f3g'' ('god') is pronounced {{IPA|[k]}}, and the {{IPA|/zd/}} in ''zajazd'' ('inn') represents a pronunciation like {{IPA|[st]}}. However, in some regional dialects, especially in western and southern Poland, final obstruents are voiced if the following word starts with a [[sonorant]] (here, for example, the {{IPA|/t/}} in ''brat ojca'' 'father's brother' would be pronounced as {{IPA|[d]}}).\n\n===Hard and soft consonants===\nMultiple [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]]s and some depalatalizations that took place in the history of Proto-Slavic and Polish have created quite a complex system of what are often called 'soft' and 'hard' consonants. These terms are useful in describing some [[inflection]] patterns and other [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] processes, but exact definitions of 'soft' and 'hard' may differ somewhat.\n\n'Soft' generally refers to the [[palatal consonant|palatal]] nature of a consonant. The alveolo-palatal sounds ''\u0144, \u015b, \u017a, \u0107, d\u017a'' are considered soft, as normally is the palatal ''j''. The ''l'' sound is also normally classed as a soft consonant: like the preceding sounds, it cannot be followed by ''y'' but takes ''i'' instead. The palatalized velars {{IPA|/k\u02b2/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261\u02b2/}} and {{IPA|/x\u02b2/}} might also be regarded as soft on this basis.\n\nConsonants not classified as soft are dubbed 'hard'. However, a subset of hard consonants, ''c, dz, sz, \u017c/rz, cz, d\u017c'', often derive from historical palatalizations (for example, ''rz'' usually represents a historical palatalized ''r'') and behaves like the soft consonants in some respects (for example, they normally take ''e'' in the nominative plural). These sounds may be called 'hardened' or 'historically soft' consonants.\n\nIn some phonological descriptions of Polish, however, a greater number of consonants, including especially the labials ''m, p, b, f, w'',  are regarded as occurring in 'hard' and 'soft' pairs. In this approach, for example, the word ''pies'' ('dog') is analysed not as {{IPA|/pj\u025bs/}} but as {{IPA|/p\u02b2\u025bs/}}, with a soft {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}}. These consonants are then also analysed as soft when they precede the vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''pi\u0107'' {{IPA|/p\u02b2it\u0361\u0255/}} 'to drink'), although here the palatalization is hardly audible. Unlike their equivalents in [[Russian language|Russian]], these consonants cannot retain their softness in the [[syllable coda]] (when not followed by a vowel). For example, the word for 'carp' has the inflected forms ''karpia'', ''karpie'' etc., with soft {{IPA|/p\u02b2/}} (or {{IPA|/pj/}}, depending on the analysis), but the nominative singular is ''karp'', with a hard {{IPA|/p/}}.\n\nThe consonants ''t, d, r'' (and some others) can also be regarded as having hard and soft forms according to the above approach, although the soft forms occur only in [[loanwords]] such as ''tir'' {{IPA|/t\u02b2ir/}} ('large lorry'; see [[TIR Treaty|TIR]]). If the distinction is made for all relevant consonants, then ''y'' and ''i'' can be regarded as [[allophone]]s of a single phoneme, with ''y'' following hard consonants and ''i'' following soft ones (and in initial position).\n\nThe historical palatalized forms of some consonants have developed in Polish into noticeably different sounds: historical palatalized ''t, d, r'' have become the sounds now represented by ''\u0107, d\u017a, rz'' respectively. Similarly palatalized ''s, z, n'' became the sounds ''\u015b, \u017a, \u0144''. The palatalization of labials has resulted (according to the main phonological analysis given in the sections above) in the addition of {{IPAl-pl|j}}, as in the example ''pies'' just given. These developments are reflected in some [[Polish grammar#Regular morphological alternation|regular morphological changes]] in Polish grammar, such as in noun declension.\n\n===Glottal stop===\nIn more contemporary Polish, a phonetic [[glottal stop]] may appear as the onset of a vowel-initial word (e.g. ''Ala'' {{IPA|[\u0294ala]}}), though this can be hard to detect.<ref>Magdalena Osowicka-Kondratowicz, \"Zwarcie krtaniowe \u2013 rodzaj fonacji czy artykulacji?\" , Rocznik Slawistyczny, t. LXVII, 2018 {{doi|10.24425/rslaw.2018.124590}}, p. 41</ref> It may also appear following word-final vowels to connotate particular affects; for example, ''nie'' ('no') is normally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b]}}, but may instead be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b\u0294]}} or in a prolonged interrupted {{IPA|[\u0272\u025b\u0294\u025b]}}. This intervocalic glottal stop may also break up a vowel hiatus, even when one appears morpheme-internally, as in ''poeta'' ('poet') {{IPA|[p\u0254\u0294\u025bta]}} or Ukraina ('Ukraine') {{IPA|[\u0294ukra\u0294ina]}}. A relatively new phenomenon  in Polish is the expansion of the usage of glottal stops. In the past, initial vowels were pronounced with an initial [[voiceless glottal fricative]] (so that ''Ala'' was pronounced {{IPA|[hala]}}), pre-[[iotation]] (so that ''ig\u0142a'' 'needle' was pronounced {{IPA|[ji\u0261u\u032fa]}}), or pre-[[labialization]] (so that ''oko'' 'eye' was pronounced {{IPA|[u\u032f\u0254k\u0254]}}).<ref>Osowicka-Kondratowicz, 2018 p. 40</ref>\n\n===Dialectal variation===\nIn some [[Polish dialects]] (found in the [[Kresy|eastern borderlands]] and in [[Upper Silesia]]) there is an additional [[voiced glottal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u0266/}}, represented by the letter {{angbr|h}}. In standard Polish, both {{angbr|h}} and {{angbr|ch}} represent {{IPA|/x/}}.\n\nSome eastern dialects also preserve the [[velarized dental lateral approximant]], {{IPA|[\u026b\u032a]}}, which corresponds with {{IPA|[w]}} in standard Polish. Those dialects also can palatalize {{IPA|/l/}} ({{IPA|[l\u02b2]}}) in every position, but standard Polish does so only allophonically before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|p=130}} {{IPA|[\u026b\u032a]}} and {{IPA|[l\u02b2]}} are also common realizations in native speakers of Polish from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Roc\u0142awski|1976}} notes that students of Polish philology were hostile towards the lateral variant of {{angbr|\u0142}}, saying that it sounded \"unnatural\" and \"awful\". Some of the students also said that they perceived the lateral {{angbr|\u0142}} as a variant of {{angbr|l}}, which, he further notes, along with the necessity of deciding from context whether the sound meant was {{IPA|/w/}} or {{IPA|/l/}}, made people hostile towards the sound.{{sfnp|Roc\u0142awski|1976|pp=130\u2013131}} On the other hand, some Poles view the lateral variant with nostalgia, associating it with the elegant culture of [[History of Poland (1918\u201339)|interwar Poland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.bialystok.pl/reportaz/index/id/25909|title=S\u0142ynne g\u0142adkie \u0142|publisher=Radio Bia\u0142ystok|accessdate=27 June 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630205328/http://www.radio.bialystok.pl/reportaz/index/id/25909|archivedate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Masurian dialect]] and some neighbouring dialects, ''[[mazurzenie]]'' occurs: retroflex {{IPA|/\u0282, \u0290, t\u0361\u0282, d\u0361\u0290/}} merge with the corresponding dentals {{IPA|/s, z, t\u0361s, d\u0361z/}} unless {{IPA|/\u0290/}} is spelled {{angbr|rz}} (a few centuries ago, it represented a palatalized trill {{IPA|/r\u02b2/}}, distinct from {{IPA|/\u0290/}}; only the latter sound occurs in modern Polish).\n\n== Prosody ==\nThe predominant [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] pattern in Polish is penultimate: the second-last syllable is stressed. Alternating preceding syllables carry secondary stress: in a four-syllable word, if the primary stress is on the third syllable, there will be secondary stress on the first.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gussmann|2007|p=8}}, deferring to {{Harvcoltxt|Rubach|Booij|1985}} for further discussion.</ref>\n\nEach vowel represents one syllable although the letter ''i'' normally does not represent a vowel when it precedes another vowel (it represents {{IPA|/j/}}, palatalization of the preceding consonant, or both depending on analysis; see [[Polish orthography]] and the above). Also, the letters ''u'' and ''i'' sometimes represent only semivowels after another vowel, as in ''autor'' {{IPA|/\u02c8awt\u0254r/}} ('author'), mostly in loanwords (so not in native ''nauka'' {{IPA|/na\u02c8u.ka/}} 'science, the act of learning', for example, nor in nativized ''Mateusz'' {{IPA|/ma\u02c8te.u\u0282/}}  'Matthew').\n\nSome [[loanword]]s, particularly from [[classical languages]], have the stress on the antepenultimate (third-last) syllable. For example, ''fizyka'' ({{IPA|/\u02c8fiz\u0268ka/}}) ('physics') is stressed on the first syllable. That may lead to a rare phenomenon of minimal pairs differing only in stress placement: ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/\u02c8muz\u0268ka/}} 'music' vs. ''muzyka'' {{IPA|/mu\u02c8z\u0268ka/}} - genitive singular of ''muzyk'' 'musician'. When additional syllables are added to such words through [[inflection]] or [[suffix]]ation, the stress normally becomes regular: ''uniwersytet'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272i\u02c8v\u025brs\u0268t\u025bt/}}, 'university') has irregular stress on the third (or antepenultimate) syllable, but the genitive ''uniwersytetu'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272iv\u025brs\u0268\u02c8t\u025btu/}}) and derived adjective ''uniwersytecki'' ({{IPA|/u\u0272iv\u025brs\u0268\u02c8t\u025bt\u0361sk\u02b2i/}}) have regular stress on the penultimate syllables. Over time, loanwords become nativized to have a penultimate stress.{{sfnp|Gussmann|2007|p=9}}\n\nAnother class of exceptions is verbs with the conditional endings ''-by, -bym, -by\u015bmy'' etc. Those endings are not counted in determining the position of the stress: '''''zro'''bi\u0142bym'' ('I would do') is stressed on the first syllable and ''zro'''bi'''liby\u015bmy'' ('we would do') on the second. According to prescriptive grammars, the same applies to the first and second person plural past tense endings ''-\u015bmy, -\u015bcie'' although this rule is often ignored in colloquial speech (so ''zro'''bi'''li\u015bmy'' 'we did' is said to be correctly stressed on the second syllable, although in practice it is commonly stressed on the third as ''zrobi'''li'''\u015bmy'').<ref>[http://phonetik.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/uploads/tx_sibibtex/Oliver_Grice_ICPhS2003-1_01.pdf Phonetics and Phonology of lexical stress in Polish verbs], Dominika Oliver, Martine Grice, Institute of Phonetics, Saarland University, Germany</ref> The irregular stress patterns are explained by the fact that these endings are detachable [[clitic]]s rather than true verbal inflections: for example, instead of '''''ko'''go zoba'''czy'''li\u015bcie?'' ('whom did you see?') it is possible to say '''''ko'''go\u015bcie zoba'''czy'''li?'' \u2013 here ''kogo'' retains its usual stress (first syllable) in spite of the attachment of the clitic. Reanalysis of the endings as inflections when attached to verbs causes the different colloquial stress patterns.\n\nSome common word combinations are stressed as if they were a single word. That applies in particular to many combinations of preposition plus a personal pronoun, such as '''''do''' niej'' ('to her'), '''''na''' nas'' ('on us'), ''prze'''ze''' mnie'' ('because of me'), all stressed on the bolded syllable.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Evolution of the Polish language]]\n* [[Polish alphabet]]\n* [[Polish orthography]]\n* [[Help:IPA/Polish]] (a guide to pronunciation of Polish words as represented in Wikipedia articles)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation\n|last=Biedrzycki\n|first=Leszek\n|language=Polish\n|year=1963\n|title=Fonologiczna interpretacja polskich g\u0142osek nosowych\n|trans-title=Phonological interpretation of Polish nasal vowels\n|journal=Biuletyn Polskiego Towarzystwa J\u0119zykoznawczego\n|volume=22\n|pages=25\u201345\n}}\n* {{Citation\n|last=Biedrzycki\n|first=Leszek\n|language=Polish\n|year=1978\n|title=Fonologia angielskich i polskich rezonant\u00f3w.
