This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men will not have the mutation, while all of their daughters will be [[genetic carrier]]s of the mutation. Female carriers usually show no clinical symptoms, but will pass the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters with the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.\n\nFemales are very unlikely to express clinical signs. However, there have been a few rare cases where females have shown symptoms associated with Norrie disease such as retinal abnormalities and mild hearing loss.<ref name=\"ghr\" /> Additionally, cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> One possible scenario that could lead to a female case of Norrie disease is if both of their copies of the ''NDP'' gene bear mutations, which could be the case in [[consanguineous]] families or due to a spontaneous [[mutation|somatic mutation]]. Another explanation for affected females could be skewed [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]]. In this latter case, carrier females with one mutated ''NDP'' allele could have a higher proportion of defective norrin being expressed, leading to the presentation of symptoms of Norrie disease.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The ''NDP'' gene ===\n\nNorrie disease is caused by a mutation in the ''Norrin cystine knot growth factor'' gene, also known as the Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) gene or ''[[NDP (gene)|NDP]]'' gene. Mutations could include splicing or mis-sense mutations, as well as partial or full gene deletion.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> The normal function of the ''NDP'' gene is to produce the instructions for creating a protein called [[norrin]]. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin is believed to be crucial.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) | encyclopedia = [[Genetics Home Reference]] | publisher = [[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] |date=March 2008 | url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=ndp | access-date=18 March 2008}}</ref> Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a blood supply to the [[inner ear]] and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory function is interfered by the mutation of ''NDP''.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\"/> This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells in the back of the eye. When norrin's role in the establishment of [[blood vessel]]s supplying the eye is disrupted, the tissues cannot develop properly.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\"/>\n\nNorrin is not only important in the development of the eye. The mutation of the ''NDP'' gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the ''NDP'' gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring [[Monoamine oxidase|''MAO'']] genes. When the mutations simply change a single [[amino acid]] in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the ''NDP'' mutation does not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying exactly the same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the [[cysteine]]s forming the putative [[cystine knot]]), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.<ref name=\"Meitinger\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meitinger T, Meindl A, Bork P, Rost B, Sander C, Haasemann M, Murken J | title = Molecular modelling of the Norrie disease protein predicts a cystine knot growth factor tertiary structure | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 376\u201380 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8298646 | doi = 10.1038/ng1293-376 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52cc6fcac912474f335097960474fa1ab182ea36 }}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nNorrie disease and other ''NDP'' related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 95% of affected males.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Clinical diagnoses rely on [[human eye|ocular]] findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8\u201310 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris [[atrophy]], shallowing of [[anterior chamber]], and shrinking of the globe.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Children with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.\n\nIn addition to its use for initial diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is used to confirm [[diagnostic testing]] (such as diagnosis by ocular examination), for carrier testing females, [[prenatal]] diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 95% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are [[submicroscopic]] deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is [[linkage analysis]], which is used when the first two types are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.<ref name=\"Sims\" />\n\n[[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is often used to diagnose the [[retinal dysplasia]] that occurs with the Norrie disease. However, the retinal dysplasia can be indistinguishable on MRI from [[persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous]], or the dysplasia of [[trisomy 13]] and [[Walker\u2013Warburg syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castillo |first1=Mauricio | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neuroradiology companion : methods, guidelines, and imaging fundamentals|date=2011|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781451111750|edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nFor families with an existing history of Norrie disease, genetic counselling and ''in utero'' diagnosis of Norrie disease may be considered.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Zhu J, Yang J, Zhang X, Zhang Q, Zhao P | title = Prenatal diagnosis of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and Norrie disease | journal = Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = e00503 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30474316 | pmc = 6382493 | doi = 10.1002/mgg3.503 }}</ref> ''In utero'' diagnosis has been reported to include genetic testing by amniocentesis and ultrasonography to examine fetal eyes.

For more significantly impaired hearing, [[cochlear implant]]s may also be considered.<ref name=\"Sims\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n30-50% of individuals with Norrie disease have been reported to present with developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Additionally, behavioral issues have also been reported. Supportive intervention and therapy, for example working with speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, can be used to maximize educational opportunities for these individuals.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Furthermore, training of teachers and school counselors on how to best support children with vision and hearing impairment can be extremely beneficial.\n\nRoutine monitoring of individuals with Norrie disease is recommended to best manage the disease. This includes regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist, even when vision is severely compromised. Additionally, due to the high proportion of individuals with Norrie disease who develop hearing loss, regular monitoring of hearing loss is beneficial to allow any hearing loss to be detected early and then correctly managed.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> More recently, the use of dual sensory clinics has been proposed to provide improved care to patients living with conditions such as Norrie disease. For example, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (GOSH), London are building a new Sight and Sound center, with the aim of improving the patient experience for individuals with conditions such as Norrie disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natsip.org.uk/3661-calling-uk-norrie-families-dual-sensory-clinics-for-children-and-young-people-up-to-18-yrs|title=National Sensory Impairment Partnership.

In cases where hearing loss is also experienced, this psychological burden has been shown to increase. For example, a number of Norrie disease patients have been reported to experience transient depression correlating with the onset of hearing loss.<ref name=\":3\" /> Because of this, the provision of emotional support to individuals with Norrie disease can be as important as clinical treatment strategies in terms of improving their quality of life and reducing disease burden.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch into understanding Norrie disease and how to improve the lives of those with Norrie disease is ongoing. For example, research is taking place at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London (UCL GOSICH) to study the developmental changes in the ear and eye in Norrie disease, with the hope to understand how to improve current treatment strategies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://norriedisease.org.uk/news/nd-research-project-great-ormond-street/|title=Norrie Disease Foundation.

The first member of the family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating.<ref name=\"Warburg, M\">{{cite journal |author=Warburg M |title=Norrie's disease: a new hereditary bilateral pseudotumour of the retina |journal=Acta Ophthalmol. |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=757\u2013772 |year=1961|doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.1961.tb07740.x }}</ref> The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass.  Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of [[retinoblastoma]], a cancerous tumor on the retina. A [[histology|histologic]] examination showed a hemorrhagic [[necrotic]] mass in the [[posterior chamber]], surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) [[glia]]l tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, [[hyperplasia]] of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment [[epithelium]], [[hypoplasia]] and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and [[phthisis bulbi]]. The physician had suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells had  already begun to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well.<ref name=\"Warburg, M\"/> She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, [[Gordon Norrie]] (1855\u20131941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|421|Gordon Norrie}}. Retrieved 13 February 2007.</ref> The ''NDP'' gene was previously named the \u201cNorrie disease (pseudoglioma)\u201d gene, which is still used widely when referring to ''NDP''. However, the current approved name for ''NDP'' is \u201cNorrin cystine knot growth factor\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Patient Organizations ==\nThere are two patient organizations for people affected by Norrie disease. The '''Norrie Disease Association (NDA)''' was founded in 1994 and is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to provide information and support to people living with Norrie disease and their families. The NDA holds a conference on Norrie disease every three years in Boston, US. The '''Norrie Disease Foundation (NDF)''' is a UK-based charity established in 2016. The main aims of NDF are to provide support for families and promote pioneering research into Norrie disease. They organize two family days a year where families with Norrie disease can come together to share experiences, meet each other and build relationships and supportive networks. The websites for both patient organizations contain useful information for patients and their families about the disease.\n\n'''NDA:''' http://www.norriedisease.org/<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.norriedisease.org/|title=Norrie Disease Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''NDF:''' https://norriedisease.org.uk/<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://norriedisease.org.uk/|title=Norrie Disease Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = 31165\n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|15|8|q|15}}\n| ICD9            = {{ICD9|743.8}}\n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 310600\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = \n| Orphanet        = 649\n}}\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/tests/?term=norrie/ NCBI Genetic Testing Registry]\n\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of eye}}\n{{X-linked disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Genetic diseases and disorders]]\n[[Category:Blindness]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders of eyes]]\n[[Category:X-linked recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Norrie disease\n| synonyms        = \n| image           = \n| caption         = \n| pronounce       = \n| field           = \n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Norrie disease''' is a [[rare disease]] and [[genetic disorder]] that primarily affects the [[human eye|eyes]] and almost always leads to [[blindness]].

This means that almost only males are affected. Sons of affected men will not have the mutation, while all of their daughters will be [[genetic carrier]]s of the mutation. Female carriers usually show no clinical symptoms, but will pass the mutation to 50% of their offspring. Daughters with the mutated gene will also be, like their mother, asymptomatic carriers, but 50% of their sons will express clinical symptoms.\n\nFemales are very unlikely to express clinical signs. However, there have been a few rare cases where females have shown symptoms associated with Norrie disease such as retinal abnormalities and mild hearing loss.<ref name=\"ghr\" /> Additionally, cases of symptomatic female carriers have been reported.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> One possible scenario that could lead to a female case of Norrie disease is if both of their copies of the ''NDP'' gene bear mutations, which could be the case in [[consanguineous]] families or due to a spontaneous [[mutation|somatic mutation]]. Another explanation for affected females could be skewed [[X-inactivation|X-chromosome inactivation]]. In this latter case, carrier females with one mutated ''NDP'' allele could have a higher proportion of defective norrin being expressed, leading to the presentation of symptoms of Norrie disease.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== The ''NDP'' gene ===\n\nNorrie disease is caused by a mutation in the ''Norrin cystine knot growth factor'' gene, also known as the Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) gene or ''[[NDP (gene)|NDP]]'' gene. Mutations could include splicing or mis-sense mutations, as well as partial or full gene deletion.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> The normal function of the ''NDP'' gene is to produce the instructions for creating a protein called [[norrin]]. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin is believed to be crucial.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\">{{Cite encyclopedia | title = Norrie disease (pseudoglioma) | encyclopedia = [[Genetics Home Reference]] | publisher = [[U.S. National Library of Medicine]] |date=March 2008 | url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene=ndp | access-date=18 March 2008}}</ref> Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a blood supply to the [[inner ear]] and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory function is interfered by the mutation of ''NDP''.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\"/> This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells in the back of the eye. When norrin's role in the establishment of [[blood vessel]]s supplying the eye is disrupted, the tissues cannot develop properly.<ref name=\"GeneticsHomeReference\"/>\n\nNorrin is not only important in the development of the eye. The mutation of the ''NDP'' gene can affect other systems of the body as well. The most severe problems are caused by chromosomal deletions in the region of the ''NDP'' gene, causing the prevention of the gene product, or even that of the neighboring [[Monoamine oxidase|''MAO'']] genes. When the mutations simply change a single [[amino acid]] in norrin, the effects are less widespread and severe. However, the location and type of the ''NDP'' mutation does not necessarily determine the degree of severity of the disease, since highly varying clinical signs have been diagnosed in patients carrying exactly the same mutation. Therefore, the involvement of other modifying genes is very likely. On the other hand, if certain structurally important amino acids are changed (e.g. the [[cysteine]]s forming the putative [[cystine knot]]), the clinical outcome has been shown to be more serious.<ref name=\"Meitinger\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meitinger T, Meindl A, Bork P, Rost B, Sander C, Haasemann M, Murken J | title = Molecular modelling of the Norrie disease protein predicts a cystine knot growth factor tertiary structure | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 376\u201380 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8298646 | doi = 10.1038/ng1293-376 | url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52cc6fcac912474f335097960474fa1ab182ea36 }}</ref>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n\nNorrie disease and other ''NDP'' related diseases are diagnosed with the combination of clinical findings and molecular genetic testing. Molecular genetic testing identifies the mutations that cause the disease in about 95% of affected males.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Clinical diagnoses rely on [[human eye|ocular]] findings. Norrie disease is diagnosed when grayish-yellow fibrovascular masses are found behind the eye from birth through three months. Doctors also look for progression of the disease from three months through 8\u201310 years of age. Some of these progressions include cataracts, iris [[atrophy]], shallowing of [[anterior chamber]], and shrinking of the globe.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Children with the condition either have only light perception or no vision at all.\n\nIn addition to its use for initial diagnosis, molecular genetic testing is used to confirm [[diagnostic testing]] (such as diagnosis by ocular examination), for carrier testing females, [[prenatal]] diagnosis, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. There are three types of clinical molecular genetic testing. In approximately 95% of males, mis-sense and splice mutations of the NDP gene and partial or whole gene deletions are detected using sequence analysis.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Deletion/duplication analysis can be used to detect the 15% of mutations that are [[submicroscopic]] deletions. This is also used when testing for carrier females. The last testing used is [[linkage analysis]], which is used when the first two types are unavailable. Linkage analysis is also recommended for those families who have more than one member affected by the disease.<ref name=\"Sims\" />\n\n[[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] is often used to diagnose the [[retinal dysplasia]] that occurs with the Norrie disease. However, the retinal dysplasia can be indistinguishable on MRI from [[persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous]], or the dysplasia of [[trisomy 13]] and [[Walker\u2013Warburg syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Castillo |first1=Mauricio | name-list-format = vanc |title=Neuroradiology companion : methods, guidelines, and imaging fundamentals|date=2011|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams & Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781451111750|edition=4th }}</ref>\n\nFor families with an existing history of Norrie disease, genetic counselling and ''in utero'' diagnosis of Norrie disease may be considered.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Zhu J, Yang J, Zhang X, Zhang Q, Zhao P | title = Prenatal diagnosis of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and Norrie disease | journal = Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = e00503 | date = January 2019 | pmid = 30474316 | pmc = 6382493 | doi = 10.1002/mgg3.503 }}</ref> ''In utero'' diagnosis has been reported to include genetic testing by amniocentesis and ultrasonography to examine fetal eyes.

For ocular (eye) management, often patients already suffer from complete retinal detachment at birth, or by the time of diagnosis, so surgical intervention is often not offered. However, there is some evidence for the benefit of early surgery or laser therapy for cases where retinal detachment is incomplete.<ref name=\"Sims\" /><ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh MK, Drenser KA, Capone A, Trese MT | title = Early vitrectomy effective for Norrie disease | journal = Archives of Ophthalmology | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 456\u201360 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20385941 | doi = 10.1001/archophthalmol.2009.403 }}</ref> Surgery may also be used to treat increased intraocular pressure and in rare cases [[Enucleation of the eye|enucleation]] (removal) of the eye is considered to control pain.<ref name=\"Sims\" />\n\nA high proportion (85\u201390%) of individuals with Norrie disease experience progressive hearing loss in their second decade of life. In most cases, use of hearing aids has been shown to be effective into middle or late adulthood. For more significantly impaired hearing, [[cochlear implant]]s may also be considered.<ref name=\"Sims\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n30-50% of individuals with Norrie disease have been reported to present with developmental delay or cognitive impairment. Additionally, behavioral issues have also been reported. Supportive intervention and therapy, for example working with speech and language therapists and occupational therapists, can be used to maximize educational opportunities for these individuals.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> Furthermore, training of teachers and school counselors on how to best support children with vision and hearing impairment can be extremely beneficial.\n\nRoutine monitoring of individuals with Norrie disease is recommended to best manage the disease. This includes regular follow-up with an ophthalmologist, even when vision is severely compromised. Additionally, due to the high proportion of individuals with Norrie disease who develop hearing loss, regular monitoring of hearing loss is beneficial to allow any hearing loss to be detected early and then correctly managed.<ref name=\"Sims\" /> More recently, the use of dual sensory clinics has been proposed to provide improved care to patients living with conditions such as Norrie disease. For example, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] (GOSH), London are building a new Sight and Sound center, with the aim of improving the patient experience for individuals with conditions such as Norrie disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.natsip.org.uk/3661-calling-uk-norrie-families-dual-sensory-clinics-for-children-and-young-people-up-to-18-yrs|title=National Sensory Impairment Partnership. Calling UK Norrie families - Dual Sensory Clinics for children and young people up to 18 yrs. |date=2019 |url-status=live |access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref> The benefits of dual sensory clinics include improved communication between the different health care professionals (HCPs) involved in management of Norrie disease (e.g. ophthalmologists and audiologists) as well as allowing more consistent training of staff on best practices for managing and interacting with individuals suffering from sensory impairment.\n\nIndividuals with Norrie disease can often feel isolated from society due to difficulties in communication. In cases where hearing loss is also experienced, this psychological burden has been shown to increase. For example, a number of Norrie disease patients have been reported to experience transient depression correlating with the onset of hearing loss.<ref name=\":3\" /> Because of this, the provision of emotional support to individuals with Norrie disease can be as important as clinical treatment strategies in terms of improving their quality of life and reducing disease burden.\n\n== Research ==\nResearch into understanding Norrie disease and how to improve the lives of those with Norrie disease is ongoing. For example, research is taking place at Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, University College London (UCL GOSICH) to study the developmental changes in the ear and eye in Norrie disease, with the hope to understand how to improve current treatment strategies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://norriedisease.org.uk/news/nd-research-project-great-ormond-street/|title=Norrie Disease Foundation.

The first member of the family to be thoroughly studied was a 12-month-old boy. At the child's examination at three months, it was noticed that he was normal except that his lens appeared to be opaque and his irises were deteriorating.<ref name=\"Warburg, M\">{{cite journal |author=Warburg M |title=Norrie's disease: a new hereditary bilateral pseudotumour of the retina |journal=Acta Ophthalmol. |volume=39 |issue=5 |pages=757\u2013772 |year=1961|doi=10.1111/j.1755-3768.1961.tb07740.x }}</ref> The area behind his lens was filled with a growing yellowish mass.  Five months later, his left eye was removed due to suspicion of [[retinoblastoma]], a cancerous tumor on the retina. A [[histology|histologic]] examination showed a hemorrhagic [[necrotic]] mass in the [[posterior chamber]], surrounded by undifferentiated (immature, undeveloped) [[glia]]l tissue. The diagnosis included a pseudotumor of the retina, [[hyperplasia]] of retinal, ciliary, and iris pigment [[epithelium]], [[hypoplasia]] and necrosis of the inner layer of the retina, cataract, and [[phthisis bulbi]]. The physician had suspected a tumor, although it emerged that it was a developmental defect that led to the malformation of inner parts of the eye. Because the eye was not functional, cells had  already begun to die (necrosis) and the eye globe began to shrink due to its dysfunction (phthisi bulbi). In this Danish family, five of the seven people in these cases developed deafness later in life. Also, in four of the seven, mental capacity was determined to be low. After Warburg researched literature under various medical categories, she discovered 48 similar cases which she believed were caused by this disease as well.<ref name=\"Warburg, M\"/> She then suggested this disease be named after another famous Danish ophthalmologist, [[Gordon Norrie]] (1855\u20131941). Norrie was greatly recognized for his work with the blind and for being a surgeon at the Danish Institute for the Blind for 35 years.<ref>{{WhoNamedIt|doctor|421|Gordon Norrie}}. Retrieved 13 February 2007.</ref> The ''NDP'' gene was previously named the \u201cNorrie disease (pseudoglioma)\u201d gene, which is still used widely when referring to ''NDP''. However, the current approved name for ''NDP'' is \u201cNorrin cystine knot growth factor\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Patient Organizations ==\nThere are two patient organizations for people affected by Norrie disease. The '''Norrie Disease Association (NDA)''' was founded in 1994 and is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to provide information and support to people living with Norrie disease and their families. The NDA holds a conference on Norrie disease every three years in Boston, US. The '''Norrie Disease Foundation (NDF)''' is a UK-based charity established in 2016. The main aims of NDF are to provide support for families and promote pioneering research into Norrie disease. They organize two family days a year where families with Norrie disease can come together to share experiences, meet each other and build relationships and supportive networks. The websites for both patient organizations contain useful information for patients and their families about the disease.\n\n'''NDA:''' http://www.norriedisease.org/<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.norriedisease.org/|title=Norrie Disease Association|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n'''NDF:''' https://norriedisease.org.uk/<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://norriedisease.org.uk/|title=Norrie Disease Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=27 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|  DiseasesDB      = 31165  \n|  ICD10           = {{ICD10|Q|15|8|q|15}} \n|  ICD9            = {{ICD9|743.8}}  \n|  ICDO            =  \n|  OMIM            = 310600  \n|  MedlinePlus     =  \n|  eMedicineSubj   =  \n|  eMedicineTopic  =  \n|  MeshID          = \n}}\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/all/tests/?term=norrie/ NCBI Genetic Testing Registry]\n\n{{Congenital malformations and deformations of eye}}\n{{X-linked disorders}}\n\n[[Category:Genetic diseases and disorders]]\n[[Category:Blindness]]\n[[Category:Congenital disorders of eyes]]\n[[Category:X-linked recessive disorders]]\n[[Category:Rare diseases]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norrie_disease"}
