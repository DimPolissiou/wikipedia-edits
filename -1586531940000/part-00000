This 'stacked gearbox' was followed by other manufacturers. Compacting the engine made the engine much shorter, allowing the wheelbase to be shortened. This allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized [[center of gravity]]. The swingarm could be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short {{cvt|1385|mm}}. Four 40&nbsp;mm Keihin CV carburetors fed fuel to the engine. It had KYB upside down 41&nbsp;mm front forks and 300&nbsp;mm semi-floating disk brakes. The instrument panel was electrical with a self diagnosis system and digital speed readout. The exhaust system used Yamaha's [[Exhaust Ultimate Power Valve]] (EXUP), which controlled the exhaust gas flow to maximize engine power production at all revs. This created a high powered and high torque engine.  \nThe [[Yamaha YZF-R6]] was introduced in 1999 as the 600 cc version of the R1 super bike.\n\nThe 1999 R1 saw only minor changes, apart from paint and graphics. More improvements were a redesigned gear change linkage and the gear change shaft length being increased. Fuel tank reserve capacity was reduced from {{cvt|5.5|to|4.0|L}}, while the total fuel tank capacity was unchanged at {{cvt|18|l}}.\n\n''[[Motorcycle Consumer News]]'' tests of the 1998 model year YZF-R1 yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.96 seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph}} of 5.93 seconds, a{{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.19 seconds at {{cvt|131.40|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|168|mph}}, with deceleration from {{cvt|60|to|0|mph}} of {{cvt|113.9|ft}}.<ref name=PerfIndex/> For the 1999 model year, ''Cycle World'' tests recorded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 3.0 seconds, {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.31 seconds at {{cvt|139.55|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|170|mph}}.<ref name=Catterson1999/>\n\n==2000\u20132001==\n[[File:Yamaha YZF R1 2001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|2001 YZF-R1]]\n\nIn 2000, Yamaha introduced a series of changes to improve the bike, and minor changes to the bodywork to allow for better long duration ride handling. Yamaha's main design goal was to sharpen the pre-existing bike and not to redesign it. The dry weight was reduced five pounds to {{cvt|414|lb}}.<ref name=\"SRspecs\">{{Citation |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090312021813/http://sportrider.com/tech/146_weights_measurements/index10.html |archivedate=March 12, 2009 |url=http://www.sportrider.com/tech/146_weights_measurements/index10.html |title= Sport Rider: Yamaha Weights and Measurements |magazine= Sport Rider |year=2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt {{cvt|127.8|hp|kW}} at the rear wheel,<ref name=\"SRspecs\"/> top-end output remained the same, but changes to the engine management system were intended to result in a smoother, broader distribution of power. The bodywork was still unmistakably R1, although a few changes were made resulting in a 3% reduction in the [[drag coefficient]]. The headlight housing's profile was sharpened, the side panels were made more aerodynamic and slippery, and the windscreen was reshaped for better rider protection.\n\nThe seating area was also updated. The fuel tank was reshaped, with a more relaxed rear angle and deeper leg recesses to provide for a better rider feel. The seat extended further towards the rear of the tank and the new, steeper, seating position put additional weight on the front end. All of this was aimed at improving weight bias and offering sharper cornering and more stability.\n\nMechanically, the [[carburetor]]s were re-jetted in an effort to improve throttle response, especially in the low end, all the way up to the bike's 11,750&nbsp;rpm [[redline]]. The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal oil ways to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced [[tappet]] clearance, provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow [[chrome moly]] shift shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned shift linkage and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\n[[File:Yamaha.jpg|thumb|2002 YZF-R1 with aftermarket high-mount exhaust]]\nA new [[fuel injection]] system was introduced for the 2002 year, which worked like a carburetor by employing a CV carburetor slide controlled by vacuum created by the engine. With a similar power output to the 2000-2001 bike, the engine remained largely the same. One notable improvement was the use of new cylinder sleeves of a high silicon content alloy containing magnesium that minimized heat induced distortion, reducing oil consumption. Also in 2002, Yamaha released the newly developed Deltabox frame,<ref>{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Mayhersohn |first=Norman |title=Yamaha FZR |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |page=48 |date=November 1987 }}</ref> which, with its hydro formed construction, reduced the total number of frame welds. These changes improved the frame's rigidity by 30%. The cooling system was redesigned for better performance and compactness. The exhaust system was changed from a 4-into-1 to a new titanium 4-into-2-into-1 design. The rear end of the motorcycle was updated and streamlined with a [[LED]] taillight. This allowed for very clean rear body lines when choosing one of several common after market modifications, such as removal of the turn signal stalks and stock license plate bracket; and replacing them with assorted available replacements that \"hug\" the body or frame. Also, front end lighting was improved in 2002, between the higher definition headlights and also side \"parking\" lights within the twin-headlight panel, giving a more angular appearance. This also gave additional after market possibilities, such as to remove the front turn signals and use these front lights as directional or hazard markers while stopped. For 2003, the only change was fitted hazard warning lights and dipped headlights, which stay on all the time the engine is running.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Cycle World]]'' reported fuel mileage of {{cvt|38|mpgus}}, a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.9&nbsp;seconds, a {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.32&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|137.60|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|167|mph}}.<ref name=Canet2002/>\n\n==2004\u20132005==\n[[File:Yzf-r1 2004.jpg|thumb|left|2004 YZF-R1]]\nWith the competition advancing, Yamaha made some major changes to the model. This included style updates, like an under seat twin exhaust, and performance upgrades including radial brakes, and, for the first time an R1 [[Ram-air intake]]. Furthermore, the tendency for [[wheelie]]s by earlier productions was reduced by changing the geometry of the frame and weight distribution. The all-new engine was no longer used as a stressed member of the chassis, and had a separate top [[crankcase]] and [[cylinder block]].\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1 Instruments.jpg|thumb|2005 YZF-R1 instrumentation]]\nThe 2004 R1 weighs {{cvt|172|kg}} dry. The conventional front [[brake caliper]]s were replaced by radially mounted calipers, activated by a radial master cylinder. A factory-installed [[steering damper]] was also added this year. Combined with the changes to the frame, this helped to eliminate the tendency of the handlebars to shake violently during rapid acceleration or deceleration on less-than-perfect surfaces, a phenomenon known as a [[speed wobble]] or [[tank slapper]].\n\n''Motorcycle Consumer News'' tests of the 2004 model year YZF-R1S yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 3.04&nbsp;seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph|0}} of 5.42&nbsp;seconds, a quarter-mile time of 9.90&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|144.98|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|179|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex />\n\n[[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] won the senior race at the [[2005 Isle of Man TT]].\n\n==2006==\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1 2006.jpg|thumb|2006 YZF-R1]]\nThe [[swingarm]] was extended by {{cvt|20|mm}} to reduce acceleration instability. In this year, Yamaha also released a limited edition version in original Yamaha racing colors to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The model (LE/SP) had a Kenny Roberts front and rear custom [[\u00d6hlins]] suspension units developed by the same team as the [[Yamaha YZR-M1|YZR-M1]] MotoGP bike. Custom forged aluminum [[Marchesini]] wheels specifically designed for the LE shaved nearly a pound off the unsprung weight. A back torque-limiting [[slipper clutch]], and an integrated lap timer rounded out the package, making the LE virtually a production racer. Only 500 units were made for the United States with another 500 units for Europe.{{Clear}}\n\n==2007\u20132008==\n[[File:YAMAHA YZF-R1 2007TMS.jpg|thumb|2007-2008 YZF-R1]]\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1.jpg|thumb|left|2007 Yamaha YZF-R1 used by [[Noriyuki Haga]] in the [[Superbike World Championship]].]]\nAn all-new YZF-R1 for the 2007 model year was announced on 8 October 2006. It had an all-new inline four-cylinder engine, going back to a more conventional four-valves per cylinder, rather than Yamaha's trade mark five-valve Genesis layout. It also had the Yamaha Chip Control Intake (YCC-I) electronic variable-length [[Velocity stack|intake funnel]] system, Yamaha Chip Control Throttle (YCC-T) [[fly-by-wire]] throttle system, [[slipper-type clutch]], all-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers with 310&nbsp;mm discs, a wider radiator, and M1 styling on the new large [[ram-air]] ports in the front fairing. There were no major changes for 2008. Power at the rear wheel was {{cvt|156.7|hp}} @ 10,160&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=CW09-2008/>\n\nMotorcycle Consumer News tests of the 2007 model year YZF-R1 yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.94&nbsp;seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph|0}} of 5.46&nbsp;seconds, a \u00bc mile time of 9.88&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|145.50|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex />\n\n==2009\u20132014==\n[[File:2009 Yamaha YZF-R1.jpg|thumb|2009 YZF-R1 Limited Launch Edition]]\n[[File:R1 Yamaha 2011 model.jpg|thumb|2011 YZF-R1]]\nIn late 2008, Yamaha announced they would release an all new R1 for 2009. The new R1 takes engine technology from the M1 MotoGP bike with its [[Crossplane|cross plane crankshaft]]. Crossplane technology puts each connecting rod 90\u00b0 from the next, with an uneven firing interval of 270\u00b0- 180\u00b0- 90\u00b0- 180\u00b0. The 2009 R1 was the first production sportbike to use a crossplane crankshaft.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/article/?article=34083|title=2009 Yamaha YZF-R1 Features Uneven Firing Order For Improved Power Delivery|publisher=Yamaha press release via Road Racing World|year=2008|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref> The power delivery is the same as a 90\u00b0 V4 with a 180\u00b0 crank, such as the [[Honda VFR800]] and very similar to the [[Yamaha V-Max]] which has been lauded for its exhaust sound.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/2009-star-motorcycles-vmax-full-review-86751.html|title=2009 Star V-Max Review/Test|publisher=Motorcycle.com|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=2010-04-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100501152056/http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/2009-star-motorcycles-vmax-full-review-86751.html| archivedate= 1 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Yamaha claims the bike would give the rider 'two engines in one', the low end torque of a twin and the pace of an inline four. As with previous incarnations of the R1, the 2009 model keeps its Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T).\n\nAnother advancement included on the 2009 model was D-Mode Throttle Control Valve Mapping, which allows a rider to choose between three distinct maps depending on the rider's environment. Each mode of operation controls YCC-T characteristics, changing how the R1 reacts to rider input. The first mode is Standard Mode, which delivers performance for a wide variety of driving conditions. The second mode is \"A\" mode which will give a rider more available power in the lower to mid RPM range. The third mode is \"B\" mode, which is a dial back of the previous mode, designed to soften throttle response in inclement weather and heavy traffic. D-Mode throttle control is controlled by the rider through a forward mode button near the throttle. The instrument panel is more comprehensive than previous models, and the 2009/2010 Yamaha YZF-R1 model had a gear indicator as standard.\n\nOverall handling of the R1 was improved through changes to frame and suspension. A new sub frame was designed for the 2009 R1, cast from magnesium giving lower weight aiding mass centralisation. The rear shock absorber on the 2009 offers variable speed damping, as well as an easy to tweak pre-load via a screw adjustment. The rear shock now connects underneath the swing arm through a different linkage; a change from previous years' models. To improve overall handling and safety, Yamaha included an electronic steering damper.\n\nThe front has the same classic R1 shape, though the air intake location and headlamp design have been revamped on the 2009 model; using only projector lamps, and using the new-found design space within the nose cone to reroute ram air tubes next to the lights.\n\nTesting the 2010 model year in the confines of a [[tri-oval]] racetrack, ''[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]]'' magazine reported a {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.02&nbsp;seconds @ {{cvt|144.23|mph}}, and fuel consumption of {{cvt|25|mpgus}}.<ref name=Henning2010/>  ''Motorcycle Consumer News'' reported a tested top speed of {{cvt|176.7|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex/>\n\nIn 2012 the Yamaha YZF-R1 received traction control, redesigned upper cowl (nose of bike), and a special edition 50th Anniversary R1 was released. The special edition color is inspired from Assen TT-winning MotoGP bike.  The special edition commemorates the participation of Yamaha in MotoGP. Only 2000 units of this edition were made.\n\n==2015\u20132020==\n[[File:2015 Yamaha YZF-R1.JPG|thumb|2015 YZF-R1]]\nAt the centennial EICMA motorcycle show, Yamaha officially unveiled a new generation of R1.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eicma.it/en/2014/11/yamaha-r1-2015/|title=Home - Eicma|author=|date=|website=eicma.it}}</ref> It is similar to MotoGP's 2005\u2013Present YZR M1.

This 'stacked gearbox' was followed by other manufacturers. Compacting the engine made the engine much shorter, allowing the wheelbase to be shortened. This allowed the frame design to place the weight of the engine in the frame to aid handling because of an optimized [[center of gravity]]. The swingarm could be made longer without compromising the overall wheelbase, which was a short {{cvt|1385|mm}}. Four 40&nbsp;mm Keihin CV carburetors fed fuel to the engine. It had KYB upside down 41&nbsp;mm front forks and 300&nbsp;mm semi-floating disk brakes. The instrument panel was electrical with a self diagnosis system and digital speed readout. The exhaust system used Yamaha's [[Exhaust Ultimate Power Valve]] (EXUP), which controlled the exhaust gas flow to maximize engine power production at all revs. This created a high powered and high torque engine.  \nThe [[Yamaha YZF-R6]] was introduced in 1999 as the 600 cc version of the R1 super bike.\n\nThe 1999 R1 saw only minor changes, apart from paint and graphics. More improvements were a redesigned gear change linkage and the gear change shaft length being increased. Fuel tank reserve capacity was reduced from {{cvt|5.5|to|4.0|L}}, while the total fuel tank capacity was unchanged at {{cvt|18|l}}.\n\n''[[Motorcycle Consumer News]]'' tests of the 1998 model year YZF-R1 yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.96 seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph}} of 5.93 seconds, a{{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.19 seconds at {{cvt|131.40|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|168|mph}}, with deceleration from {{cvt|60|to|0|mph}} of {{cvt|113.9|ft}}.<ref name=PerfIndex/> For the 1999 model year, ''Cycle World'' tests recorded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 3.0 seconds, {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.31 seconds at {{cvt|139.55|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|170|mph}}.<ref name=Catterson1999/>\n\n==2000\u20132001==\n[[File:Yamaha YZF R1 2001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|2001 YZF-R1]]\n\nIn 2000, Yamaha introduced a series of changes to improve the bike, and minor changes to the bodywork to allow for better long duration ride handling. Yamaha's main design goal was to sharpen the pre-existing bike and not to redesign it. The dry weight was reduced five pounds to {{cvt|414|lb}}.<ref name=\"SRspecs\">{{Citation |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090312021813/http://sportrider.com/tech/146_weights_measurements/index10.html |archivedate=March 12, 2009 |url=http://www.sportrider.com/tech/146_weights_measurements/index10.html |title= Sport Rider: Yamaha Weights and Measurements |magazine= Sport Rider |year=2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt {{cvt|127.8|hp|kW}} at the rear wheel,<ref name=\"SRspecs\"/> top-end output remained the same, but changes to the engine management system were intended to result in a smoother, broader distribution of power. The bodywork was still unmistakably R1, although a few changes were made resulting in a 3% reduction in the [[drag coefficient]]. The headlight housing's profile was sharpened, the side panels were made more aerodynamic and slippery, and the windscreen was reshaped for better rider protection.\n\nThe seating area was also updated. The fuel tank was reshaped, with a more relaxed rear angle and deeper leg recesses to provide for a better rider feel. The seat extended further towards the rear of the tank and the new, steeper, seating position put additional weight on the front end. All of this was aimed at improving weight bias and offering sharper cornering and more stability.\n\nMechanically, the [[carburetor]]s were re-jetted in an effort to improve throttle response, especially in the low end, all the way up to the bike's 11,750&nbsp;rpm [[redline]]. The redesigned camshafts were lightened and used internal oil ways to lubricate journals that, when combined with reduced [[tappet]] clearance, provided less friction and created less engine noise. The gearbox received a taller first gear, a hollow [[chrome moly]] shift shaft with an additional bearing and a completely redesigned shift linkage and foot pedal. These changes were aimed at eliminating problems with the transmission in earlier models, and to help to seamlessly transfer the bike's power to the road.\n\n==2002\u20132003==\n[[File:Yamaha.jpg|thumb|2002 YZF-R1 with aftermarket high-mount exhaust]]\nA new [[fuel injection]] system was introduced for the 2002 year, which worked like a carburetor by employing a CV carburetor slide controlled by vacuum created by the engine. With a similar power output to the 2000-2001 bike, the engine remained largely the same. One notable improvement was the use of new cylinder sleeves of a high silicon content alloy containing magnesium that minimized heat induced distortion, reducing oil consumption. Also in 2002, Yamaha released the newly developed Deltabox frame,<ref>{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Mayhersohn |first=Norman |title=Yamaha FZR |magazine=[[Popular Mechanics]] |page=48 |date=November 1987 }}</ref> which, with its hydro formed construction, reduced the total number of frame welds. These changes improved the frame's rigidity by 30%. The cooling system was redesigned for better performance and compactness. The exhaust system was changed from a 4-into-1 to a new titanium 4-into-2-into-1 design. The rear end of the motorcycle was updated and streamlined with a [[LED]] taillight. This allowed for very clean rear body lines when choosing one of several common after market modifications, such as removal of the turn signal stalks and stock license plate bracket; and replacing them with assorted available replacements that \"hug\" the body or frame. Also, front end lighting was improved in 2002, between the higher definition headlights and also side \"parking\" lights within the twin-headlight panel, giving a more angular appearance. This also gave additional after market possibilities, such as to remove the front turn signals and use these front lights as directional or hazard markers while stopped. For 2003, the only change was fitted hazard warning lights and dipped headlights, which stay on all the time the engine is running.\n\nIn 2002, ''[[Cycle World]]'' reported fuel mileage of {{cvt|38|mpgus}}, a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.9&nbsp;seconds, a {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.32&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|137.60|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|167|mph}}.<ref name=Canet2002/>\n\n==2004\u20132005==\n[[File:Yzf-r1 2004.jpg|thumb|left|2004 YZF-R1]]\nWith the competition advancing, Yamaha made some major changes to the model. This included style updates, like an under seat twin exhaust, and performance upgrades including radial brakes, and, for the first time an R1 [[Ram-air intake]]. Furthermore, the tendency for [[wheelie]]s by earlier productions was reduced by changing the geometry of the frame and weight distribution. The all-new engine was no longer used as a stressed member of the chassis, and had a separate top [[crankcase]] and [[cylinder block]].\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1 Instruments.jpg|thumb|2005 YZF-R1 instrumentation]]\nThe 2004 R1 weighs {{cvt|172|kg}} dry. The conventional front [[brake caliper]]s were replaced by radially mounted calipers, activated by a radial master cylinder. A factory-installed [[steering damper]] was also added this year. Combined with the changes to the frame, this helped to eliminate the tendency of the handlebars to shake violently during rapid acceleration or deceleration on less-than-perfect surfaces, a phenomenon known as a [[speed wobble]] or [[tank slapper]].\n\n''Motorcycle Consumer News'' tests of the 2004 model year YZF-R1S yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 3.04&nbsp;seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph|0}} of 5.42&nbsp;seconds, a quarter-mile time of 9.90&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|144.98|mph}}, and a top speed of {{cvt|179|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex />\n\n[[John McGuinness (motorcycle racer)|John McGuinness]] won the senior race at the [[2005 Isle of Man TT]].\n\n==2006==\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1 2006.jpg|thumb|2006 YZF-R1]]\nThe [[swingarm]] was extended by {{cvt|20|mm}} to reduce acceleration instability. In this year, Yamaha also released a limited edition version in original Yamaha racing colors to celebrate its 50th anniversary. The model (LE/SP) had a Kenny Roberts front and rear custom [[\u00d6hlins]] suspension units developed by the same team as the [[Yamaha YZR-M1|YZR-M1]] MotoGP bike. Custom forged aluminum [[Marchesini]] wheels specifically designed for the LE shaved nearly a pound off the unsprung weight. A back torque-limiting [[slipper clutch]], and an integrated lap timer rounded out the package, making the LE virtually a production racer. Only 500 units were made for the United States with another 500 units for Europe.{{Clear}}\n\n==2007\u20132008==\n[[File:YAMAHA YZF-R1 2007TMS.jpg|thumb|2007-2008 YZF-R1]]\n[[File:Yamaha YZF-R1.jpg|thumb|left|2007 Yamaha YZF-R1 used by [[Noriyuki Haga]] in the [[Superbike World Championship]].]]\nAn all-new YZF-R1 for the 2007 model year was announced on 8 October 2006. It had an all-new inline four-cylinder engine, going back to a more conventional four-valves per cylinder, rather than Yamaha's trade mark five-valve Genesis layout. It also had the Yamaha Chip Control Intake (YCC-I) electronic variable-length [[Velocity stack|intake funnel]] system, Yamaha Chip Control Throttle (YCC-T) [[fly-by-wire]] throttle system, [[slipper-type clutch]], all-new aluminum Deltabox frame and swingarm, six-piston radial-mount front brake calipers with 310&nbsp;mm discs, a wider radiator, and M1 styling on the new large [[ram-air]] ports in the front fairing. There were no major changes for 2008. Power at the rear wheel was {{cvt|156.7|hp}} @ 10,160&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=CW09-2008/>\n\nMotorcycle Consumer News tests of the 2007 model year YZF-R1 yielded a {{cvt|0|to|60|mph}} time of 2.94&nbsp;seconds and {{cvt|0|to|100|mph|0}} of 5.46&nbsp;seconds, a \u00bc mile time of 9.88&nbsp;seconds at {{cvt|145.50|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex />\n\n==2009\u20132014==\n[[File:2009 Yamaha YZF-R1.jpg|thumb|2009 YZF-R1 Limited Launch Edition]]\n[[File:R1 Yamaha 2011 model.jpg|thumb|2011 YZF-R1]]\nIn late 2008, Yamaha announced they would release an all new R1 for 2009. The new R1 takes engine technology from the M1 MotoGP bike with its [[Crossplane|cross plane crankshaft]]. Crossplane technology puts each connecting rod 90\u00b0 from the next, with an uneven firing interval of 270\u00b0- 180\u00b0- 90\u00b0- 180\u00b0. The 2009 R1 was the first production sportbike to use a crossplane crankshaft.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.roadracingworld.com/news/article/?article=34083|title=2009 Yamaha YZF-R1 Features Uneven Firing Order For Improved Power Delivery|publisher=Yamaha press release via Road Racing World|year=2008|accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref> The power delivery is the same as a 90\u00b0 V4 with a 180\u00b0 crank, such as the [[Honda VFR800]] and very similar to the [[Yamaha V-Max]] which has been lauded for its exhaust sound.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/2009-star-motorcycles-vmax-full-review-86751.html|title=2009 Star V-Max Review/Test|publisher=Motorcycle.com|date=August 26, 2008|accessdate=2010-04-20| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100501152056/http://www.motorcycle.com/manufacturer/2009-star-motorcycles-vmax-full-review-86751.html| archivedate= 1 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> Yamaha claims the bike would give the rider 'two engines in one', the low end torque of a twin and the pace of an inline four. As with previous incarnations of the R1, the 2009 model keeps its Yamaha Chip Controlled Throttle (YCC-T).\n\nAnother advancement included on the 2009 model was D-Mode Throttle Control Valve Mapping, which allows a rider to choose between three distinct maps depending on the rider\u2019s environment. Each mode of operation controls YCC-T characteristics, changing how the R1 reacts to rider input. The first mode is Standard Mode, which delivers performance for a wide variety of driving conditions. The second mode is \"A\" mode which will give a rider more available power in the lower to mid RPM range. The third mode is \"B\" mode, which is a dial back of the previous mode, designed to soften throttle response in inclement weather and heavy traffic. D-Mode throttle control is controlled by the rider through a forward mode button near the throttle. The instrument panel is more comprehensive than previous models, and the 2009/2010 Yamaha YZF-R1 model had a gear indicator as standard.\n\nOverall handling of the R1 was improved through changes to frame and suspension. A new sub frame was designed for the 2009 R1, cast from magnesium giving lower weight aiding mass centralisation. The rear shock absorber on the 2009 offers variable speed damping, as well as an easy to tweak pre-load via a screw adjustment. The rear shock now connects underneath the swing arm through a different linkage; a change from previous years' models. To improve overall handling and safety, Yamaha included an electronic steering damper.\n\nThe front has the same classic R1 shape, though the air intake location and headlamp design have been revamped on the 2009 model; using only projector lamps, and using the new-found design space within the nose cone to reroute ram air tubes next to the lights.\n\nTesting the 2010 model year in the confines of a [[tri-oval]] racetrack, ''[[Motorcyclist (magazine)|Motorcyclist]]'' magazine reported a {{cvt|0|to|1/4|mi}} time of 10.02&nbsp;seconds @ {{cvt|144.23|mph}}, and fuel consumption of {{cvt|25|mpgus}}.<ref name=Henning2010/>  ''Motorcycle Consumer News'' reported a tested top speed of {{cvt|176.7|mph}}.<ref name=PerfIndex/>\n\nIn 2012 the Yamaha YZF-R1 received traction control, redesigned upper cowl (nose of bike), and a special edition 50th Anniversary R1 was released. The special edition color is inspired from Assen TT-winning MotoGP bike.  The special edition commemorates the participation of Yamaha in MotoGP.
