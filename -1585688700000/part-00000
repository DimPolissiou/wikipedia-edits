None of the Vickers hovercraft designs reached quantity production, manufacturing efforts being centered upon Saunders-Roe's existing portfolio. Perhaps the most high-profile vehicle produced by BHC was the large [[SR.N4]] ''Mountbatten'' class hovercraft; it was the largest civil-orientated hovercraft to ever be put into service; several were completed and used in revenue services across the [[English Channel]] for multiple decades.\n\nLater on, the BHC developed their own newer hovercraft designs, such as the military-oriented [[British Hovercraft Corporation BH.7|BH.7]] ''Wellington'' class and the medium-size diesel-powered [[British Hovercraft Corporation AP1-88]]. These vehicles made advances in the efficiency and viability of hovercraft; the AP1-88 was produced in quantity not only by BHC but also [[Licensed production|under licence]] in both [[Australia]] and [[China]]. In 1970, Westland Aircraft acquired the shares from the other firm's owners, making the BHC a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westland. During the 1980s, the firm's focus on hovercraft declined as it became increasingly involved in the manufacture of [[composite material|composites]] for other company's products. In 1984, the company was renamed ''Westland Aerospace''.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hovercraft in Dover.jpg|thumb|[[SR.N4]] ''Princess Margaret'' at the mouth of the [[Port of Dover|Western Docks in Dover]], 1998]]\n\nDuring the late 1950s and early 1960s, British inventor [[Christopher Cockerell|Sir Christopher Cockerell]] had, in cooperation with British aerospace manufacturer [[Saunders-Roe]], developed a pioneering new form of transportation, embodied in the form of the experimental [[SR.N1]] vehicle, which became widely known as the [[hovercraft]].<ref name = \"pay sym 72\">Paine and Syms 2012, p. 82.</ref> British manufacturer Saunders-Roe proceeded with work on various hovercraft designs, successfully developing multiple commercially viable vehicles. These included the [[SR.N4]], a large cross-[[English Channel|Channel]] [[ferry]] capable of seating up to 418 passengers along with 60 cars, and the [[SR.N5]], the first commercially-active hovercraft.<ref name = \"pay sym 238 595\">Paine and Syms 2012, pp. 238, 595.</ref>\n\nBritish Hovercraft Corporation (BHC) emerged as a corporate entity in March 1966, at which point the [[Saunders-Roe]] division of [[Westland Aircraft]] and [[Vickers Supermarine]] (the two largest hovercraft manufacturers in the world) were merged.<ref name = \"parl 1969\"/> Following the merger, Westland Aircraft held 65% of the shares in BHC, while Vickers had a 25% stake in the venture and the British state-owned [[National Research Development Corporation]] also held 10% of the shares.{{CN|date=February 2020}} Despite the inclusion of Vickers' hovercraft venture, none of its designs were ever taken through to the manufacturing stage; instead, production activity was centred on the existing designs produced by Saunders-Roe, including the [[SR.N5]] ''Warden'' class, the stretched [[SR.N6]] ''Winchester'' class, and the large [[SR.N4]] ''Mountbatten'' class hovercraft.\n\nSubstantial support for the hovercraft industry, and BHC specifically, was sourced directly from the British Government. By 1969, contributions from the British state averaged around \u00a33 million per year; of this, roughly one-third was attributed to research and development contracts, while the remaining two-thirds was divided between financing the [[Joint Services Military Trials Unit]] based at [[Lee-on-Solent]] and the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]]'s [[Hythe, Hampshire|Hythe]] division.<ref name = \"parl 1969\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1967-01-24/debates/512740f9-8426-490e-bf96-e48663e928ec/Hovercraft(ResearchAndDevelopment) |title = Hovercraft (Research And Development) |publisher = [[Hansard]] |date = 24 January 1967}}</ref> In addition to financing, the British Government was also keen to implement a regulatory framework for the hovercraft sector, including the implementation of safety certification, leading to the Hovercraft Act of 1968.<ref name = \"parl 1969\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/acts/hovercraft-act-1968 |title = Hovercraft Act 1968 |publisher = Hansard |date = 26 July 1968}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all commitments made by the British government would be ultimately be fulfilled.

and symptoms ==\nOveractive bladder is characterized by a group of four symptoms: urgency, urinary frequency, nocturia, and urge incontinence.  Urge incontinence is not present in the \"dry\" classification.\n\n[[Urinary urgency|Urgency]] is considered the hallmark symptom of OAB, but there are no clear criteria for what constitutes urgency and studies often use other criteria.<ref name=AUA2014/>  Urgency is currently defined by the International Continence Society (ICS), as of 2002, as \"Sudden, compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer.\"  The previous definition was \"Strong desire to void accompanied by fear of leakage or pain.\"<ref name = \"Can Urol 2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wein A | title = Symptom-based diagnosis of overactive bladder: an overview | journal = Canadian Urological Association Journal | volume = 5 | issue = 5 Suppl 2 | pages = S135\u20136 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21989525 | pmc = 3193392 | doi = 10.5489/cuaj.11183 }}</ref>  The definition does not address the immediacy of the urge to void and has been criticized as subjective.<ref name = \"Can Urol 2011\" />\n\n[[Frequent urination|Urinary frequency]] is considered abnormal if the person urinates more than eight times in a day.  This frequency is usually monitored by having the person keep a voiding diary where they record urination episodes.<ref name=AUA2014/> The number of episodes varies depending on sleep, fluid intake, medications, and up to seven is considered normal if consistent with the other factors.\n\n[[Nocturia]] is a symptom where the person complains of interrupted sleep because of an urge to void and, like the urinary frequency component, is affected by similar lifestyle and medical factors.  Individual waking events are not considered abnormal, one study in Finland established two or more voids per night as affecting quality of life.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tikkinen KA, Johnson TM, Tammela TL, Sintonen H, Haukka J, Huhtala H, Auvinen A | title = Nocturia frequency, bother, and quality of life: how often is too often?

Like frequency, the person can track incontinence in a diary to assist with diagnosis and management of symptoms.  Urge incontinence can also be measured with pad tests, and these are often used for research purposes.  Some people with urge incontinence also have [[stress incontinence]] and this can complicate clinical studies.<ref name=AUA2014/>\n\nIt is important that the clinician and the person with overactive bladder both reach a consensus on the term, 'urgency.' Some common phrases used to describe OAB include, 'When I've got to go, I've got to go,' or 'When I have to go, I have to rush, because I think I will wet myself.' Hence the term, 'fear of leakage,' is an important concept to people.<ref>Campbell-Walsh Urology, Tenth Edition, Chapter 66, Page 1948</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nThe cause of OAB is unclear, and indeed there may be multiple causes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacco E | title = [Physiopathology of overactive bladder syndrome] | journal = Urologia | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 24\u201335 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22287269 | doi = 10.5301/RU.2012.8972 }}</ref> It is often associated with overactivity of the [[detrusor urinae muscle]], a pattern of bladder muscle contraction observed during [[Urodynamic testing|urodynamics]].<ref name=\"Treatment\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sussman DO | title = Overactive bladder: treatment options in primary care medicine | journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association | volume = 107 | issue = 9 | pages = 379\u201385 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17908830 }}</ref> It is also possible that the increased contractile nature originates from within the urothelium and lamina propria, and abnormal contractions in this tissue could stimulate dysfunction in the detrusor or whole bladder.<ref name=\"Moro et al. 2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moro C, Uchiyama J, Chess-Williams R | title = Urothelial/lamina propria spontaneous activity and the role of M3 muscarinic receptors in mediating rate responses to stretch and carbachol | journal = Urology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1442.e9\u201315 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22001099 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2011.08.039 | url = http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1373&context=hsm_pubs }}</ref>\n\n===Catheter-related irritation===\nIf bladder spasms occur or there is no urine in the drainage bag when a [[catheter]] is in place, the catheter may be blocked by blood, thick sediment, or a kink in the catheter or drainage tubing. Sometimes spasms are caused by the catheter irritating the bladder, [[prostate]] or [[penis]]. Such spasms can be controlled with medication such as [[butylscopolamine]], although most people eventually adjust to the irritation and the spasms go away.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003981.htm |title=Urinary catheters |publisher=MedlinePlus, the National Institutes of Health's Web site |date=2010-03-09 |access-date=2010-12-01 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204093143/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003981.htm |archive-date=2010-12-04 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis of OAB is made primarily on the person's signs and symptoms and by ruling out other possible causes such as an infection.<ref name=AUA2014/> [[Urodynamics]], a [[cystoscopy|bladder scope]], and ultrasound are generally not needed.<ref name=AUA2014/><ref name=\"AUSFive\">{{Citation |author1 = American Urogynecologic Society |author1-link = American Urogynecologic Society |date = May 5, 2015 |title = Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question |publisher = American Urogynecologic Society |work = [[Choosing Wisely]]: an initiative of the [[ABIM Foundation]] |url = http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-urogynecologic-society/ |access-date = June 1, 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150602021428/http://www.choosingwisely.org/societies/american-urogynecologic-society/ |archive-date = June 2, 2015 }}</ref> Additionally, urine culture may be done to rule out infection.

This method is aimed at improving the person's control over the time, place and frequency of urination.\n\nTimed voiding programs involve establishing a schedule for urination. To do this, a person fills in a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns that appear in the chart, the person can plan to empty his or her bladder before he or she would otherwise leak. Some individuals find it helpful to use a vibrating reminder watch to help them remember to use the bathroom.

and symptoms ==\nOveractive bladder is characterized by a group of four symptoms: urgency, urinary frequency, nocturia, and urge incontinence.

Like frequency, the person can track incontinence in a diary to assist with diagnosis and management of symptoms.  Urge incontinence can also be measured with pad tests, and these are often used for research purposes.  Some people with urge incontinence also have [[stress incontinence]] and this can complicate clinical studies.<ref name=AUA2014/>\n\nIt is important that the clinician and the person with overactive bladder both reach a consensus on the term, 'urgency.' Some common phrases used to describe OAB include, 'When I've got to go, I've got to go,' or 'When I have to go, I have to rush, because I think I will wet myself.' Hence the term, 'fear of leakage,' is an important concept to people.<ref>Campbell-Walsh Urology, Tenth Edition, Chapter 66, Page 1948</ref>\n\n==Causes==\nThe cause of OAB is unclear, and indeed there may be multiple causes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sacco E | title = [Physiopathology of overactive bladder syndrome] | journal = Urologia | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 24\u201335 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22287269 | doi = 10.5301/RU.2012.8972 }}</ref> It is often associated with overactivity of the [[detrusor urinae muscle]], a pattern of bladder muscle contraction observed during [[Urodynamic testing|urodynamics]].<ref name=\"Treatment\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sussman DO | title = Overactive bladder: treatment options in primary care medicine | journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association | volume = 107 | issue = 9 | pages = 379\u201385 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17908830 }}</ref> It is also possible that the increased contractile nature originates from within the urothelium and lamina propria, and abnormal contractions in this tissue could stimulate dysfunction in the detrusor or whole bladder.<ref name=\"Moro et al. 2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moro C, Uchiyama J, Chess-Williams R | title = Urothelial/lamina propria spontaneous activity and the role of M3 muscarinic receptors in mediating rate responses to stretch and carbachol | journal = Urology | volume = 78 | issue = 6 | pages = 1442.e9\u201315 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22001099 | doi = 10.1016/j.urology.2011.08.039 | url = http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1373&context=hsm_pubs }}</ref>\n\n===Catheter-related irritation===\nIf bladder spasms occur or there is no urine in the drainage bag when a [[catheter]] is in place, the catheter may be blocked by blood, thick sediment, or a kink in the catheter or drainage tubing.

This method is aimed at improving the person's control over the time, place and frequency of urination.\n\nTimed voiding programs involve establishing a schedule for urination. To do this, a person fills in a chart of voiding and leaking. From the patterns that appear in the chart, the person can plan to empty his or her bladder before he or she would otherwise leak.

He served as the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. R\u00fcstem Pasha is also known as Damat R\u00fcstem Pasha (the epithet ''[[damat]]'' meaning \"son-in-law\" to the [[Ottoman dynasty]]) as a result of his marriage to the sultan's daughter, [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. He is known as one of the most influential and successful grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nRustem Pasha was taken as a child to [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), where he built a military and bureaucracy career. He was very well educated. On 26 November 1539, he married Mihrimah Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife [[Hurrem Sultan]]. His brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] was an Ottoman grand admiral.\n\n==Early life==\nOttoman sources speak about Rustem as a [[Croat]] or [[Albanians|Albanian]]. He is referred to as a Serbian by Turkey's historiographer [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]  . Rustem is referred to as a Croat by Tayib  Osman-zade Ahmed, writer of the work \"Hadikatul vuzara\" and the Turkish encyclopedia Kamus-ul-alam.<ref> \nHamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107, Veliki vezir Rustem-pa\u0161a, ZNAKOVI VREMENA \u2022 SARAJEVO \u2022  2018 http://www.ibn-sina.net/images/pdf/znakovi/82/45_Hamdija_Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87___znakovi_82.pdf #page=47</ref>\nR\u00fcstem owes his career to the support of [[Hurrem Sultan]], he was extremely ambitious. [[Rustem Pasha]] was a man of very humble origins. He came as a child to Constantinople where he studied at [[Enderun]], an institute for the education/indoctrination of talented boys stolen from christian parents in the Balkans. At the end, the graduates were able to speak, read and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in [[science]], [[finance]] and excel in army command as well as in [[close combat]] skills. That was the perfect start for a career in the [[military]] and bureaucracy. In 1526, R\u00fcstem took part in the [[Battle of Mohacs]] as [[silahdar]] (weapon bearer in a cavalry division). Silahdars were an elite division of the [[Ottoman army]]. Members of this division could also become ordinary soldiers (non-aristocrat), if they proved to be extraordinarily courageous and loyal. \n\nA few years later R\u00fcstem advanced to [[mirahur-i evvel]] aga (chief supervisor of the sultan's stables) and [[rikab-dar]] (the [[stirrup holder]] when the ruler got on the horse). The [[mirahur]] accompanied the Sultan during his travels, so the Sultan knew R\u00fcstem a long time before he appointed him, possibly inspired by Hurrem, the tutor of his sons. In making this decision, he was surely influenced by R\u00fcstem's character. Most historical sources describe R\u00fcstem as a reasonable and calm man with a keen intellect, who always keeps a cool head, and who is always unconditionally devoted to his ruler. These characteristics reflected R\u00fcstem's faith, and brought R\u00fcstem, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and the famous jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi]] (Mehmed Ebussuud Efendi), permanently closer together. R\u00fcstem was a Sunni and preferred the spiritual order of Sunni Islam Sufism Naqshbandi.\n\n==Wealth and legacy==\n[[File:Rustem Pasha Mosque.JPG|thumb|175px|right]]\nAs Grand Vizier, he collected vast wealth. Even R\u00fcstem's sworn opponents admitted, that he never boasted of his wealth or power (although he was a man of fortune), and that he was the very first Grand Vizier in the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who significantly contributed to the development of the state from his own funds. According to most period testimonies (excluding Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's \"[[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] Mersiyesi\"), R\u00fcstem was considered one of the few state dignitaries who didn't take bribes. Nonetheless, R\u00fcstem's famous economic talent and his modest way of life, both highly valued by the Sultan, made him rich, even before his marriage to [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. In his last will (a part of endowment charter from 1561), R\u00fcstem made an inventory of every single detail of his property, in order to secure his great foundation projects after his death. R\u00fcstem's testament determines exactly which part of his property belongs to the state, to his foundations, to the [[Hurrem Sultan]]'s foundation and to Mihrimah's foundations, what he leaves to his wife Mihrimah and to their daughter [[Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]. He determines his wife Mihrimah Sultan as executor of his last will and his daughter Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah as the executor and administrator of his foundations.\n\nAll historians emphasize [[R\u00fcstem]]'s relentless hard work to consolidate the troubled economy of the Ottoman Empire - impoverished by excessive spending on wars and a lavish lifestyle of the court - and his efforts to improve it. The period documents say that he also generously financed this upswing from his own resources. On his lands were built toll free bridges, roads, covered bazaars, granaries, baths, hospices, caravanserais, convents, schools and various other establishments for the public benefit. Their funding was largely secured by the leasing of R\u00fcstem's estates. He supported agriculture, founded new trading centers, like the bazaar in Sarajevo or silk factories in [[Bursa]] and [[Istanbul]], social and educational institutions. He developed the domestic economy by encouraging major public works projects and built a modern infrastructure: trade routes, and water networks in Istanbul, [[Mecca]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nHe also found enough money in the treasury to make Suleiman's dream come true ([[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], 1550\u201357), as well as to fund other monumental architectural projects realized by the legendary [[Mimar Sinan]]. To reduce protectionism in the state administration, an official installment fee was introduced, and confiscated when the officials misused his authority. R\u00fcstem's reform of the military remained unfinished. At the time of his death in Constantinople on 10 July 1561, his personal property included 815 lands in Rumelia and Anatolia, 476 mills, 1700 slaves, 2,900 war horses, 1,106 camels, 800 gold ambroidery Holy Qur'ans, 500 books, 5000 Caftan, 130 kinds of armors, 860 gold embroidered swords, 1500 silver tolga, 1000 silver balls, 33 precious jewels etc.\n\nThe [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]] (Turkish: R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa Camii) is an Ottoman mosque located in Has\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131 (Strawmat Weavers Market) in Fatih, Turkey, which was designed by Ottoman imperial architect [[Mimar Sinan]] for Grand Vizier R\u00fcstem Pasha. It was built between 1561 and 1563.\n\n==Political career==\nAt first, R\u00fcstem Pasha was a [[Sanjak-bey|sanjak bey]]. After the death of [[Pargali Ibrahim Pasha]] his way became very easy. He was promoted to Baylerbey of the [[Diyarbakir]]. When he married [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]], Rustem was already a vizier. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] made Rustem the grand vizier for the first time in 1544. But in 1553, Rustem was dismissed from his position. After two years he took this position again from 1555 until his death in 1561.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LE9QAAAAMAAJ&q=Rustem+pasa+power&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIQTAF|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|last=Necipo\u011flu|first=G\u00fclru|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|isbn=9780262140508|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a diplomat, R\u00fcstem initiated many trade agreements with European countries and India. His biggest success in the diplomatic area, was the agreement with the King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which confirmed, without firing a shot, the western border of the Ottoman Empire for more than 14 years (signed in 1547). Ferdinand renounced his claim to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and agreed to pay a tax of 30,000 gold ducats per year into the Ottoman treasury. The ambassador of the Emperor Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq wrote that Charles had tried on several occasions to revise the unfavourable agreement, but R\u00fcstem had always prevented it. R\u00fcstem also worked on the agreement with the [[Safavids]] (signed 1554), which ended the long-standing Ottoman-Safavid wars, and secured the eastern borders of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSuleiman was manipulated by Hurrem's intrigues when he murdered Ibrahim and replaced him with his son-in-law, R\u00fcstem Pasha. R\u00fcstem was not Suleiman's son-in-law when Ibrahim Pasha was executed. The background of Ibrahim's execution was much more complicated (e.g. he used the seal \"Sultan Ibrahim\", retained the majority of the confiscated property of Suleiman's \"minister of finance\" [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], whose execution he ordered etc.). Ibrahim was replaced with [[Ayas Mehmed Pasha]], followed by [[L\u00fctfi Pasha]] and [[Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha]]. R\u00fcstem's career developed, unlike Ibrahim, exactly according to the rules. He became Grand Vizier eight years after Ibrahim's death.\n\nLater Hurrem and R\u00fcstem conspired against [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] for many years. The very ambitious Mustafa received foreign ambassadors as well as Ottoman commanders many times, without his father's knowledge, and was regarded by them as an important ally against Suleiman. So the Austrian ambassador Ghislain de Busbecq (visiting Mustafa before S\u00fcleyman), informed his ruler: \"Mustafa will be an excellent sultan, receptive and open to talks.\" And the Papal ambassador Navagero said: \"Mustafa lives with his mother. She says that people adore him.\" Understanding the danger of the situation, Suleiman remembered his father Selim dethroning his grandfather Bayezid (who was killed only a month after his abdication in 1512). Officers loyal to him advised that a part of the army is getting ready to put Mustafa on the throne. In 1552, while preparing a campaign against Persia, Suleiman appointed R\u00fcstem \"Serasker\" (commander-in-chief) of the campaign. But soldiers assembled in the military camp in Karaman (Anatolia), rejected Suleiman's appointment, and insisted R\u00fcstem should be replaced with Mustafa (the same problem was faced by R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]], as admiral of the Ottoman fleet during the Tripolis siege, even though he achieved many victories until his death in 1553).\n\nThe destabilization continued. Mustafa's so-often cited correspondence with the [[Safavid]]s signed \"Sultan Mustafa\" (kept today in archives), was, in this context, probably not so relevant. It could be authentic, it could be a Safavids' or a Hurrem-R\u00fcstem deception, or maybe Suleiman's safeguard to calm public opinion after Mustafa's death. There are various versions of reports on Mustafa's end in the Ere\u011fli valley. According to one of them, R\u00fcstem Pasha made an offer to Mustafa to join his father's army and at the same time he warned Suleiman that Mustafa was coming to kill him. According to another version, it was Suleiman himself who summoned his son to Ere\u011fli, and Mustafa came, \"confident that the army would protect him\".\n\nOnly R\u00fcstem appears in all the versions as the antagonist. However, it is not surprising, as they are all based on Mustafa's PR chief consultant [[Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey]]'s elegy, \"\u015eehzade Mustafa Mersiyesi\". Even the report of the Austrian ambassador de Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, had the same origin. R\u00fcstem, suspended and banished, was fair game as an object of violence. No one dared to criticize the Sultan himself. Suleiman probably realized this, and called R\u00fcstem back two years later.\n\nR\u00fcstem's scapegoating as the seemingly dominant figure of the \"conspiracy against Mustafa\", radically changed public opinion. And so the R\u00fcstem extolled years ago as the \"pillar of the Ottoman empire\", brilliant economist and sophisticated statesman, was forgotten, as well as his great projects and charitable foundations. He became R\u00fcstem the \"black heart, the murderer of the loved Prince Mustafa\". Nothing was enough to make him dirty: his \"dirty\" origin, the imputation of bribery, the story with the louse... Some foreign ambassadors like Ghiselin de Busbecq or Bernardo Navagero, repeated it spitefully in their reports (all the more that R\u00fcstem was as a diplomat an invincible opponent, the agreement from 1547 must not be forgotten). Unlike them, Jean Chesneau, the secretary of the French ambassador, wrote about him: \"The grand vizier is a man of humble origin, who, thanks to his talent and will, worked his way up from nothing. He is an agreeable companion, engaging your interest with his acute faculty of judgment, an insightful way of thinking and magnanimous manners. During the negotiations, he is calm and dispassionate, although in his views determined.\" \n\nTa\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's elegy, the reports of ambassadors, administrative dossiers, foundation charters and some private documents like Hurrem's and Mihrimah's plea to Suleiman when R\u00fcstem was expelled to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, are the only period sources reporting on R\u00fcstem's life. They were also the basis of the often cited \u0130br\u0101h\u012bm Pe\u00e7ev\u012b's work \"T\u0101r\u012b\u1e2b-i Pe\u00e7ev\u012b\", published 80 years after R\u00fcstem's death.\n\n==Relationship with Mihrimah==\n[[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]] was married off to the governor of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] R\u00fcstem in 1539.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/03/11/notable-life-of-mihrimah-sultan|title=Notable life of Mihrimah Sultan|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> After his marriage, he was nominated to the vizierate in November 1544.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf3h3Z1YQtIC&pg=PA88&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Rustem&f=false|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|last=Casale|first=Giancarlo|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199798797|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the union was unhappy, Mihrimah flourished as a patroness of the arts and continued her travels with her father until her husband's death. This marriage had, like many dynastic unions, a political character. Hurrem's role was probably important. Nonetheless, according to the rules, it was a decision of the father. R\u00fcstem was at that time already a wealthy man and had, since 1538, a splendid career as Governor of Anatolya, one of the two most important administrative regions in the Ottoman Empire. This post was considered to be a preliminary stage to Grand Vizier. Mihrimah knew R\u00fcstem for a very long time as the mentor of her brothers and the adviser of her father.\n \nAfter his death Mihrimah accomplished his work, as well as the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque (1561\u201363), one of [[Mimar Sinan]]'s most impressive projects. R\u00fcstem supported Mihrimah's charitable foundations, for example, the Mihrimah Sultan \u0130skele Camii ([[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar]], 1540\u201348; a known [[k\u00fclliye]] in Istanbul, [[Mimar Sinan]] project). R\u00fcstem was also Mihrimah's mentor, particularly concerning political and financial decisions. His last will from 1561, provides evidence of his confidence in his wife. R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] (who died in December 1553, a turbulent year for the family), was later buried in Mihrimah Sultan Complex in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, as well as the two sons of R\u00fcstem and Mihrimah. The daughter, Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan (1542\u20131594), was married in 1561 to [[Semiz Ali Pasha]] (R\u00fcstem's successor as Grand Vizier).\n\n==Death==\nR\u00fcstem Pasha died after a long illness, on 10 July 1561 of [[hydrocephalus]]. He was buried in the wonderful [[Sehzade Mosque]], dedicated to Suleiman's favourite son [[Sehzade Mehmed]] (1520-1543), because his dream project, the [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]], was not yet built.

He served as the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|grand vizier]] of sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. R\u00fcstem Pasha is also known as Damat R\u00fcstem Pasha (the epithet ''[[damat]]'' meaning \"son-in-law\" to the [[Ottoman dynasty]]) as a result of his marriage to the sultan's daughter, [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. He is known as one of the most influential and successful grand viziers of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nRustem Pasha was taken as a child to [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]), where he built a military and bureaucracy career. He was very well educated. On 26 November 1539, he married Mihrimah Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Suleiman I and his wife [[Hurrem Sultan]]. His brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] was an Ottoman grand admiral.\n\n==Early life==\nOttoman sources speak about Rustem as a [[Croat]] or [[Albanians|Albanian]]. He is referred to as a Serbian by Turkey's historiographer [[Mustafa \u00c2l\u00ee]]  . Rustem is referred to as a Croat by Tayib  Osman-zade Ahmed, writer of the work \"Hadikatul vuzara\" and the Turkish encyclopedia Kamus-ul-alam.<ref> \nHamdija Kre\u0161evljakovi\u0107, Veliki vezir Rustem-pa\u0161a, ZNAKOVI VREMENA \u2022 SARAJEVO \u2022  2018 http://www.ibn-sina.net/images/pdf/znakovi/82/45_Hamdija_Kre%C5%A1evljakovi%C4%87___znakovi_82.pdf #page=47</ref>\nR\u00fcstem owes his career to the support of [[Hurrem Sultan]], he was extremely ambitious. [[Rustem Pasha]] was a man of very humble origins. He came as a child to Constantinople where he studied at [[Enderun]], an institute for the education/indoctrination of talented boys stolen from christian parents in the Balkans. At the end, the graduates were able to speak, read and write at least three languages, able to understand the latest developments in [[science]], [[finance]] and excel in army command as well as in [[close combat]] skills. That was the perfect start for a career in the [[military]] and bureaucracy. In 1526, R\u00fcstem took part in the [[Battle of Mohacs]] as [[silahdar]] (weapon bearer in a cavalry division). Silahdars were an elite division of the [[Ottoman army]]. Members of this division could also become ordinary soldiers (non-aristocrat), if they proved to be extraordinarily courageous and loyal. \n\nA few years later R\u00fcstem advanced to [[mirahur-i evvel]] aga (chief supervisor of the sultan's stables) and [[rikab-dar]] (the [[stirrup holder]] when the ruler got on the horse). The [[mirahur]] accompanied the Sultan during his travels, so the Sultan knew R\u00fcstem a long time before he appointed him, possibly inspired by Hurrem, the tutor of his sons. In making this decision, he was surely influenced by R\u00fcstem's character. Most historical sources describe R\u00fcstem as a reasonable and calm man with a keen intellect, who always keeps a cool head, and who is always unconditionally devoted to his ruler. These characteristics reflected R\u00fcstem's faith, and brought R\u00fcstem, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], and the famous jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi]] (Mehmed Ebussuud Efendi), permanently closer together. R\u00fcstem was a Sunni and preferred the spiritual order of Sunni Islam Sufism Naqshbandi.\n\n==Wealth and legacy==\n[[File:Rustem Pasha Mosque.JPG|thumb|175px|right]]\nAs Grand Vizier, he collected vast wealth. Even R\u00fcstem's sworn opponents admitted, that he never boasted of his wealth or power (although he was a man of fortune), and that he was the very first Grand Vizier in the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]] who significantly contributed to the development of the state from his own funds. According to most period testimonies (excluding Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's \"[[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] Mersiyesi\"), R\u00fcstem was considered one of the few state dignitaries who didn't take bribes. Nonetheless, R\u00fcstem's famous economic talent and his modest way of life, both highly valued by the Sultan, made him rich, even before his marriage to [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]]. In his last will (a part of endowment charter from 1561), R\u00fcstem made an inventory of every single detail of his property, in order to secure his great foundation projects after his death. R\u00fcstem's testament determines exactly which part of his property belongs to the state, to his foundations, to the [[Hurrem Sultan]]'s foundation and to Mihrimah's foundations, what he leaves to his wife Mihrimah and to their daughter [[Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan]]. He determines his wife Mihrimah Sultan as executor of his last will and his daughter Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah as the executor and administrator of his foundations.\n\nAll historians emphasize [[R\u00fcstem]]'s relentless hard work to consolidate the troubled economy of the Ottoman Empire - impoverished by excessive spending on wars and a lavish lifestyle of the court - and his efforts to improve it. The period documents say that he also generously financed this upswing from his own resources. On his lands were built toll free bridges, roads, covered bazaars, granaries, baths, hospices, caravanserais, convents, schools and various other establishments for the public benefit. Their funding was largely secured by the leasing of R\u00fcstem's estates. He supported agriculture, founded new trading centers, like the bazaar in Sarajevo or silk factories in [[Bursa]] and [[Istanbul]], social and educational institutions. He developed the domestic economy by encouraging major public works projects and built a modern infrastructure: trade routes, and water networks in Istanbul, [[Mecca]] and [[Jerusalem]].\n\nHe also found enough money in the treasury to make Suleiman's dream come true ([[S\u00fcleymaniye Mosque]], 1550\u201357), as well as to fund other monumental architectural projects realized by the legendary [[Mimar Sinan]]. To reduce protectionism in the state administration, an official installment fee was introduced, and confiscated when the officials misused his authority. R\u00fcstem's reform of the military remained unfinished. At the time of his death in Constantinople on 10 July 1561, his personal property included 815 lands in Rumelia and Anatolia, 476 mills, 1700 slaves, 2,900 war horses, 1,106 camels, 800 gold ambroidery Holy Qur'ans, 500 books, 5000 Caftan, 130 kinds of armors, 860 gold embroidered swords, 1500 silver tolga, 1000 silver balls, 33 precious jewels etc.\n\nThe [[R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque]] (Turkish: R\u00fcstem Pa\u015fa Camii) is an Ottoman mosque located in Has\u0131rc\u0131lar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131 (Strawmat Weavers Market) in Fatih, Turkey, which was designed by Ottoman imperial architect [[Mimar Sinan]] for Grand Vizier R\u00fcstem Pasha. It was built between 1561 and 1563.\n\n==Political career==\nAt first, R\u00fcstem Pasha was a [[Sanjak-bey|sanjak bey]]. After the death of [[Pargali Ibrahim Pasha]] his way became very easy. He was promoted to Baylerbey of the [[Diyarbakir]]. When he married [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]], Rustem was already a vizier. [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] made Rustem the grand vizier for the first time in 1544. But in 1553, Rustem was dismissed from his position. After two years he took this position again from 1555 until his death in 1561.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LE9QAAAAMAAJ&q=Rustem+pasa+power&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIQTAF|title=Architecture, Ceremonial, and Power: The Topkapi Palace in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries|last=Necipo\u011flu|first=G\u00fclru|date=1991|publisher=Architectural History Foundation|isbn=9780262140508|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAs a diplomat, R\u00fcstem initiated many trade agreements with European countries and India. His biggest success in the diplomatic area, was the agreement with the King [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which confirmed, without firing a shot, the western border of the Ottoman Empire for more than 14 years (signed in 1547). Ferdinand renounced his claim to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1526\u20131867)|Kingdom of Hungary]] and agreed to pay a tax of 30,000 gold ducats per year into the Ottoman treasury. The ambassador of the Emperor Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq wrote that Charles had tried on several occasions to revise the unfavourable agreement, but R\u00fcstem had always prevented it. R\u00fcstem also worked on the agreement with the [[Safavids]] (signed 1554), which ended the long-standing Ottoman-Safavid wars, and secured the eastern borders of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSuleiman was manipulated by Hurrem's intrigues when he murdered Ibrahim and replaced him with his son-in-law, R\u00fcstem Pasha. R\u00fcstem was not Suleiman's son-in-law when Ibrahim Pasha was executed. The background of Ibrahim's execution was much more complicated (e.g. he used the seal \"Sultan Ibrahim\", retained the majority of the confiscated property of Suleiman's \"minister of finance\" [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], whose execution he ordered etc.). Ibrahim was replaced with [[Ayas Mehmed Pasha]], followed by [[L\u00fctfi Pasha]] and [[Had\u0131m Suleiman Pasha]]. R\u00fcstem's career developed, unlike Ibrahim, exactly according to the rules. He became Grand Vizier eight years after Ibrahim's death.\n\nLater Hurrem and R\u00fcstem conspired against [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]] for many years. The very ambitious Mustafa received foreign ambassadors as well as Ottoman commanders many times, without his father's knowledge, and was regarded by them as an important ally against Suleiman. So the Austrian ambassador Ghislain de Busbecq (visiting Mustafa before S\u00fcleyman), informed his ruler: \"Mustafa will be an excellent sultan, receptive and open to talks.\" And the Papal ambassador Navagero said: \"Mustafa lives with his mother. She says that people adore him.\" Understanding the danger of the situation, Suleiman remembered his father Selim dethroning his grandfather Bayezid (who was killed only a month after his abdication in 1512). Officers loyal to him advised that a part of the army is getting ready to put Mustafa on the throne. In 1552, while preparing a campaign against Persia, Suleiman appointed R\u00fcstem \"Serasker\" (commander-in-chief) of the campaign. But soldiers assembled in the military camp in Karaman (Anatolia), rejected Suleiman's appointment, and insisted R\u00fcstem should be replaced with Mustafa (the same problem was faced by R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]], as admiral of the Ottoman fleet during the Tripolis siege, even though he achieved many victories until his death in 1553).\n\nThe destabilization continued. Mustafa's so-often cited correspondence with the [[Safavid]]s signed \"Sultan Mustafa\" (kept today in archives), was, in this context, probably not so relevant. It could be authentic, it could be a Safavids' or a Hurrem-R\u00fcstem deception, or maybe Suleiman's safeguard to calm public opinion after Mustafa's death. There are various versions of reports on Mustafa's end in the Ere\u011fli valley. According to one of them, R\u00fcstem Pasha made an offer to Mustafa to join his father's army and at the same time he warned Suleiman that Mustafa was coming to kill him. According to another version, it was Suleiman himself who summoned his son to Ere\u011fli, and Mustafa came, \"confident that the army would protect him\".\n\nOnly R\u00fcstem appears in all the versions as the antagonist. However, it is not surprising, as they are all based on Mustafa's PR chief consultant [[Ta\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey]]'s elegy, \"\u015eehzade Mustafa Mersiyesi\". Even the report of the Austrian ambassador de Busbecq, who claims to have received an account from an eyewitness, had the same origin. R\u00fcstem, suspended and banished, was fair game as an object of violence. No one dared to criticize the Sultan himself. Suleiman probably realized this, and called R\u00fcstem back two years later.\n\nR\u00fcstem's scapegoating as the seemingly dominant figure of the \"conspiracy against Mustafa\", radically changed public opinion. And so the R\u00fcstem extolled years ago as the \"pillar of the Ottoman empire\", brilliant economist and sophisticated statesman, was forgotten, as well as his great projects and charitable foundations. He became R\u00fcstem the \"black heart, the murderer of the loved Prince Mustafa\". Nothing was enough to make him dirty: his \"dirty\" origin, the imputation of bribery, the story with the louse... Some foreign ambassadors like Ghiselin de Busbecq or Bernardo Navagero, repeated it spitefully in their reports (all the more that R\u00fcstem was as a diplomat an invincible opponent, the agreement from 1547 must not be forgotten). Unlike them, Jean Chesneau, the secretary of the French ambassador, wrote about him: \"The grand vizier is a man of humble origin, who, thanks to his talent and will, worked his way up from nothing. He is an agreeable companion, engaging your interest with his acute faculty of judgment, an insightful way of thinking and magnanimous manners. During the negotiations, he is calm and dispassionate, although in his views determined.\" \n\nTa\u015fl\u0131cal\u0131 Yahya Bey's elegy, the reports of ambassadors, administrative dossiers, foundation charters and some private documents like Hurrem's and Mihrimah's plea to Suleiman when R\u00fcstem was expelled to \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, are the only period sources reporting on R\u00fcstem's life. They were also the basis of the often cited \u0130br\u0101h\u012bm Pe\u00e7ev\u012b's work \"T\u0101r\u012b\u1e2b-i Pe\u00e7ev\u012b\", published 80 years after R\u00fcstem's death.\n\n==Relationship with Mihrimah==\n[[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah Sultan]] was married off to the governor of [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] R\u00fcstem in 1539.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2014/03/11/notable-life-of-mihrimah-sultan|title=Notable life of Mihrimah Sultan|work=DailySabah|access-date=2017-10-13}}</ref> After his marriage, he was nominated to the vizierate in November 1544.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xf3h3Z1YQtIC&pg=PA88&dq=Rustem+pasa+power&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjV7Ouvqe3WAhWCAxoKHSLPAgUQ6AEIIzAA#v=onepage&q=Rustem&f=false|title=The Ottoman Age of Exploration|last=Casale|first=Giancarlo|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199798797|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the union was unhappy, Mihrimah flourished as a patroness of the arts and continued her travels with her father until her husband's death. This marriage had, like many dynastic unions, a political character. Hurrem's role was probably important. Nonetheless, according to the rules, it was a decision of the father. R\u00fcstem was at that time already a wealthy man and had, since 1538, a splendid career as Governor of Anatolya, one of the two most important administrative regions in the Ottoman Empire. This post was considered to be a preliminary stage to Grand Vizier. Mihrimah knew R\u00fcstem for a very long time as the mentor of her brothers and the adviser of her father.\n \nAfter his death Mihrimah accomplished his work, as well as the R\u00fcstem Pasha Mosque (1561\u201363), one of [[Mimar Sinan]]'s most impressive projects. R\u00fcstem supported Mihrimah's charitable foundations, for example, the Mihrimah Sultan \u0130skele Camii ([[Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (\u00dcsk\u00fcdar)|Mihrimah Sultan Mosque in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar]], 1540\u201348; a known [[k\u00fclliye]] in Istanbul, [[Mimar Sinan]] project). R\u00fcstem was also Mihrimah's mentor, particularly concerning political and financial decisions. His last will from 1561, provides evidence of his confidence in his wife. R\u00fcstem's brother [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] (who died in December 1553, a turbulent year for the family), was later buried in Mihrimah Sultan Complex in \u00dcsk\u00fcdar, as well as the two sons of R\u00fcstem and Mihrimah.

She suffered a breakdown due to the deterioration of her father's health. After this she worked in a glassware shop. She eventually joined the [[J.

The [[Whitechapel Gallery]] exhibition of [[Jackson Pollock]] in the winter of 1958 had an impact on her.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nHer early work was figurative and semi-impressionist. Between 1958 and 1959, her work at the advertising agency showed her adoption of a style of painting based on the [[Pointillism|pointillist]] technique.<ref name=\"Bridget Riley\">[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=4929 Bridget Riley] [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York.</ref> Around 1960, she began to develop her signature [[Op Art]] style consisting of black and white geometric patterns that explore the dynamism of sight and produce a disorienting effect on the eye and produces movement and color.<ref name=\"Chilvers, Ian 2009. pp. 598-599\"/> In the summer of 1960, she toured Italy with her mentor Maurice de Sausmarez, and the two friends visited the [[Venice Biennale]] with its large exhibition of [[Futurism|Futurist]] works.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nEarly in her career, Riley worked as an art teacher for children from 1957\u201358 at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] (now known as ''Sacred Heart Language College''). At the Convent of the Sacred Heart, she began a basic design course.

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

They present a great variety of geometric forms that produce sensations of movement or colour. In the early 1960s, her works were said to induce sensation in viewers as varied as seasick and [[sky diving]]. From 1961 to 1964, she worked with the contrast of black and white, occasionally introducing tonal scales of grey. Works in this style comprised her first 1962 solo show at Musgrave's Gallery One, as well as numerous subsequent shows. For example, in ''Fall'', a single perpendiculars curve is repeated to create a field of varying optical frequencies.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/riley-fall-t00616  Bridget Riley, ''Fall'' (1963)] [[Tate]].</ref> Visually, these works relate to many concerns of the period: a perceived need for audience participation (this relates them to the [[Happening]]s, which were common in this era), challenges to the notion of the mind-body duality which led [[Aldous Huxley]] to experiment with [[hallucinogenic drugs]];<ref>[[Aldous Huxley|Huxley, Aldous]] (1954) ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', Chatto and Windus, p. 15</ref> concerns with a tension between a scientific future which might be very beneficial or might lead to a [[nuclear war]]; and fears about the loss of genuine individual experience in a Brave New World.<ref>Introduction to Frances Follin, Embodied Visions: Bridget Riley, Op Art and the Sixties, Thames and Hudson 2004</ref> Her paintings since 1961, have been executed by assistants.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> She meticulously plans her composition's design with preparatory drawings and collage techniques; her assistants paint the final canvases with great precision under her instruction.<ref name=\"Practising Abstraction\">Practising Abstraction, Bridget Riley talking to Michael Craig-Martin in ''Bridget Riley, Dialogues on Art'', p. 62</ref>\n\nRiley began investigating colour in 1967, the year in which she produced her first stripe painting.<ref name=\"Tate Press Release\">{{cite web| url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/bridget-riley |title=Press Release: Bridget Riley |publisher=Tate Gallery | date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=18 September 2015}}</ref> Following a major retrospective in the early 1970s, Riley began travelling extensively.

In 1983, for the first time in fifteen years, Riley returned to Venice to once again study the paintings that form the basis of European colourism. Towards the end of the 1980s, Riley's work underwent a dramatic change with the reintroduction of the diagonal in the form of a sequence of [[parallelogram]]s used to disrupt and animate the vertical stripes that had characterised her previous paintings.<ref>[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5101424 Bridget Riley, ''August'' (1995)] [[Christie's]] Post-War & Contemporary Art Evening Sale, London, 30 June 2008.</ref> In ''Delos'' (1983), for example, blue, turquoise, and emerald hues alternate with rich yellows, reds and white.<ref>J\u00f6rg Heiser (May 2011), Bridget Riley at Galerie Max Hetzler, Berlin, ''[[Frieze (magazine)|Frieze]]''.</ref>\n\n===Murals===\n[[File:Bridget-riley-bolt-of-colour-1-chinati-foundatin-marfa-texas.jpg|thumb|''Bolt of Colour'', 2017-2019.

It is his most precious possession, and, as Proust explains, the source of his innermost happiness. However, as can be seen from the practice of the great artists, although the text may be strong and durable and able to support a lifetime's work, it cannot be taken for granted and there is no guarantee of permanent possession. It may be mislaid or even lost, and retrieval is very difficult. It may lie dormant, and be discovered late in life after a long struggle, as with [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] or Proust himself. Why it should be that some people have this sort of text while others do not, and what 'meaning' it has, is not something which lends itself to argument. Nor is it up to the artist to decide how important it is, or what value it has for other people. To ascertain this is perhaps beyond even the capacities of an artist's own time.<ref name=\"Bracewell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1|title=Seeing is Believing|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|date=October 2008|publisher=Frieze Magazine|accessdate=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111073803/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/seeing_is_believing_1/|archivedate=11 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"pn\">{{cite journal|jstor=887465|last=Riley|first=Bridget|date=September 1997|title=Painting Now|journal=The Burlington Magazine|publisher=The Burlington Magazine Publications, Ltd.|volume=139|issue=1134|pages=616\u2013622}}</ref>}}\n\n===Writer and curator===\nRiley has written on artists from [[Nicolas Poussin]] to [[Bruce Nauman]].

Seitz); the exhibition which first drew worldwide attention to her work and the Op Art movement. Her painting ''Current'', 1964, was reproduced on the cover of the show's catalogue. Riley became increasingly disillusioned, however, with the exploitation of her art for commercial purposes, discovering that in the USA there was no copyright protection for artists. The first US copyright legislation was eventually passed, following an independent initiative by New York artists, in 1967.<ref name=Kudielka/>\n\nShe participated in [[documenta]]s IV (1968) and VI (1977).

Involvement of the arms and face is more unusual, as is lymphedema of the abdomen with [[ascites]] (fluid collection in the abdominal cavity) and [[Pericardial effusion|fluid collection around the heart]].<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\nVarious lung problems can occur in people with yellow nail syndrome.

Generally, people are diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome if they have two or three of the three classical symptoms (yellow nails, lymphedema and pleural effusion). The nail changes are considered essential for the diagnosis, but they can be subtle.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n[[Pulmonary function testing]] can show obstruction of the airways. People with pleural effusions may show evidence of restriction in lung volumes due to the fluid.

This can show both under developed (hypoplastic) lymphatic ducts and dilated ducts. Dye may be found in the skin months after the initial test. [[Scintigraphy]] of lymph flow (lymphoscintigraphy) shows delays in drainage of lymph (sometimes asymmetrically), although this test can also be normal.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNormal treatment for swelling and any respiratory problems is appropriate.  Nutritional supplementation with [[Vitamin E]] in some studies has been shown to be effective in controlling nail changes.<ref name=\"titleYellow nail syndrome. DermNet NZ\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nPeople with yellow nail syndrome have been found to have a moderately reduced lifespan compared to people without the condition.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe condition is thought to be rare, with approximately 150 cases described in the medical literature.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Patient Registry==\nResearch is needed to determine the cause of YNS, to identify biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapy, and to find effective treatments.

It is the first symptom of the condition in about a third. Involvement of the arms and face is more unusual, as is lymphedema of the abdomen with [[ascites]] (fluid collection in the abdominal cavity) and [[Pericardial effusion|fluid collection around the heart]].<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\nVarious lung problems can occur in people with yellow nail syndrome. Many experience cough and [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]]. Forty percent of cases develop [[pleural effusion]]s, which are collections of fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] (the space that contains the lungs and normally only has a minimal amount of fluid in it).<ref name=Maldonado2009/> About half of all people with yellow nail syndrome have either recurrent [[Lower respiratory tract infection|chest infections]] or a chronic lung condition known as [[bronchiectasis]] which causes chronic production of [[sputum]] with episodes of worsening. Forty percent of people with yellow nail syndrome have chronic [[sinusitis]].<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\nYellow nail syndrome has been associated with some drugs, ''e.g.'' [[penicillamine]], [[bucillamine]] and [[gold sodium thiomalate]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nanda S|author2=Dorville F|year=2009|title=Yellow nail syndrome|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=181|issue=9|pages=614|doi=10.1503/cmaj.080255|pmid=19770240|pmc=2764757}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been associated with exposure to titanium from dental implants.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmc = 3176400|year = 2010|last1 = Berglund|first1 = F|title = Titanium, Sinusitis, and the Yellow Nail Syndrome|journal = Biological Trace Element Research|volume = 143|issue = 1|pages = 1\u20137|last2 = Carlmark|first2 = B|pmid = 20809268|doi = 10.1007/s12011-010-8828-5}}</ref>\n\n==Genetics==\nAlthough it has been described in families, it has been suggested that it might not have a genetic link.<ref name=\"pmid17459037\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoque SR, Mansour S, Mortimer PS |title=Yellow nail syndrome: not a genetic disorder?

Generally, people are diagnosed with yellow nail syndrome if they have two or three of the three classical symptoms (yellow nails, lymphedema and pleural effusion). The nail changes are considered essential for the diagnosis, but they can be subtle.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n[[Pulmonary function testing]] can show obstruction of the airways. People with pleural effusions may show evidence of restriction in lung volumes due to the fluid. Analysis of the fluid in pleural effusions generally shows high levels of protein but low levels of cholesterol and [[lactate dehydrogenase]], but about 30% of effusions are [[chyle|chylous]] ([[chylothorax]]) in that they have the characteristics of [[lymph]].<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\nA [[lymphogram]] may be performed in people with lymphedema. This can show both under developed (hypoplastic) lymphatic ducts and dilated ducts. Dye may be found in the skin months after the initial test. [[Scintigraphy]] of lymph flow (lymphoscintigraphy) shows delays in drainage of lymph (sometimes asymmetrically), although this test can also be normal.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Treatment==\nNormal treatment for swelling and any respiratory problems is appropriate.  Nutritional supplementation with [[Vitamin E]] in some studies has been shown to be effective in controlling nail changes.<ref name=\"titleYellow nail syndrome. DermNet NZ\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nPeople with yellow nail syndrome have been found to have a moderately reduced lifespan compared to people without the condition.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe condition is thought to be rare, with approximately 150 cases described in the medical literature.<ref name=Maldonado2009/>\n\n==Patient Registry==\nResearch is needed to determine the cause of YNS, to identify biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and response to therapy, and to find effective treatments.

This took the form of ''[[Palm wine|tuba]]'' (palm wine) drinking among the soldiers and male villagers, [[baseball]] games and [[arnis]] demonstrations. However, tensions rose due to several reasons: Captain Thomas W. Connell, commanding officer of the American unit in Balangiga, ordered the town cleaned up in preparation for a visit by the U.S. Army's inspector-general. However, in complying with his directive, the townspeople inadvertently cut down vegetation with food value, in violation of Lukb\u00e1n's policies regarding [[food security]]. As a consequence, on September 18, 1901, around 400 guerrillas sent by Lukb\u00e1n appeared in the vicinity of Balangiga. They were to mete sanctions upon the town officials and local residents for violating Lukb\u00e1n's orders regarding food security and for fraternizing with the Americans. The threat was probably defused by Captain [[Eugenio Daza]], a member of Lukb\u00e1n's staff, and by the parish priest, Father Donato Guimbaolibot.<ref name=\"borr\">{{cite web | last =Borrinaga | first =Rolando | title =The Balangiga Conflict:Its Causes, Impact and Meaning | url=http://www.geocities.com/rolborr/balconsum.html | accessdate = 2008-03-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091022070336/http://geocities.com/rolborr/balconsum.html|archivedate=2009-10-22}}</ref>\n\nA few days later, Connell had the town's male residents rounded up and detained for the purpose of hastening his clean-up operations.

Abanador also brought in a group of \"[[Tax evasion|tax evaders]]\" to bolster their numbers. Much palm wine was brought in to ensure that the American soldiers would be drunk the day after the ''fiesta''. Hours before the attack, women and children were sent away to safety. To mask the disappearance of the women from the dawn service in the church, 34 men from [[Lawaan, Eastern Samar|Barrio Lawaan]] [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]] as women worshippers.<ref name=\"borr\"/> These \"women\", carrying small [[coffin]]s, were challenged by Sergeant Scharer of the sentry post about the town plaza near the church.

Abanador, who had been supervising the prisoners' communal labor in the town plaza, grabbed the rifle of Private Adolph Gamlin, one of the American sentries, and stunned him with a blow to the head. This served as the signal for the rest of the communal laborers in the plaza to rush the other sentries and soldiers of Company C, who were mostly having breakfast in the [[mess]] area. Abanador then gave a shout, signaling the other Filipino men to the attack and fired Gamlin's rifle at the mess tent, hitting one of the soldiers. The [[Balangiga bells|pealing of the church bells]] and the sounds from [[conch]] shells being blown followed seconds later. Some of the Company C troopers were attacked and hacked to death before they could grab their rifles; the few who survived the initial onslaught fought almost bare-handed, using kitchen utensils, steak knives, and chairs.

Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General [[Vicente Lukb\u00e1n]], but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals.

Much palm wine was brought in to ensure that the American soldiers would be drunk the day after the ''fiesta''. Hours before the attack, women and children were sent away to safety. To mask the disappearance of the women from the dawn service in the church, 34 men from [[Lawaan, Eastern Samar|Barrio Lawaan]] [[cross-dressing|cross-dressed]] as women worshippers.<ref name=\"borr\"/> These \"women\", carrying small [[coffin]]s, were challenged by Sergeant Scharer of the sentry post about the town plaza near the church. Opening one of the coffins with his bayonet, he saw the body of a dead child who, he was told, was a victim of a [[cholera]] epidemic. Abashed, he let the women pass on. Unbeknownst to the sentries, the other coffins hid the ''bolos'' and other weapons of the attackers.<ref name=\"bautista\"/>\n\nThe issue of children's bodies merits further attention since there is much conflict between accounts by members of Company C. That day, the 27th, was the 52nd anniversary of the founding of the parish, an occasion on which an image of a recumbent Christ known as a Santo Intierra would have been carried around the parish.

Abanador, who had been supervising the prisoners' communal labor in the town plaza, grabbed the rifle of Private Adolph Gamlin, one of the American sentries, and stunned him with a blow to the head. This served as the signal for the rest of the communal laborers in the plaza to rush the other sentries and soldiers of Company C, who were mostly having breakfast in the [[mess]] area. Abanador then gave a shout, signaling the other Filipino men to the attack and fired Gamlin's rifle at the mess tent, hitting one of the soldiers. The [[Balangiga bells|pealing of the church bells]] and the sounds from [[conch]] shells being blown followed seconds later. Some of the Company C troopers were attacked and hacked to death before they could grab their rifles; the few who survived the initial onslaught fought almost bare-handed, using kitchen utensils, steak knives, and chairs. One private used a [[baseball bat]] to fend off the attackers before being overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite web| title= Jungle Patrol 2: Remember Balangiga| url= http://bakbakan.com/junglep/jp-2.html| accessdate= 2008-03-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080510141323/http://www.bakbakan.com/junglep/jp-2.html| archivedate= 10 May 2008| url-status= dead}}</ref><ref name=\"dumindin\">{{cite web | last =Dumindin | first =Arnaldo | title =Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 | url=http://www.freewebs.com/philippineamericanwar/balangigamassacre1901.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-30}}</ref>\n\nThe men detained in the Sibley tents broke out and made their way to the municipal hall.

Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General [[Vicente Lukb\u00e1n]], but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 [[carabao]]s and killed 39 people.<ref name=\"nebrida\"/>\n\nThe [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]] of the Army observed that only the good sense and restraint of the majority of Smith's subordinates prevented a complete reign of terror in Samar. The abuses outraged [[Anti-imperialism|anti-Imperialist]] groups in the United States when these became known in March 1902.\n\nThe exact number of Filipinos killed by US troops will never be known. A population shortfall of about 15,000 is apparent between the Spanish census of 1887 and the American census of 1903 but how much of the shortfall is due to a disease epidemic and known natural disasters and how many due to combat is difficult to determine.

Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]].

He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"[[cabinet card]]s\" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men's physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====First large-scale bodybuilding competition====\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\".

Bushman]], who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous [[silent movie]] career.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1950s{{ndash}}1960s ===\nBodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and [[gymnastics]] champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for [[Muscular hypertrophy|bulking up]] and [[Fat loss|cutting down]], the use of [[protein]] and other [[food supplements]], and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the [[International Federation of Bodybuilders]] (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|National Amateur Bodybuilding Association]] (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===1970s{{ndash}}1990s===\n==== New organizations ====\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 [[docudrama]] ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\n\n==== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ====\n[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]\n\nThis period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with [[Lee Haney]], the 1990s with [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus R\u00fchl]], and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like [[Tom Platz]] or [[Paul Demayo]] for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Theunissen|first=Steve|title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed|url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).

McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright.<ref>American Media Inc., \"American Media, Inc.

This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Olympic sport discussion ====\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Littman|first=Jean|title=Bodybuilding And The Olympics: An Ongoing Controversy|publisher=article99.com|url=http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205174022/http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 5, 2007|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Areas ==\n=== Professional bodybuilding ===\n{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.<ref>[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq \u2013 Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref> Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\n\n===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===\n{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.<ref name=\"natural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner_natural_bodybuilding_guide.htm|title=Beginner's Guide To Natural Bodybuilding Competition: Disseminating Misconception From Reality!|website=Bodybuilding.com|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.<ref name=\"natural\"/>\n\n=== Men's Physique ===\nDue to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. The first MR. Olympia was Mark Wingson, which was followed by Jeremy Buendia for consecutive years. Like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that men's physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit. Bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the Physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses. Many of the competitors are not freakishly large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding. Although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now Men's Physique seems to be the most popular class to be in.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Classic Physique ===\nThis is the middle ground of both Men's Physique and Bodybuilding. The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors. They pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike Mens Physique which hide the legs in board shorts. Classic physique has only been around for 3 years now as it started in 2016. Danny Hester was the first Classic Physique Mr. Olympia and now Chris Bumstead is the 2019 Mr. Olympia. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Female bodybuilding ===\n{{main|Female bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]\nThe first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest\u2014that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.<ref>Todd, Jan, \"Bodybuilding\", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999</ref> In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a [[gymnastic]] element to them. A study by the ''[[Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine]]'' found that female bodybuilders who are taking [[anabolic steroid]]s are more likely to have qualified for [[Substance dependence|substance dependence disorder]], to have been diagnosed with a [[psychiatric illness]], or to have a history of [[sexual abuse]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barnett|first1=Mitchell|title=Women and Anabolic Steroids: An Analysis of a Dozen Users|journal=Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine|date=Nov 2010|volume=20|issue=6|pages=475\u201381|pmid=21079445|doi=10.1097/JSM.0b013e3181fb5370}}</ref>\n\nE.

Each competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique. A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.\n\nIn contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is paramount, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n==== Bulking and cutting ====\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12\u201314 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible. The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of [[anabolism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/reverse-dieting-how-go-cut-bulk-without-gaining-fat|work=[[Men's Journal]]|title=Reverse Dieting: How to Go From Cut to Bulk Without Gaining Fat|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to [[Oxidized fats|oxidize]] fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Charles|author2=Frank L|author3=Evens W|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding.|journal=Sports Med|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=317\u201327|pmid=15107010|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}</ref>\n\nThe bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.<ref>the science and development of muscle hypertrophy, Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, page 139-140</ref> A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions. Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible.\n\n==== Clean bulking ====\nMany non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt this conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats. \"Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish,\" says White{{Who|date=January 2019}}. \"Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example\".<ref>Giblin, Chris. \"Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy.\" Joe Weider's Muscle & Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.</ref> To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. [[Macronutrient]] goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.\n\n====Dirty bulking====\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus, without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly with no [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] concerns often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method.<ref>Evans, Rian.

Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-competition ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the last week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders usually decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"[[vascularity]]\". The muscular definition and vascularity are further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step, called \"pumping\", consists in performing exercises with light weights or other kinds of low resistance (for instance two athletes can \"pump\" each other by holding a towel and pulling in turn), just before the contest, to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size and density.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Muscle growth ==\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize [[muscle hypertrophy]]:\n* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.\n* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.\n* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.\n\nBodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\".\n\n=== Weight training ===\n{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}\n\nIntensive [[weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.<ref name=\"pmid7371625\">{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25\u201334|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}</ref>\n\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), however, the emphasis is different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nMany trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals; typically, a bodybuilder will aim at sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to a myofibrillar hypertrophy kind of training temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\".{{Clarify|date=January 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]]. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to build muscle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major Nutrients in Food|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/major-nutrients-in-food-topic-overview|publisher=webMd|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref> The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Manoreem MM, Thompson J, Russo M|title=Diet and exercise strategies of a world-class bodybuilder|journal=Int J Sport Nutr.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=76\u201386|date=March 1993|doi=10.1123/ijsn.3.1.76|pmid=8499940|accessdate=|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15139f1395bff0699b645bd96461b0e129a3e8d3}}</ref>\n\n==== Carbohydrates ====\n[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes [[protein synthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Rob|title=Coach & Athletic Director|date=March 2002|volume=71|issue=8|page=3}}<!--|accessdate=November 5, 2012-->{{fcn|date=January 2020}}</ref> Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriadis|first=George|last2=Mitrou|first2=Panayota|last3=Lambadiari|first3=Vaia|last4=Maratou|first4=Eirini|last5=Raptis|first5=Sotirios A.|date=August 2011|title=Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue|journal=Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice|volume=93|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S52\u201359|doi=10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6|issn=1872-8227|pmid=21864752}}</ref> It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein\u2014which also induces the release of insulin\u2014it is impossible to add muscle mass.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0368-2|pmid=17957382|title=Effects of contraction and insulin on protein synthesis, AMP-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation state of translation factors in rat skeletal muscle|journal=Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv|volume=455|issue=6|pages=1129\u201340|year=2007|last1=Miranda|first1=Lisa|last2=Horman|first2=Sandrine|last3=De Potter|first3=Isabelle|last4=Hue|first4=Louis|last5=Jensen|first5=J\u00f8rgen|last6=Rider|first6=Mark H.}}</ref> Bodybuilders seek out [[Glycemic index|low-glycemic]] [[polysaccharide]]s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-glycemic sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) just before, during, and/or just after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael W.|title=Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|website=|publisher=IU School of Medicine|url=http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/gluconeogenesis.html|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Protein ====\n[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]\nThe motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s.

Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value]] (BV) and quick absorption rates. [[Whey protein]] also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g., [[seitan]]) and two parts soy protein (e.g., [[tofu]]) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders.

In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank the competitors based on criteria such as symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation. Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of [[Adipose tissue|nonessential body fat]], enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular [[dehydration]] and [[carbohydrate loading]], to achieve maximum muscular definition and [[vascularity]], as well as [[Sun tanning|tanning]] to accentuate the contrast of the skin under the spotlights.

He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\". Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, [[Florenz Ziegfeld]]. The [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1936 [[musical film]] ''[[The Great Ziegfeld]]'' depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nSandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined [[dumbbell]]s, spring [[pulley]]s, and tension bands. Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"[[cabinet card]]s\" and other prints. Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of [[Golden ratio|ideal body proportion]]s close to those of ancient Greek and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues. Men's physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n====First large-scale bodybuilding competition====\nSandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\". It was held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rhodes|first=Jesse|title=Bodybuilders Through the Ages|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Bodybuilders-Through-the-Ages.html|date=July 19, 2009}}</ref> Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members. The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy. The winner was William L. Murray of [[Nottingham]]. The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper. The bronze Sandow trophy \u2014 now the most famous of all \u2014 was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to [[Steve Reeves]] for winning the inaugural [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|NABBA]] [[Universe Championships|Mr. Universe]] contest.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the [[International Federation of BodyBuilders|IFBB]] [[Mr. Olympia]] contest, [[Frank Zane]], was presented with a replica of the bronze trophy.

Two weeks later, [[Thomas Edison]] made a film of Treloar's posing routine. Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before.

Bushman]], who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous [[silent movie]] career.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== 1950s{{ndash}}1960s ===\nBodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and [[gymnastics]] champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for [[Muscular hypertrophy|bulking up]] and [[Fat loss|cutting down]], the use of [[protein]] and other [[food supplements]], and the opportunity to enter physique contests. The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the [[International Federation of Bodybuilders]] (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers [[Joe Weider|Joe]] and [[Ben Weider]]. Other bodybuilding organizations included the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU), [[National Amateur Body-Builders' Association|National Amateur Bodybuilding Association]] (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG). Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size. Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDuring the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Bill Pearl]], [[Reg Park]], [[Leroy Colbert]], and [[Clarence Ross]]. Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema. The most notable{{According to whom|date=February 2017}} were [[Jack LaLanne]], [[Steve Reeves]], Reg Park, and [[Mickey Hargitay]]. While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in [[North Hollywood, California]] and [[Vic Tanny]]'s chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of [[Gold's Gym]] in the mid-1960s.  Finally, the famed [[Muscle Beach]] in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like. The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in popular shows and movies.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===1970s{{ndash}}1990s===\n==== New organizations ====\nIn the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Franco Columbu]], [[Lou Ferrigno]], and others in the 1977 [[docudrama]] ''[[Pumping Iron]]''. By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) took a back seat. The [[National Physique Committee]] (NPC) was formed in 1981 by [[Jim Manion]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifbbpro.com/features/jim-manion-chairman-ifbb-professional-league/|title=IFBB Professional League - Jim Manion, Chairman IFBB Professional League|publisher=Ifbbpro.com|date=September 26, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921210350/http://abhivacrossfitarena.com/|archivedate=September 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee. The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB. The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests. In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events.\n\n==== Anabolic/androgenic steroid use ====\n[[File:Ronnie_Coleman_8_x_Mr_Olympia_-_2009_-_7.png|right|thumb|[[Ronnie Coleman]], eight-time [[Mr. Olympia]], pictured in October 2009]]\n\nThis period also saw the rise of [[anabolic steroid]]s in bodybuilding and many other sports. In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Sergio Oliva]], and [[Lou Ferrigno]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with [[Lee Haney]], the 1990s with [[Dorian Yates]], [[Ronnie Coleman]], and [[Markus R\u00fchl]], and up to the present day. Bodybuilders such as [[Greg Kovacs]] attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level. Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like [[Tom Platz]] or [[Paul Demayo]] for their leg muscles. At the time of shooting ''Pumping Iron'', Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} He would later say that he does not regret using anything.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-250_162-676684.html|newspaper=CBS|date=February 11, 2009|title=Arnold: No Regrets About Steroids|accessdate=August 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the [[IOC]], the IFBB introduced [[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in sport|doping]] tests for both steroids and other banned substances. Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition. During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Theunissen|first=Steve|title=Arnold & Steroids: Truth Revealed|url=http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|accessdate=February 27, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031008172601/http://hjem.get2net.dk/JamesBond/www/artikler/steroidemisbrug/arnoldandsteroids.htm|archivedate=October 8, 2003|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).

McMahon wanted to bring [[WWE|WWF]]-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding. A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was [[Gary Strydom]]. McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992. Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine ''Bodybuilding Lifestyles'' (later ''WBF Magazine''), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, [[Joe Weider]] sold Weider Publications to [[American Media (publisher)|AMI]], which owns the ''[[National Enquirer]]''. The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of [[Ben Weider]] in October 2008. In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright.<ref>American Media Inc., \"American Media, Inc.

This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former [[Eastern Bloc]] states.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Olympic sport discussion ====\nIn the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] sport. It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Littman|first=Jean|title=Bodybuilding And The Olympics: An Ongoing Controversy|publisher=article99.com|url=http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205174022/http://www.article99.com/recreation-and-sports/olympics/article.php?art=63758|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 5, 2007|date=November 13, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Areas ==\n=== Professional bodybuilding ===\n{{Main|Professional bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Frank_Zane.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Zane]], three-time Mr. Olympia]]\nIn the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"[[Professional bodybuilding|professional]]\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization. Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card.<ref>[http://www.ifbb.com/ifbb-faq/ Ifbb Faq \u2013 Ifbb]. Ifbb.com (February 22, 1999). Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref> Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.\n\n===Natural bodybuilding {{anchor|MuscleMania|UFE|INBF|WNBF|INBA|PNBA|NPC|NANBF}}===\n{{Main|Natural bodybuilding}}\nDue to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions. In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.<ref name=\"natural\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/beginner_natural_bodybuilding_guide.htm|title=Beginner's Guide To Natural Bodybuilding Competition: Disseminating Misconception From Reality!|website=Bodybuilding.com|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from [[Polygraph test|lie detectors]] to [[urinalysis]]. Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA. These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered.<ref name=\"natural\"/>\n\n=== Men's Physique ===\nDue to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. The first MR. Olympia was Mark Wingson, which was followed by Jeremy Buendia for consecutive years. Like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that men's physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit. Bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the Physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses. Many of the competitors are not freakishly large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding. Although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now Men's Physique seems to be the most popular class to be in.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Classic Physique ===\nThis is the middle ground of both Men's Physique and Bodybuilding. The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors. They pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike Mens Physique which hide the legs in board shorts. Classic physique has only been around for 3 years now as it started in 2016. Danny Hester was the first Classic Physique Mr. Olympia and now Chris Bumstead is the 2019 Mr. Olympia. {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Female bodybuilding ===\n{{main|Female bodybuilding}}\n[[File:Nikki_Fuller.jpg|thumb|Pro female bodybuilder [[Nikki Fuller]] performing a side chest pose]]\nThe first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in [[Canton, Ohio]] in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest\u2014that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity.<ref>Todd, Jan, \"Bodybuilding\", St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture, Gale Group, 1999</ref> In 1980, the first [[Ms. Olympia]] (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held. The first winner was [[Rachel McLish]], who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year. The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding. McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing. In 1985, a movie called ''[[Pumping Iron II: The Women]]'' was released. It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 [[Caesars Palace]] World Cup Championship. Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, [[Bev Francis]], and McLish. At the time, Francis was actually a [[Powerlifting|powerlifter]], though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, the related areas of [[fitness and figure competition]] have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding. McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder. Fitness competitions also have a [[gymnastic]] element to them.

Each competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique. A [[posedown]] is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring. Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach.\n\nIn contrast to [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] or [[powerlifting]] competitions, where [[physical strength]] is paramount, or to [[Olympic weightlifting]], where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry. Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n=== Preparations ===\n==== Bulking and cutting ====\nThe general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12\u201314 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of [[Adipose tissue|body fat]] (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible. The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance ([[calorie]] surplus). The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue. The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of [[anabolism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/reverse-dieting-how-go-cut-bulk-without-gaining-fat|work=[[Men's Journal]]|title=Reverse Dieting: How to Go From Cut to Bulk Without Gaining Fat|accessdate=2020-01-24}}</ref>\n\nThe cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit). The main goal of cutting is to [[Oxidized fats|oxidize]] fat while preserving as much muscle as possible. The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight. However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Charles|author2=Frank L|author3=Evens W|title=Macronutrient considerations for the sport of bodybuilding.|journal=Sports Med|date=March 2004|volume=34|issue=5|pages=317\u201327|pmid=15107010|doi=10.2165/00007256-200434050-00004}}</ref>\n\nThe bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance.<ref>the science and development of muscle hypertrophy, Dr. Brad Schoenfeld, page 139-140</ref> A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions. Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible.\n\n==== Clean bulking ====\nMany non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt this conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase. The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking. Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for. A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high would be to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss. Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a decently low amount of fats. \"Gaining lean muscle means going for leaner cuts of meat, like flank steaks and fillets, chicken, and, of course, fish,\" says White{{Who|date=January 2019}}. \"Enjoy your meat with some starch: rice, beans, quinoa, whole-grain couscous, or sweet potato, for example\".<ref>Giblin, Chris. \"Clean Bulking: for Frustrated Hard-Gainers, Clean Bulking Is Attainable If You Focus Your Diet Accordingly with the Right Foods and Strategy.\" Joe Weider's Muscle & Fitness, vol. 75, no. 8, 2014, p. 89.</ref> To maintain a clean bulk it is important to reach calorie goals every day. [[Macronutrient]] goals will be different for each person, but, it is ideal to get as close as possible.\n\n====Dirty bulking====\n\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus, without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients (carbs, fats, and proteins). Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly with no [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] concerns often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method.<ref>Evans, Rian.

Retrieved on 2016-11-29.</ref>\n\n==== Pre-competition ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the last week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders usually decrease their consumption of [[water]], [[Sodium in biology|sodium]], and [[carbohydrate]]s, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce [[glycogen]] in the muscle. The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and [[diuretic]]s may be introduced, while [[carbohydrate loading]] is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen. The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"[[vascularity]]\". The muscular definition and vascularity are further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through [[Sunless tanning|tanning products]] and applying [[Vegetable oil|oils]] to the skin to increase shine. Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins. A final step, called \"pumping\", consists in performing exercises with light weights or other kinds of low resistance (for instance two athletes can \"pump\" each other by holding a towel and pulling in turn), just before the contest, to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size and density.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n== Muscle growth ==\nBodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize [[muscle hypertrophy]]:\n* [[Strength training]] through weights or elastic/hydraulic resistance.\n* Specialized [[nutrition]], incorporating extra [[protein]] and supplements when necessary.\n* Adequate rest, including sleep and recuperation between workouts.\n\nBodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\".\n\n=== Weight training ===\n{{Main|Weight training|Strength training}}\n\nIntensive [[weight training]] causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as [[microtrauma]]. These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] (DOMS). It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in [[muscle growth]]. Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout. However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease.<ref name=\"pmid7371625\">{{cite journal|title=Effects of strength training and immobilization on human muscle fibres|year=1980|vauthors=MacDougall JD, Elder GC, Sale DG, Moroz JR, Sutton JR|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology|volume=43|issue=1|pages=25\u201334|pmid=7371625|doi=10.1007/BF00421352}}</ref>\n\nWeight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of [[Muscle hypertrophy|hypertrophy]]: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Weight Training Intensity or Volume for Bigger Muscles?|url=http://www.motleyhealth.com/strength/weight-training-intensity-or-volume-for-bigger-muscles|accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), however, the emphasis is different.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nMany trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals; typically, a bodybuilder will aim at sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to a myofibrillar hypertrophy kind of training temporarily in order to move past a plateau. However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\".{{Clarify|date=January 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet. Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more [[Food energy|calories]] than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass. In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with [[cardiovascular exercise]] to lose [[body fat]]. Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to build muscle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Major Nutrients in Food|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/major-nutrients-in-food-topic-overview|publisher=webMd|accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref> The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Manoreem MM, Thompson J, Russo M|title=Diet and exercise strategies of a world-class bodybuilder|journal=Int J Sport Nutr.|volume=3|issue=1|pages=76\u201386|date=March 1993|doi=10.1123/ijsn.3.1.76|pmid=8499940|accessdate=|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/15139f1395bff0699b645bd96461b0e129a3e8d3}}</ref>\n\n==== Carbohydrates ====\n[[Carbohydrate]]s play an important role for bodybuilders. They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery. Carbohydrates also promote secretion of [[insulin]], a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need. Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes [[protein synthesis]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=Rob|title=Coach & Athletic Director|date=March 2002|volume=71|issue=8|page=3}}<!--|accessdate=November 5, 2012-->{{fcn|date=January 2020}}</ref> Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriadis|first=George|last2=Mitrou|first2=Panayota|last3=Lambadiari|first3=Vaia|last4=Maratou|first4=Eirini|last5=Raptis|first5=Sotirios A.|date=August 2011|title=Insulin effects in muscle and adipose tissue|journal=Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice|volume=93|issue=Suppl 1|pages=S52\u201359|doi=10.1016/S0168-8227(11)70014-6|issn=1872-8227|pmid=21864752}}</ref> It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein\u2014which also induces the release of insulin\u2014it is impossible to add muscle mass.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00424-007-0368-2|pmid=17957382|title=Effects of contraction and insulin on protein synthesis, AMP-activated protein kinase and phosphorylation state of translation factors in rat skeletal muscle|journal=Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv|volume=455|issue=6|pages=1129\u201340|year=2007|last1=Miranda|first1=Lisa|last2=Horman|first2=Sandrine|last3=De Potter|first3=Isabelle|last4=Hue|first4=Louis|last5=Jensen|first5=J\u00f8rgen|last6=Rider|first6=Mark H.}}</ref> Bodybuilders seek out [[Glycemic index|low-glycemic]] [[polysaccharide]]s and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-glycemic sugars and starches. This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat. However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure [[Glucose|dextrose]] or [[maltodextrin]]) just before, during, and/or just after a workout. This may help to replenish [[glycogen]] stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite web |last=King|first=Michael W.|title=Substrates for Gluconeogenesis|website=|publisher=IU School of Medicine|url=http://web.indstate.edu/thcme/mwking/gluconeogenesis.html|doi=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n==== Protein ====\n[[File:Protein_shake.jpg|thumb|Protein milkshakes, made from protein powder (center) and milk (left), are a common [[bodybuilding supplement]].]]\nThe motor proteins [[actin]] and [[myosin]] generate the forces exerted by contracting [[muscle]]s.

Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. [[Casein]] or [[Whey protein|whey]] are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. Whey protein is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high [[Biological Value]] (BV) and quick absorption rates. [[Whey protein]] also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0007114511006271|pmid=22289570|title=Greater stimulation of myofibrillar protein synthesis with ingestion of whey protein isolate v.

Bodybuilders are usually thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of [[soy]], which is additionally avoided due to its claimed [[estrogenic]] properties. Still, some nutrition experts believe that soy, [[flax seeds]] and many other plants that contain the weak estrogen-like compounds or [[Phytoestrogens|phytoestrogen]]s, can be used beneficially, as phytoestrogens compete with estrogens for receptor sites in the male body and can block its actions. This can also include some inhibition of [[pituitary]] functions while stimulating the P450 system (the system that eliminates hormones, drugs and metabolic waste product from the body) in the liver to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen.<ref name=\"MikeFalcon\">{{cite web|last=Falcon|first=Mike|url=http://www.maxmuscle.com/index.cfm?fa=article&doc_id=116&subcat=science|title=Estrogens, Testosterone & Phytoestrogens|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025023850/http://www.maxmuscle.com/index.cfm?fa=article&doc_id=116&subcat=science|archive-date=October 25, 2006|website=maxmuscle.com}}</ref><ref name=\"TestosteroneSyndrome\">{{cite book|author1=Eugene Shippen|author2=William Fryer|title=The testosterone syndrome: the critical factor for energy, health, and sexuality: reversing the male menopause|publisher=M.

A combination of one part wheat protein (e.g., [[seitan]]) and two parts soy protein (e.g., [[tofu]]) has thus been favored by many bodybuilders.

There are many reasons why overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts). Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns.<ref name=\"LonnieLowery_Overtraining\">Lowery, Lonnie.

Timely provision of [[carbohydrate]]s, [[Protein (nutrient)|protein]]s, and various micronutrients such as [[vitamin]]s, [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical. A mental disorder, informally called \u201cbigorexia\u201d (by analogy with [[anorexia]]), may account for overtraining in some individuals. Sufferers feel as if they are never big enough or muscular enough, which forces them to overtrain in order to try to reach their goal physique.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mosley|first=Philip E.|date=2009-05-01|title=Bigorexia: bodybuilding and muscle dysmorphia|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|volume=17|issue=3|pages=191\u2013198|doi=10.1002/erv.897|pmid=18759381|issn=1099-0968}}</ref>\n\nAn article by ''[[Muscle & Fitness]]'' magazine, \"Overtrain for Big Gains\", claimed that overtraining for a brief period can be beneficial.

For example, although one major medical dictionary<ref name=\"Dorlands\">{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> considers \"brain death\" to be synonymous with \"cerebral death\" (death of the [[cerebrum]]), the US National Library of Medicine [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the [[brainstem]]. The distinctions are medically significant because, for example, in someone with a dead [[cerebrum]] but a living [[brainstem]], spontaneous breathing may continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes [[brainstem death]]), only [[life support]] equipment would maintain [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. Patients classified as brain-dead can have their organs surgically removed for [[organ donation]].\n\n==Legal history==\n\nTraditionally, both the legal and medical communities determined [[death]] through the permanent end of certain [[Human body|bodily]] functions in [[clinical death]], especially [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]].  With the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration, heartbeat, or other external signs of life, the need for another definition of death occurred, raising questions of [[legal death]]. This gained greater urgency with the widespread use of [[life support]] equipment, as well as rising capabilities and demand for [[organ transplantation]].\n\nSince the 1960s, laws on determining death have, therefore, been implemented in all countries with active organ transplantation programs. The first European country to adopt brain death as a legal definition (or indicator) of death was [[Finland]] in 1971. In the [[United States]], [[Kansas]] had enacted a similar law earlier.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | author=(Randell T. | title=Medical and legal considerations of brain death | journal=Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica | volume=48 | issue=2 | year=2004 | pages=139\u2013144 | pmid=14995934 | doi=10.1111/j.0001-5172.2004.00304.x}}</ref>\n\nAn ''[[ad hoc]]'' committee at [[Harvard Medical School]] published a pivotal 1968 report to define irreversible [[coma]].<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1968 | title = A definition of irreversible coma: report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 205 | issue = 6| pages = 337\u201340 | doi=10.1001/jama.1968.03140320031009| pmid = 5694976 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAz4nl35KkIC&pg=PA59|title=Life-sustaining technologies and the elderly.|publisher=DIANE Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781428922815|year=1987}}</ref> The Harvard criteria gradually gained consensus toward what is now known as brain death. In the wake of the 1976 [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]], state legislatures in the United States moved to accept brain death as an acceptable indication of death. In 1981 a Presidential commission issued a landmark report \u2013 ''Defining Death: Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in the Determination of Death'' <ref>{{cite document|title=Defining death: a report on the medical, legal and ethical issues in the determination of death|hdl=1805/707|date=July 1981}}</ref> \u2013 that rejected the \"higher brain\" approach to death in favor of a \"whole brain\" definition.

J Roy Coll Physns of London 1995;29:381-2</ref> This new definition, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and for spontaneous breathing, and the essentially unchanged 1976 tests held to establish that state, have been adopted as a basis of death certification for organ transplant purposes in subsequent Codes of Practice.<ref>A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death.

(2000, January 13).Spontaneous Movements Often Occur After Brain Death.Science Daily.</ref> The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) states that the \"determination of brain death requires that there is unresponsive coma, the absence of brain-stem reflexes and the absence of respiratory centre function, in the clinical setting in which these findings are irreversible. In particular, there must be definite clinical or neuro-imaging evidence of acute brain pathology (e.g. traumatic brain injury, intracranial haemorrhage, hypoxic encephalopathy) consistent with the irreversible loss of neurological function.\"<ref>http://www.anzics.com.au/Downloads/ANZICS%20Statement%20on%20%20Death%20and%20Organ%20Donation%20Edition%203.2.pdf</ref>\n\n==Medical criteria==\nNatural movements also known as the [[Lazarus sign]] or Lazarus reflex can occur on a brain-dead person whose organs have been kept functioning by life support. The living cells that can cause these movements are not living cells from the brain or brain stem; these cells come from the spinal cord. Sometimes these body movements can cause false hope for family members.\n\nA brain-dead individual has no clinical evidence of brain function upon [[physical examination]]. This includes no response to [[pain]] and no [[cranial nerve]] [[reflex]]es. Reflexes include [[Pupil constriction|pupillary response]] (fixed pupils), [[oculocephalic reflex]], [[corneal reflex]], no response to the [[caloric reflex test]], and no spontaneous [[Respiratory system|respiration]]s.\n\nBrain death can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from other medical states such as [[barbiturate overdose]], [[alcohol intoxication]], [[sedative]] overdose, [[hypothermia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[coma]], and chronic [[vegetative states]]. Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with [[anencephaly]].\n\nBrain electrical activity can stop completely, or drop to such a low level as to be undetectable with most equipment. An [[electroencephalogram|EEG]] will therefore be flat, though this is sometimes also observed during deep [[anesthesia]] or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Karasawa | first1 = H | display-authors = etal   | date = Jan 2001 | title = Intracranial electroencephalographic changes in deep anesthesia | url = | journal = Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 25\u201330 | pmid = 11137657 | doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(00)00510-1}}</ref> Although in the United States a flat EEG test is not required to certify death, it is considered to have confirmatory value. In the UK it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it might reveal in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the Code of Practice criteria.<ref>A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis of Death. Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, 70 Wimpole Street, London, 2008</ref>\n\nThe diagnosis of brain death is often required to be highly rigorous, in order to be certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK),<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/5/760.full |title=Difficulty in brainstem death testing in the presence of high spinal cord injury |first=C.

For example, although one major medical dictionary<ref name=\"Dorlands\">{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> considers \"brain death\" to be synonymous with \"cerebral death\" (death of the [[cerebrum]]), the US National Library of Medicine [[Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) system defines brain death as including the [[brainstem]]. The distinctions are medically significant because, for example, in someone with a dead [[cerebrum]] but a living [[brainstem]], spontaneous breathing may continue unaided, whereas in whole-brain death (which includes [[brainstem death]]), only [[life support]] equipment would maintain [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. Patients classified as brain-dead can have their organs surgically removed for [[organ donation]].\n\n==Legal history==\n\nTraditionally, both the legal and medical communities determined [[death]] through the permanent end of certain [[Human body|bodily]] functions in [[clinical death]], especially [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] and [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]].  With the increasing ability of the medical community to resuscitate people with no respiration, heartbeat, or other external signs of life, the need for another definition of death occurred, raising questions of [[legal death]]. This gained greater urgency with the widespread use of [[life support]] equipment, as well as rising capabilities and demand for [[organ transplantation]].\n\nSince the 1960s, laws on determining death have, therefore, been implemented in all countries with active organ transplantation programs. The first European country to adopt brain death as a legal definition (or indicator) of death was [[Finland]] in 1971. In the [[United States]], [[Kansas]] had enacted a similar law earlier.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | author=(Randell T. | title=Medical and legal considerations of brain death | journal=Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica | volume=48 | issue=2 | year=2004 | pages=139\u2013144 | pmid=14995934 | doi=10.1111/j.0001-5172.2004.00304.x}}</ref>\n\nAn ''[[ad hoc]]'' committee at [[Harvard Medical School]] published a pivotal 1968 report to define irreversible [[coma]].<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1968 | title = A definition of irreversible coma: report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Harvard Medical School to Examine the Definition of Brain Death | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 205 | issue = 6| pages = 337\u201340 | doi=10.1001/jama.1968.03140320031009| pmid = 5694976 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAz4nl35KkIC&pg=PA59|title=Life-sustaining technologies and the elderly.|publisher=DIANE Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9781428922815|year=1987}}</ref> The Harvard criteria gradually gained consensus toward what is now known as brain death. In the wake of the 1976 [[Karen Ann Quinlan case]], state legislatures in the United States moved to accept brain death as an acceptable indication of death. In 1981 a Presidential commission issued a landmark report \u2013 ''Defining Death: Medical, Legal, and Ethical Issues in the Determination of Death'' <ref>{{cite document|title=Defining death: a report on the medical, legal and ethical issues in the determination of death|hdl=1805/707|date=July 1981}}</ref> \u2013 that rejected the \"higher brain\" approach to death in favor of a \"whole brain\" definition. This report was the basis for the [[Uniform Determination of Death Act]], which has been enacted in 39 states of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legislative Fact Sheet \u2013 Determination of Death Act|url=http://uniformlaws.org/LegislativeFactSheet.aspx?title=Determination%20of%20Death%20Act|publisher=Uniform Law Commission|accessdate=8 May 2012}}</ref> The Uniform Determination of Death Act in the United States attempts to standardize criteria. Today, both the legal and medical communities in the US use \"brain death\" as a legal definition of death, allowing a person to be declared [[legal death|legally dead]] even if life support equipment keeps the body's metabolic processes working.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pntb.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Uniform-Determination-of-Death-1980_5c.pdf | title=Uniform Determination of Death Act | publisher=National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws| accessdate=26 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the Royal College of Physicians reported in 1995, abandoning the 1979 claim that the tests published in 1976 sufficed for the diagnosis of brain death and suggesting a new definition of death based on the irreversible loss of brain stem function alone.<ref>Criteria for the diagnosis of brain stem death. J Roy Coll Physns of London 1995;29:381-2</ref> This new definition, the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness and for spontaneous breathing, and the essentially unchanged 1976 tests held to establish that state, have been adopted as a basis of death certification for organ transplant purposes in subsequent Codes of Practice.<ref>A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death. Academy of Medical Royal Colleges. 70 Wimpole Street, London, 2008</ref><ref>American Academy of Neurology. (2000, January 13).Spontaneous Movements Often Occur After Brain Death.Science Daily.</ref> The Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society (ANZICS) states that the \"determination of brain death requires that there is unresponsive coma, the absence of brain-stem reflexes and the absence of respiratory centre function, in the clinical setting in which these findings are irreversible. In particular, there must be definite clinical or neuro-imaging evidence of acute brain pathology (e.g. traumatic brain injury, intracranial haemorrhage, hypoxic encephalopathy) consistent with the irreversible loss of neurological function.\"<ref>http://www.anzics.com.au/Downloads/ANZICS%20Statement%20on%20%20Death%20and%20Organ%20Donation%20Edition%203.2.pdf</ref>\n\n==Medical criteria==\nNatural movements also known as the [[Lazarus sign]] or Lazarus reflex can occur on a brain-dead person whose organs have been kept functioning by life support. The living cells that can cause these movements are not living cells from the brain or brain stem; these cells come from the spinal cord. Sometimes these body movements can cause false hope for family members.\n\nA brain-dead individual has no clinical evidence of brain function upon [[physical examination]]. This includes no response to [[pain]] and no [[cranial nerve]] [[reflex]]es. Reflexes include [[Pupil constriction|pupillary response]] (fixed pupils), [[oculocephalic reflex]], [[corneal reflex]], no response to the [[caloric reflex test]], and no spontaneous [[Respiratory system|respiration]]s.\n\nBrain death can sometimes be difficult to differentiate from other medical states such as [[barbiturate overdose]], [[alcohol intoxication]], [[sedative]] overdose, [[hypothermia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[coma]], and chronic [[vegetative states]]. Some comatose patients can recover to pre-coma or near pre-coma level of functioning, and some patients with severe irreversible neurological dysfunction will nonetheless retain some lower brain functions, such as spontaneous respiration, despite the losses of both cortex and brain stem functionality. Such is the case with [[anencephaly]].\n\nBrain electrical activity can stop completely, or drop to such a low level as to be undetectable with most equipment. An [[electroencephalogram|EEG]] will therefore be flat, though this is sometimes also observed during deep [[anesthesia]] or [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Karasawa | first1 = H | display-authors = etal   | date = Jan 2001 | title = Intracranial electroencephalographic changes in deep anesthesia | url = | journal = Clin Neurophysiol | volume = 112 | issue = 1| pages = 25\u201330 | pmid = 11137657 | doi=10.1016/s1388-2457(00)00510-1}}</ref> Although in the United States a flat EEG test is not required to certify death, it is considered to have confirmatory value. In the UK it is not considered to be of value because any continuing activity it might reveal in parts of the brain above the brain stem is held to be irrelevant to the diagnosis of death on the Code of Practice criteria.<ref>A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis of Death. Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, 70 Wimpole Street, London, 2008</ref>\n\nThe diagnosis of brain death is often required to be highly rigorous, in order to be certain that the condition is irreversible. Legal criteria vary, but in general require neurological examinations by two independent physicians. The exams must show complete and irreversible absence of brain function (brain stem function in UK),<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/5/760.full |title=Difficulty in brainstem death testing in the presence of high spinal cord injury |first=C.
