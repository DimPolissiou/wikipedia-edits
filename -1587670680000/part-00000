The film stars [[Jane Withers]], [[O. P. Heggie]], [[Jackie Searl]], [[Katharine Alexander]], and [[Walter Woolf King]]. It was Wither's first starring role.\n \n==Plot==\nJeanette Tracy, known to her friends as Ginger, is an 8-year-old orphan living in a New York slum apartment with her \"Uncle Rex\", an aging Shakespearean actor. Their poor but happy existence is framed by lines from famous Shakespearean plays which they recite to each other; their favorite is the balcony scene from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. One day a probation officer comes to the apartment and threatens to take Ginger away if she doesn't stop skipping school and Uncle Rex remains unemployed. Uncle Rex says he has found a job at the casting office and Ginger assures the officer that she will be a model student from now on. It turns out that Uncle Rex's new job is as a sidewalk hawker for a movie theater, and he is arrested when he attacks the manager who insults his Shakespearean acting. Unable to pay the $30 fine, he is sent to jail for 30 days.\n\nGinger steals small metal pieces from stores to come up with money to pay the fine and is caught and brought before a judge. He suggests that the well-to-do Mrs. Parker, who is writing a book about child-raising called ''Are Children Human?'' take her into her own home. Mrs. Parker's son, Hamilton, is the product of her ideas: an effeminate, snobbish, harp-playing youth. The contrast between Hamilton and Ginger is stark, as Ginger is a tomboy, speaks slang, and lacks table manners. But Mr. Parker, who disapproves of his wife's child-raising ideas, takes a liking to Ginger and offers to bail out Uncle Rex. When he brings him home to pick up Ginger, Uncle Rex is so overwhelmed by the elegant house and the opportunities that wealth can afford for Ginger's future that he runs out on her. He is struck by a car and spends several months in a hospital with [[aphasia]]. \n\nAs the months pass, Ginger becomes more and more cultured while Hamilton becomes more streetwise. When they are taken out for a ride on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] day, Ginger spots her old gang and Hamilton gets into a fight with an older boy who has taken Ginger's dog. Hamilton wins the fight. Back home, Ginger overhears Mrs. Parker reading from her book to her ladies' club, describing how uncouth Ginger was when she came to her and asserting that Uncle Rex isn't her real uncle at all, but a friend of her deceased actor-parents. Ginger becomes inconsolable and runs away with Hamilton back to her slum apartment. There they find Uncle Rex, who has found his way home. The Parkers join them there, having made up with one another after Mrs. Parker agrees to be more \"human\" in her child-raising efforts.\n\n==Cast== \n*[[Jane Withers]] as Ginger\n*[[O. P.

Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on [[caster sugar]] which has crystals of approximately 0.35&nbsp;mm.\n\n{{wiktionary|brown sugar}}\n\n==Production==\nBrown sugar is often produced by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control the ratio of molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. Brown sugar prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined brown sugar, washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses.\n\nThe molasses usually used for food is obtained from [[sugar cane]], because the flavor is generally preferred over [[Molasses#Sugar beet molasses|beet sugar molasses]], although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, [[sugar beet]] molasses is used. The white sugar used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, [[nutritional value]], color, and taste of fully refined white sugar is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the white sugar will be masked by the molasses.\n\n==History==\nIn the late 19th century, the newly consolidated refined white sugar industry, which did not have full control over brown sugar production, mounted a [[smear campaign]] against brown sugar, reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in brown sugar. The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that brown sugar was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by \"a minute insect\".<ref name=\"revolution\">Levenstein, Harvey.

Products for industrial use (e.g., the industrial production of cakes) may be based on [[caster sugar]] which has crystals of approximately 0.35&nbsp;mm.\n\n{{wiktionary|brown sugar}}\n\n==Production==\nBrown sugar is often produced by adding sugarcane molasses to completely refined white sugar crystals to more carefully control the ratio of molasses to sugar crystals and to reduce manufacturing costs. Brown sugar prepared in this manner is often much coarser than its unrefined equivalent and its molasses may be easily separated from the crystals by simply washing to reveal the underlying white sugar crystals; in contrast, with unrefined brown sugar, washing will reveal underlying crystals which are off-white due to the inclusion of molasses.\n\nThe molasses usually used for food is obtained from [[sugar cane]], because the flavor is generally preferred over [[Molasses#Sugar beet molasses|beet sugar molasses]], although in some areas, especially in Belgium and the Netherlands, [[sugar beet]] molasses is used. The white sugar used can be from either beet or cane, as the chemical composition, [[nutritional value]], color, and taste of fully refined white sugar is for practical purposes the same, no matter from what plant it originates. Even with less-than-perfect refining, the small differences in color, odor, and taste of the white sugar will be masked by the molasses.\n\n==History==\nIn the late 19th century, the newly consolidated refined white sugar industry, which did not have full control over brown sugar production, mounted a [[smear campaign]] against brown sugar, reproducing microscopic photographs of harmless but repulsive-looking microbes living in brown sugar. The effort was so successful that by 1900, a best-selling cookbook warned that brown sugar was of inferior quality and was susceptible to infestation by \"a minute insect\".<ref name=\"revolution\">Levenstein, Harvey.

Its current theme music, \"[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]\" (which debuted in 1985) was composed by [[John Williams]].\n\n==History==\n\n===John Chancellor and David Brinkley (1970\u20131982)===\n[[File:Nightlynews1974.jpg|thumb|left|''NBC Nightly News'' title card, used from 1972 to 1975.]]\n''NBC Nightly News'' replaced ''[[The Huntley\u2013Brinkley Report]]'' in August 1970 upon [[Chet Huntley]]'s retirement. At first, [[David Brinkley]], [[John Chancellor]], and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] rotated duties as anchors. At least one, usually two, and very rarely all three anchored the program on a given night. Except for the few nights when one of the men solo anchored, each evening's program included one [[news anchor|anchor]] based in [[New York City]] and one in [[Washington, D.C.]], as had been the case on the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report''. Brinkley's appearances were always from Washington and McGee's were always from New York. Chancellor moved between those two cities depending on his partner for the evening.\n\nIn addition to Brinkley as a holdover from the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'', McGee had earned praise for his anchoring or co-anchoring of space flights, and Chancellor had also earned praise as McGee's co-anchor for the space missions of [[Apollo 12]] and [[Apollo 13]].\n\n[[File:Brinkleynbcnightlynews.jpg|thumb|left|Brinkley provided commentary several times per week in the 1970s.]]\nWith network executives perceiving the instability of this arrangement as a factor in ''Nightly News'' losing [[audience]] share to the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', NBC discontinued the rotation arrangement, and McGee eventually took over for [[Hugh Downs]] as host of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''. Chancellor became the sole anchor of the program on August 9, 1971, with Brinkley providing a three-minute commentary segment, \"David Brinkley's Journal,\" from Washington several times a week.\n\nOn June 7, 1976, NBC brought Brinkley back to the anchor desk and tried the dual-anchor approach once again. Initially, Chancellor and Brinkley both reported from New York City, however Brinkley would later return to Washington. Chancellor again became sole anchor of ''Nightly News'' on October 10, 1979, with Brinkley once again providing commentaries until he left NBC for [[ABC News]] in 1981, where he became host of that network's new [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning interview show]] ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]''.\n\nDespite the various changes, Chancellor was never able to break the grip that [[Walter Cronkite]] and the ''CBS Evening News'' had on the American news viewer, although ''Nightly News'' was sometimes a strong second place in the evening news ratings for most of the 1970s. After stepping down from the anchor desk on April 2, 1982, Chancellor remained on the program as an editorial commentator until his retirement in 1993.\n\n===Tom Brokaw (1982\u20132004)===\nOn April 5, 1982, [[Tom Brokaw]], who had been serving as anchor of ''Today'' since 1976, joined the program and took over co-anchor duties in New York City, while [[Roger Mudd]] became anchor in Washington. Mudd was dropped from the broadcast and Brokaw became the solo anchor of ''Nightly News'' on September 5, 1983, the same day that his ABC competitor, [[Peter Jennings]], became sole anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]''. With Brokaw being the sole anchor, the ''Nightly News'' was now completely based in New York City. Among other news items, he covered the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]], the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and [[Hurricane Andrew]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. He was the only network anchor in [[Berlin]] when the [[Berlin Wall]] fell. Brokaw's presence slowly attracted viewers, and during the 1990s, ''Nightly News'' battled for the viewership lead with ''World News Tonight''. He and [[Katie Couric]] hosted a prime-time [[newsmagazine]], ''[[Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric]]'', that aired from 1993 to 1994 before being folded into the multi-night ''Dateline NBC'' program. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} By 1997, ''NBC Nightly News'' had solidified its first place standing in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], a spot it would retain solely for ten years. The once-dominant ''CBS Evening News'', anchored by [[Dan Rather]], had lost a substantial portion of the audience it held during the Walter Cronkite era and slid to third place (where it still remains as of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/media/scott-pelley-cbs-evening-news.html|title=Scott Pelley Said to Be Leaving Post as \u2018CBS Evening News\u2019 Anchor|publisher=}}</ref>) in the viewership wars.\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin with Tom Brokaw-1.jpg|thumb|right|Brokaw with [[Vladimir Putin]] before an interview on June 2, 2000.]]\nOn [[September 11, 2001]], Brokaw joined [[Katie Couric]] and [[Matt Lauer]] around 9:30&nbsp;a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw said:\n\n{{cquote|This is war.  This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20010912owentv4p4.asp|title=Tuned In: This was reality TV at its most horrific|publisher=Post-gazette.com|date= September 12, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-04|first=Rob|last=Owen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16ArLMUwAE|title=NBC World Trade Center Part 12: YouTube (accessed 2009-11-22)|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref>}}\n\nOn May 28, 2002, Brokaw announced his retirement as anchor of ''Nightly News'', to take effect shortly after the [[United States Presidential election, 2004|Presidential election in 2004]]. During this last time helming the network's Presidential election coverage, NBC graphic designers created images of a giant electoral map on the ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza, and [[cherry picker]]s tallied the electoral vote count on the facade of [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] (this tradition has continued with each election since then). Brokaw's final broadcast took place on December 1, 2004, ending 22 years on the ''Nightly News'' desk and a 21-year run as the network's chief newsman \u2013 a record tenure in NBC's history.\n\n===Brian Williams (2004\u20132015)===\n[[Brian Williams]], a frequent substitute for Brokaw for ''NBC Nightly News'', succeeded him as the program's permanent anchor on December 2, 2004. The program held onto the #1 ratings spot among the network evening newscasts from Williams' first day, averaging about 10 million viewers each week until February 2007, when it slipped behind its closest competitor ''World News with Charles Gibson''. However, ''NBC Nightly News'' regained the lead a few months later; it has now been America's most-watched evening newscast for over a decade.\n\nWilliams rose to new levels of popularity for his live [[spot news|spot reporting]] during and after the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 hurricane season]]. With the transition to Williams, the show recognized its past in its opening seconds, with small photos of past anchors and sets and the voices of [[John Cameron Swayze]], Huntley, Brinkley, Chancellor, and Brokaw, as well as an orchestral version of the \"G-E-C\" [[NBC chimes|NBC Chimes]] serving as an intro bumper, before going into the opening headlines summary read by Williams; this montage was discontinued on September 17, 2007. On December 4, 2006, ''Nightly News'' was presented with \"limited commercial interruptions\" through a sponsorship arrangement with [[Philips]], marking the first time in its 36-year history that the newscast experimented with reduced advertising.\n\n[[File:NBC Nightly News Broadcast.jpg|thumb|left|''NBC Nightly News'' [[Television studio#Production control room|control room]].]]\nDuring Williams' tenure as main anchor of the program, [[Lester Holt]] and [[Kate Snow]] often substituted while he was on vacation or on assignment; other substitute anchors included [[Savannah Guthrie]], [[Tamron Hall]], [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], [[Jenna Wolfe]], [[Erica Hill]], [[Hoda Kotb]], [[Natalie Morales (journalist)|Natalie Morales]] and [[Carl Quintanilla]], as well as now-former NBC anchors [[Ann Curry]], [[Campbell Brown (journalist)|Campbell Brown]], [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], [[Amy Robach]] and [[John Seigenthaler (anchorman)|John Seigenthaler]].\n\n''NBC Nightly News'' began broadcasting in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on March 26, 2007, becoming the first of the three network evening news programs to make the transition (the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' began broadcasting in HD on January 7, 2008; ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' began broadcasting in HD on August 25, 2008, during its coverage of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]]). Most news video from on-remote locations continued to be shot in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] at the time, while the network's news bureaus underwent a conversion to HD, which was completed in 2009.\n\nThe ''Nightly News'' set in [[GE Building#NBC Studio productions|Studio 3C]], which had been in use since January 27, 1992, was retired on May 4, 2007. The broadcast temporarily relocated to Studio 8G on the same set as of May 8, 2007 used for the studio segments seen during the network's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' broadcasts and its [[Football Night in America|pregame show]], and where NBC's 2006 Congressional election coverage originated.

Williams issued an apology, saying he had \"misremembered\" the story in his head and it had been a genuine accident, but many critics accused Williams of fabricating the story and called for his resignation.

Four years later, NBC correspondents Ray Scherer and [[Robert MacNeil]] were partnered at the anchor desk on ''The Scherer-MacNeil Report'' on Saturdays, continuing until 1967. At that time, the network replaced it with a second weekend airing of ''The Frank McGee Report'', which had been airing on Sundays for several years by that point.<ref>Castleman and Podrazik, ''The TV Schedule Book'', McGraw-Hill Paperbacks, 1984</ref> The Saturday edition of the ''Report'' ran for about a year and a half.\n\nOn January 4, 1969, the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'' was expanded to Saturday evenings, with the main anchors working solo on alternating weeks. When lower-than-expected ratings occurred, the network pulled the pair off Saturdays and assigned others such as McGee and Vanocur to anchor the broadcast. On August 2, 1970, two days after the weekday ''Huntley-Brinkley'' broadcast ended, the network expanded its evening newscast to Sundays, which also replaced the Sunday broadcast of ''The Frank McGee Report''. For the first year after the Sunday broadcast began, Chancellor, Brinkley and McGee rotated on the program as they did on weeknights; there were no separate weekend anchors. The Saturday and Sunday broadcasts were respectively titled ''NBC Saturday Night News'' and ''NBC Sunday Night News'' until sometime in the 1970s, when they adopted the ''NBC Nightly News'' name.\n\nWhen Chancellor became sole anchor of the weeknight editions in August 1971, a separate anchor was named for the weekend editions.\n\nThe weekend editions may occasionally be abbreviated or preempted due to [[NBC Sports]] telecasts (such as [[Golf Channel on NBC|golf tournaments]], [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame football games]] and [[Thoroughbred Racing on NBC|Thoroughbred Racing tournaments]]) that overrun into the program's time slot.

First aired on August 3, 1970, the program is currently the most watched network newscast in the United States, with an average of 9.3 million viewers, just a few thousand more than its nearest rival, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympics Help NBC's News Shows to Ratings Win|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/02/business/media/02tele.html|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 1, 2010|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Evening News Ratings |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/evening_news_ratings/ |author=Chris Ariens |magazine=[[AdWeek|TVNewser]] |publisher=[[Mediabistro.com]] |accessdate=March 12, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822125723/http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/evening_news_ratings/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 }}</ref> ''NBC Nightly News'' is produced from Studio 3C at [[NBC Studios (New York City)|NBC Studios]] at [[30 Rockefeller Plaza|30 Rockefeller Center]] in [[New York City]].

Previous anchors have included [[John Chancellor]], [[David Brinkley]], [[Tom Brokaw]] and [[Brian Williams]].\n\nThe program is broadcast live over most NBC stations from 6:30 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] seven days a week; the \"Western Edition\" of the program occasionally features breaking news and/or updated information on news stories covered during the original telecast for [[Pacific Time Zone]] viewers. Its current theme music, \"[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]\" (which debuted in 1985) was composed by [[John Williams]].\n\n==History==\n\n===John Chancellor and David Brinkley (1970\u20131982)===\n[[File:Nightlynews1974.jpg|thumb|left|''NBC Nightly News'' title card, used from 1972 to 1975.]]\n''NBC Nightly News'' replaced ''[[The Huntley\u2013Brinkley Report]]'' in August 1970 upon [[Chet Huntley]]'s retirement. At first, [[David Brinkley]], [[John Chancellor]], and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] rotated duties as anchors. At least one, usually two, and very rarely all three anchored the program on a given night. Except for the few nights when one of the men solo anchored, each evening's program included one [[news anchor|anchor]] based in [[New York City]] and one in [[Washington, D.C.]], as had been the case on the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report''. Brinkley's appearances were always from Washington and McGee's were always from New York. Chancellor moved between those two cities depending on his partner for the evening.\n\nIn addition to Brinkley as a holdover from the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'', McGee had earned praise for his anchoring or co-anchoring of space flights, and Chancellor had also earned praise as McGee's co-anchor for the space missions of [[Apollo 12]] and [[Apollo 13]].\n\n[[File:Brinkleynbcnightlynews.jpg|thumb|left|Brinkley provided commentary several times per week in the 1970s.]]\nWith network executives perceiving the instability of this arrangement as a factor in ''Nightly News'' losing [[audience]] share to the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', NBC discontinued the rotation arrangement, and McGee eventually took over for [[Hugh Downs]] as host of ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]''. Chancellor became the sole anchor of the program on August 9, 1971, with Brinkley providing a three-minute commentary segment, \"David Brinkley's Journal,\" from Washington several times a week.\n\nOn June 7, 1976, NBC brought Brinkley back to the anchor desk and tried the dual-anchor approach once again. Initially, Chancellor and Brinkley both reported from New York City, however Brinkley would later return to Washington. Chancellor again became sole anchor of ''Nightly News'' on October 10, 1979, with Brinkley once again providing commentaries until he left NBC for [[ABC News]] in 1981, where he became host of that network's new [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning interview show]] ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]''.\n\nDespite the various changes, Chancellor was never able to break the grip that [[Walter Cronkite]] and the ''CBS Evening News'' had on the American news viewer, although ''Nightly News'' was sometimes a strong second place in the evening news ratings for most of the 1970s. After stepping down from the anchor desk on April 2, 1982, Chancellor remained on the program as an editorial commentator until his retirement in 1993.\n\n===Tom Brokaw (1982\u20132004)===\nOn April 5, 1982, [[Tom Brokaw]], who had been serving as anchor of ''Today'' since 1976, joined the program and took over co-anchor duties in New York City, while [[Roger Mudd]] became anchor in Washington. Mudd was dropped from the broadcast and Brokaw became the solo anchor of ''Nightly News'' on September 5, 1983, the same day that his ABC competitor, [[Peter Jennings]], became sole anchor of ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]''. With Brokaw being the sole anchor, the ''Nightly News'' was now completely based in New York City. Among other news items, he covered the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster]], [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]], [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]], the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], and [[Hurricane Andrew]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Vladimir Putin]]. He was the only network anchor in [[Berlin]] when the [[Berlin Wall]] fell. Brokaw's presence slowly attracted viewers, and during the 1990s, ''Nightly News'' battled for the viewership lead with ''World News Tonight''. He and [[Katie Couric]] hosted a prime-time [[newsmagazine]], ''[[Now with Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric]]'', that aired from 1993 to 1994 before being folded into the multi-night ''Dateline NBC'' program. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} By 1997, ''NBC Nightly News'' had solidified its first place standing in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], a spot it would retain solely for ten years. The once-dominant ''CBS Evening News'', anchored by [[Dan Rather]], had lost a substantial portion of the audience it held during the Walter Cronkite era and slid to third place (where it still remains as of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/business/media/scott-pelley-cbs-evening-news.html|title=Scott Pelley Said to Be Leaving Post as \u2018CBS Evening News\u2019 Anchor|publisher=}}</ref>) in the viewership wars.\n\n[[File:Vladimir Putin with Tom Brokaw-1.jpg|thumb|right|Brokaw with [[Vladimir Putin]] before an interview on June 2, 2000.]]\nOn [[September 11, 2001]], Brokaw joined [[Katie Couric]] and [[Matt Lauer]] around 9:30&nbsp;a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]], and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw said:\n\n{{cquote|This is war.  This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20010912owentv4p4.asp|title=Tuned In: This was reality TV at its most horrific|publisher=Post-gazette.com|date= September 12, 2001|accessdate=2008-11-04|first=Rob|last=Owen}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16ArLMUwAE|title=NBC World Trade Center Part 12: YouTube (accessed 2009-11-22)|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2007-11-21|accessdate=2011-11-27}}</ref>}}\n\nOn May 28, 2002, Brokaw announced his retirement as anchor of ''Nightly News'', to take effect shortly after the [[United States Presidential election, 2004|Presidential election in 2004]]. During this last time helming the network's Presidential election coverage, NBC graphic designers created images of a giant electoral map on the ice rink at Rockefeller Plaza, and [[cherry picker]]s tallied the electoral vote count on the facade of [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]] (this tradition has continued with each election since then). Brokaw's final broadcast took place on December 1, 2004, ending 22 years on the ''Nightly News'' desk and a 21-year run as the network's chief newsman \u2013 a record tenure in NBC's history.\n\n===Brian Williams (2004\u20132015)===\n[[Brian Williams]], a frequent substitute for Brokaw for ''NBC Nightly News'', succeeded him as the program's permanent anchor on December 2, 2004. The program held onto the #1 ratings spot among the network evening newscasts from Williams' first day, averaging about 10 million viewers each week until February 2007, when it slipped behind its closest competitor ''World News with Charles Gibson''. However, ''NBC Nightly News'' regained the lead a few months later; it has now been America's most-watched evening newscast for over a decade.\n\nWilliams rose to new levels of popularity for his live [[spot news|spot reporting]] during and after the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005 hurricane season]]. With the transition to Williams, the show recognized its past in its opening seconds, with small photos of past anchors and sets and the voices of [[John Cameron Swayze]], Huntley, Brinkley, Chancellor, and Brokaw, as well as an orchestral version of the \"G-E-C\" [[NBC chimes|NBC Chimes]] serving as an intro bumper, before going into the opening headlines summary read by Williams; this montage was discontinued on September 17, 2007. On December 4, 2006, ''Nightly News'' was presented with \"limited commercial interruptions\" through a sponsorship arrangement with [[Philips]], marking the first time in its 36-year history that the newscast experimented with reduced advertising.\n\n[[File:NBC Nightly News Broadcast.jpg|thumb|left|''NBC Nightly News'' [[Television studio#Production control room|control room]].]]\nDuring Williams' tenure as main anchor of the program, [[Lester Holt]] and [[Kate Snow]] often substituted while he was on vacation or on assignment; other substitute anchors included [[Savannah Guthrie]], [[Tamron Hall]], [[Harry Smith (US journalist)|Harry Smith]], [[Jenna Wolfe]], [[Erica Hill]], [[Hoda Kotb]], [[Natalie Morales (journalist)|Natalie Morales]] and [[Carl Quintanilla]], as well as now-former NBC anchors [[Ann Curry]], [[Campbell Brown (journalist)|Campbell Brown]], [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], [[Amy Robach]] and [[John Seigenthaler (anchorman)|John Seigenthaler]].\n\n''NBC Nightly News'' began broadcasting in [[high-definition television|high definition]] on March 26, 2007, becoming the first of the three network evening news programs to make the transition (the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' began broadcasting in HD on January 7, 2008; ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]'' began broadcasting in HD on August 25, 2008, during its coverage of the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]]). Most news video from on-remote locations continued to be shot in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] at the time, while the network's news bureaus underwent a conversion to HD, which was completed in 2009.\n\nThe ''Nightly News'' set in [[GE Building#NBC Studio productions|Studio 3C]], which had been in use since January 27, 1992, was retired on May 4, 2007. The broadcast temporarily relocated to Studio 8G on the same set as of May 8, 2007 used for the studio segments seen during the network's ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' broadcasts and its [[Football Night in America|pregame show]], and where NBC's 2006 Congressional election coverage originated. After months of construction, Studio 3C was re-opened on October 22, 2007, with the introduction of a new set for ''Nightly News''; sister cable network [[MSNBC]]'s new set in Studio 3A was also inaugurated at that time. On October 24, 2011, the broadcast moved to Studio 3B, which also served as the homebase of Williams' short-lived newsmagazine for NBC, ''[[Rock Center with Brian Williams|Rock Center]]''.\n\n====Embellishment scandal/suspension and replacement====\nOn February 4, 2015, Williams apologized on the program for having [[Brian Williams#False claims about helicopter incident in Iraq war reporting|\u201cconflated\u201d on numerous occasions]] an account that he had been aboard a [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|Chinook helicopter]] shot down by enemy fire from a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] while covering the [[Invasion of Iraq]] in 2003, when he was in fact aboard a helicopter that followed behind it. This came after he received criticism by U.S. soldiers for embellishing the story when a segment from the January 30 broadcast recounting the incident was posted on the program's [[Facebook]] page.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Williams admits that his story of coming under fire while in Iraq was false|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/brian-williams-admits-that-his-story-of-coming-under-fire-while-in-iraq-was-false/2015/02/04/d7fe32d0-acc0-11e4-9c91-e9d2f9fde644_story.html?tid=sm_fb|author=Paul Farhi|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=February 4, 2015|accessdate=February 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Soldiers blasted Brian Williams about Iraq War story, calling him a \u2018liar\u2019 and \u2018a fake\u2019 ahead of news anchor's confession|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/brian-williams-blasted-soldiers-iraq-war-story-article-1.2104986|author=Nina Golgowski|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=February 5, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Brian Williams Faces \u2018Fact-Checking\u2019 Inquiry at NBC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/business/media/brian-williams-helicopter-incident-in-iraq.html?_r=0=|author=Emily Steel|work=The New York Times|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref> The revelation spurred negative press towards Williams, including some asking for him to be fired by NBC News, although [[Paul Rieckhoff]], founder of [[Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America]], stated that \u201cpersecuting [Williams] over this mistake will do little to help our veterans and service members\u201d.<ref>{{cite news|title=Should Brian Williams be fired?|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/tv/tv-guy/os-should-brian-williams-be-fired-20150206-post.html|author=Hal Boedeker|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=February 6, 2015|accessdate=February 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:2012 Lester Holt by US Army (cropped) 2.jpg|thumb|left|Lester Holt, current anchor of ''NBC Nightly News'']]\n\nAmid that controversy and [[Brian Williams#Hurricane Katrina reporting questioned|questions over Williams' claims]] that made regarding his experiences while reporting from [[New Orleans]] on the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005, including that he contracted [[dysentery]] from accidentally ingesting flood water, the news division decided to launch an internal investigation into the matter that would be conducted through its investigative unit.

Williams claimed to have been reporting in Iraq in 2002 when the helicopter he was traveling on was hit by an RPG and he was forced to land. He had told the story several times, including his appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and on ''Nightly News'' itself only a few nights before several war veterans who had been with Williams in 2002 claimed that Williams had not been present at the time of the crash, but showed up about an hour later to report on it. Williams issued an apology, saying he had \"misremembered\" the story in his head and it had been a genuine accident, but many critics accused Williams of fabricating the story and called for his resignation.

Four years later, NBC correspondents Ray Scherer and [[Robert MacNeil]] were partnered at the anchor desk on ''The Scherer-MacNeil Report'' on Saturdays, continuing until 1967. At that time, the network replaced it with a second weekend airing of ''The Frank McGee Report'', which had been airing on Sundays for several years by that point.<ref>Castleman and Podrazik, ''The TV Schedule Book'', McGraw-Hill Paperbacks, 1984</ref> The Saturday edition of the ''Report'' ran for about a year and a half.\n\nOn January 4, 1969, the ''Huntley-Brinkley Report'' was expanded to Saturday evenings, with the main anchors working solo on alternating weeks. When lower-than-expected ratings occurred, the network pulled the pair off Saturdays and assigned others such as McGee and Vanocur to anchor the broadcast. On August 2, 1970, two days after the weekday ''Huntley-Brinkley'' broadcast ended, the network expanded its evening newscast to Sundays, which also replaced the Sunday broadcast of ''The Frank McGee Report''. For the first year after the Sunday broadcast began, Chancellor, Brinkley and McGee rotated on the program as they did on weeknights; there were no separate weekend anchors. The Saturday and Sunday broadcasts were respectively titled ''NBC Saturday Night News'' and ''NBC Sunday Night News'' until sometime in the 1970s, when they adopted the ''NBC Nightly News'' name.\n\nWhen Chancellor became sole anchor of the weeknight editions in August 1971, a separate anchor was named for the weekend editions.\n\nThe weekend editions may occasionally be abbreviated or preempted due to [[NBC Sports]] telecasts (such as [[Golf Channel on NBC|golf tournaments]], [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|Notre Dame football games]] and [[Thoroughbred Racing on NBC|Thoroughbred Racing tournaments]]) that overrun into the program's time slot.
