In many places the boundary between the two provinces is not noticeable as both sides of the boundary are equally urbanized.

Initially, it was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]]; many Jews worked on labor projects for various local firms, especially the railway and the [[Luftwaffe]]. Beginning in May 1941, the ghetto became a collection center with Jews sent there from the [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw]] ghettos. In 1942, two thousand Jews [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|arrived from Slovakia]] and hundreds more from nearby ghettos that had been liquidated.{{efn|name=liquidation|Liquidation refers to the Nazi action of shutting down a ghetto, with the inhabitants forced to move, deported, or murdered nearby.{{sfn|Aronson|Longerich|2001|p=194}}}}\n\nThe first deportation was in May 1942 and took around 2,500 Jews to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]]. In October that same year, the ghetto was liquidated; about 2,500 Jews were deported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] while some 1,400 Jews were retained as inmates of forced-labor camps in the town. Unusually, the labor camp operated by the Luftwaffe\u2014employing, at its peak, about a thousand Jews\u2014was allowed to exist until 22 July 1944.

The motive was probably to keep Jews away from the two nearby military installations, a Luftwaffe airfield and a Wehrmacht base, which were filled with troops in preparation for the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the Soviet Union]]. (The decree establishing the ghetto was not formally issued until 1942).{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} Until 1942,{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}} Irena was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]] (there was no physical fence, although the penalty for unauthorized departure was death) consisting of six streets. Its boundaries were initially Ok\u00f3lna Street, the Irenka River, Bankowa, and Staromiejska Streets. Staromiejska Street was removed from the ghetto in September 1942; its residents moved to Bankowa. Initially, Poles were allowed to enter and perhaps live in the ghetto, so many of the Jews were able to survive by trading material goods for food with them.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} A Polish-language secular school, run by Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm, instructed 70 to 100 pupils.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}\n\nIn late 1941, Poles were banned from entering the ghetto, resulting in waste piling up and [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]] epidemics. The sick were treated at a thirty-bed hospital run by Isaar Kawa, a doctor from [[Konin]]; with the help of Polish doctors, medicines were imported from Warsaw.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=157}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}  Simultaneously,  new restrictions were imposed by the Germans: the use of stoves was banned, winter clothing requisitioned, and fuel imports forbidden.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} More Jews began to leave the ghetto to obtain essentials, resulting in twenty young women being shot after being captured.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Because conditions were better in Lublin District than in Warsaw, some Jews fled to towns there including D\u0119blin\u2013Irena;{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=196}} twenty Jews were shot for being unregistered refugees.

These consisted mainly of Jews expelled from [[Pu\u0142awy]] and the [[Warthegau]] region, as well as some Jews who had come to live with relatives to avoid being trapped in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. Overcrowding was severe; there were 7\u201315 people per room. More Jews arrived in May 1941: 1,000 from the ghettos at Warsaw, [[Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto|Cz\u0119stochowa]], and [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]], although they were not housed in the ghetto but at work sites in the area.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} On 13 and 14&nbsp;May 1942, two transports totalling 2,042 [[Slovak Jews]]  [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|arrived from Pre\u0161ov]].{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=166}} Although they brought food with them, they were unused to the harsh conditions and many died of typhus due to the poor sanitation.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=62}} More than 2,000 Jews were brought to D\u0119blin\u2013Irena from nearby towns, having survived the liquidation{{efn|name=liquidation}} of their communities because they had been selected to work.

Deported to Opole in February 1941, the Viennese wanted to escape the harsh conditions there.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} These Jews, as well as another four hundred recruited in D\u0119blin\u2013Irena and the [[Lipowa 7]] camp in Lublin,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} and 500 Polish workers, worked twelve hours a day levelling the runway and building roads, walls, air-raid shelters, and earth fortifications. They also built a barbed-wire-enclosed complex adjacent to the runway for craftsmen to work.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Following the completion of the project in October, the workers were dispersed to various projects around the town, an action which may have been related to the typhus epidemic.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Some of the Jews from Vienna stayed at the airfield, having obtained permits to work on gravel transportation and building fuel tanks; they were the nucleus for the later labor camp. After the deportation of 6&nbsp;May 1942, additional Jews tried to secure permits, often fictitious ones obtained through bribery, to avoid deportation. By October 1942, the camp had 543 legal residents.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} At this point there were five forced-labor camps around D\u0119blin: the Luftwaffe camp, the fortress, the train station (300 Jews), Lipova Street (200 Jews and Poles), and another near the municipal boundary (300 Jews).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}}\n\n== Deportation, murder, and liquidation ==\n===First deportation===\nThe first deportation was on 6&nbsp;May 1942,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=459}}{{sfn|Musia\u0142|2000|p=244}} to clear space for the Slovak deportees who arrived a week later.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=608}} A force composed of German and Ukrainian police and a few German SS and Ukrainian SS auxiliaries ordered Jews to assemble in the main square at 09:00.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} According to [[Yad Vashem]], the [[Blue Police]] also participated.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=158}} Probably because the Luftwaffe was seeking permission to recruit more laborers, the Jews had to wait for five hours.

This operation also killed the prisoners of Poniatowa but did not affect the Jews at the Luftwaffe camp in D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=60\u201361, 63}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} who were unaware of it.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Following Operation Harvest Festival, there were ten labor camps for Jews in the Lublin District with more than 10,000 Jews still alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}}\n\n== Luftwaffe camp ==\n===Camp leader===\n[[File:UT 2 w Szkole Orlat w Deblinie.jpg|thumb|alt= Polish Air Force Academy airfield with four planes and a number of men around them |[[Polish Air Force Academy]] in D\u0119blin, 1947]]\nThe camp leader ({{lang-de|[[Lager\u00e4lteste]]|link=no}}) at the Luftwaffe camp was Hermann Wenkert, a Jewish lawyer from Vienna who had been deported to Opole in 1941 and came to Irena with the volunteers.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}  According to Wenkert's account,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} soon after his arrival he happened upon Eduard Bromofsky, an Austrian Luftwaffe officer with whom Wenkert had served during World War I. Bromofsky convinced the commander of the camp to promote Wenkert to his position. Even after Bromofsky was reassigned, the relationships that Wenkert had cultivated with the German authorities enabled him to retain his position.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}} Wenkert populated the administration with other Viennese Jews, insisted on extra rations for himself and his family, and had his family transferred from Opole to Irena. Because of his close association with the German authorities and use of his position for personal benefit, some survivors considered him to be a collaborator.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}} When it was possible, Wenkert negotiated with the authorities and paid bribes to avoid punishment; he also consulted respected prisoners in cases where the matter had not come to German attention. However, when he thought there was no other option and the survival of the camp was in the balance, Wenkert turned Jews accused of wrongdoing over to the Germans even though he knew that this would result in their deaths.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} In general, German-speaking Jews had a more positive impression of him than the local Jews, who spoke Yiddish.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=66}} According to Silberklang, both views of Wenkert may be true: that he tried to secure benefits for himself personally while also working to keep the other Jewish prisoners alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|pp=401\u2013402}}\n\n===Conditions===\nConditions were relatively good compared to other camps.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=93}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}} Residents received food rations of about 1,700 [[kilocalories]] daily (enough to live), weekly baths, medical care, and were allowed to practice their religion.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=78}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The presence of 100 young children\u2014whose existence was justified by increasing the productivity of their parents\u2014was particularly unusual and not equalled elsewhere in the Lublin District after Operation Harvest Festival. The children received education in Polish, but had to hide when the SS conducted inspections.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=72\u201373}} According to Farkash, Wenkert's positive relationship with the camp command was partially responsible for the good conditions.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=69}} Wenkert managed to get religious Jews exempted from working on [[Shabbat]] and allowed a [[chevra kadisha]] society to operate, burying the dead according to Jewish law. In 1943, about 80 Jews (including Wenkert) received kosher food for the week of [[Passover]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}}\n\nThe camp had three German commanders, all at the rank of Sergeant Major:  Kattengel (through March 1943), Dusy, and Rademacher (during the last two months). Although Kattengel was distrusted, because he roamed the camp with a dog and whip, both Dusy and Rademacher were described positively by survivors. Dusy even arranged for one woman to receive treatment at a German hospital after she was badly injured. Wiszniewski, a local {{lang|de|Volkesdeutscher}}, was the lead foreman of the Jewish laborers and did not mistreat them. Autheried engineer Kozak brought food to the Jews he worked with.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=69\u201370}} Both theft and having foreign currency were punishable by death. Punishment could be excessive and arbitrary\u2014nine Jews were shot for causing a fire, even though it was proved to be accidental\u2014but less so than other Nazi camps.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=74\u201375}} According to Farkash, in 1943, Wenkert allowed a group of [[Jewish partisans]] seeking refuge from a hostile unit of the Polish [[Home Army]] resistance group into the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} The Slovak Jews at the camp were the last major group to survive of the almost 40,000 Slovak Jews deported to the Lublin District in 1942.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=159}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=296}} The [[The Holocaust in Slovakia#Hiatus (1943)|Jews remaining in Pre\u0161ov]] hired couriers (non-Jews from the Polish\u2013Slovak border) to travel to the camp regularly until it was dissolved, carrying letters and bringing valuables and money. A committee was formed in the camp to distribute the aid among the Slovak Jews. Cases of theft by Polish Jews led to friction between the two communities.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}}\n\nDespite the relatively good conditions, some Jews tried to escape because they feared that the camp would be liquidated. The Luftwaffe camp command imposed [[collective punishment]] to deter escapees.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} According to a 1943 [[Home Army]] report, the local Polish population was hostile to Jewish fugitives. The organization itself accused Jews of joining Communist partisan groups and stealing from Polish peasants.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|pp=213, 361}} Most Jews who tried to escape were captured, and others returned to the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} Several members of the Kowalczyk family were honored as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for sheltering Jews who had escaped from the camp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kowalczyk family |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4034962&ind=1 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> \u00c1rp\u00e1d Szab\u00f3, a Hungarian military doctor, was similarly recognized for smuggling a Slovak Jewish couple to Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Szab\u00f3 \u00c1rp\u00e1d |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4044388&ind=2 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidation===\n[[File:Cz\u0119stochowa - Hasag-Pelcery plaque 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Plaque with Star of David and Hebrew letters|left|Memorial plaque at the former HASAG camp in Cz\u0119stochowa]]\nThe camp was liquidated on 22&nbsp;July 1944, the same day that the Red Army reached Lublin.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} At the time of the deportation, some 800 to 900 Jews were still alive, of whom 400 to 600 were from  D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} 40 from Vienna,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}} and 70 to 80  from Slovakia.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}} Two{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} or three{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} transports departed from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena on 17 and 22&nbsp;July.  (Silberklang reports a third on 20 July).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Since no one was willing to volunteer, the first transport carried about 200 people who had few connections in the camp, including single adults and fifteen children between three and six years of age. On the orders of camp security officer Georg Bartenschlager, the fifteen children were shot upon their arrival in Cz\u0119stochowa. The rest of the prisoners, including Wenkert and 33 young children, departed on the second transport with Rademacher, the German camp commander, who carried a letter of protection from the airfield commander.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} About fifty Jews escaped from the camp during the evacuation, but most were killed. The second transport arrived in Cz\u0119stochowa on 25 July; the young children were kept separated for two and a half days but were not killed. The reason for this is not clear, but likely involved negotiations with Bartenschlager.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=76\u201377}} In Cz\u0119stochowa, the Jews worked at the four  [[Hugo Schneider AG]] plants. Some were deported to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in January 1945 while others were liberated by the Red Army.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=77}} About half survived.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nAccording to Farkash, the airfield camp at D\u0119blin\u2013Irena is a \"singular case\" in the Lublin district and possibly in the entirety of occupied Poland.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=58}} One unusual aspect of the camp was that it was run from start to finish by the Luftwaffe rather than the SS, although during 1943 and 1944, the SS tried to expand its role.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=68}} According to Silberklang, being run by the Wehrmacht helped to ensure the camp's survival.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=364}} However, other camps (such as three in Zamo\u015b\u0107 county) were run by the Luftwaffe and yet were still liquidated before the end of 1943.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=68, 78}} Another reason was the importance of Jewish workers at D\u0119blin to the German war effort,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=411}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} which was continually emphasized by Wenkert in his dealings with the Germans. Overall, luck played a major role in the fortuitous combination of Jewish leadership, relatively friendly Germans, and the evacuation of the camp to Cz\u0119stochowa rather than [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} Ninety-nine percent of the Jews from Lublin District were killed in the Holocaust,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=431}} but hundreds from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena survived the war.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nD\u0119blin was liberated by the [[1st Polish Army]] by 27&nbsp;July 1944.{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=536}} Some of the Jewish survivors, who attempted to return home in January 1945, were told by the local [[Milicja Obywatelska]] chief that it was illegal for them to settle in town.{{sfn|Rubin|2004|p=88}}{{sfn|Rice|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 29]}}{{sfn|Ko\u017ami\u0144ska-Frejlak|2014|p=154}} In March 1945, survivors \u0141aja, Gitla and Fryda Luksemburg were murdered with the involvement of local police.{{sfn|Krzy\u017canowski|2013|p=253}}<ref name=\"Miasto\" /> Ester Kaminska suffered repeated harassment and extortion from local Poles, one of whom had obtained her family's bakery from the Nazis, which led to her departure to Palestine in 1947.{{sfn|Rice|2017|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 119\u2013120]}} Other Jews received threatening letters.

Initially, it was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]]; many Jews worked on labor projects for various local firms, especially the railway and the [[Luftwaffe]]. Beginning in May 1941, the ghetto became a collection center with Jews sent there from the [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]] and [[Warsaw Ghetto|Warsaw]] ghettos. In 1942, two thousand Jews [[deportation of Jews from Slovakia|arrived from Slovakia]] and hundreds more from nearby ghettos that had been liquidated.{{efn|name=liquidation|Liquidation refers to the Nazi action of shutting down a ghetto, with the inhabitants forced to move, deported, or murdered nearby.{{sfn|Aronson|Longerich|2001|p=194}}}}\n\nThe first deportation was in May 1942 and took around 2,500 Jews to [[Sobib\u00f3r extermination camp]]. In October that same year, the ghetto was liquidated; about 2,500 Jews were deported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]] while some 1,400 Jews were retained as inmates of forced-labor camps in the town. Unusually, the labor camp operated by the Luftwaffe\u2014employing, at its peak, about a thousand Jews\u2014was allowed to exist until 22 July 1944. One of the last Jewish labor camps in the Lublin District, it enabled hundreds of Jews to survive the Holocaust.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Jews in D\u0119blin greet Pi\u0142sudski, 1920.png|thumb|left|alt= A line of Jewish men shown greeting Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski| Jews in D\u0119blin greet Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] after his capture of D\u0119blin during the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]], 1920.]]\n[[D\u0119blin]] and Irena{{efn|The two municipalities, having long been considered one unit, were officially merged in 1953.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=636}}}} ({{lang-yi|\u05de\u05d0\u05d3\u05d6\u05e9\u05d9\u05e5}}, {{transl|yi|Modzhitz}}){{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}} are located {{convert|68.7|km|sp=us}} northwest of [[Lublin]] in Poland,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=636}} at the confluence of the [[Vistula]] and [[Wieprz]] rivers and at an important junction on the [[Lublin\u2013Warsaw rail line]].<ref name=\"MJP\" /> Local Jews supported the [[January Uprising]] in 1863.

They were conscripted into forced labor units that cleared up the bomb damage and repaired some of the buildings, and the Jewish community was forced to pay a fine of 20,000 [[z\u0142oty]].{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=636}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=59}} During the German occupation, D\u0119blin\u2013Irena became part of the [[Lublin District]] of the [[General Governorate]] occupation region.

The motive was probably to keep Jews away from the two nearby military installations, a Luftwaffe airfield and a Wehrmacht base, which were filled with troops in preparation for the [[Operation Barbarossa|1941 invasion of the Soviet Union]]. (The decree establishing the ghetto was not formally issued until 1942).{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} Until 1942,{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=156}} Irena was an [[Nazi ghettos#Types of ghettos|open ghetto]] (there was no physical fence, although the penalty for unauthorized departure was death) consisting of six streets. Its boundaries were initially Ok\u00f3lna Street, the Irenka River, Bankowa, and Staromiejska Streets. Staromiejska Street was removed from the ghetto in September 1942; its residents moved to Bankowa. Initially, Poles were allowed to enter and perhaps live in the ghetto, so many of the Jews were able to survive by trading material goods for food with them.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} A Polish-language secular school, run by Aida Milgroijm-Citronbojm, instructed 70 to 100 pupils.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}\n\nIn late 1941, Poles were banned from entering the ghetto, resulting in waste piling up and [[typhus]] and [[dysentery]] epidemics. The sick were treated at a thirty-bed hospital run by Isaar Kawa, a doctor from [[Konin]]; with the help of Polish doctors, medicines were imported from Warsaw.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=157}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}  Simultaneously,  new restrictions were imposed by the Germans: the use of stoves was banned, winter clothing requisitioned, and fuel imports forbidden.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=92}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} More Jews began to leave the ghetto to obtain essentials, resulting in twenty young women being shot after being captured.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Because conditions were better in Lublin District than in Warsaw, some Jews fled to towns there including D\u0119blin\u2013Irena;{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=196}} twenty Jews were shot for being unregistered refugees. The {{lang|de|Judenrat}}{{'}}s command altered again as Drayfish was executed, accused of filing complaints with the Pu\u0142awy County administration; he was replaced by the businessman Yisrael Weinberg.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nIn March 1941, 3,750 Jews lived in the ghetto, including 565 who were not from the area. These consisted mainly of Jews expelled from [[Pu\u0142awy]] and the [[Warthegau]] region, as well as some Jews who had come to live with relatives to avoid being trapped in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]]. Overcrowding was severe; there were 7\u201315 people per room. More Jews arrived in May 1941: 1,000 from the ghettos at Warsaw, [[Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto|Cz\u0119stochowa]], and [[Opole Ghetto|Opole]], although they were not housed in the ghetto but at work sites in the area.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}} On 13 and 14&nbsp;May 1942, two transports totalling 2,042 [[Slovak Jews]]  [[List of Holocaust transports from Slovakia|arrived from Pre\u0161ov]].{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=166}} Although they brought food with them, they were unused to the harsh conditions and many died of typhus due to the poor sanitation.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=62}} More than 2,000 Jews were brought to D\u0119blin\u2013Irena from nearby towns, having survived the liquidation{{efn|name=liquidation}} of their communities because they had been selected to work. These included 300 people from [[Ryki]], 300 from [[Gniewosz\u00f3w, Masovian Voivodeship|Gniewosz\u00f3w]] and [[Zwole\u0144]], and a group from [[St\u0119\u017cyca, Lublin Voivodeship|St\u0119\u017cyca]].

Deported to Opole in February 1941, the Viennese wanted to escape the harsh conditions there.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} These Jews, as well as another four hundred recruited in D\u0119blin\u2013Irena and the [[Lipowa 7]] camp in Lublin,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} and 500 Polish workers, worked twelve hours a day levelling the runway and building roads, walls, air-raid shelters, and earth fortifications. They also built a barbed-wire-enclosed complex adjacent to the runway for craftsmen to work.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Following the completion of the project in October, the workers were dispersed to various projects around the town, an action which may have been related to the typhus epidemic.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=637}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} Some of the Jews from Vienna stayed at the airfield, having obtained permits to work on gravel transportation and building fuel tanks; they were the nucleus for the later labor camp. After the deportation of 6&nbsp;May 1942, additional Jews tried to secure permits, often fictitious ones obtained through bribery, to avoid deportation. By October 1942, the camp had 543 legal residents.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=64}} At this point there were five forced-labor camps around D\u0119blin: the Luftwaffe camp, the fortress, the train station (300 Jews), Lipova Street (200 Jews and Poles), and another near the municipal boundary (300 Jews).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}}\n\n== Deportation, murder, and liquidation ==\n===First deportation===\nThe first deportation was on 6&nbsp;May 1942,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=459}}{{sfn|Musia\u0142|2000|p=244}} to clear space for the Slovak deportees who arrived a week later.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=608}} A force composed of German and Ukrainian police and a few German SS and Ukrainian SS auxiliaries ordered Jews to assemble in the main square at 09:00.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} According to [[Yad Vashem]], the [[Blue Police]] also participated.{{sfn|Yad Vashem|2009|p=158}} Probably because the Luftwaffe was seeking permission to recruit more laborers, the Jews had to wait for five hours.

Israeli historian Talia Farkash estimates that about 500, including 60\u201390 young children, managed to get in, mostly by paying bribes.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=66}} Silberklang's estimate is that 1,000 Jews entered the camp, including 280 women and 100 children.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The Jewish elder, Hermann Wenkert, later claimed that if he had allowed non-registered Jews entry, and they were discovered, everyone in the camp would have been killed. Instead, he bribed the Germans to obtain legal permits for an additional 400 Jews, which were mostly given to the wives and children of current residents.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=66}}\n\nMany of the Slovak Jews, not knowing what to expect, had lingered in the ghetto while packing their bags. About 215 to 500 Jews were shot while clearing the houses.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Between 2,000{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} and 2,500 people were deported to [[Treblinka extermination camp]]; mostly the Slovaks.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=329}} Members of the {{lang|de|Judenrat}}, Jewish police, and their families, about 100 in total, were retained to clean up the ghetto.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} Perhaps another 100 Jews were hiding without permission in the ghetto.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} On 28 October, the remaining Jews were sent to the Schultz labor camp, and the ghetto was officially liquidated. Either on that day or within the next few weeks, 1,000 people were removed from the labor camps, including the 200 workers at D\u0119blin Fortress and 200 to 500 of the Luftwaffe's workers.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} They were deported to Ko\u0144skowola{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} or Treblinka.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nAfter this, Farkash estimates that there were about 1,400 Jews were still alive in the labor camps around Irena.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} Estimates of the number at the Luftwaffe camp range from 1,000 (''[[Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos]]''){{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} to 2,000 (Silberklang),{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} with another 300 at a railway camp near the passenger station, and 120 at another camp near the railway loading station.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}} During May or July 1943, most of the remaining prisoners in the railway camps were deported to [[Poniatowa concentration camp|Poniatowa]] via the transit ghetto in Ko\u0144skowola; the rest were deported in late 1943.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=63}}{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}  In the remaining labor camps in Pu\u0142awy County, where hundreds of Jews were still alive, they were murdered during [[Operation Harvest Festival]] (2\u20133&nbsp;November 1943). This operation also killed the prisoners of Poniatowa but did not affect the Jews at the Luftwaffe camp in D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=60\u201361, 63}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} who were unaware of it.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Following Operation Harvest Festival, there were ten labor camps for Jews in the Lublin District with more than 10,000 Jews still alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}}\n\n== Luftwaffe camp ==\n===Camp leader===\n[[File:UT 2 w Szkole Orlat w Deblinie.jpg|thumb|alt= Polish Air Force Academy airfield with four planes and a number of men around them |[[Polish Air Force Academy]] in D\u0119blin, 1947]]\nThe camp leader ({{lang-de|[[Lager\u00e4lteste]]}}) at the Luftwaffe camp was Hermann Wenkert, a Jewish lawyer from Vienna who had been deported to Opole in 1941 and came to Irena with the volunteers.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}  According to Wenkert's account,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=402}} soon after his arrival he happened upon Eduard Bromofsky, an Austrian Luftwaffe officer with whom Wenkert had served during World War I. Bromofsky convinced the commander of the camp to promote Wenkert to his position. Even after Bromofsky was reassigned, the relationships that Wenkert had cultivated with the German authorities enabled him to retain his position.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}} Wenkert populated the administration with other Viennese Jews, insisted on extra rations for himself and his family, and had his family transferred from Opole to Irena. Because of his close association with the German authorities and use of his position for personal benefit, some survivors considered him to be a collaborator.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=65}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}} When it was possible, Wenkert negotiated with the authorities and paid bribes to avoid punishment; he also consulted respected prisoners in cases where the matter had not come to German attention. However, when he thought there was no other option and the survival of the camp was in the balance, Wenkert turned Jews accused of wrongdoing over to the Germans even though he knew that this would result in their deaths.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} In general, German-speaking Jews had a more positive impression of him than the local Jews, who spoke Yiddish.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=66}} According to Silberklang, both views of Wenkert may be true: that he tried to secure benefits for himself personally while also working to keep the other Jewish prisoners alive.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|pp=401\u2013402}}\n\n===Conditions===\nConditions were relatively good compared to other camps.{{sfn|Rubin|2006|p=93}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=365}} Residents received food rations of about 1,700 [[kilocalories]] daily (enough to live), weekly baths, medical care, and were allowed to practice their religion.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=78}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=400}} The presence of 100 young children\u2014whose existence was justified by increasing the productivity of their parents\u2014was particularly unusual and not equalled elsewhere in the Lublin District after Operation Harvest Festival. The children received education in Polish, but had to hide when the SS conducted inspections.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=72\u201373}} According to Farkash, Wenkert's positive relationship with the camp command was partially responsible for the good conditions.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=69}} Wenkert managed to get religious Jews exempted from working on [[Shabbat]] and allowed a [[chevra kadisha]] society to operate, burying the dead according to Jewish law. In 1943, about 80 Jews (including Wenkert) received kosher food for the week of [[Passover]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=73\u201374}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=401}}\n\nThe camp had three German commanders, all at the rank of Sergeant Major:  Kattengel (through March 1943), Dusy, and Rademacher (during the last two months). Although Kattengel was distrusted, because he roamed the camp with a dog and whip, both Dusy and Rademacher were described positively by survivors. Dusy even arranged for one woman to receive treatment at a German hospital after she was badly injured. Wiszniewski, a local {{lang|de|Volkesdeutscher}}, was the lead foreman of the Jewish laborers and did not mistreat them. Autheried engineer Kozak brought food to the Jews he worked with.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=69\u201370}} Both theft and having foreign currency were punishable by death. Punishment could be excessive and arbitrary\u2014nine Jews were shot for causing a fire, even though it was proved to be accidental\u2014but less so than other Nazi camps.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=74\u201375}} According to Farkash, in 1943, Wenkert allowed a group of [[Jewish partisans]] seeking refuge from a hostile unit of the Polish [[Home Army]] resistance group into the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=67}} The Slovak Jews at the camp were the last major group to survive of the almost 40,000 Slovak Jews deported to the Lublin District in 1942.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991| p=159}}{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=296}} The [[The Holocaust in Slovakia#Hiatus (1943)|Jews remaining in Pre\u0161ov]] hired couriers (non-Jews from the Polish\u2013Slovak border) to travel to the camp regularly until it was dissolved, carrying letters and bringing valuables and money. A committee was formed in the camp to distribute the aid among the Slovak Jews. Cases of theft by Polish Jews led to friction between the two communities.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}}\n\nDespite the relatively good conditions, some Jews tried to escape because they feared that the camp would be liquidated. The Luftwaffe camp command imposed [[collective punishment]] to deter escapees.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} According to a 1943 [[Home Army]] report, the local Polish population was hostile to Jewish fugitives. The organization itself accused Jews of joining Communist partisan groups and stealing from Polish peasants.{{sfn|Zimmerman|2015|pp=213, 361}} Most Jews who tried to escape were captured, and others returned to the camp.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=74}} Several members of the Kowalczyk family were honored as [[Righteous Among the Nations]] for sheltering Jews who had escaped from the camp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kowalczyk family |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4034962&ind=1 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref> \u00c1rp\u00e1d Szab\u00f3, a Hungarian military doctor, was similarly recognized for smuggling a Slovak Jewish couple to Hungary.<ref>{{cite web |title=Szab\u00f3 \u00c1rp\u00e1d |url=https://righteous.yadvashem.org/?search=Deblin&searchType=righteous_only&language=en&itemId=4044388&ind=2 |website=The Righteous Among the Nations Database |publisher=[[Yad Vashem]] |accessdate=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidation===\n[[File:Cz\u0119stochowa - Hasag-Pelcery plaque 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Plaque with Star of David and Hebrew letters|left|Memorial plaque at the former HASAG camp in Cz\u0119stochowa]]\nThe camp was liquidated on 22&nbsp;July 1944, the same day that the Red Army reached Lublin.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} At the time of the deportation, some 800 to 900 Jews were still alive, of whom 400 to 600 were from  D\u0119blin\u2013Irena,{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}} 40 from Vienna,{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=70}} and 70 to 80  from Slovakia.{{sfn|B\u00fcchler |1991|p=159}} Two{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} or three{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} transports departed from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena on 17 and 22&nbsp;July.  (Silberklang reports a third on 20 July).{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=409}} Since no one was willing to volunteer, the first transport carried about 200 people who had few connections in the camp, including single adults and fifteen children between three and six years of age. On the orders of camp security officer Georg Bartenschlager, the fifteen children were shot upon their arrival in Cz\u0119stochowa. The rest of the prisoners, including Wenkert and 33 young children, departed on the second transport with Rademacher, the German camp commander, who carried a letter of protection from the airfield commander.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=75}} About fifty Jews escaped from the camp during the evacuation, but most were killed. The second transport arrived in Cz\u0119stochowa on 25 July; the young children were kept separated for two and a half days but were not killed. The reason for this is not clear, but likely involved negotiations with Bartenschlager.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=76\u201377}} In Cz\u0119stochowa, the Jews worked at the four  [[Hugo Schneider AG]] plants. Some were deported to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] in January 1945 while others were liberated by the Red Army.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=77}} About half survived.{{sfn|Crago|2012|p=638}}\n\nAccording to Farkash, the airfield camp at D\u0119blin\u2013Irena is a \"singular case\" in the Lublin district and possibly in the entirety of occupied Poland.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=58}} One unusual aspect of the camp was that it was run from start to finish by the Luftwaffe rather than the SS, although during 1943 and 1944, the SS tried to expand its role.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|p=68}} According to Silberklang, being run by the Wehrmacht helped to ensure the camp's survival.{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=364}} However, other camps (such as three in Zamo\u015b\u0107 county) were run by the Luftwaffe and yet were still liquidated before the end of 1943.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=68, 78}} Another reason was the importance of Jewish workers at D\u0119blin to the German war effort,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=411}}{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} which was continually emphasized by Wenkert in his dealings with the Germans. Overall, luck played a major role in the fortuitous combination of Jewish leadership, relatively friendly Germans, and the evacuation of the camp to Cz\u0119stochowa rather than [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}} Ninety-nine percent of the Jews from Lublin District were killed in the Holocaust,{{sfn|Silberklang|2013|p=431}} but hundreds from D\u0119blin\u2013Irena survived the war.{{sfn|Farkash|2014|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\nD\u0119blin was liberated by the [[1st Polish Army]] by 27&nbsp;July 1944.{{sfn|Weinstein|2006|p=536}} Some of the Jewish survivors, who attempted to return home in January 1945, were told by the local [[Milicja Obywatelska]] chief that it was illegal for them to settle in town.{{sfn|Rubin|2004|p=88}}{{sfn|Rice|2017|p=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 29]}}{{sfn|Ko\u017ami\u0144ska-Frejlak|2014|p=154}} In March 1945, survivors \u0141aja, Gitla and Fryda Luksemburg were murdered with the involvement of local police.{{sfn|Krzy\u017canowski|2013|p=253}}<ref name=\"Miasto\" /> Ester Kaminska suffered repeated harassment and extortion from local Poles, one of whom had obtained her family's bakery from the Nazis, which led to her departure to Palestine in 1947.{{sfn|Rice|2017|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=L0MwDwAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=D%C4%99blin+1942+jews&ots=4YMln6eUay&sig=R5NCwbZQA85AeAzLL2NuAiYSdwA&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=D%C4%99blin&f=false 119\u2013120]}} Other Jews received threatening letters.

''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (3rd ed.). p. 501.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n{{politics of China}}\n{{further|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}\n\n=== Modern Chinese intellectual tradition ===\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the modern [[Chinese intellectualism|Chinese intellectual]] tradition is defined by two central concepts: (i) [[iconoclasm]] and (ii) [[nationalism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After'', New York:Free Press, 1999. pp. 12\u201316.</ref>\n\n==== Iconoclastic revolution and anti-Confucianism ====\nBy the turn of the 20th century, a proportionately small yet socially significant cross-section of China's traditional elite (i.e. landlords and bureaucrats) found themselves increasingly skeptical of the efficacy and even the moral validity of [[Confucianism]].<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 10.</ref> These skeptical iconoclasts formed a new segment of Chinese society, a modern intelligentsia whose arrival\u2014or as historian of China [[Maurice Meisner]] would label it, their defection\u2014heralded the beginning of the destruction of the [[gentry]] as a social class in China.<ref>Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 11.</ref>\n\nThe fall of the [[Qing dynasty|last imperial Chinese dynasty]] in 1911 marked the final failure of the Confucian moral order and it did much to make Confucianism synonymous with political and [[social conservatism]] in the minds of Chinese intellectuals. It was this association of conservatism and Confucianism which lent to the iconoclastic nature of Chinese intellectual thought during the first decades of the 20th century.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 14.</ref>\n\nChinese iconoclasm was expressed most clearly and vociferously by [[Chen Duxiu]] during the [[New Culture Movement]] which occurred between 1915 and 1919.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/> Proposing the \"total destruction of the traditions and values of the past\", the New Culture Movement was spearheaded by the ''[[New Youth]]'', a periodical which was published by Chen Duxiu and was profoundly influential on the young [[Mao Zedong]], whose first published work appeared on the magazine's pages.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Pages 14\"/>\n\n==== Nationalism and the appeal of Marxism ====\nAlong with iconoclasm, radical anti-imperialism dominated the Chinese intellectual tradition and slowly evolved into a fierce nationalist fervor which influenced Mao's philosophy immensely and was crucial in adapting Marxism to the Chinese model.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 44\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 44.</ref> Vital to understanding Chinese nationalist sentiments of the time is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which was signed in 1919. The Treaty aroused a wave of bitter nationalist resentment in Chinese intellectuals as lands formerly ceded to Germany in [[Shandong]] were\u2014without consultation with the Chinese\u2014transferred to Japanese control rather than returned to Chinese sovereignty.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\">Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe negative reaction culminated in the [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident]] in 1919 during which a protest began with 3,000 students in Beijing displaying their anger at the announcement of the Versailles Treaty's concessions to Japan. The protest took a violent turn as protesters began attacking the homes and offices of ministers who were seen as cooperating with, or being in the direct pay of, the Japanese.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\"/> The [[May Fourth Movement|4 May Incident and Movement]] which followed \"catalyzed the political awakening of a society which had long seemed inert and dormant\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 17\"/>\n\nAnother international event would have a large impact not only on Mao, but also on the Chinese intelligentsia. The [[Russian Revolution]] elicited great interest among Chinese intellectuals, although socialist revolution in China was not considered a viable option until after the May 4 Incident.<ref name=After>Meisner, Maurice. ''Mao's China and After''. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 18.</ref> Afterwards, \"[t]o become a Marxist was one way for a Chinese intellectual to reject both the traditions of the Chinese past and Western domination of the Chinese present\".<ref name=After/>\n\n=== Yan'an period between November 1935 and March 1947 ===\nDuring the period immediately following the [[Long March]], Mao and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) were headquartered in [[Yan'an]], which is a prefecture-level city in [[Shaanxi]] province. During this period, Mao clearly established himself as a Marxist theoretician and he produced the bulk of the works which would later be canonized into the \"thought of Mao Zedong\".<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\">Meisner, Maurice. Mao's China and After. New York: Free Press, 1999. p. 45.</ref> The rudimentary philosophical base of Chinese Communist ideology is laid down in Mao's numerous dialectical treatises and it was conveyed to newly recruited party members. This period truly established ideological independence from Moscow for Mao and the CPC.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999. Page 45\"/>\n\nAlthough the Yan'an period did answer some of the questions, both ideological and theoretical, which were raised by the Chinese Communist Revolution, it left many of the crucial questions unresolved, including how the Communist Party of China was supposed to launch a socialist revolution while completely separated from the urban sphere.<ref name=\"Meisner, Maurice 1999.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\">Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 119.</ref>\n\n=== Differences from Marxism ===\nThe two differences between Maoism and [[Marxism]] are how the [[proletariat]] are defined and what political and economic conditions would start a [[communist revolution]]: \n# For [[Karl Marx]], the proletariat were the urban [[working class]], which was determined in the revolution by which the [[bourgeoisie]] overthrew [[feudalism]].<ref>Sandmo, Agnar. ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A. James; Chang, Maria Hsia (1978). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1407255 \"Maoism and Marxism in Comparative Perspective\"]. ''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible. In ''The Great Union of the Popular Masses'' (1919), Mao said: \"The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme\".<ref>Mao, Zedong.

Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C.

Cambridge 2011. P. 289-290\"/>\n\n=== Mass line ===\nContrary to the [[Leninism|Leninist]] [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] model employed by the [[Bolshevik]]s, the theory of the [[mass line]] holds that party must not be separate from the popular masses, either in policy or in revolutionary struggle. To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'' reads: <blockquote>Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong... [and] far from making a correct analysis of many problems, he confused right and wrong and the people with the enemy... herein lies his tragedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/china/the-four-modernizations,-1979-82.html|title=China the Four Modernizations, 1979-82|website=country-studies.com|accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nScholars outside China see this re-working of the definition of Maoism as providing an ideological justification for what they see as the restoration of the essentials of capitalism in China by Deng and his successors, who sought to \"eradicate all ideological and physiological obstacles to economic reform\".<ref>S. Zhao, \"A State-Led Nationalism: The Patriotic Education Campaign in Post-Tiananmen China\", Communist and Post-Communist Studies, 1998, 31(3): p. 288.</ref> In 1978, this led to the [[Sino-Albanian split]] when Albanian leader [[Enver Hoxha]] denounced Deng as a revisionist and formed [[Hoxhaism]] as an anti-revisionist form of Marxism.\n\nMao himself is officially regarded by the CPC as a \"great revolutionary leader\" for his role in fighting against the [[Japanese fascism|Japanese fascist invasion]] during the Second World War and creating the People's Republic of China, but Maoism as implemented between 1959 and 1976 is regarded by today's CPC as an economic and political disaster. In Deng's day, support of radical Maoism was regarded as a form of \"left deviationism\" and being based on a [[cult of personality]], although these \"errors\" are officially attributed to the [[Gang of Four (China)|Gang of Four]] rather than being attributed to Mao himself.<ref>For a newest expression of the official judgment see \u4e2d\u56fd\u5171\u4ea7\u515a\u5386\u53f2\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5377\u4e0b\u518c\uff0c\u4e2d\u5171\u4e2d\u592e\u515a\u53f2\u7814\u7a76\u5ba4\u8457\uff0c\u4e2d\u5171\u515a\u53f2\u51fa\u7248\u793e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u516b\u7ae0\u5bf9\"\u6587\u5316\u5927\u9769\u547d\"\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5206\u6790(History of China Communist Party, Vol. 2, Party History Research Centre (November 2010), Chap. 28 Analysis on Cultural Revolution).</ref> Thousands of Maoists were arrested in the [[Hua Guofeng]] period after 1976.

Another camp denounced the new leadership as traitors to the cause of Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Mao Zedong Thought.

Many of the foreign parties that were [[fraternal party|fraternal parties]] aligned with the Chinese government before 1975 either disbanded, abandoned the new Chinese government entirely, or even renounced [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and developed into non-communist, [[social democratic]] parties. What is today called the international Maoist movement evolved out of the second camp\u2014the parties that opposed Deng and said they upheld the true legacy of Mao.\n\n== International influence ==\n[[File:UCPN (Maoist) 7th General Convention Nepal.jpg|thumb|The [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre)]] in February 2013]]\nFrom 1962 onwards, the challenge to the Soviet [[hegemony]] in the [[World Communist Movement|world communist movement]] made by the CPC resulted in various divisions in communist parties around the world.

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]]. It was founded in 1965 with [[Akram Yari]] as its first leader, advocating the overthrow of the then-current order by means of [[people's war]].\n\n===Australia===\nThe [[Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist)]] is a Maoist organisation in [[Australia]].

It was founded in 1968 with [[Siraj Sikder]] as its first leader. The party played a role in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].\n\n=== Belgium ===\nThe [[Sino-Soviet split]] had an important influence on communism in [[Belgium]]. The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

The UIC (S) was formed in 1976 after the alliance of a number of Maoist groups carrying out military actions within Iran. In 1982, the UIC (S) mobilized forces in forests around [[Amol]] and launched an insurgency against the Islamist Government. The uprising was eventually a failure and many UIC (S) leaders were shot.\n\n=== Palestine ===\nThe [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] is a Maoist political and military organization. The DFLP's original political orientation was based on the view that Palestinian national goals could be achieved only through revolution of the masses and [[people's war]].\n\n=== Philippines ===\n{{main|Communist Party of the Philippines}}\nThe [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] is the largest communist party in the Philippines, active since December 26, 1968 (Mao's birthday). It was formed as a result of the [[First Great Rectification Movement]] and a split between the old [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930]] which the founders saw as revisionist. The CPP was formed on Maoist lines in stark contrast with the old PKP which put primary focus to the parliamentary struggle. The CPP was founded by [[Jose Maria Sison]] and other cadres from the old party.<ref name=\"saulo\">{{cite book|last=Saulo|first=Alfredo|title=Communism in the Philippines}}</ref>\n\nThe CPP also has an armed wing which it exercises absolute control over, namely the [[New People's Army]]. It currently wages a guerrilla war against the government of the Republic of the Philippines in the countryside and is still currently active. Both the CPP and the NPA are part of the [[National Democratic Front of the Philippines]], a consolidation of Maoist sectoral organizations such as [[Kabataang Makabayan]] as part of the united front strategy.

The party was among the most active resistance movements before the [[Carnation Revolution|Portuguese democratic revolution of 1974]], especially among students of Lisbon. After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.\n\nIntensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril]] was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-[[Carnation Revolution]] Portugal.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine Maoist party. The armed wing of the party was [[First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups]].\n\n=== Sweden ===\nIn 1968, a small extremist Maoist sect called Rebels ({{lang-sv|Rebellerna}}) was established in [[Stockholm]]. Led by [[Francisco Sarri\u00f3n]], the group unsuccessfully demanded the Chinese embassy to admit them into the Communist Party of China.

It was founded in 1972 with [[\u0130brahim Kaypakkaya]] as its first leader. The armed wing of the party is named the Workers' and Peasants' Liberation Army in Turkey (TIKKO).\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n{{main|Category:Maoist organisations in the United Kingdom}}\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States during the late 1960s, parts of the emerging [[New Left]] rejected the Marxism espoused by the Soviet Union and instead adopted pro-Chinese communism.\n\nThe [[Black Panther Party]], especially under the leadership of [[Huey Newton]], was influenced by Mao Zedong's ideas. Into the 1970s, Maoists in the United States, e.g. Maoist representative Jon Lux, formed a large part of the [[New Communist movement]].\n\nThe [[Revolutionary Communist Party, USA]] is also a Maoist movement.\n\n== Criticism and implementation ==\n[[File:ForbiddenCity MaoZedongPortrait (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|Despite falling out of favor within the [[Communist Party of China]] by 1978, Mao is still revered, with Deng's famous \"70% right, 30% wrong\" line]]\nMaoism has fallen out of favour within the Communist Party of China, beginning with Deng Xiaoping's reforms in 1978. Deng believed that Maoism showed the dangers of \"ultra-leftism\", manifested in the harm perpetrated by the various mass movements that characterized the Maoist era. In Chinese communism, the term \"left\" can be taken as a euphemism for Maoist policies.

Mao did not believe that education alone would bring about the transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Communism#Marxist communism|communism]] because of three main reasons. (1) Psychologically, the capitalists would not repent and turn towards communism on their own; (2) the rulers must be overthrown by the people; (3) \"the proletarians are discontented, and a demand for communism has arisen and had already become a fact\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 109.</ref> These reasons do not provide socioeconomic explanations, which usually form the core of Marxist ideology.\n\n; Formative Maoist period (1927\u20131935)\nIn this period, Mao avoided all theoretical implications in his literature and employed a minimum of Marxist category thought. His writings in this period failed to elaborate what he meant by the \"Marxist method of political and class analysis\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 111.</ref> Prior to this period, Mao was concerned with the dichotomy between knowledge and action. He was more concerned with the dichotomy between revolutionary ideology and counter-revolutionary objective conditions. There was more correlation drawn between China and the Soviet model.\n\n; Mature Maoist period (1935\u20131940)\nIntellectually, this was Mao's most fruitful time. The shift of orientation was apparent in his pamphlet ''Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War'' (December 1936). This pamphlet tried to provide a theoretical veneer for his concern with revolutionary practice.<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 113.</ref> Mao started to separate from the Soviet model since it was not automatically applicable to China. China's unique set of historical circumstances demanded a correspondingly unique application of Marxist theory, an application that would have to diverge from the Soviet approach.\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u56fd\u9769\u547d\u6218\u4e89\u7684\u6218\u7565\u95ee\u989803531.jpg|thumb|''Strategic Issues in the Chinese Revolutionary War'' (1947)]]\n; Civil War period (1940\u20131949)\nUnlike the Mature period, this period was intellectually barren. Mao focused more on revolutionary practice and paid less attention to Marxist theory. He continued to emphasize theory as practice-oriented knowledge.<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 117.</ref> The biggest topic of theory he delved into was in connection with the [[Cheng Feng]] movement of 1942. It was here that Mao summarized the correlation between Marxist theory and Chinese practice: \"The target is the Chinese revolution, the arrow is Marxism\u2013Leninism. We Chinese communists seek this arrow for no other purpose than to hit the target of the Chinese revolution and the revolution of the east\".<ref name=\"Lowe, Donald M 1966. Page 117\"/> The only new emphasis was Mao's concern with two types of subjectivist deviation: (1) [[dogmatism]], the excessive reliance upon abstract theory; (2) [[empiricism]], excessive dependence on experience.\n\n; Post-1949 period following the revolutionary victory\nThe victory of 1949 was to Mao a confirmation of theory and practice. \"Optimism is the keynote to Mao's intellectual orientation in the post-1949 period\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M. ''The Function of \"China\" in Marx, Lenin, and Mao''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1966. p. 118.</ref> Mao assertively revised theory to relate it to the new practice of socialist construction. These revisions are apparent in the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction''. \"In the 1930s, when Mao talked about contradiction, he meant the contradiction between subjective thought and objective reality. In ''Dialectal Materialism'' of 1940, he saw idealism and materialism as two possible correlations between subjective thought and objective reality. In the 1940s, he introduced no new elements into his understanding of the subject-object contradiction. In the 1951 version of ''On Contradiction'', he saw contradiction as a universal principle underlying all processes of development, yet with each contradiction possessed of its own particularity\".<ref>Lowe, Donald M.

''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011, p.000.</ref> For Mao Zedong, the proletariat were the millions of peasants, to whom he referred as ''the popular masses''. Mao based his revolution upon the peasants, because they possessed two qualities: (i) they were poor, and (ii) they were a political blank slate; in Mao's words, \u201cA clean sheet of paper has no blotches, and so the newest and most beautiful words can be written on it\u201d.<ref>Gregor, A.

''The Review of Politics''. 40: 3. pp. 307\u2013327.</ref>\n# For Marx, [[proletarian revolution]] was internally fueled, by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]; that, as capitalism developed, \"a tension arises between the [[productive forces]] and the [[mode of production]]\".<ref>Sandmo, Agnar (2011). ''Economics Evolving: A History of Economic Thought'', Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p.000.</ref> The political tension between the productive forces (the workers) and the owners of the [[means of production]] (the capitalists) would be an inevitable incentive to proletarian revolution, which would result in a [[Communist society]] as the main economic structure. Mao did not subscribe to Marx's proposal of inevitable cyclicality in the economic system. His goal was to unify the Chinese nation and so realize progressive change for China in the form of Communism, hence, revolution was needed as soon as possible. In ''The Great Union of the Popular Masses'' (1919), Mao said: \"The decadence of the state, the sufferings of humanity, and the darkness of society have all reached an extreme\".<ref>Mao, Zedong.

This thesis held that for the majority of the people of the planet, the long road to [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]] could only be opened by a \"national, popular, democratic, anti-feudal and anti-imperialist revolution, run by the communists\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Amin|first=Samir|title=The Countries of the South Must Take Their Own Independent Initiatives|publisher=The Third World Forum|date=October 2009|url=http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|accessdate=22 February 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723131304/http://www.forumtiersmonde.net/fren/index.php/activitesactions/249-the-countries-of-the-south-must-take-their-own-independent-initiatives|archivedate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== People's war ===\nHolding that \"[[political power grows out of the barrel of a gun]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch05.htm|title=Quotations From Chairman Mao|publisher=Peking Foreign Languages Press|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> Maoism emphasizes the \"revolutionary struggle of the vast majority of people against the exploiting classes and their state structures\", which Mao termed a \"[[people's war]]\". Mobilizing large parts of rural populations to revolt against established institutions by engaging in [[guerrilla warfare]], Maoist Thought focuses on \"surrounding the cities from the countryside\".\n\nMaoism views the industrial-rural divide as a major division exploited by capitalism, identifying capitalism as involving industrial urban [[Developed country|developed]] [[First World]] societies ruling over rural [[Developing country|developing]] [[Third World]] societies.<ref>Alexander C.

To conduct a successful revolution the needs and demands of the masses must be told to the party so that the party can interpret them with a Marxist view.\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nThe theory of the [[Cultural Revolution]] states that the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat does not wipe out bourgeois ideology\u2014the class-struggle continues and even intensifies during socialism, therefore a constant struggle against these ideologies and their social roots must be conducted. Cultural Revolution is directed also against traditionalism.\n\n=== Contradiction ===\nMao drew from the writings of [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], and [[Joseph Stalin]] in elaborating his theory. Philosophically, his most important reflections emerge on the concept of \"contradiction\" (''maodun''). In two major essays, ''[[On Contradiction]]'' and ''On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People'', he adopts the [[positivist]]-[[empiricist]] idea (shared by Engels) that contradiction is present in matter itself and thus also in the ideas of the brain. Matter always develops through a dialectical contradiction: \"The interdependence of the contradictory aspects present in all things and the struggle between these aspects determine the life of things and push their development forward. There is nothing that does not contain contradiction; without contradiction nothing would exist\".<ref>Mao Tse Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm \"On contradiction\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, Foreign Language Press, Peking, 1967, p. 75.</ref>\n\nFurthermore, each contradiction (including [[class struggle]], the contradiction holding between relations of production and the concrete development of forces of production) expresses itself in a series of other contradictions, some dominant, others not. \"There are many contradictions in the process of development of a complex thing, and one of them is necessarily the principal contradiction whose existence and development determine or influence the existence and development of the other contradictions\".<ref>Mao Tse-Tung, \"[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_17.htm On contradiction]\", Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op. cit., p. 89.</ref>\n\nThus, the principal contradiction should be tackled with priority when trying to make the basic contradiction \"solidify\". Mao elaborates further on this theme in the essay ''[[On Practice]]'', \"on the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\". Here, ''Practice'' connects \"contradiction\" with \"class struggle\" in the following way, claiming that inside a mode of production there are three realms where practice functions: economic production, scientific experimentation (which also takes place in economic production and should not be radically disconnected from the former) and finally class struggle. These may be considered the proper objects of economy, scientific knowledge and politics.<ref>Cfr. Mao Tse-Tung, [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm \"On practice. On the relation between knowledge and practice, between knowing and doing\"], Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Tse-Tung, op.cit., p. 55: \"Man's social practice is not confined to activity in production, but takes many forms&mdash;class struggle, political life, scientific and artistic pursuits; in short, as a social being, man participates in all spheres of the practical life of society. Thus man, in varying degrees, comes to know the different relations between man and man, not only through his material life but also though his political and cultural life (both of which are intimately bound up with material life)\".</ref>\n\nThese three spheres deal with matter in its various forms, socially mediated. As a result, they are the only realms where knowledge may arise (since truth and knowledge only make sense in relation to matter, according to Marxist epistemology). Mao emphasizes&mdash;like Marx in trying to confront the \"bourgeois idealism\" of his time&mdash;that knowledge must be based on [[empirical evidence]].\n\nKnowledge results from hypotheses verified in the contrast with a real object; this real object, despite being mediated by the subject's theoretical frame, retains its materiality and will offer resistance to those ideas that do not conform to its truth. Thus in each of these realms (economic, scientific and political practice), contradictions (principle and secondary) must be identified, explored and put to function to achieve the communist goal. This involves the need to know, \"scientifically\", how the masses produce (how they live, think and work), to obtain knowledge of how class struggle (the main contradiction that articulates a mode of production, in its various realms) expresses itself.\n\nMao held that contradictions were the most important feature of society and since society is dominated by a wide range of contradictions, this calls for a wide range of varying strategies. Revolution is necessary to fully resolve antagonistic contradictions such as those between labour and capital. Contradictions arising within the revolutionary movement call for ideological correction to prevent them from becoming antagonistic.\n\n[[File:Mao Zedong in Red.svg|thumb|Maoism is described as being [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] adapted to Chinese conditions whereas its variant [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] is considered universally applicable]]\n\n=== Three Worlds Theory ===\n[[Three Worlds Theory]] states that during the [[Cold War]] two imperialist states formed the \"first world\"\u2014the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. The second world consisted of the other imperialist states in their spheres of influence. The third world consisted of the non-imperialist countries. Both the first and the second world exploit the third world, but the first world is the most aggressive party. The workers in the first and second world are \"bought up\" by imperialism, preventing socialist revolution. On the other hand, the people of the third world have not even a short-sighted interest in the prevailing circumstances, hence revolution is most likely to appear in third world countries, which again will weaken imperialism opening up for revolutions in other countries too.<ref name=\"emg\">[http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism \"Maoism\"]. Glossary of Terms. ''Encyclopedia of Marxism''.</ref>\n\n=== Agrarian socialism ===\nMaoism departs from conventional European-inspired Marxism in that its focus is on the agrarian countryside, rather than the industrial urban forces\u2014this is known as [[agrarian socialism]]. Notably, Maoist parties in Peru, Nepal, and the Philippines have adopted equal stresses on urban and rural areas, depending on the country's focus of economic activity. Maoism broke with the framework of the [[Soviet Union]] under [[Nikita Khrushchev]], dismissing it as \"[[State capitalism|state capitalist]]\" and \"[[Marxist revisionism|revisionist]]\", a pejorative term among communists referring to those who fight for capitalism in the name of socialism and who depart from [[Historical materialism|historical]] and [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nAlthough Maoism is critical of urban industrial capitalist powers, it views urban [[industrialization]] as a prerequisite to expand [[economic development]] and socialist reorganization to the countryside, with the goal being the achievement of rural industrialization that would abolish the distinction between town and countryside.<ref>John H. Badgley, John Wilson Lewis. Peasant Rebellion and Communist Revolution in Asia. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 1974. p. 249.</ref>\n\n== In China ==\nIn its post-revolutionary period, Mao Zedong Thought is defined in the CPC's Constitution as \"[[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] applied in a Chinese context\", synthesized by Mao and China's \"[[Generations of Chinese leadership|first-generation leaders]]\". It asserts that [[class struggle]] continues even if the [[proletariat]] has already overthrown the [[bourgeoisie]] and there are capitalist restorationist elements within the Communist Party itself. Maoism provided the CPC's first comprehensive theoretical guideline with regards to how to continue socialist revolution, the creation of a socialist society, socialist military construction and highlights various contradictions in society to be addressed by what is termed \"socialist construction\". While it continues to be lauded to be the major force that defeated \"imperialism and feudalism\" and created a \"New China\" by the Communist Party of China, the ideology survives only in name on the Communist Party's Constitution as [[Deng Xiaoping]] abolished most Maoist practices in 1978, advancing a guiding ideology called \"[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|title=Xinhua: Constitution of the Communist Party of China|website=news.xinhuanet.com|accessdate=10 November 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017214011/http://news.xinhuanet.com/ziliao/2002-11/18/content_633225_1.htm|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n== After Mao Zedong's death ==\n=== China ===\n[[File:Mao Zedong 1959 (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]]]]\n[[File:Deng Xiaoping and Jimmy Carter at the arrival ceremony for the Vice Premier of China. - NARA - 183157-restored(cropped).jpg|thumb|[[Deng Xiaoping]]]]\nShortly after Mao's death in 1976, [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|socialist market reforms]] in 1978, thereby beginning the radical change in Mao's ideology in the People's Republic of China (PRC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|title=UC Berkeley Journalism -Faculty - Deng's Revolution|accessdate=22 August 2007|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104132630/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/faculty/schell/schelldeng.html|archivedate=4 January 2009}}</ref> Although Mao Zedong Thought nominally remains the state ideology, Deng's admonition to \"[[seek truth from facts]]\" means that state policies are judged on their practical consequences and in many areas the role of [[ideology]] in determining policy has thus been considerably reduced. Deng also separated Mao from Maoism, making it clear that Mao was fallible and hence the truth of Maoism comes from observing social consequences rather than by using Mao's quotations as [[Holy Writ|holy writ]], as was done in Mao's lifetime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=17 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nContemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by the revisionist Communist Party. Some Maoists say that Deng's ''[[Reform and Opening]]'' economic policies that introduced market principles spelled the end of Maoism in China, although Deng himself asserted that his reforms were upholding Mao Zedong Thought in accelerating the output of the country's [[productive forces]].\n\nIn addition, the party constitution has been rewritten to give the socialist ideas of Deng prominence over those of Mao. One consequence of this is that groups outside China which describe themselves as Maoist generally regard China as having repudiated Maoism and restoring [[capitalism]] and there is a wide perception both inside and outside China that China has abandoned Maoism. However, while it is now permissible to question particular actions of Mao and talk about excesses taken in the name of Maoism, there is a prohibition in China on either publicly questioning the validity of Maoism or on questioning whether the current actions of the CPC are \"Maoist\".\n\nAlthough Mao Zedong Thought is still listed as one of the [[Four Cardinal Principles]] of the People's Republic of China, its historical role has been re-assessed. The Communist Party now says that Maoism was necessary to break China free from its feudal past, but it also says that the actions of Mao are seen to have led to excesses during the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/chinesehistory/contents/02cul/c04s07.html|title=Exploring Chinese History :: Culture :: Philosophy :: Maoism|website=ibiblio.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|official view]] is that China has now reached an economic and political stage, known as the [[primary stage of socialism]], in which China faces new and different problems completely unforeseen by Mao and as such the solutions that Mao advocated are no longer relevant to China's current conditions. The official proclamation of the new CPC stance came in June 1981, when the Sixth Plenum of the Eleventh National Party Congress Central Committee took place. The 35,000-word ''Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of Our Party Since the Founding of the People's Republic of China'' reads: <blockquote>Chief responsibility for the grave 'Left' error of the 'cultural revolution,' an error comprehensive in magnitude and protracted in duration, does indeed lie with Comrade Mao Zedong...

In the West and Third World, a plethora of parties and organizations were formed that upheld links to the CPC. Often they took names such as Communist Party (Marxist\u2013Leninist) or Revolutionary Communist Party to distinguish themselves from the traditional pro-Soviet communist parties. The pro-CPC movements were in many cases based among the wave of student radicalism that engulfed the world in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nOnly one Western classic communist party sided with the CPC, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]]. Under the leadership of the CPC and Mao Zedong, a parallel international communist movement emerged to rival that of the [[Soviets]], although it was never as formalized and homogeneous as the pro-Soviet tendency.\n\nAnother effort at regrouping the international communist movement is the [[International Conference of Marxist\u2013Leninist Parties and Organizations (International Newsletter)|International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations]] (ICMLPO). Three notable parties that participate in the ICMLPO are the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Party of Germany]] (MLPD), the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] (CPP) and [[Marxist\u2013Leninist Communist Organization \u2013 Proletarian Way]]. The ICMLPO seeks to unity around Marxism-Leninism, not Maoism. However, some of the parties and organizations within the ICMLPO identify as Mao Zedong Thought or Maoist.\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nThe [[Progressive Youth Organization]] was a Maoist organization in [[Afghanistan]].

The pro-Soviet [[Communist Party of Belgium]] experienced a split of a Maoist wing under [[Jacques Grippa]]. The latter was a lower-ranking CPB member before the split, but Grippa rose in prominence as he formed a worthy internal Maoist opponent to the CPB leadership. His followers where sometimes referred to as Grippisten or Grippistes. When it became clear that the differences between the pro-Moscow leadership and the pro-Beijing wing were too great, Grippa and his entourage decided to split from the CPB and formed the [[Communist Party of Belgium \u2013 Marxist\u2013Leninist]] (PCBML). The PCBML had some influence, mostly in the heavily industrialized [[Borinage]] region of [[Wallonia]], but never managed to gather more support than the CPB. The latter held most of its leadership and base within the pro-Soviet camp. However, the PCBML was the first European Maoist party, and was recognized at the time of its foundation as the largest and most important Maoist organization in Europe outside of [[Albania]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FjM-4ZG9iuMC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=pcbml+european+maoist+party&source=bl&ots=3WwrGN5owp&sig=ACfU3U02V3qK0mU9WsEzQhJvSbbQAhPMQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiplaaqlY7lAhUwIjQIHcZfBkoQ6AEwCnoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=pcbml%20european%20maoist%20party&f=false|title=Maoism in the Developed World|last=Alexander|first=Robert Jackson|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9780275961480|location=|pages=59|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/world-outlook/v05n37-nov-17-1967-wo.pdf|title=End of the Road for Grippa?|last=|first=|date=17 November 1967|work=World Outlook|access-date=10 October 2019|page=930}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the PCBML never really gained a foothold in [[Flanders]], there was a reasonably successful Maoist movement in this region. Out of the student unions that formed in the wake of the May 1968 protests, Alle Macht Aan De Arbeiders (AMADA) or All Power To The Workers, was formed as a vanguard party-under-construction. This Maoist group originated mostly out of students from the universities of [[Leuven]] and [[Ghent]], but did manage to gain some influence among the striking miners during the shut-downs of the Belgian stonecoal mines in the late 1960s and early 1970s. This group became the [[Workers' Party of Belgium]] (WPB) in 1979 and still exists today, although its power base has shifted somewhat from Flanders towards Wallonia. The WPB stayed loyal to the teachings of Mao for a long time, but after a general congress held in 2008 the party formally broke with its Maoist/Stalinist past.<ref>D.

After the revolution, the MRPP achieved fame for its large and highly artistic mural paintings.\n\nIntensely active during 1974 and 1975, during that time the party had members that later came to be very important in national politics. For example, a future Prime Minister of Portugal, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] was active within Maoist movements in Portugal and identified as a Maoist. In the 1980s, the [[For\u00e7as Populares 25 de Abril]] was another far-left Maoist armed organization operating in Portugal between 1980 and 1987 with the goal of creating socialism in post-[[Carnation Revolution]] Portugal.\n\n=== Spain ===\nThe [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine Maoist party.
