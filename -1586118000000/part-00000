AKP is also widely accredited for overcoming the 2001 economic crisis in Turkey by following International Monetary Fund guidelines, as well as successfully weathering the 2008 financial crisis. From 2002-2011 the Turkish economy grew on average by 7.5 percent annually, thanks to lower inflation and interest rates. The government under AKP also backed extensive privatization programs. The average income in Turkey rose from $2,800 U.S. in 2001 to around $10,000 U.S. in 2011, higher than income in some of the new EU member states. Other reforms included increasing civilian representation over military in areas of national security, education and media, and grant broadcasting and increased cultural rights to Kurds. On Cyprus, AKP supported unification of Cyprus, something deeply opposed by the Turkish military, leading almost to a military coup in 2004. Other AKP reforms included lifting bans on religious and conservative dress, such as headscarves, in universities and public institutions. AKP also ended discrimination against students from religious high schools, who previously had to meet additional criteria in areas of education and upon entry to universities. AKP is also accredited for bringing the Turkish military under civilian rule, a paradigm shift for a country that had experienced constant military meddling for almost a century.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/research/turkey-the-new-model/</ref> \n\nControversies over whether the party remains committed to [[Secularism|secular principles]] enshrined in the [[Turkish constitution]] have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey's constitution establishes the country as a secular state and prohibits any political parties that promote Islamism or shariah law. Some activists, commentators, opponents and government officials have accused the party of Islamism, which has resulted in unsuccessful closure cases, such as the one in 2008 brought about by the lifting of a long-standing university ban on headscarves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1|title=Turkey's governing party avoids being shut down for anti-secularism|author=Robert Tait|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2008-07-30}}</ref> The party denies allegations of Islamism and affirms that it is committed to secularism.

The chief prosecutor charged the Justice and Development Party with abusing the law and justice. He based his case on the fact that the party's leader had been banned from political life for reading an Islamist poem, and thus the party had no standing in elections. The [[European Commission]] had previously criticised Turkey for banning the party's leader from participating in elections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey mulls banning leading party before elections |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/turkey-mulls-banning-leading-party-elections/article-111091|date=October 23, 2002|publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial}}\nThe party again faced a [[2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial|closure trial in 2008]].

Even if it were a political symbol, does that give [one the] right to ban it? Could you bring prohibitions to symbols?\" These statements led to a joint proposal of the Justice and Development Party and the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] for changing the constitution and the law to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves at state universities. Soon afterwards, Turkey's chief prosecutor, [[Abdurrahman Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya]], asked the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] to close down the party on charges of violating the [[Secularism in Turkey|separation of religion and state]] in Turkey.<ref name=\"hurr0730\">{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-634073 |title=From landmark success to closure: AKP's journey |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-07-22 |first=Izgi |last=Gungor }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|accessdate=2008-11-16|title=Closure case against ruling party creates shockwaves|date=2008-03-15|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421214216/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|archivedate=2008-04-21}}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|accessdate=2008-09-04|title=Full text of testimony|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512171455/http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|archive-date=2011-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The closure request failed by only one vote, as only 6 of the 11 judges ruled in favour, with 7 required; however, 10 out of 11 judges agreed that the Justice and Development Party had become \"a center for anti-secular activities\", leading to a loss of 50% of the state funding for the party.<ref>''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 19 August 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html AKP to ask for retrial by Constitutional Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820065944/http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html |date=2013-08-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Elections ===\n==== 2002 general elections ====\nThe AKP won a sweeping victory in the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 elections]], which saw every party previously represented in the Grand National Assembly ejected from the chamber. In the process, it won a two-thirds majority of seats, becoming the first Turkish party in 11 years to win an outright majority. Erdo\u011fan, as the leader of the biggest party in parliament, would have been normally given the task to form a cabinet. However according to the Turkish Constitution Article 109 the Prime Ministers had to be also a representative of the Turkish Parliament.  Erdagan, who was banned from holding any political office after a 1994 incident in which he read a poem deemed pro-Islamist by judges, was therefore not. As a result, G\u00fcl became prime minister. It survived the crisis over the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite a massive back bench rebellion where over a hundred AKP MPs joined those of the opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) in parliament to prevent the government from allowing the [[United States]] to launch a Northern offensive in Iraq from Turkish territory. Later, Erdo\u011fan's ban was abolished with the help of the CHP and Erdo\u011fan became prime minister by being selected to parliament after a [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|by-election in Siirt]].\n\n[[File:AK Party poster after the parliamentary elections in 2007.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Party leader Erdo\u011fan on a poster thanking the people for the election results.]]\nThe AKP has undertaken structural reforms, and during its rule Turkey has seen rapid growth and an end to its three decade long period of high inflation rates.

The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdo\u011fan claimed the failure to elect a president was a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution.\n\nThe AKP achieved victory in the rescheduled July 22, 2007 elections with 46.6% of the vote, translating into control of 341 of the 550 available parliamentary seats. Although the AKP received significantly more votes in 2007 than in 2002, the number of parliamentary seats they controlled decreased due to the rules of the [[Elections in Turkey|Turkish electoral system.]] However, they retained a comfortable ruling majority.<ref name=vote2007 /> \"[[No Stopping, Push On!]]\" was the slogan of the Justice and Development Party in the general elections of 2007.\n\nTerritorially, the elections of 2007 saw a major advance for the AKP, with the party outpolling the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic Society Party]] in traditional Kurdish strongholds such as [[Van Province|Van]] and [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], as well as outpolling the secular-left CHP in traditionally secular areas such as [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]]. Overall, the AKP secured a plurality of votes in 68 of Turkey's 81 provinces, with its strongest vote of 71% coming from [[Bing\u00f6l Province|Bing\u00f6l]].

The reform package was first vetoed by [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer|President Sezer]]. Then he applied to the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]] about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court did not find any problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.\n\nThe reforms consisted of:\n* electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament;\n* reducing the presidential term from seven years to five;\n* allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term;\n* holding general elections every four years instead of five;\n* reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.\n\n==== 2009 local elections ====\nThe Turkish local elections of 2009 took place during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]. After the success of the AKP in the 2007 general elections, the party saw a decline in the local elections of 2009. In these elections the AKP received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. Still, the AKP remained the dominating party in Turkey. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AKP won in Turkey's largest cities: [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329100431/http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |title=Turkish local elections, 2009 |date=2009-03-29 |publisher=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |section=International / Europe }}</ref>\n\n==== 2010 constitutional referendum ====\nReforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign.

The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.\n\n==== 2014 elections ====\nIn the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|presidential election of 2014]], the AKP's long time leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was elected President. In the party's [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first extraordinary congress]], former foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader and took over as Prime Minister on 28 August 2014.  Davuto\u011flu stepped down as Prime Minister on 4 May 2016 following policy disagreements with President Erdo\u011fan.  Presidential aide Cemil Ertem said to Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilize further \"when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdo\u011fan takes office\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey PM Ahmet Davuto\u011flu to quit amid reports of Erdo\u011fan rift|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36213401|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015 general election ====\nIn the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|general election]] held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye B\u00fcy\u00fck Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party and the power to form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)]], HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.\n\n==== 2019 local elections ====\nIn the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 local elections]], the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey's 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to AKP's mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as alleged government inaction on the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Syrian refugee crisis]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html|title=Istanbul election rerun won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan|author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/world/europe/istanbul-mayor-election-erdogan.html|title=Turkey's President Suffers Stinging Defeat in Istanbul Election Redo|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|date=2019-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Soon after the elections, the Turkish government ordered a [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|re-election in Istanbul]].

AKP is also widely accredited for overcoming the 2001 economic crisis in Turkey by following International Monetary Fund guidelines, as well as successfully weathering the 2008 financial crisis. From 2002-2011 the Turkish economy grew on average by 7.5 percent annually, thanks to lower inflation and interest rates. The government under AKP also backed extensive privatization programs. The average income in Turkey rose from $2,800 U.S. in 2001 to around $10,000 U.S. in 2011, higher than income in some of the new EU member states. Other reforms included increasing civilian representation over military in areas of national security, education and media, and grant broadcasting and increased cultural rights to Kurds. On Cyprus, AKP supported unification of Cyprus, something deeply opposed by the Turkish military, leading almost to a military coup in 2004. Other AKP reforms included lifting bans on religious and conservative dress, such as headscarves, in universities and public institutions. AKP also ended discrimination against students from religious high schools, who previously had to meet additional criteria in areas of education and upon entry to universities. AKP is also accredited for bringing the Turkish military under civilian rule, a paradigm shift for a country that had experienced constant military meddling for almost a century.<ref>https://www.brookings.edu/research/turkey-the-new-model/</ref> \n\nControversies over whether the party remains committed to [[Secularism|secular principles]] enshrined in the [[Turkish constitution]] have dominated Turkish politics since 2002. Turkey's constitution establishes the country as a secular state and prohibits any political parties that promote Islamism or shariah law. Some activists, commentators, opponents and government officials have accused the party of Islamism, which has resulted in unsuccessful closure cases, such as the one in 2008 brought about by the lifting of a long-standing university ban on headscarves.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jul/30/turkey.nato1|title=Turkey's governing party avoids being shut down for anti-secularism|author=Robert Tait|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2008-07-30}}</ref> The party denies allegations of Islamism and affirms that it is committed to secularism.

The chief prosecutor charged the Justice and Development Party with abusing the law and justice. He based his case on the fact that the party's leader had been banned from political life for reading an Islamist poem, and thus the party had no standing in elections. The [[European Commission]] had previously criticised Turkey for banning the party's leader from participating in elections.<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey mulls banning leading party before elections |url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/turkey-mulls-banning-leading-party-elections/article-111091|date=October 23, 2002|publisher=EurActiv |accessdate=February 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Main|2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial}}\nThe party again faced a [[2008 Justice and Development Party closure trial|closure trial in 2008]].

Even if it were a political symbol, does that give [one the] right to ban it? Could you bring prohibitions to symbols?\" These statements led to a joint proposal of the Justice and Development Party and the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] for changing the constitution and the law to lift a ban on women wearing headscarves at state universities. Soon afterwards, Turkey's chief prosecutor, [[Abdurrahman Yal\u00e7\u0131nkaya]], asked the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey]] to close down the party on charges of violating the [[Secularism in Turkey|separation of religion and state]] in Turkey.<ref name=\"hurr0730\">{{cite news |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=-634073 |title=From landmark success to closure: AKP's journey |work=[[Turkish Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-08-11 |date=2008-07-22 |first=Izgi |last=Gungor }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|accessdate=2008-11-16|title=Closure case against ruling party creates shockwaves|date=2008-03-15|work=[[Today's Zaman]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421214216/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=136476|archivedate=2008-04-21}}<br/>{{cite news|url=http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|accessdate=2008-09-04|title=Full text of testimony|work=[[Milliyet]]|language=Turkish|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512171455/http://i.milliyet.com.tr/akpsavunma/default.aspx?ver=59|archive-date=2011-05-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The closure request failed by only one vote, as only 6 of the 11 judges ruled in favour, with 7 required; however, 10 out of 11 judges agreed that the Justice and Development Party had become \"a center for anti-secular activities\", leading to a loss of 50% of the state funding for the party.<ref>''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 19 August 2013, [http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html AKP to ask for retrial by Constitutional Court] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820065944/http://todayszaman.com/news-323934-ak-party-to-ask-for-retrial-by-constitutional-court.html |date=2013-08-20 }}</ref>\n\n=== Elections ===\n==== 2002 general elections ====\nThe AKP won a sweeping victory in the [[2002 Turkish general election|2002 elections]], which saw every party previously represented in the Grand National Assembly ejected from the chamber. In the process, it won a two-thirds majority of seats, becoming the first Turkish party in 11 years to win an outright majority. Erdo\u011fan, as the leader of the biggest party in parliament, would have been normally given the task to form a cabinet. However according to the Turkish Constitution Article 109 the Prime Ministers had to be also a representative of the Turkish Parliament.  Erdagan, who was banned from holding any political office after a 1994 incident in which he read a poem deemed pro-Islamist by judges, was therefore not. As a result, G\u00fcl became prime minister. It survived the crisis over the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] despite a massive back bench rebellion where over a hundred AKP MPs joined those of the opposition [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) in parliament to prevent the government from allowing the [[United States]] to launch a Northern offensive in Iraq from Turkish territory. Later, Erdo\u011fan's ban was abolished with the help of the CHP and Erdo\u011fan became prime minister by being selected to parliament after a [[2003 Siirt Province by-election|by-election in Siirt]].\n\n[[File:AK Party poster after the parliamentary elections in 2007.jpg|right|230px|thumb|Party leader Erdo\u011fan on a poster thanking the people for the election results.]]\nThe AKP has undertaken structural reforms, and during its rule Turkey has seen rapid growth and an end to its three decade long period of high inflation rates.

The opposition parties boycotted the parliamentary vote and deadlocked the election process. At the same time, Erdo\u011fan claimed the failure to elect a president was a failure of the Turkish political system and proposed to modify the constitution.\n\nThe AKP achieved victory in the rescheduled July 22, 2007 elections with 46.6% of the vote, translating into control of 341 of the 550 available parliamentary seats. Although the AKP received significantly more votes in 2007 than in 2002, the number of parliamentary seats they controlled decreased due to the rules of the [[Elections in Turkey|Turkish electoral system.]] However, they retained a comfortable ruling majority.<ref name=vote2007 /> \"[[No Stopping, Push On!]]\" was the slogan of the Justice and Development Party in the general elections of 2007.\n\nTerritorially, the elections of 2007 saw a major advance for the AKP, with the party outpolling the pro-Kurdish [[Democratic Society Party]] in traditional Kurdish strongholds such as [[Van Province|Van]] and [[Mardin Province|Mardin]], as well as outpolling the secular-left CHP in traditionally secular areas such as [[Antalya Province|Antalya]] and [[Artvin Province|Artvin]]. Overall, the AKP secured a plurality of votes in 68 of Turkey's 81 provinces, with its strongest vote of 71% coming from [[Bing\u00f6l Province|Bing\u00f6l]].

The reform package was first vetoed by [[Ahmet Necdet Sezer|President Sezer]]. Then he applied to the [[Constitutional Court of Turkey|Turkish constitutional court]] about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court did not find any problems in the package and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.\n\nThe reforms consisted of:\n* electing the president by popular vote instead of by parliament;\n* reducing the presidential term from seven years to five;\n* allowing the president to stand for re-election for a second term;\n* holding general elections every four years instead of five;\n* reducing the quorum of lawmakers needed for parliamentary decisions from 367 to 184.\n\n==== 2009 local elections ====\nThe Turkish local elections of 2009 took place during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]]. After the success of the AKP in the 2007 general elections, the party saw a decline in the local elections of 2009. In these elections the AKP received 39% of the vote, 3% less than in the local elections of 2004. Still, the AKP remained the dominating party in Turkey. The second party CHP received 23% of the vote and the third party MHP received 16% of the vote. The AKP won in Turkey's largest cities: [[Ankara]] and [[Istanbul]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329100431/http://secim2009.ntvmsnbc.com/default.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-03-29 |title=Turkish local elections, 2009 |date=2009-03-29 |publisher=[[NTV-MSNBC]] |section=International / Europe }}</ref>\n\n==== 2010 constitutional referendum ====\nReforming the Constitution was one of the main pledges of the AKP during the 2007 election campaign.

The referendum was agreed by a majority of 58%.\n\n==== 2014 elections ====\nIn the [[2014 Turkish presidential election|presidential election of 2014]], the AKP's long time leader Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan was elected President. In the party's [[2014 Justice and Development Party Extraordinary Congress|first extraordinary congress]], former foreign minister [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] was unanimously elected unopposed as party leader and took over as Prime Minister on 28 August 2014.  Davuto\u011flu stepped down as Prime Minister on 4 May 2016 following policy disagreements with President Erdo\u011fan.  Presidential aide Cemil Ertem said to Turkish TV that the country and its economy would stabilize further \"when a prime minister more closely aligned with President Erdo\u011fan takes office\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Turkey PM Ahmet Davuto\u011flu to quit amid reports of Erdo\u011fan rift|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36213401|publisher=BBC|accessdate=5 May 2016|work=BBC News|date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n==== 2015 general election ====\nIn the [[June 2015 Turkish general election|general election]] held on 7 June, the AKP gained 40.87% of the vote and 258 seats in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] (Turkish: T\u00fcrkiye B\u00fcy\u00fck Millet Meclisi, TBMM). Though it still remains the biggest party in Turkey, the AKP lost its status as the majority party and the power to form a single-party government. Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AKP was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]], who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)]], HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AKP from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution. The AKP is now forced to form a coalition government in negotiation with other parties.\n\n==== 2019 local elections ====\nIn the [[2019 Turkish local elections|2019 local elections]], the ruling party AKP lost control of Istanbul and Ankara for the first time in 25 years, as well as 5 of Turkey's 6 largest cities. The loss has been widely attributed to AKP's mismanagement of the Turkish economic crisis, rising authoritarianism as well as alleged government inaction on the [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War in Turkey|Syrian refugee crisis]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/23/europe/turkey-istanbul-mayor-election-intl/index.html|title=Istanbul election rerun won by opposition, in blow to Erdogan|author=Isil Sariyuce and Ivana Kottasov\u00e1|website=CNN|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/23/world/europe/istanbul-mayor-election-erdogan.html|title=Turkey's President Suffers Stinging Defeat in Istanbul Election Redo|last=Gall|first=Carlotta|date=2019-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Soon after the elections, the Turkish government ordered a [[June 2019 Istanbul mayoral election|re-election in Istanbul]].

{"title_page": "Japanese dictionary", "text_new": "{{Nihongo|'''Japanese dictionaries'''|\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178|Kokugo jiten|lead=yes}} have a history that began over 1300 years ago when [[Japanese Buddhist]] priests, who wanted to understand Chinese [[sutra]]s, adapted [[Chinese character]] dictionaries.  Present-day Japanese [[lexicographer]]s are exploring computerized editing and [[electronic dictionaries]]. According to Keisuke Nakao:\n  \n<blockquote>It has often been said that dictionary publishing in Japan is active and prosperous, that Japanese people are well provided for with reference tools, and that lexicography here, in practice as well as in research, has produced a number of valuable reference books together with voluminous academic studies. (1998:35)\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter introducing some Japanese \"dictionary\" words, this article will discuss early and modern Japanese dictionaries, demarcated at the 1603 CE lexicographical sea-change from ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'', the first bilingual Japanese\u2013Portuguese dictionary. \"Early\" here will refer to lexicography during the [[Heian period|Heian]], [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]], and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] periods (794\u20131573); and \"modern\" to Japanese dictionaries from the [[Edo period|Edo]] or Tokugawa era (1603\u20131867) through the present.\n\n==Lexicographical terminology==\nFirst, it will be useful to introduce some key Japanese terms for dictionaries and [[collation]] (ordering of entry words) that the following discussion will be using.\n\nThe [[Wiktionary]] uses English ''[[Wikt:dictionary|dictionary]]'' to define a few synonyms including [[Wikt:lexicon|lexicon]], [[Wikt:wordbook|wordbook]], [[Wikt:vocabulary|vocabulary]], [[Wikt:thesaurus|thesaurus]], and [[Wikt:translating dictionary|translating dictionary]]. It also uses ''dictionary'' to translate six Japanese words.\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u8f9e\u5178|\u8f9e\u5178]], [[Literal translation|lit.]] \"word reference-work\") \"dictionary; lexicon; glossary\"\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u5178|\u5b57\u5178]], lit. \"character reference-work\") \"character dictionary\"\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u4e8b\u5178|\u4e8b\u5178]], lit. \"thing reference-work\") \"encyclopedia, encyclopedic dictionary\"<ref>Colloquially, to distinguish \u8f9e\u5178 and \u4e8b\u5178, the former is referred to as ''kotoba no ten'' (\u3053\u3068\u3070\u306e\u5178) and the latter ''koto no ten'' (\u3053\u3068\u306e\u5178).</ref>\n*''jisho'' ([[Wikt:\u8f9e\u66f8|\u8f9e\u66f8]], lit. \"word book\") \"dictionary; wordbook; lexicon; glossary\"\n*''jisho'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u66f8|\u5b57\u66f8]], lit. \"character book\") \"character dictionary; dictionary\"\n*''jibiki'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u5f15|\u5b57\u5f15]], lit. \"character pull/arrange) \"character dictionary; dictionary\"\nThe first three [[homophonous]] ''jiten'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''ten'' ([[Wikt:\u5178|\u5178]] \"reference work; dictionary; classic; canon; model\") are Chinese [[loanwords]]. However, Chinese distinguishes their pronunciations, avoiding the potential ambiguities of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] ''jiten'': ''c\u00eddi\u01cen'' \u8f9e\u5178 \"word dictionary\", ''z\u00ecdi\u01cen'' \u5b57\u5178 \"character dictionary\", or ''sh\u00ecdi\u01cen'' \u4e8b\u5178 \"encyclopedia\". The usual Japanese word for \"encyclopedia\" is ''hyakka jiten'' (\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u5178 \"100/many subject dictionary\", see [[Japanese encyclopedias]]). The ''jiten'', ''jisho'', and ''jibiki'' terms for dictionaries of ''[[kanji]]'' \"Chinese characters\" share the element ''ji'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57|\u5b57]] \"character; graph; letter; script; writing\").\n\nLexicographical collation is straightforward for [[romanized]] languages, and most dictionaries enter words in alphabetical order. In contrast, the [[Japanese writing system]], with ''kanji'', ''[[hiragana]]'', and ''[[katakana]]'', creates complications for dictionary ordering. University of Arizona professor Don C. Bailey (1960:4) discusses how Japanese lexicography differentiates semantic, graphic, and phonetic collation methods, namely:\n*''bunruitai'' (\u5206\u985e\u4f53 \"classification form\") \"semantic collation; grouping words with similar meanings; thesaurus-like organization\"\n*''jikeibiki'' (\u5b57\u5f62\u5f15\u304d \"character shape arrangement\") \"logographic collation; organizing ''kanji'' dictionaries by [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (recurring graphic components)\"\n*''onbiki'' (\u97f3\u5f15\u304d \"pronunciation arrangement\") \"phonetic collation; organization by the Japanese [[syllabary]] in ''[[iroha]]'' or ''[[goj\u016bon]]'' ordering\"\nIn general, ''jikeibiki'' organization is for a readers' dictionary, ''bunruitai'' for a writers' dictionary, and ''onbiki'' for both types.\n\nThe Japanese writing system originated with the introduction of [[Chinese characters]] around the 4th century CE, and early Japanese dictionaries developed from [[Chinese dictionaries]] circa the 7th century CE. These three Japanese collation systems were borrowed and adapted from Chinese character dictionaries.\n\nThe first, and oldest, Chinese system of collation by [[semantic field]] (for instance, \"birds\" or \"fish\") dates back to the ca. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]''. Only a few dictionaries like the ''[[Xiao Erya]]'', ''[[Guangya]]'', and ''[[Piya]]'' used semantic collation. This system is inefficient looking up a word unless the dictionary user already knows its meaning; imagine, for example, using [[Roget's Thesaurus]] without an alphabetical index. ''Bunruitai'' collation is obsolete among modern Japanese dictionaries, with the exception of thesauri.\n\nThe second system of dictionary collation by radicals (Chinese ''bushou'', Japanese ''bushu'', \u90e8\u9996 \"section headers\") originated with the 121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''. Japanese dictionaries followed the Chinese example of reducing the number of radicals: original 540 (''Shuowen Jiezi''), adjusted 542 (''[[Yupian]]''), condensed 214 (''[[Zihui]]'', ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]''), and abridged 189 (''[[Xinhua Zidian]]''). Japanese ''jikeibiki'' collation by radical and [[stroke order|stroke]] ordering is standard for character dictionaries, and does not require a user to know the meaning or pronunciation beforehand.\n\nThe third Chinese system of ordering by pronunciation is evident in a [[rime dictionary]], which collates the characters by [[Tone name|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]]. The 601 CE ''[[Qieyun]]'' is the oldest extant Chinese dictionary collated by pronunciation, and was expanded in the ''[[Guangyun]]'' and ''[[Jiyun]]''. The shortcoming of this unwieldy tone-rime method is that a user needs to know, or guess, the pronunciation of a character in order to look it up. The modern Chinese dictionary improvement is alphabetical collation by ''[[pinyin]]'' romanization. Japanese ''onbiki'' dictionaries historically changed from poetic ''iroha'' to practical ''goj\u016bon'' ordering around 1890. Compare the former [[pangram]] poem (''i-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to, chi-ri-nu-ru-wo'', \u2026 \"Although flowers glow with color, They are quickly fallen, \u2026) with the latter \"fifty sounds\" 10 consonants by 5 vowels grid (''a-i-u-e-o, ka-ki-ku-ke-ko'', \u2026).\n\n==Early Japanese lexicography==\nThe first Japanese dictionaries are no longer extant and only known by titles. For example, the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (tr. Aston 1896:354) says [[Emperor Tenmu]] was presented a dictionary in 682 CE, the ''Niina'' (\u65b0\u5b57, \"New Characters\") with 44 fascicles (''kan'' [[Wikt:\u5dfb|\u5dfb]]). The earliest dictionaries made in Japan were not for the Japanese language but rather dictionaries of Chinese characters written in Chinese and annotated in Japanese.\n\nJapanese lexicography flowered during the Heian Period, when [[Chinese culture]] and [[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan. During the Kamakura and Muromachi eras, despite advances in [[woodblock printing]] technology, there was a decline in lexicography that Bailey (1960:22) describes as \"a tendency toward simplification and popularization\".\n\nThe following review of the first published Japanese dictionaries is divided into the above lexicographical ''jikeibiki'', ''bunruitai'', and ''onbiki'' types.\n\n===Graphically organized dictionaries===\n''Jikeibiki'' graphic collation began with the oldest extant Japanese dictionary: the circa 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi]]'', edited by the Heian monk and scholar [[K\u016bkai]]. It enters approximately 1,000 characters under 534 radicals, and each entry gives the [[seal script]] character, Chinese [[fanqie]] reading, and definition (usually copied from the ''Yupian''), but does not give native [[kun'yomi]] Japanese readings.\n\nThe first dictionary containing Japanese readings of ''kanji'' was the circa 900 ''[[Shinsen Jiky\u014d]]'', which the editor Sh\u014dj\u016b (\u660c\u4f4f) compiled from the ''Yupian'' and ''Qieyun''. It enters 21,300 characters, giving both Chinese and Sino-Japanese readings, and cites many early Japanese texts. Internal organization innovatively combines ''jikeibiki'' and ''bunruitai'' methods; a simplified system of 160 radicals is ordered semantically (e.g., 5-7 are Rain, Air, and Wind).\n\nThe circa 1100 Buddhist ''[[Ruiju My\u014dgish\u014d]]'' dictionary lists over 32,000 characters and compounds under 120 radicals. The structure and definitions closely follow the Chinese ''Yupian'' and ''Qieyun''. This Heian reference work gives both Sino-Japanese and Japanese readings for ''kanji'', usually with [[Kanbun]] annotations in citations from [[Chinese classic texts]].\n\nThe circa 1245 ''[[Jiky\u014dsh\u016b]]'' collates Chinese characters primarily by the 542 ''Yupian'' radicals and secondarily by semantic headings adapted from the ''Iroha Jiruish\u014d''. This Kamakura dictionary, edited by Sugawara no Tamenaga (\u83c5\u539f\u70ba\u9577), exists in 3, 7, and 20 fascicle editions that have convoluted textual histories.\n\nThe next ''jikeibiki'' collated dictionary of ''kanji'' was the circa 1489 ''[[Wagokuhen]]''. This \"Japanese ''Yupian''\" was based on the Chinese ''Yupian'', actually the 1013 ''Daguang yihui Yupian'' (\u5927\u5ee3\u76ca\u6703\u7389\u7bc7, \"Expanded and Enlarged ''Yupian''\"), which was current in Muromachi Japan. The ''Wagokuhen'' went through dozens of editions, which collate entries through various systems of (from 100 to 542) radicals, without any overt semantic subdivisions.\n\nTwo historical aspects of these logographically arranged Japanese ''jikeibiki'' dictionaries are reducing the number of radicals and semantically ordering them. The radical systems ranged from 542 (the ''Yupian''), 534, 160, 120, down to 100. Both the ''Shinsen Jiky\u014d'' and ''Jiky\u014dsh\u016b'' refined logographic categorization with ''bunruitai''-type arrangements. While Chinese dictionaries have occasional examples of semantically ordered radicals (for instance, [[Kangxi radicals]] 38 and 39 are Woman and Child), Japanese lexicography restructured radicals into more easily memorable sequences.\n\n===Semantically organized dictionaries===\nJapanese ''bunruitai'' semantic collation of dictionaries began with the 938 CE ''[[Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d]]'', compiled by Minamoto no Shitag\u014d (\u6e90\u9806). This Heian dictionary adapts the ancient Chinese ''Erya'' dictionary's 19 semantic categories into 24 Japanese headings with subheadings. For instance, Heaven and Earth is subdivided into Stars and Constellations, Clouds and Rain, Wind and Snow, etc.\nThe character entries give source citations, Chinese pronunciations, definitions, and Japanese readings in the ancient ''[[Man'y\u014dgana]]'' character system.\n\nThe circa 1444 ''[[Kagakush\u016b]]'' was an anonymous Muromachi era Japanese language dictionary or encyclopedia that defined some 3000 words into 18 semantic categories. It was designed for the literate public rather than for priests and literati, and was reissued many times.\n\n===Phonetically organized dictionaries===\nJapanese ''onbiki'' phonetic collation began during the late Heian Period. The circa 1144&ndash;1165 CE ''[[Iroha Jiruish\u014d]]'' was the first dictionary to group entries in the ''iroha'' order. Words are entered by 47 first ''[[kana]]'' syllables, each subdivided into 21 semantic groups.\n\nThe circa 1468 ''[[Setsuy\u014dsh\u016b]]'' was a popular Muromachi dictionary collated in ''iroha'' order and subdivided into 12 (later 13) semantic categories. It defined current Japanese vocabulary rather than borrowed Sino-Japanese compounds, and went through many editions and reprints.\n\nThe 1484 ''[[Onkochishinsho]]'' was the first Japanese dictionary to collate words in ''goj\u016bon'' rather than conventional ''iroha'' order. This Muromachi reference work enters about 13,000 words, first by pronunciation and then by 12 subject classifications.\n\nAll three of these ''onbiki'' dictionaries adapted the ''bunruitai'' method to collate primarily by first syllable and secondarily by semantic field. This is comparatively less efficient than modern Japanese dictionaries with single-sorting ''goj\u016bon'' collation by first syllable, second syllable, etc.\n\n==Modern Japanese lexicography==\nThe development of early Japanese lexicography from Chinese\u2013Japanese dictionaries has cross-linguistic parallels, for instance, early English language lexicography developed from Latin\u2013English dictionaries. Nonetheless, modern Japanese lexicography adapted to an unparalleled second foreign wave from Western language dictionaries and romanization.\n\nDuring the [[Nanban trade]] Period (1543&ndash;1650 CE) when Japan was opened to Europeans, the [[Jesuit]] Mission Press published two groundbreaking dictionaries. The 1598 monolingual ''[[Rakuy\u014dsh\u016b]]'' (\u843d\u8449\u96c6, \"Collection of Fallen Leaves\") gave Sino-Japanese and native Japanese readings of characters, and introduced the small raised circle (''handakuten'' \u534a\u6fc1\u70b9) to indicate the ''p'' sound (compare ''ha'' \u306f and ''pa'' \u3071). The 1603&ndash;1604 bilingual Japanese-Portuguese ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' or ''Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam'' dictionary is still cited as an authority for early Japanese pronunciation. The year 1604 was at the beginning of the Edo Period and also, as Nakao (1998:37) points out, the date of the first monolingual English dictionary, the [[Table Alphabeticall]].\n\nDuring the [[Sakoku]] Period (1641&ndash;1853) when Japan was closed to foreigners, with the exception of the [[Dutch East India Company]], ''[[Rangaku]]'' (\"Dutch/Western learning\") influenced Japanese lexicography through bilingual Japanese and Dutch dictionaries. Another notable publication was the 1712 ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'' encyclopedia, which was based on the 1609 Chinese ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]''.\n\n===Japanese language dictionaries===\n''Kokugo jiten/jisho'' (\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178/\u8f9e\u66f8 \"national language dictionary\") means \"Japanese\u2013Japanese dictionary, monolingual Japanese dictionary\". This \"national language\" term ''kokugo'', which Chinese borrowed as ''guoyu'', usually refers to the Japanese language as taught in Japanese schools. ''Nihongo jisho'' (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8f9e\u66f8 \"Japanese language dictionary\") is a neologism that contrasts Japanese with other world languages. There are hundreds of ''kokugo'' dictionaries in print, ranging from huge multivolume tomes to paperback abridgments. According to Japanese translator Tom Gally (1999:n.p.), \"While all have shortcomings, the best ''kokugo'' dictionaries are probably among the best reference works in existence in any language.\"\n\nThe Edo ''[[Kokugaku]]'' scholar [[Tanikawa Kotosuga]] ([[:ja:\u8c37\u5ddd\u58eb\u6e05]], 1709&ndash;1776) began compilation of the first full-scale Japanese language dictionary, the ''Wakun no Shiori'' or ''Wakunkan'' (\u548c\u8a13\u681e \"Guidebook to Japanese Pronunciations\"). This influential 9-volume dictionary of classical Japanese words was posthumously completed and finally published in 1887.\n\nThe first truly modern Japanese language dictionary was edited by the grammarian and English translator [[\u014ctsuki Fumihiko]], who used ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' as the model for his pioneering ''Genkai'' (\u8a00\u6d77 \"Sea of Words, 1889&ndash;1891)\". His revised 5-volume ''Daigenkai'' (\u5927\u8a00\u6d77 \"Great/Comprehensive Sea of Words\", Fuzanb\u014d, 1932&ndash;1937) dictionary continues to be cited for its definitions and etymologies.\n\nThe ''Daijiten'' (\u5927\u8fad\u5178 \"Great/Comprehensive Dictionary\", Heibonsha 1934\u201336), edited by Shimonaka Yasabur\u014d (\u4e0b\u4e2d\u5f4c\u4e09\u90ce), is the largest ''kokugo'' dictionary ever published. The original 26-volume edition, which is still available in condensed versions, entered over 700,000 headwords, listed by pronunciation, and covered a wide variety of Japanese vocabulary.\n\nThe ''[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]'' (Shogakukan, 1972, 1976) is the modern equivalent of the ''Daigenkai'' and ''Daijiten''. This multivolume historical dictionary enters about 500,000 headwords, and is currently the most complete reference work for the Japanese language.\n\nThe bestselling ''kokugo'' titles are practical 1-volume dictionaries rather than encyclopedic works like the ''Nihon Kokugo Daijiten''. For present purposes, they are divided between large-size dictionaries that enter 100,000-200,000 headwords on 2000-3000 pages and medium-size ones with 60,000-100,000 on 1300&ndash;1500 pages. The following discussion will introduce the central ''kokugo'' dictionaries, excepting the numerous smallest editions.\n\nLarger single-volume Japanese language dictionaries are a highly profitable and competitive market for Japanese publishing houses.\n*The ''[[K\u014djien]]'' (\"Wide Garden of Words\", Iwanami Shoten, 1955, 5th ed. 1998), edited by [[Shinmura Izuru]], enters 200,000 headwords. This highly respected dictionary gives definitions in chronological order, which is useful for understanding diachronic semantics. Japanese newspaper editorials commonly cite ''K\u014djien'' definitions as authoritative, but the following dictionaries are sometimes lexicographically superior.\n*The ''[[Daijirin]]'' (\u5927\u8f9e\u6797 \"Great Forest of Words\", 1988, Sanseid\u014d, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Matsumura Akira (\u677e\u6751\u660e), has 233,000 headwords. This highly-evaluated rival of the ''K\u014djien'' gives detailed definitions, and arranges word meanings with the most common ones first, instead of historical order.\n*The ''[[Daijisen]]'' (\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 \"Great Fountainhead of Words\", Sh\u014dgakukan, 1995, 2nd ed. 1998), also edited by Matsumura Akira (above), has 220,000 entries, and is practically a twin of the ''Daijirin''. Two minor improvements are color pictures instead of [[line art]] and replacing classical usage citations with contemporary ones.\n*The ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \"Great Japanese Dictionary\", K\u014ddansha, 1989, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Umesao Tadao (\u6885\u68f9\u5fe0\u592b), enters 175,000 headwords. It is distinguished by numerous color illustrations and occasional English translations.\nThe hefty scale of these larger dictionaries provides comprehensive coverage of Japanese words, but also renders them cumbersome and unwieldy.\n\nMedium single-volume dictionaries have comparative advantages in portability, usability, and price.\n*The ''[[Sanseid\u014d Kokugo Jiten]]'' (\u4e09\u7701\u5802\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \"Sanseido's Japanese Dictionary\", 1960, 5th ed. 2001), edited by Kenb\u014d Hidetoshi (\u898b\u574a\u8c6a\u7d00), has 76,000 headwords.

This popular and distinctive dictionary achieved notoriety from [[Akasegawa Genpei]]'s 1996 bestseller that listed many amusingly idiosyncratic definitions.\n*The ''Meiji Shoin Seisen Kokugo Jiten'' (\u660e\u6cbb\u66f8\u9662\u7cbe\u9078\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \"Meiji Publishing's Selected Japanese Dictionary\", 1972, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Miyaji Yutaka (\u5bae\u5730\u88d5) and Kai Mutsur\u014d (\u7532\u6590\u7766\u90ce), has 50,000 headwords.

This was the first Japanese dictionary fully edited with computers, and give illustrative citations from over 350 published sources.\nSome Japanese publishers sell both a larger dictionary with more archaisms and classical citations as well as a smaller condensation with more modern examples, for instance, Sh\u014dgakukan's ''Daijisen'' and ''Gendai Kokugo Reikai Jiten''.\n\n===Chinese character dictionaries===\n''Kan-Wa jiten'' ([[:ja:\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178|\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178]] \"''[[Han Chinese|Kan]]''[''ji''] Chinese [character]-''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' Japanese dictionary\") means \"Japanese dictionary of ''kanji'' (Chinese characters)\". This unique type of monolingual dictionary enters Japanese borrowings of ''kanji'' and multi-character compounds (''jukugo'' [[Wikt:\u719f\u8a9e|\u719f\u8a9e]]), but is not a bilingual Chinese\u2013Japanese dictionary. A ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionary headword (''oyaji'' \u89aa\u5b57 \"parent character\") entry typically gives variant graphic forms, graphic etymology, readings, meanings, compounds, and idioms. Indexes usually include both radical-stroke and pronunciation (''on'' and ''kun'' readings), and sometimes other character indexing systems like the [[four corner method]].\n\nThe history of ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionaries began with early Japanese references such as the ''Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi'' and ''Ruiju My\u014dgish\u014d'' (above). In 1716, the Edo author of ''[[Yomihon]]'', Tsuga Teish\u014d (\u90fd\u8cc0\u5ead\u9418, 1718&ndash;1794) published the ''K\u014dki Jiten'' (\u5eb7\u7199\u5b57\u5178), a Japanese version of the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', which standardized the ''Kan-Wa jiten'' system of 214 Kangxi radicals. The first dictionary titled with ''Kan-Wa'' was the ''Kan-Wa Daijiten'' (\u6f22\u548c\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"Great ''Kanji''-Japanese Character Dictionary\", Sanseid\u014d, 1903), edited by Shigeno Yasutsugu (\u91cd\u91ce\u5b89\u7e79, 1827&ndash;1910), founder of the ''[[Shigaku zasshi]]''. The '' Daijiten'' (\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"Great Character Dictionary\", Kodansha, 1917), edited by Eida Takei \u6804\u7530\u731b\u732a, went through numerous reprints.\n\nThe best available ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionary is unquestionably [[Tetsuji Morohashi|Morohashi Tetsuji]]'s 13-volume ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'' (\"Great/Comprehensive ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", Taish\u016bkan, 1956\u201360), which contains over 50,000 characters and 530,000 compounds. It was condensed into the 4-volume ''K\u014d Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u5e83\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"Broad ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", Taish\u016bkan, 1982), edited by Morohashi, Kamada Tadashi (\u938c\u7530\u6b63), and Yoneyama Toratar\u014d (\u7c73\u5c71\u5bc5\u592a\u90ce), which enters 20,000 characters and 120,000 compounds.\n\nThe following major ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionaries are presented in the chronological order of their first editions.

It combines two other Heibonsha dictionaries edited by Shirakawa, the etymological ''Jit\u014d'' (\u5b57\u7d71, 1994) and the phonological ''Jikun'' (\u5b57\u8a13, 1995).\n*The ''Taish\u016bkan Gendai Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u5927\u4fee\u9928\u73fe\u4ee3\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"Taishukan's Modern ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", 1996), edited by Kimura Sh\u016bji (\u6728\u6751\u79c0\u6b21) and Kurosawa Hiromitsu (\u9ed2\u6ca2\u5f18\u5149), enters 7500 characters and 25,000 compounds.\n*The '' Goj\u016bon Biki Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u4e94\u5341\u97f3\u5f15\u304d\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary Indexed by the Fifty Sounds\", Sanseido, 2004), edited by Okimori Takuya (\u6c96\u68ee\u5353\u4e5f), gives 6,300 characters and 30,000 compounds, collated by pronunciation (like the ''Jits\u016b'') rather than radical.\n*The ''Shincho Nihongo Kanji Jiten'' (\u65b0\u6f6e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u6f22\u5b57\u8f9e\u5178 \"Shincho Japanese Kanji Dictionary\", Shinchosha, 2007), gives 15,375 characters and 47,000 compounds.\n\n''Kan-Ei jiten'' (\u6f22\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178 \"''Kanji''\u2013English dictionary\") refers to a character dictionary designed for English-speaking students of Japanese.

It is collated through an idiosyncratic \"Radical Priority System\" reorganization of the 214 Kangxi radicals.\n*The ''Japanese Character Dictionary With Compound Lookup via Any Kanji'' (\u6f22\u82f1\u719f\u8a9e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u5b57\u5178, Nichigai, 1989), edited by Mark Spahn and Wolfgang Hadamitzky, lists 7,054 characters and nearly 47,000 compounds, collated under a simplified system of 79 radicals. This \"reverse dictionary\" cross-references compounds by their component characters; for instance, the ''ten'' \u5178 headword lists compounds including ''jiten'' (\u8f9e\u5178\"dictionary\") under the second position, ''hyakka jiten'' (\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u5178 \"encyclopedia\") under the fourth, etc.\n*The ''New Japanese-English Character Dictionary'' (\u65b0\u6f22\u82f1\u5b57\u5178, [[Kenky\u016bsha]], 1990, NTC reprint, 1993), edited by [[Jack Halpern (linguist)|Jack Halpern]], enters approximately 3,500 characters, emphasizing etymologies and historical semantics. Primary collation follows a \"System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns\" (SKIP), but pronunciation and radical indexes are provided. It was revised as ''The Kodansha Kanji Dictionary'', ([[Kodansha]], 2013), and its abridged ''[[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary]]''.\n*''The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary'' (\u65b0\u7248\u30cd\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3\u6f22\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178, Tuttle, 1997), edited by John H. Haig, is a complete revision of Nelson's, and includes 7107 characters and 70,000 compounds. It employs a modified ''Kangxi'' system of 217 radicals, and has a 230-page \"Universal Radical Index\" that fully cross-references under each component radical. For example, ''t\u014d'' or ''agari'' ([[Wikt:\u9a30|\u9a30]] \"gallop, prance; soar; rise up\") is entered under radical 187 \u99ac \"horse\", but is also indexed under radicals 1 \u4e00 \"one\", 12 \u4e37 or \u516b \"eight\", 37 \u5927 \"big\", and 130 \u6708 \"meat; moon\".\nIt is noteworthy that all four of these ''Ei\u2013Wa'' dictionaries attempted to improve upon the traditional radical system, which can be problematical for users, but none of their improvements has been widely accepted.\n\n===Japanese and English dictionaries===\nSince Japanese bilingual dictionaries, which are available for most major world languages, are too numerous to be discussed here, the two cases in point are ''Ei-Wa jiten'' (\u82f1\u548c\u8f9e\u5178) \"English\u2013Japanese dictionaries\" and ''Wa-Ei jiten'' (\u548c\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178) \"Japanese\u2013English dictionaries\".\n\nFirst, the history of English\u2013Japanese dictionaries began at the end of the Edo period. The English missionary Walter H. Medhurst, who never traveled to Japan, compiled the first bilingual wordbook ''An English and Japanese, and Japanese and English Vocabulary'' (Batavia, 1830). The Dutch translator Hori Tatsunosuke (\u5800 \u9054\u4e4b\u52a9), who interpreted for [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Perry]], compiled the first true English\u2013Japanese dictionary: ''A Pocket Dictionary of the English and Japanese Language'' (\u82f1\u548c\u5bfe\u8a33\u8896\u73cd\u8f9e\u66f8, Yosho-Shirabedokoro, 1862). It was based upon English-Dutch and Dutch-Japanese bilingual dictionaries, and contained about 35,000 headwords.\n\nEnglish\u2013Japanese dictionary publishing flourished during the [[Taish\u014d period]]. Kanda Naibu (\u795e\u7530\u4e43\u6b66) used the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' as the basis for his ''Mohan [Model] English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u6a21\u7bc4\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Sanseid\u014d, 1911).

The American missionary [[James Curtis Hepburn]] edited ''A Japanese and English Dictionary with an English and Japanese Index'' (\u548c\u82f1\u8a9e\u6797\u96c6\u6210, Shanghai, American Presbyterian Press, 1867), with 20,722 Japanese-English and 10,030 English-Japanese words, on 702 pages. Although designed to be used by missionaries in Japan, this first Japanese\u2013English dictionary was so popular among the Japanese that nine editions were published by 1910.\n\nThe history of English\u2013Japanese dictionaries began with the arrival of [[HMS Phaeton]], in order to better facilitate sakoku policy in the future due to the Nagasaki Harbour Incident. The Rangaku interpreter, Motoki Sh\u014dzaemon (\u672c\u6728\u5e84 \u5de6\u885b\u9580), compiled the first Japanese English dictionary, purported to contain 6000 words in 1814 with the help of Dutch scholars in Japan titled \"Angeria Gorintaisei\" (\u8af3\u5384\u5229\u4e9e\u8a9e\u6797\u5927\u6210).

It was primarily intended for English-speaking learners of Japanese. Jukichi Inouye (\u4e95\u4e0a\u5341\u5409) also edited ''Inouye's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u4e95\u4e0a\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Sanseido, 1909), which was the first dictionary intended for Japanese learners of English. Takenobu Yoshitar\u014d (\u6b66\u4fe1\u7531\u592a\u90ce) edited the authoritative ''Takenobu's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u6b66\u4fe1\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Kenkyusha, 1918), which had more coverage and better usage examples than any contemporary dictionaries. It was subsequently revised as ''[[Kenky\u016bsha's New Japanese\u2013English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed. 1931) in order to compete with ''A Standard Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8fad\u5178, Taishukwan, 1924), edited by Takehara Tsuneta (\u7af9\u539f\u5e38\u592a), with 57,000 headwords and 300,000 examples; and ''Sait\u014d's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8fad\u5178, Nichi-Eisha, 1928), also edited by Saito Hidesaburo, with 50,000 headwords and 120,000 examples.

Nakamura Akira, 50,000 entries\n\n===Electronic and online dictionaries===\n''Denshi jisho'' (\u96fb\u5b50\u8f9e\u66f8) refers either generally to \"dictionary software\" (on CD-ROM, hard drive, ''onrain jisho'' \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u8f9e\u66f8 \"online dictionary\", etc.) or specifically to \"a dedicated [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-type dictionary\" also known as a ''denshi jiten'' (\u96fb\u5b50\u8f9e\u5178).\n\nThe specific meaning of handheld \"[[electronic Japanese dictionary]]\" became popular in the early 1980s. Modern stand-alone dictionaries resemble a PDA or small [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] computer. Different manufacturers and models offer various user features, [[Japanese input methods]], and multiple-volume capacities for switching between dictionaries of Modern Japanese, Classical Japanese, ''Kanji'', English, medical terminology, etc.\n\nThe general ''denshi jisho'' meaning of \"dictionary database software\" has evolved from early floppies that Japanese users copied onto their local computers to contemporary server-based dictionaries accessible by users with cell phones. Japanese dictionary software is available in either [[freeware]] or commercial versions, both of which are found online.\n\nMany online dictionaries of Japanese are based upon [[Jim Breen]]'s voluntary [[EDICT]] (Japanese\u2013English Dictionary) Project, which consists of the 170,000 entry-strong core JMdict ([[XML]]) and EDICT (text)  files (under [[Creative Commons license]]), and associated files such as KANJIDIC for ''kanji''. [[Eijir\u014d]], another major online database, is targeted primarily at native Japanese speakers, and as such lacks some of the features to make it more accessible to non-native speakers.  Here are some major non-commercial online reference sites.\n*[http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1C Jim Breen's WWWJDIC], primary web interface for EDICT\n*[http://www.romajidesu.com/ RomajiDesu], features EDICT-based dictionary, Japanese to Romaji/Kana/English translator, also includes KANJIDIC, KanjiVG, sample sentences, and Text to Speech.\n*[http://jisho.org/ Denshi Jisho], features EDICT-based dictionary KANJIDIC, KanjiVG and sample sentences\n*[http://jlearn.net/ JLearn], features EDICT-based dictionary KANJIDIC, KanjiVG, sample sentences, conjugation tables and searching by conjugation\n*[http://www.tanoshiijapanese.com/ Tanoshii Japanese], features EDICT-based dictionary, Text to Speech, KANJIDIC, KanjiVG and learning features\n*[http://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/  Nihongo Master Japanese Dictionary],  Japanese Bi-Directional English/Japanese Dictionary\n*[http://www.popjisyo.com/ POPjisyo Dictionary], pop-up definitions from EDICT\n*[http://www.nihongodict.com/ Nihongodict], interactive interface for EDICT\n*[http://www.studyjapanese.org/ StudyJapanese.org], EDICT and Kanji dictionary in a learning environment\n*[http://www.kanjidict.com/ Kiki's Kanji Dictionary], interface to search and browse EDICT\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921022956/http://www.foks.info/index.html FOKS Intelligent Dictionary Interface], FOKS (Forgiving Online Kanji Search) EDICT server with fuzzy searching\n*[http://www.alc.co.jp/ SpaceALC], an online version of the Eijir\u014d dictionary (Japanese)\n*[http://honyakustar.com Honyaku Star], features many dictionaries and corpora such as EDICT, as well as original dictionaries.\n\nSecond, many other online and Web dictionaries use commercial software from Japanese print dictionary publishers. Sanseido, for example, sells printed and CD-ROM dictionary versions, leases dictionary software to commercial Websites (especially search engines), and sells subscriptions to their Web Dictionary. Here are some dictionary websites that are popular in Japan.\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.excite.co.jp/world/english/ Excite \u82f1\u548c\u8f9e\u66f8 (English\u2013Japanese dictionary)], with Kenkyusha's English and Japanese dictionaries, and Sanseido's ''Daijirin''\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://translation.infoseek.co.jp/ Infoseek \u697d\u5929\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u7ffb\u8a33 (Rakuten multi-translator)], online text or webpage translator using Sanseido dictionaries\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.sanseido.net/ \u4e09\u7701\u5802 (Sanseido) Web Dictionary], free access to Sanseido's ''Daily Concise'' dictionaries or subscription access to a dozen more\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/ Yahoo!

Present-day Japanese [[lexicographer]]s are exploring computerized editing and [[electronic dictionaries]]. According to Keisuke Nakao:\n  \n<blockquote>It has often been said that dictionary publishing in Japan is active and prosperous, that Japanese people are well provided for with reference tools, and that lexicography here, in practice as well as in research, has produced a number of valuable reference books together with voluminous academic studies. (1998:35)\n</blockquote>\n\nAfter introducing some Japanese \"dictionary\" words, this article will discuss early and modern Japanese dictionaries, demarcated at the 1603 CE lexicographical sea-change from ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'', the first bilingual Japanese\u2013Portuguese dictionary. \"Early\" here will refer to lexicography during the [[Heian period|Heian]], [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]], and [[Muromachi period|Muromachi]] periods (794\u20131573); and \"modern\" to Japanese dictionaries from the [[Edo period|Edo]] or Tokugawa era (1603\u20131867) through the present.\n\n==Lexicographical terminology==\nFirst, it will be useful to introduce some key Japanese terms for dictionaries and [[collation]] (ordering of entry words) that the following discussion will be using.\n\nThe [[Wiktionary]] uses English ''[[Wikt:dictionary|dictionary]]'' to define a few synonyms including [[Wikt:lexicon|lexicon]], [[Wikt:wordbook|wordbook]], [[Wikt:vocabulary|vocabulary]], [[Wikt:thesaurus|thesaurus]], and [[Wikt:translating dictionary|translating dictionary]]. It also uses ''dictionary'' to translate six Japanese words.\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u8f9e\u5178|\u8f9e\u5178]], [[Literal translation|lit.]] \"word reference-work\") \"dictionary; lexicon; glossary\"\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u5178|\u5b57\u5178]], lit. \"character reference-work\") \"character dictionary\"\n*''jiten'' ([[Wikt:\u4e8b\u5178|\u4e8b\u5178]], lit. \"thing reference-work\") \"encyclopedia, encyclopedic dictionary\"<ref>Colloquially, to distinguish \u8f9e\u5178 and \u4e8b\u5178, the former is referred to as ''kotoba no ten'' (\u3053\u3068\u3070\u306e\u5178) and the latter ''koto no ten'' (\u3053\u3068\u306e\u5178).</ref>\n*''jisho'' ([[Wikt:\u8f9e\u66f8|\u8f9e\u66f8]], lit. \"word book\") \"dictionary; wordbook; lexicon; glossary\"\n*''jisho'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u66f8|\u5b57\u66f8]], lit. \"character book\") \"character dictionary; dictionary\"\n*''jibiki'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57\u5f15|\u5b57\u5f15]], lit. \"character pull/arrange) \"character dictionary; dictionary\"\nThe first three [[homophonous]] ''jiten'' [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] of ''ten'' ([[Wikt:\u5178|\u5178]] \"reference work; dictionary; classic; canon; model\") are Chinese [[loanwords]]. However, Chinese distinguishes their pronunciations, avoiding the potential ambiguities of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] ''jiten'': ''c\u00eddi\u01cen'' \u8f9e\u5178 \"word dictionary\", ''z\u00ecdi\u01cen'' \u5b57\u5178 \"character dictionary\", or ''sh\u00ecdi\u01cen'' \u4e8b\u5178 \"encyclopedia\". The usual Japanese word for \"encyclopedia\" is ''hyakka jiten'' (\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u5178 \"100/many subject dictionary\", see [[Japanese encyclopedias]]). The ''jiten'', ''jisho'', and ''jibiki'' terms for dictionaries of ''[[kanji]]'' \"Chinese characters\" share the element ''ji'' ([[Wikt:\u5b57|\u5b57]] \"character; graph; letter; script; writing\").\n\nLexicographical collation is straightforward for [[romanized]] languages, and most dictionaries enter words in alphabetical order. In contrast, the [[Japanese writing system]], with ''kanji'', ''[[hiragana]]'', and ''[[katakana]]'', creates complications for dictionary ordering. University of Arizona professor Don C. Bailey (1960:4) discusses how Japanese lexicography differentiates semantic, graphic, and phonetic collation methods, namely:\n*''bunruitai'' (\u5206\u985e\u4f53 \"classification form\") \"semantic collation; grouping words with similar meanings; thesaurus-like organization\"\n*''jikeibiki'' (\u5b57\u5f62\u5f15\u304d \"character shape arrangement\") \"logographic collation; organizing ''kanji'' dictionaries by [[Radical (Chinese character)|radicals]] (recurring graphic components)\"\n*''onbiki'' (\u97f3\u5f15\u304d \"pronunciation arrangement\") \"phonetic collation; organization by the Japanese [[syllabary]] in ''[[iroha]]'' or ''[[goj\u016bon]]'' ordering\"\nIn general, ''jikeibiki'' organization is for a readers' dictionary, ''bunruitai'' for a writers' dictionary, and ''onbiki'' for both types.\n\nThe Japanese writing system originated with the introduction of [[Chinese characters]] around the 4th century CE, and early Japanese dictionaries developed from [[Chinese dictionaries]] circa the 7th century CE. These three Japanese collation systems were borrowed and adapted from Chinese character dictionaries.\n\nThe first, and oldest, Chinese system of collation by [[semantic field]] (for instance, \"birds\" or \"fish\") dates back to the ca. 3rd century BCE ''[[Erya]]''. Only a few dictionaries like the ''[[Xiao Erya]]'', ''[[Guangya]]'', and ''[[Piya]]'' used semantic collation. This system is inefficient looking up a word unless the dictionary user already knows its meaning; imagine, for example, using [[Roget's Thesaurus]] without an alphabetical index. ''Bunruitai'' collation is obsolete among modern Japanese dictionaries, with the exception of thesauri.\n\nThe second system of dictionary collation by radicals (Chinese ''bushou'', Japanese ''bushu'', \u90e8\u9996 \"section headers\") originated with the 121 CE ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''. Japanese dictionaries followed the Chinese example of reducing the number of radicals: original 540 (''Shuowen Jiezi''), adjusted 542 (''[[Yupian]]''), condensed 214 (''[[Zihui]]'', ''[[Kangxi Zidian]]''), and abridged 189 (''[[Xinhua Zidian]]''). Japanese ''jikeibiki'' collation by radical and [[stroke order|stroke]] ordering is standard for character dictionaries, and does not require a user to know the meaning or pronunciation beforehand.\n\nThe third Chinese system of ordering by pronunciation is evident in a [[rime dictionary]], which collates the characters by [[Tone name|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]]. The 601 CE ''[[Qieyun]]'' is the oldest extant Chinese dictionary collated by pronunciation, and was expanded in the ''[[Guangyun]]'' and ''[[Jiyun]]''. The shortcoming of this unwieldy tone-rime method is that a user needs to know, or guess, the pronunciation of a character in order to look it up. The modern Chinese dictionary improvement is alphabetical collation by ''[[pinyin]]'' romanization. Japanese ''onbiki'' dictionaries historically changed from poetic ''iroha'' to practical ''goj\u016bon'' ordering around 1890. Compare the former [[pangram]] poem (''i-ro-ha-ni-ho-he-to, chi-ri-nu-ru-wo'', \u2026 \"Although flowers glow with color, They are quickly fallen, \u2026) with the latter \"fifty sounds\" 10 consonants by 5 vowels grid (''a-i-u-e-o, ka-ki-ku-ke-ko'', \u2026).\n\n==Early Japanese lexicography==\nThe first Japanese dictionaries are no longer extant and only known by titles. For example, the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (tr. Aston 1896:354) says [[Emperor Tenmu]] was presented a dictionary in 682 CE, the ''Niina'' (\u65b0\u5b57, \"New Characters\") with 44 fascicles (''kan'' [[Wikt:\u5dfb|\u5dfb]]). The earliest dictionaries made in Japan were not for the Japanese language but rather dictionaries of Chinese characters written in Chinese and annotated in Japanese.\n\nJapanese lexicography flowered during the Heian Period, when [[Chinese culture]] and [[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan. During the Kamakura and Muromachi eras, despite advances in [[woodblock printing]] technology, there was a decline in lexicography that Bailey (1960:22) describes as \"a tendency toward simplification and popularization\".\n\nThe following review of the first published Japanese dictionaries is divided into the above lexicographical ''jikeibiki'', ''bunruitai'', and ''onbiki'' types.\n\n===Graphically organized dictionaries===\n''Jikeibiki'' graphic collation began with the oldest extant Japanese dictionary: the circa 835 CE ''[[Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi]]'', edited by the Heian monk and scholar [[K\u016bkai]]. It enters approximately 1,000 characters under 534 radicals, and each entry gives the [[seal script]] character, Chinese [[fanqie]] reading, and definition (usually copied from the ''Yupian''), but does not give native [[kun'yomi]] Japanese readings.\n\nThe first dictionary containing Japanese readings of ''kanji'' was the circa 900 ''[[Shinsen Jiky\u014d]]'', which the editor Sh\u014dj\u016b (\u660c\u4f4f) compiled from the ''Yupian'' and ''Qieyun''. It enters 21,300 characters, giving both Chinese and Sino-Japanese readings, and cites many early Japanese texts. Internal organization innovatively combines ''jikeibiki'' and ''bunruitai'' methods; a simplified system of 160 radicals is ordered semantically (e.g., 5-7 are Rain, Air, and Wind).\n\nThe circa 1100 Buddhist ''[[Ruiju My\u014dgish\u014d]]'' dictionary lists over 32,000 characters and compounds under 120 radicals. The structure and definitions closely follow the Chinese ''Yupian'' and ''Qieyun''. This Heian reference work gives both Sino-Japanese and Japanese readings for ''kanji'', usually with [[Kanbun]] annotations in citations from [[Chinese classic texts]].\n\nThe circa 1245 ''[[Jiky\u014dsh\u016b]]'' collates Chinese characters primarily by the 542 ''Yupian'' radicals and secondarily by semantic headings adapted from the ''Iroha Jiruish\u014d''. This Kamakura dictionary, edited by Sugawara no Tamenaga (\u83c5\u539f\u70ba\u9577), exists in 3, 7, and 20 fascicle editions that have convoluted textual histories.\n\nThe next ''jikeibiki'' collated dictionary of ''kanji'' was the circa 1489 ''[[Wagokuhen]]''. This \"Japanese ''Yupian''\" was based on the Chinese ''Yupian'', actually the 1013 ''Daguang yihui Yupian'' (\u5927\u5ee3\u76ca\u6703\u7389\u7bc7, \"Expanded and Enlarged ''Yupian''\"), which was current in Muromachi Japan. The ''Wagokuhen'' went through dozens of editions, which collate entries through various systems of (from 100 to 542) radicals, without any overt semantic subdivisions.\n\nTwo historical aspects of these logographically arranged Japanese ''jikeibiki'' dictionaries are reducing the number of radicals and semantically ordering them. The radical systems ranged from 542 (the ''Yupian''), 534, 160, 120, down to 100. Both the ''Shinsen Jiky\u014d'' and ''Jiky\u014dsh\u016b'' refined logographic categorization with ''bunruitai''-type arrangements. While Chinese dictionaries have occasional examples of semantically ordered radicals (for instance, [[Kangxi radicals]] 38 and 39 are Woman and Child), Japanese lexicography restructured radicals into more easily memorable sequences.\n\n===Semantically organized dictionaries===\nJapanese ''bunruitai'' semantic collation of dictionaries began with the 938 CE ''[[Wamy\u014d Ruijush\u014d]]'', compiled by Minamoto no Shitag\u014d (\u6e90\u9806). This Heian dictionary adapts the ancient Chinese ''Erya'' dictionary's 19 semantic categories into 24 Japanese headings with subheadings. For instance, Heaven and Earth is subdivided into Stars and Constellations, Clouds and Rain, Wind and Snow, etc.\nThe character entries give source citations, Chinese pronunciations, definitions, and Japanese readings in the ancient ''[[Man'y\u014dgana]]'' character system.\n\nThe circa 1444 ''[[Kagakush\u016b]]'' was an anonymous Muromachi era Japanese language dictionary or encyclopedia that defined some 3000 words into 18 semantic categories. It was designed for the literate public rather than for priests and literati, and was reissued many times.\n\n===Phonetically organized dictionaries===\nJapanese ''onbiki'' phonetic collation began during the late Heian Period. The circa 1144&ndash;1165 CE ''[[Iroha Jiruish\u014d]]'' was the first dictionary to group entries in the ''iroha'' order. Words are entered by 47 first ''[[kana]]'' syllables, each subdivided into 21 semantic groups.\n\nThe circa 1468 ''[[Setsuy\u014dsh\u016b]]'' was a popular Muromachi dictionary collated in ''iroha'' order and subdivided into 12 (later 13) semantic categories. It defined current Japanese vocabulary rather than borrowed Sino-Japanese compounds, and went through many editions and reprints.\n\nThe 1484 ''[[Onkochishinsho]]'' was the first Japanese dictionary to collate words in ''goj\u016bon'' rather than conventional ''iroha'' order. This Muromachi reference work enters about 13,000 words, first by pronunciation and then by 12 subject classifications.\n\nAll three of these ''onbiki'' dictionaries adapted the ''bunruitai'' method to collate primarily by first syllable and secondarily by semantic field. This is comparatively less efficient than modern Japanese dictionaries with single-sorting ''goj\u016bon'' collation by first syllable, second syllable, etc.\n\n==Modern Japanese lexicography==\nThe development of early Japanese lexicography from Chinese\u2013Japanese dictionaries has cross-linguistic parallels, for instance, early English language lexicography developed from Latin\u2013English dictionaries. Nonetheless, modern Japanese lexicography adapted to an unparalleled second foreign wave from Western language dictionaries and romanization.\n\nDuring the [[Nanban trade]] Period (1543&ndash;1650 CE) when Japan was opened to Europeans, the [[Jesuit]] Mission Press published two groundbreaking dictionaries. The 1598 monolingual ''[[Rakuy\u014dsh\u016b]]'' (\u843d\u8449\u96c6, \"Collection of Fallen Leaves\") gave Sino-Japanese and native Japanese readings of characters, and introduced the small raised circle (''handakuten'' \u534a\u6fc1\u70b9) to indicate the ''p'' sound (compare ''ha'' \u306f and ''pa'' \u3071). The 1603&ndash;1604 bilingual Japanese-Portuguese ''[[Nippo Jisho]]'' or ''Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam'' dictionary is still cited as an authority for early Japanese pronunciation. The year 1604 was at the beginning of the Edo Period and also, as Nakao (1998:37) points out, the date of the first monolingual English dictionary, the [[Table Alphabeticall]].\n\nDuring the [[Sakoku]] Period (1641&ndash;1853) when Japan was closed to foreigners, with the exception of the [[Dutch East India Company]], ''[[Rangaku]]'' (\"Dutch/Western learning\") influenced Japanese lexicography through bilingual Japanese and Dutch dictionaries. Another notable publication was the 1712 ''[[Wakan Sansai Zue]]'' encyclopedia, which was based on the 1609 Chinese ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]''.\n\n===Japanese language dictionaries===\n''Kokugo jiten/jisho'' (\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178/\u8f9e\u66f8 \"national language dictionary\") means \"Japanese\u2013Japanese dictionary, monolingual Japanese dictionary\". This \"national language\" term ''kokugo'', which Chinese borrowed as ''guoyu'', usually refers to the Japanese language as taught in Japanese schools. ''Nihongo jisho'' (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u8f9e\u66f8 \"Japanese language dictionary\") is a neologism that contrasts Japanese with other world languages. There are hundreds of ''kokugo'' dictionaries in print, ranging from huge multivolume tomes to paperback abridgments. According to Japanese translator Tom Gally (1999:n.p.), \"While all have shortcomings, the best ''kokugo'' dictionaries are probably among the best reference works in existence in any language.\"\n\nThe Edo ''[[Kokugaku]]'' scholar [[Tanikawa Kotosuga]] ([[:ja:\u8c37\u5ddd\u58eb\u6e05]], 1709&ndash;1776) began compilation of the first full-scale Japanese language dictionary, the ''Wakun no Shiori'' or ''Wakunkan'' (\u548c\u8a13\u681e \"Guidebook to Japanese Pronunciations\"). This influential 9-volume dictionary of classical Japanese words was posthumously completed and finally published in 1887.\n\nThe first truly modern Japanese language dictionary was edited by the grammarian and English translator [[\u014ctsuki Fumihiko]], who used ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' as the model for his pioneering ''Genkai'' (\u8a00\u6d77 \"Sea of Words, 1889&ndash;1891)\". His revised 5-volume ''Daigenkai'' (\u5927\u8a00\u6d77 \"Great/Comprehensive Sea of Words\", Fuzanb\u014d, 1932&ndash;1937) dictionary continues to be cited for its definitions and etymologies.\n\nThe ''Daijiten'' (\u5927\u8fad\u5178 \"Great/Comprehensive Dictionary\", Heibonsha 1934\u201336), edited by Shimonaka Yasabur\u014d (\u4e0b\u4e2d\u5f4c\u4e09\u90ce), is the largest ''kokugo'' dictionary ever published. The original 26-volume edition, which is still available in condensed versions, entered over 700,000 headwords, listed by pronunciation, and covered a wide variety of Japanese vocabulary.\n\nThe ''[[Nihon Kokugo Daijiten]]'' (Shogakukan, 1972, 1976) is the modern equivalent of the ''Daigenkai'' and ''Daijiten''. This multivolume historical dictionary enters about 500,000 headwords, and is currently the most complete reference work for the Japanese language.\n\nThe bestselling ''kokugo'' titles are practical 1-volume dictionaries rather than encyclopedic works like the ''Nihon Kokugo Daijiten''. For present purposes, they are divided between large-size dictionaries that enter 100,000-200,000 headwords on 2000-3000 pages and medium-size ones with 60,000-100,000 on 1300&ndash;1500 pages. The following discussion will introduce the central ''kokugo'' dictionaries, excepting the numerous smallest editions.\n\nLarger single-volume Japanese language dictionaries are a highly profitable and competitive market for Japanese publishing houses.\n*The ''[[K\u014djien]]'' (\"Wide Garden of Words\", Iwanami Shoten, 1955, 5th ed. 1998), edited by [[Shinmura Izuru]], enters 200,000 headwords. This highly respected dictionary gives definitions in chronological order, which is useful for understanding diachronic semantics. Japanese newspaper editorials commonly cite ''K\u014djien'' definitions as authoritative, but the following dictionaries are sometimes lexicographically superior.\n*The ''[[Daijirin]]'' (\u5927\u8f9e\u6797 \"Great Forest of Words\", 1988, Sanseid\u014d, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Matsumura Akira (\u677e\u6751\u660e), has 233,000 headwords. This highly-evaluated rival of the ''K\u014djien'' gives detailed definitions, and arranges word meanings with the most common ones first, instead of historical order.\n*The ''[[Daijisen]]'' (\u5927\u8f9e\u6cc9 \"Great Fountainhead of Words\", Sh\u014dgakukan, 1995, 2nd ed. 1998), also edited by Matsumura Akira (above), has 220,000 entries, and is practically a twin of the ''Daijirin''. Two minor improvements are color pictures instead of [[line art]] and replacing classical usage citations with contemporary ones.\n*The ''[[Nihongo Daijiten]]'' (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \"Great Japanese Dictionary\", K\u014ddansha, 1989, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Umesao Tadao (\u6885\u68f9\u5fe0\u592b), enters 175,000 headwords. It is distinguished by numerous color illustrations and occasional English translations.\nThe hefty scale of these larger dictionaries provides comprehensive coverage of Japanese words, but also renders them cumbersome and unwieldy.\n\nMedium single-volume dictionaries have comparative advantages in portability, usability, and price.\n*The ''[[Sanseid\u014d Kokugo Jiten]]'' (\u4e09\u7701\u5802\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \"Sanseido's Japanese Dictionary\", 1960, 5th ed. 2001), edited by Kenb\u014d Hidetoshi (\u898b\u574a\u8c6a\u7d00), has 76,000 headwords. It emphasizes contemporary usage and includes many colloquialisms.\n*The ''Iwanami Kokugo Jiten'' (\u5ca9\u6ce2\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \"Iwanami's Japanese Dictionary\", 1963, 5th ed. 1996), edited by Nishio Minoru (\u897f\u5c3e\u5b9f), has 57,000 headwords. It is marketed as a reliable authority, but sometimes overlooks current terminology.\n*The ''[[Shin Meikai Kokugo Jiten]]'' (\"New Lucid Japanese Dictionary\", Sanseid\u014d, 1972, 6th ed. 2004), edited by [[Kindaichi Ky\u014dsuke]], gives 76,500 entries. This popular and distinctive dictionary achieved notoriety from [[Akasegawa Genpei]]'s 1996 bestseller that listed many amusingly idiosyncratic definitions.\n*The ''Meiji Shoin Seisen Kokugo Jiten'' (\u660e\u6cbb\u66f8\u9662\u7cbe\u9078\u56fd\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178 \"Meiji Publishing's Selected Japanese Dictionary\", 1972, 2nd ed. 1995), edited by Miyaji Yutaka (\u5bae\u5730\u88d5) and Kai Mutsur\u014d (\u7532\u6590\u7766\u90ce), has 50,000 headwords. It includes many uncommon features such as synonyms, antonyms, stroke orders, and [[JIS encoding]].\n*The ''Gendai Kokugo Reikai Jiten'' (\u73fe\u4ee3\u56fd\u8a9e\u4f8b\u89e3\u8f9e\u5178 \"Modern Illustrated Japanese Dictionary\", Sh\u014dgakukan, 1985. 2nd ed. 1993), edited by Hayashi \u014cki (\u6797\u5de8\u6a39), gives 69,000 entries, and includes numerous tables explaining Japanese usage.\n*The ''Gakken Kokugo Daijiten'' (\u5b66\u7814\u56fd\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178 \"Gakken's Great Japanese Dictionary\", Gakush\u016b Kenky\u016bsha, 1978, 2nd ed. 1988), edited by Kindaichi Haruhiko (\u91d1\u7530\u4e00\u6625\u5f66) and Ikeda Yasabur\u014d (\u6c60\u7530\u5f25\u4e09\u90ce), enters about 120,000 headwords. This was the first Japanese dictionary fully edited with computers, and give illustrative citations from over 350 published sources.\nSome Japanese publishers sell both a larger dictionary with more archaisms and classical citations as well as a smaller condensation with more modern examples, for instance, Sh\u014dgakukan's ''Daijisen'' and ''Gendai Kokugo Reikai Jiten''.\n\n===Chinese character dictionaries===\n''Kan-Wa jiten'' ([[:ja:\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178|\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178]] \"''[[Han Chinese|Kan]]''[''ji''] Chinese [character]-''[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]'' Japanese dictionary\") means \"Japanese dictionary of ''kanji'' (Chinese characters)\". This unique type of monolingual dictionary enters Japanese borrowings of ''kanji'' and multi-character compounds (''jukugo'' [[Wikt:\u719f\u8a9e|\u719f\u8a9e]]), but is not a bilingual Chinese\u2013Japanese dictionary. A ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionary headword (''oyaji'' \u89aa\u5b57 \"parent character\") entry typically gives variant graphic forms, graphic etymology, readings, meanings, compounds, and idioms. Indexes usually include both radical-stroke and pronunciation (''on'' and ''kun'' readings), and sometimes other character indexing systems like the [[four corner method]].\n\nThe history of ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionaries began with early Japanese references such as the ''Tenrei Bansh\u014d Meigi'' and ''Ruiju My\u014dgish\u014d'' (above). In 1716, the Edo author of ''[[Yomihon]]'', Tsuga Teish\u014d (\u90fd\u8cc0\u5ead\u9418, 1718&ndash;1794) published the ''K\u014dki Jiten'' (\u5eb7\u7199\u5b57\u5178), a Japanese version of the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', which standardized the ''Kan-Wa jiten'' system of 214 Kangxi radicals. The first dictionary titled with ''Kan-Wa'' was the ''Kan-Wa Daijiten'' (\u6f22\u548c\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"Great ''Kanji''-Japanese Character Dictionary\", Sanseid\u014d, 1903), edited by Shigeno Yasutsugu (\u91cd\u91ce\u5b89\u7e79, 1827&ndash;1910), founder of the ''[[Shigaku zasshi]]''. The '' Daijiten'' (\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"Great Character Dictionary\", Kodansha, 1917), edited by Eida Takei \u6804\u7530\u731b\u732a, went through numerous reprints.\n\nThe best available ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionary is unquestionably [[Tetsuji Morohashi|Morohashi Tetsuji]]'s 13-volume ''[[Dai Kan-Wa Jiten]]'' (\"Great/Comprehensive ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", Taish\u016bkan, 1956\u201360), which contains over 50,000 characters and 530,000 compounds. It was condensed into the 4-volume ''K\u014d Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u5e83\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"Broad ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", Taish\u016bkan, 1982), edited by Morohashi, Kamada Tadashi (\u938c\u7530\u6b63), and Yoneyama Toratar\u014d (\u7c73\u5c71\u5bc5\u592a\u90ce), which enters 20,000 characters and 120,000 compounds.\n\nThe following major ''Kan\u2013Wa'' dictionaries are presented in the chronological order of their first editions. Note that the numbers of character headwords include variants.\n*The ''Kan-Wa Daijiten'' (\u6f22\u548c\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"Great ''Kanji''-Japanese Character Dictionary\", Gakken, 1978), edited by Todo Akiyasu (\u85e4\u5802\u660e\u4fdd), enters 20,000 headwords and 120,000 compounds.\n*The ''Kadokawa Daijigen'' (\u89d2\u5ddd\u5927\u5b57\u6e90 \"Kadokawa's Great Source of Characters\", 1992), edited by Ozaki Y\u016bjir\u014d (\u5c3e\u5d0e\u96c4\u4e8c\u90ce), gives 12,300 characters and 100,000 compounds.\n*The ''Dai Kangorin'' (\u5927\u6f22\u8a9e\u6797 \"Great Forest of Chinese\", Taish\u016bkan, 1992), edited by Kamada Tadashi and Yoneyama Toratar\u014d, includes 13,938 characters and 100,000 compounds.\n*The ''Shin Daijiten'' (\u65b0\u5927\u5b57\u5178 \"New ''Daijiten'', K\u014ddansha, 1993), edited by Ueda Kazutoshi (\u4e0a\u7530\u4e07\u5e74), enters 21,094 characters and 110,000 compounds, and is a modern revision of the ''Daijiten''.\n*The ''Jits\u016b'' (\u5b57\u901a \"Mastery of Characters\", Heibonsha, 1996), edited by Shirakawa Shizuka (\u767d\u5ddd\u9759), includes 9,500 characters and 22,000 compounds, collated by pronunciation in ''goj\u016bon'' order. It combines two other Heibonsha dictionaries edited by Shirakawa, the etymological ''Jit\u014d'' (\u5b57\u7d71, 1994) and the phonological ''Jikun'' (\u5b57\u8a13, 1995).\n*The ''Taish\u016bkan Gendai Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u5927\u4fee\u9928\u73fe\u4ee3\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"Taishukan's Modern ''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary\", 1996), edited by Kimura Sh\u016bji (\u6728\u6751\u79c0\u6b21) and Kurosawa Hiromitsu (\u9ed2\u6ca2\u5f18\u5149), enters 7500 characters and 25,000 compounds.\n*The '' Goj\u016bon Biki Kan-Wa Jiten'' (\u4e94\u5341\u97f3\u5f15\u304d\u6f22\u548c\u8f9e\u5178 \"''Kanji''\u2013Japanese Dictionary Indexed by the Fifty Sounds\", Sanseido, 2004), edited by Okimori Takuya (\u6c96\u68ee\u5353\u4e5f), gives 6,300 characters and 30,000 compounds, collated by pronunciation (like the ''Jits\u016b'') rather than radical.\n*The ''Shincho Nihongo Kanji Jiten'' (\u65b0\u6f6e\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u6f22\u5b57\u8f9e\u5178 \"Shincho Japanese Kanji Dictionary\", Shinchosha, 2007), gives 15,375 characters and 47,000 compounds.\n\n''Kan-Ei jiten'' (\u6f22\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178 \"''Kanji''\u2013English dictionary\") refers to a character dictionary designed for English-speaking students of Japanese.

It is collated through an idiosyncratic \"Radical Priority System\" reorganization of the 214 Kangxi radicals.\n*The ''Japanese Character Dictionary With Compound Lookup via Any Kanji'' (\u6f22\u82f1\u719f\u8a9e\u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u5b57\u5178, Nichigai, 1989), edited by Mark Spahn and Wolfgang Hadamitzky, lists 7,054 characters and nearly 47,000 compounds, collated under a simplified system of 79 radicals. This \"reverse dictionary\" cross-references compounds by their component characters; for instance, the ''ten'' \u5178 headword lists compounds including ''jiten'' (\u8f9e\u5178\"dictionary\") under the second position, ''hyakka jiten'' (\u767e\u79d1\u4e8b\u5178 \"encyclopedia\") under the fourth, etc.\n*The ''New Japanese-English Character Dictionary'' (\u65b0\u6f22\u82f1\u5b57\u5178, [[Kenky\u016bsha]], 1990, NTC reprint, 1993), edited by [[Jack Halpern (linguist)|Jack Halpern]], enters approximately 3,500 characters, emphasizing etymologies and historical semantics. Primary collation follows a \"System of Kanji Indexing by Patterns\" (SKIP), but pronunciation and radical indexes are provided. It was revised as ''The Kodansha Kanji Dictionary'', ([[Kodansha]], 2013), and its abridged ''[[Kodansha Kanji Learner's Dictionary]]''.\n*''The New Nelson Japanese-English Character Dictionary'' (\u65b0\u7248\u30cd\u30eb\u30bd\u30f3\u6f22\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178, Tuttle, 1997), edited by John H. Haig, is a complete revision of Nelson's, and includes 7107 characters and 70,000 compounds. It employs a modified ''Kangxi'' system of 217 radicals, and has a 230-page \"Universal Radical Index\" that fully cross-references under each component radical. For example, ''t\u014d'' or ''agari'' ([[Wikt:\u9a30|\u9a30]] \"gallop, prance; soar; rise up\") is entered under radical 187 \u99ac \"horse\", but is also indexed under radicals 1 \u4e00 \"one\", 12 \u4e37 or \u516b \"eight\", 37 \u5927 \"big\", and 130 \u6708 \"meat; moon\".\nIt is noteworthy that all four of these ''Ei\u2013Wa'' dictionaries attempted to improve upon the traditional radical system, which can be problematical for users, but none of their improvements has been widely accepted.\n\n===Japanese and English dictionaries===\nSince Japanese bilingual dictionaries, which are available for most major world languages, are too numerous to be discussed here, the two cases in point are ''Ei-Wa jiten'' (\u82f1\u548c\u8f9e\u5178) \"English\u2013Japanese dictionaries\" and ''Wa-Ei jiten'' (\u548c\u82f1\u8f9e\u5178) \"Japanese\u2013English dictionaries\".\n\nFirst, the history of English\u2013Japanese dictionaries began at the end of the Edo period. The English missionary Walter H. Medhurst, who never traveled to Japan, compiled the first bilingual wordbook ''An English and Japanese, and Japanese and English Vocabulary'' (Batavia, 1830). The Dutch translator Hori Tatsunosuke (\u5800 \u9054\u4e4b\u52a9), who interpreted for [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Perry]], compiled the first true English\u2013Japanese dictionary: ''A Pocket Dictionary of the English and Japanese Language'' (\u82f1\u548c\u5bfe\u8a33\u8896\u73cd\u8f9e\u66f8, Yosho-Shirabedokoro, 1862). It was based upon English-Dutch and Dutch-Japanese bilingual dictionaries, and contained about 35,000 headwords.\n\nEnglish\u2013Japanese dictionary publishing flourished during the [[Taish\u014d period]]. Kanda Naibu (\u795e\u7530\u4e43\u6b66) used the ''[[Century Dictionary]]'' as the basis for his ''Mohan [Model] English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u6a21\u7bc4\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Sanseid\u014d, 1911). ''Saito's Idiomological'' [sic] ''English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u719f\u8a9e\u672c\u4f4d\u82f1\u548c\u4e2d\u8f9e\u5178, \u014cbunsha, 1915) was edited by Saito Hidesaburou (\u658e\u4e09\u90ce).J\u016bkichi Inouye (\u4e95\u4e0a\u5341\u5409), a graduate of London University, edited ''Inouye's English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u4e95\u4e0a\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Shiseid\u014d, 1921). ''Kenkyusha's New English\u2013Japanese Dictionary on Bilingual Principles'' (\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u65b0\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, 1927) was edited by Okakura Yoshisaburo (\u5ca1\u5009\u7531\u4e09\u90ce).\n\nIn the present day, four major English\u2013Japanese dictionaries are available.\n\n*''Iwanami's Comprehensive English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u5ca9\u6ce2\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, 1970), edited by Nakajima Fumio (\u4e2d\u5cf6\u6587\u96c4), has 110,000 headwords.\n*''Shogakukan Random House English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u5c0f\u5b66\u9928\u30e9\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u30cf\u30a6\u30b9\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178), 1973 edited by Katsuaki Horiuchi, 2nd ed. 1994 edited by Konishi Tomoshichi (\u5c0f\u897f\u53cb\u4e03), has 345,000 headwords and 175,000 usage examples.\n*''Taishukan's Unabridged Genius English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u30b8\u30fc\u30cb\u30a2\u30b9\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, 2001), edited by Konishi Tomoshichi (\u5c0f\u897f\u53cb\u4e03) and Minamide Kosei (\u5357\u51fa\u5eb7\u4e16), has 255,000 headwords (see Minamide 2002).\n*''Kenkyusha's New English\u2013Japanese Dictionary'' (\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u65b0\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, 6th ed. 2002), edited by Takebayashi Shigeru (\u7af9\u6797\u6ecb), has 260,000 headwords.\n\nSecond, the history of Japanese\u2013English dictionaries began towards the end of the Edo period. The American missionary [[James Curtis Hepburn]] edited ''A Japanese and English Dictionary with an English and Japanese Index'' (\u548c\u82f1\u8a9e\u6797\u96c6\u6210, Shanghai, American Presbyterian Press, 1867), with 20,722 Japanese-English and 10,030 English-Japanese words, on 702 pages. Although designed to be used by missionaries in Japan, this first Japanese\u2013English dictionary was so popular among the Japanese that nine editions were published by 1910.\n\nThe history of English\u2013Japanese dictionaries began with the arrival of [[HMS Phaeton]], in order to better facilitate sakoku policy in the future due to the Nagasaki Harbour Incident. The Rangaku interpreter, Motoki Sh\u014dzaemon (\u672c\u6728\u5e84 \u5de6\u885b\u9580), compiled the first Japanese English dictionary, purported to contain 6000 words in 1814 with the help of Dutch scholars in Japan titled \"Angeria Gorintaisei\" (\u8af3\u5384\u5229\u4e9e\u8a9e\u6797\u5927\u6210). [[it:Motoki Sh\u014dzaemon]]\n\n''An Unabridged Japanese\u2013English Dictionary, with copious illustrations'' (\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Sanseido, 1896), edited by Frank Brinkley, Nanj\u014d Buny\u016b (\u5357\u6761\u6587\u96c4) and Iwasaki Gy\u014dshin (\u5ca9\u5d0e\u884c\u89aa), adapted and expanded Hepburn's dictionary into 1687 pages. It was primarily intended for English-speaking learners of Japanese. Jukichi Inouye (\u4e95\u4e0a\u5341\u5409) also edited ''Inouye's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u4e95\u4e0a\u82f1\u548c\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Sanseido, 1909), which was the first dictionary intended for Japanese learners of English. Takenobu Yoshitar\u014d (\u6b66\u4fe1\u7531\u592a\u90ce) edited the authoritative ''Takenobu's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u6b66\u4fe1\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, Kenkyusha, 1918), which had more coverage and better usage examples than any contemporary dictionaries. It was subsequently revised as ''[[Kenky\u016bsha's New Japanese\u2013English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed. 1931) in order to compete with ''A Standard Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30c9\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8fad\u5178, Taishukwan, 1924), edited by Takehara Tsuneta (\u7af9\u539f\u5e38\u592a), with 57,000 headwords and 300,000 examples; and ''Sait\u014d's Japanese\u2013English Dictionary'' (\u548c\u82f1\u5927\u8fad\u5178, Nichi-Eisha, 1928), also edited by Saito Hidesaburo, with 50,000 headwords and 120,000 examples.

Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, has 480,000 headwords.\n\n===Specialized dictionaries===\n''Senmon jiten'' (\u5c02\u9580\u8f9e\u5178) means \"[[specialized dictionary]]\" and ''senmon-go jiten'' (\u5c02\u9580\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178) means \"jargon dictionary; technical dictionary\". Since specialized Japanese dictionaries are too diverse and numerous to be covered here, four exemplary types are reviewed: dictionaries of old words, current words, loanwords, and thesauri. (See the bibliographies listed under \"External links\" below for more complete listings of specialized dictionaries.)\n\n''Kogo jiten'' (\u53e4\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178) means \"dictionary of [[Classical Japanese]].\" Pre-modern or Classical Japanese can vary considerably from the modern language, and ''kogo'' dictionaries are essential for anyone reading historical texts. \n*''Kadokawa Kogo Daijiten'' (\u89d2\u5ddd\u53e4\u8a9e\u5927\u8f9e\u5178, 1982&ndash;1999, 5 vols.), ed.

The most famous and popular Classical Japanese dictionary in Japan. The first edition went on the market in 1960, a total of 11 million copies have been sold so far, in 2001 9th edition went on.\n*The ''Obunsha Zenyaku Kogo Jiten'' (\u65fa\u6587\u793e\u5168\u8a33\u53e4\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178  \"Obunsha's All Transrated Classical Japanese Dictionary\", 1990, 4th ed. 2011), edited by Miyakoshi Ken (\u5bae\u8d8a\u8ce2), has 22,500 headwords.

Japan, like most other countries, continually creates new and ephemeral terms. Three publishers put out annual paperback dictionaries that cover the latest native coinages and foreign borrowings.\n*''Gendai Y\u014dgo no Kiso Chishiki'' (\u73fe\u4ee3\u7528\u8a9e\u306e\u57fa\u790e\u77e5\u8b58, Jiy\u016b Kokuminsha, 1948-)\n*''J\u014dh\u014d Chishiki Imidas'' (\u60c5\u5831\u77e5\u8b58\u30a4\u30df\u30c0\u30b9, IMIDAS [Innovative Multi-Information Dictionary, Annual Series], Sh\u016beisha, 1987-)\n*''Chiez\u014d'' (\u77e5\u6075\u8535, Asahi Shinbunsha, 1990-)\n\n''Gairaigo jiten'' (\u5916\u6765\u8a9e\u8f9e\u5178) means \"loanword dictionary\".

Nakamura Akira, 50,000 entries\n\n===Electronic and online dictionaries===\n''Denshi jisho'' (\u96fb\u5b50\u8f9e\u66f8) refers either generally to \"dictionary software\" (on CD-ROM, hard drive, ''onrain jisho'' \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u8f9e\u66f8 \"online dictionary\", etc.) or specifically to \"a dedicated [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]-type dictionary\" also known as a ''denshi jiten'' (\u96fb\u5b50\u8f9e\u5178).\n\nThe specific meaning of handheld \"[[electronic Japanese dictionary]]\" became popular in the early 1980s. Modern stand-alone dictionaries resemble a PDA or small [[Flip (form)|clamshell]] computer. Different manufacturers and models offer various user features, [[Japanese input methods]], and multiple-volume capacities for switching between dictionaries of Modern Japanese, Classical Japanese, ''Kanji'', English, medical terminology, etc.\n\nThe general ''denshi jisho'' meaning of \"dictionary database software\" has evolved from early floppies that Japanese users copied onto their local computers to contemporary server-based dictionaries accessible by users with cell phones. Japanese dictionary software is available in either [[freeware]] or commercial versions, both of which are found online.\n\nMany online dictionaries of Japanese are based upon [[Jim Breen]]'s voluntary [[EDICT]] (Japanese\u2013English Dictionary) Project, which consists of the 170,000 entry-strong core JMdict ([[XML]]) and EDICT (text)  files (under [[Creative Commons license]]), and associated files such as KANJIDIC for ''kanji''. [[Eijir\u014d]], another major online database, is targeted primarily at native Japanese speakers, and as such lacks some of the features to make it more accessible to non-native speakers.  Here are some major non-commercial online reference sites.\n*[http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1C Jim Breen's WWWJDIC], primary web interface for EDICT\n*[http://www.romajidesu.com/ RomajiDesu], features EDICT-based dictionary, Japanese to Romaji/Kana/English translator, also includes KANJIDIC, KanjiVG, sample sentences, and Text to Speech.\n*[http://jisho.org/ Denshi Jisho], features EDICT-based dictionary KANJIDIC, KanjiVG and sample sentences\n*[http://jlearn.net/ JLearn], features EDICT-based dictionary KANJIDIC, KanjiVG, sample sentences, conjugation tables and searching by conjugation\n*[http://www.tanoshiijapanese.com/ Tanoshii Japanese], features EDICT-based dictionary, Text to Speech, KANJIDIC, KanjiVG and learning features\n*[http://www.nihongomaster.com/dictionary/  Nihongo Master Japanese Dictionary],  Japanese Bi-Directional English/Japanese Dictionary\n*[http://www.popjisyo.com/ POPjisyo Dictionary], pop-up definitions from EDICT\n*[http://www.nihongodict.com/ Nihongodict], interactive interface for EDICT\n*[http://www.studyjapanese.org/ StudyJapanese.org], EDICT and Kanji dictionary in a learning environment\n*[http://www.kanjidict.com/ Kiki's Kanji Dictionary], interface to search and browse EDICT\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060921022956/http://www.foks.info/index.html FOKS Intelligent Dictionary Interface], FOKS (Forgiving Online Kanji Search) EDICT server with fuzzy searching\n*[http://www.alc.co.jp/ SpaceALC], an online version of the Eijir\u014d dictionary (Japanese)\n*[http://honyakustar.com Honyaku Star], features many dictionaries and corpora such as EDICT, as well as original dictionaries.\n\nSecond, many other online and Web dictionaries use commercial software from Japanese print dictionary publishers. Sanseido, for example, sells printed and CD-ROM dictionary versions, leases dictionary software to commercial Websites (especially search engines), and sells subscriptions to their Web Dictionary. Here are some dictionary websites that are popular in Japan.\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.excite.co.jp/world/english/ Excite \u82f1\u548c\u8f9e\u66f8 (English\u2013Japanese dictionary)], with Kenkyusha's English and Japanese dictionaries, and Sanseido's ''Daijirin''\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://translation.infoseek.co.jp/ Infoseek \u697d\u5929\u30de\u30eb\u30c1\u7ffb\u8a33 (Rakuten multi-translator)], online text or webpage translator using Sanseido dictionaries\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://www.sanseido.net/ \u4e09\u7701\u5802 (Sanseido) Web Dictionary], free access to Sanseido's ''Daily Concise'' dictionaries or subscription access to a dozen more\n*{{in lang|ja}} [http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/ Yahoo!

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] and [[baroque]] buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|St Michael's Cathedral]] (Serbian: ''Saborna crkva)'', completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular [[Romanticism]], along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an [[Eclecticism|eclecticist]] style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Istorija Beograda.|last=Antoni\u0107|first=Zdravko (ed.)|year=1995|location=Belgrade|pages=263\u2013264}}</ref>\n[[File:Belgrade_University_Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|View of Belgrade between 1890 and 1900.]]\n\nIn 1841, Prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] moved the capital of the [[Principality of Serbia]] from [[Kragujevac]] to Belgrade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|title=History|publisher=City of Kragujevac official website|accessdate=15 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329035624/http://www.kragujevac.rs/History-152-2|archive-date=29 March 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201239 |title=History (Important Years Through City History)|publisher=Official website|accessdate=10 July 2007}}</ref> During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (''mahalas'').

The mountains of [[Avala]] ({{convert|511|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and [[Kosmaj]] ({{convert|628|m|ft|abbr=on}}) lie south of the city.

On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. [[Downhill creep]]s are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the [[clay]] or [[loam]] soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in [[Karaburma]], [[Zvezdara]], [[Vi\u0161njica, Serbia|Vi\u0161njica]], [[Vin\u010da]] and [[Ritopek]], in the Danube valley, and [[Umka]], and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire [[Terazijska Terasa|Terazije slope]] above the Sava (Kalemegdan, [[Savamala]]), which can be seen by the inclination of the [[Pobednik]] monument and the tower of the [[St. Michael's Cathedral, Belgrade|Cathedral Church]], and the Vo\u017edovac section, between [[Banjica]] and [[Autokomanda]].\n{{wide image|The confluence of the Sava into the Danube at Belgrade.jpg|950px|The confluence of the [[Sava]] into the [[Danube]] at Belgrade. Pictured from [[Kalemegdan Fortress]].}}\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial [[loess]] hills of Zemun: [[Gardo\u0161]], [[\u0106ukovac]] and [[Kalvarija (Zemun)|Kalvarija]]. \n[[File:Novo Beograd - ada ciganlija and Cukarica - Banovo Brdo IMG 1756 tempo supermarket E763.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Belgrade]], [[Ada Ciganlija]], [[\u010cukarica]] and [[Banovo Brdo]] with the old town in the background.]]\n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of [[Mirijevo]] is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.<ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Klizi\u0161ta nisu samo hir prirode| newspaper = [[Politika]] | language = Serbian | date = 8 November 2011 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/193711/Klizista-nisu-samo-hir-prirode}}</ref><ref>{{Citation | author =Nikola Beli\u0107 | title = Otapanje pokre\u0107e i klizi\u0161ta | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 22 February 2012 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/209361/Otapanje-pokrece-i-klizista}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nBelgrade has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), according to [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation.

It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company.

By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]].

This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally. This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since, as well as having no BBC Local Radio service, the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by [[BBC Channel Islands News|BBC Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |title=TV licence fee not value for money \u2013 inquiry hears |publisher=Iomtoday.co.im |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221125549/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |archivedate=21 December 2012  }}</ref>\n[[File:BBC World Questions - Hungary.jpg|thumb|BBC World Service \u2013 Jonathan Dimbleby broadcasting from Budapest]]\nFor a worldwide audience, the [[BBC World Service]] provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities.

It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.\n\nThe company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Corus Entertainment]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[BBC UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge Network|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (international)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.\n\nBBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios.

In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TVNZ 1]].\n\nIn addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes.

It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). \"International Radio Journalism\". Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925\u201326) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n===1927 to 1939===\n[[File:Radio Times 1931 (masthead).jpg|thumb|left|Masthead from the edition of 25 December 1931 of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\"]]\n[[File:John Logie Baird in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC's first drama, ''[[The Man with the Flower in His Mouth]]'', on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], on 2 June 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021180342/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC's first television outside broadcast|url=http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|publisher=Prospero|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223351/http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith \u2013 newly knighted \u2013 was appointed its first Director General.

The annual message typically chronicles the year's major events.]]\nThe success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]].

The BBC moved much of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford.  Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in [[St Paul's Church, Bedford]] was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[William Temple (bishop)|York]] came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and all parts of the world on the National Day of Prayer.

In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the [[Hulton Press Library]], a photographic archive which had been acquired from the ''[[Picture Post]]'' magazine by the BBC in 1957.

The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\n===2000 to 2011===\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\n\n[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\n[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally.

It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.\n\nThe company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Corus Entertainment]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[BBC UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge Network|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (international)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.\n\nBBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios.

In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TVNZ 1]].\n\nIn addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes.
