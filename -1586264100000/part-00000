These new dynasties, all of which supported Brahmanical Hinduism, include \"the [[Karko\u1e6da Empire|Karkotas]] and [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratiharas]] of the north, the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] of the Deccan, and the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] of the south\" (the [[Pala Empire|Pala Dynasty]] is one sole exception to these).<ref>Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 172.</ref> One of the reasons of this conversion was that the brahmins were willing and able to aid in local administration, and they provided councillors, administrators and clerical staff.<ref name=\"Omvedt, Gail p. 173\">Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 173.</ref><ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 99.</ref> Moreover, brahmins had clear ideas about society, law and statecraft (and studied texts such as the [[Arthashastra]] and the [[Manusmriti]]) and could be more pragmatic than the Buddhists, whose religion was based on monastic renunciation and did not recognize that there was a [[Kshatriya|special warrior class]] that was divinely ordained to use violence.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 99-101.</ref> As [[Johannes Bronkhorst]] notes, Buddhists could give \"very little\" practical advice in response to that of the Brahmins and Buddhist texts often speak ill of kings and royalty.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Buddhism started as early as in life or soon after the death of King Ashoka. D.N. Jha writes that according to Kashmiri texts dated to the 12th century, Ashoka's Son Jalauka was Shaivite and was responsible for the destruction of many Buddhist monasteries.[7] The story of Jalauka is essentially legendary, and no independent corroboration of the Kashmir tradition has been discovered.[8] Patanjali, a famous grammarian stated in his Mahabhashya that Brahmins and Sharamanas (Buddhists) were eternal enemies[9] With the emergence of Hindu rulers of the Gupta Empire, Hinduism saw major revivalism in the Indian subcontinent which challenged Buddhism which was at that time at its zenith. Even though the Gupta Empire was tolerant towards Buddhism and patronized Buddhist arts and religious institutions, Hindu revivalism generally became a major threat to Buddhism which led to its decline. A Buddhist illustrated palm-leaf manuscript from the Pala period (one of the earliest Indian illustrated manuscripts to survive in modern times) is preserved in University of Cambridge library. Composed in the year 1015, the manuscript contains a note from the year 1138 by a Buddhist believer called Karunavajra which indicates that without his efforts, the manuscript would have been destroyed during a political struggle for power. The note states that 'he rescued the 'Perfection of Wisdom, incomparable Mother of the Omniscient' from falling into the hands of unbelievers (who according to Camillo Formigatti were most probably people of Brahmanical affiliation).[10] In 1794 Jagat Singh, Dewan (minister) of Raja Chet Singh of Banaras began excavating two pre Ashokan era stupas at Sarnath for construction material. Dharmarajika stupa was completely demolished and only its foundation exists today while Dhamekh stupa incurred serious damage. During excavation, a green marble relic casket was discovered from Dharmarajika stupa which contained Buddha's ashes was subsequently thrown into the Ganges river by Jagat Singh according to his Hindu faith. The incident was reported by a British resident and timely action of British authorities saved Dhamekh Stupa from demolition.[11]\nOmvedt states that while Buddhist institutions tended to be less involved in politics, Hindu brahmins provided numerous services for Indian royalty:<blockquote>At the higher level they provided legitimacy by creating genealogies and origin mythologies identifying the kings as Kshatriyas and organising impressive ceremonial functions that invested the king with all the paraphernalia and mystique of Hindu royalty; at the lower level they propagandised the mystique of social supremacy and political power. They taught the population, they established ritual and priestly relations with the prominent households of the region, they promulgated caste and the rights of kings.<ref name=\"Omvedt, Gail p. 173\"/></blockquote>Bronkhorst notes that some of the influence of the brahmins also derived from the fact that they were seen as powerful, because of their use of incantations and spells (mantras) as well as other sciences like [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[Calendar|calendrics]] and [[divination]]. Many Buddhists refused to use such \"sciences\" and left them to brahmins, who also performed most of the rituals of the Indian states (as well as in places like Cambodia and Burma).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 108.</ref> This eventually led to further challenges for Buddhists:<blockquote>Rulers gave financial support to Brahmans, took the responsibility of enforcing [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] laws and discriminating against \u2018heretical\u2019 sects, and refused state protection to their persons and property\u2014if they did not actively murder and loot them themselves.<ref>Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 171.</ref></blockquote>Lars Fogelin argues that the concentration of the sangha into large monastic complexes like Nalanda was one of the contributing causes for the decline. He states that the Buddhists of these large monastic institutions became \"largely divorced from day-to-day interaction with the laity, except as landlords over increasingly large monastic properties.\"<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 210.</ref> [[Padmanabh Jaini]] also notes that Buddhist laypersons are relatively neglected in the Buddhist literature, which produced only one text on lay life and not until the 11th century, while Jains produced around fifty texts on the life and conduct of a Jaina layperson.<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh S. (1980): \u201cThe disappearance of Buddhism and the survival of Jainism: a study in contrast.\u201d Studies in History of Buddhism. Ed. A. K. Narain. Delhi: B. R. Publishing. Pp. 81\u201391. Reprint: Jaini, 2001: 139\u201353.</ref>\n\nThese factors all slowly led to the replacement of Buddhism in the South and West of India by Hinduism and Jainism. Fogelin states that <blockquote>While some small Buddhist centers still persisted in South and West India in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, for the most part, both monastic and lay Buddhism had been eclipsed and replaced by Hinduism and Jainism by the end of the first millennium ce.<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 219.</ref></blockquote>Buddhist sources also mention violence against Buddhists by Hindu brahmins and kings.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\nElements which medieval [[Hinduism]] adopted during this time included vegetarianism, a critique of animal sacrifices, a strong tradition of monasticism (founded by figures such as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]) and the adoption of the Buddha as an avatar of [[Vishnu]].<ref>Harvey, Peter, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 195.</ref> On the other end of the spectrum, Buddhism slowly became more and more \"Brahmanized\", initially beginning with the adoption of Sanskrit as a means to defend their interests in royal courts.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 153.</ref> According to Bronkhorst, this move to the Sanskrit cultural world also brought with it numerous Brahmanical norms which now were adopted by the Sanskrit Buddhist culture (one example is the idea present in some Buddhist texts that the Buddha was a brahmin who knew the Vedas).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 156, 163.</ref> Bronkhorst notes that with time, even the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] became widely accepted \"by all practical purposes\" by Indian Buddhists (this survives among the [[Newar Buddhism|Newar Buddhists]] of Nepal).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 162.</ref> Bronkhorst notes that eventually, a tendency developed to see Buddhism's past as having been dependent on Brahmanism and secondary to it. This idea, according to Bronkhorst, \"may have acted like a Trojan horse, weakening this religion from within.\"<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 156, 168.</ref>\n\nThe political realities of the period also led some Buddhists to change their doctrines and practices. For example, some later texts such as the [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra|Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]] and the Sarvadurgatipari\u015bodhana Tantra begin to speak of the importance of protecting Buddhist teachings and that killing is allowed if necessary for this reason. Later Buddhist literature also begins to see kings as [[bodhisattva]]s and their actions as being in line with the dharma (Buddhist kings like [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]] and [[Jayavarman VII]] also claimed this).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 235.</ref> Bronkhorst also thinks that the increase in the use of [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rituals (including for the protection of the state and king) and spells ([[mantra]]s) by 7th century Indian Buddhism is also a response to Brahmanical and [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] influence. These included fire sacrifices, which were performed under the rule of Buddhist king [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] (r. c. 775\u2013812).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 238-241.</ref> Alexis Sanderson has shown that Tantric Buddhism is filled with imperial imagery reflecting the realities of medieval India, and that in some ways work to sanctify that world.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 244.</ref> Perhaps because of these changes, Buddhism remained indebted to Brahmanical thought and practice now that it had adopted much of its worldview. Bronkhorst argues that these somewhat drastic changes \"took them far from the ideas and practices they had adhered to during the early centuries of their religion, and dangerously close to their much-detested rivals.\"<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 245.</ref> These changes which brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism, eventually made it much easier for Buddhism to be absorbed into Hinduism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Patronage===\nIn ancient India, regardless of the religious beliefs of their kings, states usually treated all the important sects relatively even-handedly.<ref name=\"Randall Collins 2000, page 182\"/> This consisted of building monasteries and religious monuments, donating property such as the income of villages for the support of monks, and exempting donated property from taxation. Donations were most often made by private persons such as wealthy merchants and female relatives of the royal family, but there were periods when the state also gave its support and protection. In the case of Buddhism, this support was particularly important because of its high level of organisation and the reliance of monks on donations from the laity. State patronage of Buddhism took the form of land grant foundations.<ref>Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.'' Harvard University Press, 2000, pages 180, 182.</ref>\n\nNumerous copper plate inscriptions from India as well as [[Tibet]]an and [[China|Chinese]] texts suggest that the patronage of [[Buddhism]] and Buddhist monasteries in medieval India was interrupted in periods of war and political change, but broadly continued in Hindu kingdoms from the start of the common era through the early first millennium CE.<ref name=\"Nakamura1980p146\">{{cite book|author=Hajime Nakamura|title=Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w0A7y4TCeVQC |year=1980|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0272-8 |pages=145\u2013148 with footnotes }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Akira Shimada|title=Early Buddhist Architecture in Context: The Great St\u016bpa at Amar\u0101vat\u012b (ca. 300 BCE-300 CE)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfUyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA200 |year=2012|publisher=BRILL Academic |isbn=978-90-04-23326-3 |pages=200\u2013204 }}</ref><ref name=\"Schopen1997p259\">{{cite book|author=Gregory Schopen|title=Bones, Stones, and Buddhist Monks: Collected Papers on the Archaeology, Epigraphy, and Texts of Monastic Buddhism in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rxdZ-BVNm_IC&pg=PA259|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-1870-8|pages=259\u2013278}}</ref> The Gupta kings built Buddhist temples such as the one at Kushinagara,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gina Barns|title=An Introduction to Buddhist Archaeology|journal=World Archaeology|volume = 27| number = 2|year=1995|pages=166\u2013168|doi=10.1080/00438243.1995.9980301}}</ref><ref name=stoddardp3/> and monastic universities such as those at Nalanda, as evidenced by records left by three Chinese visitors to India.<ref name=scharfe2002p144/><ref name=\"Craig Lockard 2007 188\"/><ref name=higham2014p121/>\n\n===Internal social-economic dynamics===\nAccording to some scholars such as Lars Fogelin, the decline of Buddhism may be related to economic reasons, wherein the Buddhist monasteries with large land grants focused on non-material pursuits, self-isolation of the monasteries, loss in internal discipline in the ''sangha'', and a failure to efficiently operate the land they owned.<ref name=\"Schopen1997p259\"/><ref name=larsfogelin>{{cite book|author=Lars Fogelin|title=An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yPZzBgAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-994823-9 |pages=229\u2013230 }}</ref> With the growing support for Hinduism and Jainism, Buddhist monasteries also gradually lost control of land revenue.\n\n== Islamic invasions and conquest (10th to 12th century)==\n\n=== Invasions  ===\n[[File:The end of Buddhist Monks, A.D. 1193.jpg|thumb|The image, in the chapter on India in ''Hutchison's Story of the Nations'' edited by [[James Meston, 1st Baron Meston|James Meston]], depicts the Muslim Turkic general Muhammad Bakhtiyar Khilji's massacre of Buddhist monks in Bihar.

As the Sangha died out in numerous areas, it lacked the ability to revive itself without more monks to perform ordinations. Peter Harvey concludes:<blockquote>Between the alien Muslims, with their doctrinal justification of \"holy war\" to spread the faith, and Hindus, closely identified with Indian culture and with a more entrenched social dimension, the Buddhists were squeezed out of existence. Lay Buddhists were left with a folk form of Buddhism, and gradually merged into Hinduism, or converted to Islam. Buddhism, therefore, died out in all but the fringes of its homeland, though it had long since spread beyond it.<ref>Harvey, Peter, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 196.</ref> </blockquote>Fogelin also notes that some elements of the Buddhist sangha moved to the Himalayas, China, and Southeast Asia, or they may have reverted to secular life or become wandering ascetics. In this environment, without monasteries and scholastic centers of their own, Buddhist ascetics and laypersons were eventually absorbed into the religious life of [[medieval India]].<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 224.</ref>\n\n== Survival of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent ==\n[[File:Bodh gaya before restoration.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mahabodhi Temple]], [[Bodh Gaya]], before the 19th century restoration.]]\nBuddhist institutions survived in eastern India right until the Islamic invasion.

Indian Buddhism also survives among [[Newar people|Newars]] of Nepal, who practice unique form of [[Vajrayana]] known as [[Newar Buddhism]].\n\nWhile the Buddhist monastic centers like [[Nalanda]] had been sacked, the temples and ''[[stupas]]'' at pilgrimage sites (such as [[Bodh Gaya]]) didn't receive the same treatment. The reason these were left unharmed was because they were \"not material legitimations of rival royal families\".<ref name=\"Fogelin\" /> Inscriptions at [[Bodh Gaya]] show that the [[Mahabodhi temple]] was in some use till 14th century. According to the 17th century Tibetan Lama [[Taranatha]]'s ''History of Buddhism in India'', the temple was restored by a Bengali queen in the 15th century, later passing on to a landowner and becoming a [[Shaivism|Shaivite]] center.<ref name=\"Fogelin\" />  Inscriptions at [[Bodh Gaya]] mention Buddhist pilgrims visiting it throughout the period of Buddhist decline:<ref>Middle Land, Middle Way: A Pilgrim's Guide to the Buddha's India, Shravasti Dhammika, Buddhist Publication Society, 1992p. 55-56</ref>\n\n* 1302-1331: Several groups from [[Sindh]]\n* 15th or 16th century: a pilgrim from [[Multan]]\n* 2nd half of the 15th century, monk Budhagupta from South India\n* 16th-century Abhayaraj from Nepal\n* 1773 Trung Rampa, a representative of the [[Panchen Lama]] from Tibet, welcomed by Maharaja of Varanasi\n* 1877, Burmese mission sent by King [[Mindon Min]]\n\n[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul Fazl]], the courtier of [[Mughal emperor]] [[Akbar]], states, \"For a long time past scarce any trace of them (the Buddhists) has existed in Hindustan.\" When he visited [[Kashmir]] in 1597 he met with a few old men professing Buddhism, however, he 'saw none among the learned'. This can also be seen from the fact that Buddhist priests were not present amidst learned divines that came to the [[Ibadat Khana]] of Akbar at [[Fatehpur Sikri]].<ref name=\"Ramesh Chandra Majumdar 1951 426\"/>\n\nAfter the Islamization of Kashmir by sultans like [[Sikandar Butshikan]], much of Hinduism was gone and a little of Buddhism remained.

These new dynasties, all of which supported Brahmanical Hinduism, include \"the [[Karko\u1e6da Empire|Karkotas]] and [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Pratiharas]] of the north, the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakutas]] of the Deccan, and the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyas]] and [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] of the south\" (the [[Pala Empire|Pala Dynasty]] is one sole exception to these).<ref>Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 172.</ref> One of the reasons of this conversion was that the brahmins were willing and able to aid in local administration, and they provided councillors, administrators and clerical staff.<ref name=\"Omvedt, Gail p. 173\">Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 173.</ref><ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 99.</ref> Moreover, brahmins had clear ideas about society, law and statecraft (and studied texts such as the [[Arthashastra]] and the [[Manusmriti]]) and could be more pragmatic than the Buddhists, whose religion was based on monastic renunciation and did not recognize that there was a [[Kshatriya|special warrior class]] that was divinely ordained to use violence.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 99-101.</ref> As [[Johannes Bronkhorst]] notes, Buddhists could give \"very little\" practical advice in response to that of the Brahmins and Buddhist texts often speak ill of kings and royalty.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 103.</ref>\n\nThe persecution of Buddhism started as early as in life or soon after the death of King Ashoka. D.N. Jha writes that according to Kashmiri texts dated to the 12th century, Ashoka's Son Jalauka was Shaivite and was responsible for the destruction of many Buddhist monasteries.[7] The story of Jalauka is essentially legendary, and no independent corroboration of the Kashmir tradition has been discovered.[8] Patanjali, a famous grammarian stated in his Mahabhashya that Brahmins and Sharamanas (Buddhists) were eternal enemies[9] With the emergence of Hindu rulers of the Gupta Empire, Hinduism saw major revivalism in the Indian subcontinent which challenged Buddhism which was at that time at its zenith. Even though the Gupta Empire was tolerant towards Buddhism and patronized Buddhist arts and religious institutions, Hindu revivalism generally became a major threat to Buddhism which led to its decline. A Buddhist illustrated palm-leaf manuscript from the Pala period (one of the earliest Indian illustrated manuscripts to survive in modern times) is preserved in University of Cambridge library. Composed in the year 1015, the manuscript contains a note from the year 1138 by a Buddhist believer called Karunavajra which indicates that without his efforts, the manuscript would have been destroyed during a political struggle for power. The note states that 'he rescued the 'Perfection of Wisdom, incomparable Mother of the Omniscient' from falling into the hands of unbelievers (who according to Camillo Formigatti were most probably people of Brahmanical affiliation).[10] In 1794 Jagat Singh, Dewan (minister) of Raja Chet Singh of Banaras began excavating two pre Ashokan era stupas at Sarnath for construction material. Dharmarajika stupa was completely demolished and only its foundation exists today while Dhamekh stupa incurred serious damage. During excavation, a green marble relic casket was discovered from Dharmarajika stupa which contained Buddha's ashes was subsequently thrown into the Ganges river by Jagat Singh according to his Hindu faith. The incident was reported by a British resident and timely action of British authorities saved Dhamekh Stupa from demolition.[11]\nOmvedt states that while Buddhist institutions tended to be less involved in politics, Hindu brahmins provided numerous services for Indian royalty:<blockquote>At the higher level they provided legitimacy by creating genealogies and origin mythologies identifying the kings as Kshatriyas and organising impressive ceremonial functions that invested the king with all the paraphernalia and mystique of Hindu royalty; at the lower level they propagandised the mystique of social supremacy and political power. They taught the population, they established ritual and priestly relations with the prominent households of the region, they promulgated caste and the rights of kings.<ref name=\"Omvedt, Gail p. 173\"/></blockquote>Bronkhorst notes that some of the influence of the brahmins also derived from the fact that they were seen as powerful, because of their use of incantations and spells (mantras) as well as other sciences like [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[Calendar|calendrics]] and [[divination]]. Many Buddhists refused to use such \"sciences\" and left them to brahmins, who also performed most of the rituals of the Indian states (as well as in places like Cambodia and Burma).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 108.</ref> This eventually led to further challenges for Buddhists:<blockquote>Rulers gave financial support to Brahmans, took the responsibility of enforcing [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] laws and discriminating against \u2018heretical\u2019 sects, and refused state protection to their persons and property\u2014if they did not actively murder and loot them themselves.<ref>Omvedt, Gail, Buddhism in India: Challenging Brahmanism and Caste, p. 171.</ref></blockquote>Lars Fogelin argues that the concentration of the sangha into large monastic complexes like Nalanda was one of the contributing causes for the decline. He states that the Buddhists of these large monastic institutions became \"largely divorced from day-to-day interaction with the laity, except as landlords over increasingly large monastic properties.\"<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 210.</ref> [[Padmanabh Jaini]] also notes that Buddhist laypersons are relatively neglected in the Buddhist literature, which produced only one text on lay life and not until the 11th century, while Jains produced around fifty texts on the life and conduct of a Jaina layperson.<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh S. (1980): \u201cThe disappearance of Buddhism and the survival of Jainism: a study in contrast.\u201d Studies in History of Buddhism. Ed. A. K. Narain. Delhi: B. R. Publishing. Pp. 81\u201391. Reprint: Jaini, 2001: 139\u201353.</ref>\n\nThese factors all slowly led to the replacement of Buddhism in the South and West of India by Hinduism and Jainism. Fogelin states that <blockquote>While some small Buddhist centers still persisted in South and West India in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, for the most part, both monastic and lay Buddhism had been eclipsed and replaced by Hinduism and Jainism by the end of the first millennium ce.<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 219.</ref></blockquote>Buddhist sources also mention violence against Buddhists by Hindu brahmins and kings.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\nElements which medieval [[Hinduism]] adopted during this time included vegetarianism, a critique of animal sacrifices, a strong tradition of monasticism (founded by figures such as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]) and the adoption of the Buddha as an avatar of [[Vishnu]].<ref>Harvey, Peter, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 195.</ref> On the other end of the spectrum, Buddhism slowly became more and more \"Brahmanized\", initially beginning with the adoption of Sanskrit as a means to defend their interests in royal courts.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 153.</ref> According to Bronkhorst, this move to the Sanskrit cultural world also brought with it numerous Brahmanical norms which now were adopted by the Sanskrit Buddhist culture (one example is the idea present in some Buddhist texts that the Buddha was a brahmin who knew the Vedas).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 156, 163.</ref> Bronkhorst notes that with time, even the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] became widely accepted \"by all practical purposes\" by Indian Buddhists (this survives among the [[Newar Buddhism|Newar Buddhists]] of Nepal).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 162.</ref> Bronkhorst notes that eventually, a tendency developed to see Buddhism's past as having been dependent on Brahmanism and secondary to it. This idea, according to Bronkhorst, \"may have acted like a Trojan horse, weakening this religion from within.\"<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 156, 168.</ref>\n\nThe political realities of the period also led some Buddhists to change their doctrines and practices. For example, some later texts such as the [[Mah\u0101y\u0101na Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra|Mah\u0101parinirv\u0101\u1e47a S\u016btra]] and the Sarvadurgatipari\u015bodhana Tantra begin to speak of the importance of protecting Buddhist teachings and that killing is allowed if necessary for this reason. Later Buddhist literature also begins to see kings as [[bodhisattva]]s and their actions as being in line with the dharma (Buddhist kings like [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]] and [[Jayavarman VII]] also claimed this).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 235.</ref> Bronkhorst also thinks that the increase in the use of [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] rituals (including for the protection of the state and king) and spells ([[mantra]]s) by 7th century Indian Buddhism is also a response to Brahmanical and [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] influence. These included fire sacrifices, which were performed under the rule of Buddhist king [[Dharmapala (emperor)|Dharmapala]] (r. c. 775\u2013812).<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 238-241.</ref> Alexis Sanderson has shown that Tantric Buddhism is filled with imperial imagery reflecting the realities of medieval India, and that in some ways work to sanctify that world.<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 244.</ref> Perhaps because of these changes, Buddhism remained indebted to Brahmanical thought and practice now that it had adopted much of its worldview. Bronkhorst argues that these somewhat drastic changes \"took them far from the ideas and practices they had adhered to during the early centuries of their religion, and dangerously close to their much-detested rivals.\"<ref>Bronkhorst, Johannes, Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism BRILL, 2011, p. 245.</ref> These changes which brought Buddhism closer to Hinduism, eventually made it much easier for Buddhism to be absorbed into Hinduism.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n===Patronage===\nIn ancient India, regardless of the religious beliefs of their kings, states usually treated all the important sects relatively even-handedly.<ref name=\"Randall Collins 2000, page 182\"/> This consisted of building monasteries and religious monuments, donating property such as the income of villages for the support of monks, and exempting donated property from taxation. Donations were most often made by private persons such as wealthy merchants and female relatives of the royal family, but there were periods when the state also gave its support and protection. In the case of Buddhism, this support was particularly important because of its high level of organisation and the reliance of monks on donations from the laity. State patronage of Buddhism took the form of land grant foundations.<ref>Randall Collins, ''The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change.''

As the Sangha died out in numerous areas, it lacked the ability to revive itself without more monks to perform ordinations. Peter Harvey concludes:<blockquote>Between the alien Muslims, with their doctrinal justification of \"holy war\" to spread the faith, and Hindus, closely identified with Indian culture and with a more entrenched social dimension, the Buddhists were squeezed out of existence. Lay Buddhists were left with a folk form of Buddhism, and gradually merged into Hinduism, or converted to Islam. Buddhism, therefore, died out in all but the fringes of its homeland, though it had long since spread beyond it.<ref>Harvey, Peter, Introduction to Buddhism, p. 196.</ref> </blockquote>Fogelin also notes that some elements of the Buddhist sangha moved to the Himalayas, China, and Southeast Asia, or they may have reverted to secular life or become wandering ascetics. In this environment, without monasteries and scholastic centers of their own, Buddhist ascetics and laypersons were eventually absorbed into the religious life of [[medieval India]].<ref>Fogelin, Lars, An Archaeological History of Indian Buddhism, Oxford University Press, p. 224.</ref>\n\n== Survival of Buddhism in the Indian subcontinent ==\n[[File:Bodh gaya before restoration.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mahabodhi Temple]], [[Bodh Gaya]], before the 19th century restoration.]]\nBuddhist institutions survived in eastern India right until the Islamic invasion.

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and [[the resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]]. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [[Christian cross|cross]] is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [[incense]] and candles, and is placed in the center of the [[nave]] (where the congregation gathers)''S\u0113meron Krem\u0101tai Ep\u00ed X\u00fdlou'':\n\n<blockquote>Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross ''(three times)''.<br>He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.<br>He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. <br>He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.<br>The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. <br>The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.<br>We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ ''(three times)''.<br>Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Archimandrite Kallistos (Ware) and Mother Mary\n|year = 2002\n|title = The Lenten Triodion\n|chapter = Service of the Twelve Gospels\n|page = 587\n|place = South Cannan, PA\n|publisher = St. Tikhon's Seminary Press\n|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2QNbTDjvJ0 Today He who hung the earth upon the waters ] Chanted by the Byzantine Choir of Athens</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe readings are:\n\n# {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} \u2013 Christ's last sermon, Jesus prays for the [[apostles]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201328|KJV}} \u2013 The agony in the [[Garden of Gethsemane|garden]], the mockery and denial of Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201375|KJV}} \u2013 The mockery of Christ, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] denies Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:28\u201319:16|KJV}} \u2013 [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:3\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Judas]] commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; [[Simon of Cyrene]] compelled to carry the cross.\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:16\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:33\u201354|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:32\u201349|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:25\u201337|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:43\u201347|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:38\u201342|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:62\u201366|KJV}} \u2013 The Jews set a guard.\n\nDuring the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross.

The service does not end with the [[First Hour]], as usual, but with a special [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] by the priest:\n\n<blockquote>May Christ our true God, Who for the salvation of the world endured spitting, and scourging, and buffeting, and the Cross, and death, through the intercessions of His [[Theotokos|most pure Mother]], of our holy and [[Holy Fathers|God-bearing fathers]], and of all the [[saint]]s, have mercy on us and save us, for He is good and the Lover of mankind.</blockquote>\n\n===Royal Hours===\n[[File:Service of the Royal Hours - Great Friday -- Annunciation, Toronto, 2014.JPG|right|thumb|Vigil during the Service of the Royal Hours.]]\n{{main|Royal Hours}}\nThe next day, in the forenoon on Friday, all gather again to pray the '''''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRSgOFbH-fQ Royal Hours]''''', a special expanded celebration of the [[Little Hours]] (including the First Hour, [[Third Hour]], [[Sext|Sixth Hour]], [[Ninth Hour]] and [[Typica]]) with the addition of scripture readings ([[Old Testament]], [[Epistle]] and [[Gospel]]) and hymns about the Crucifixion at each of the Hours (some of the material from the previous night is repeated). This is somewhat more festive in character, and derives its name of \"Royal\" from both the fact that the Hours are served with more solemnity than normal, commemorating Christ the King who humbled himself for the salvation of mankind, and also from the fact that this service was in the past attended by the Emperor and his court.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Vespers of Holy and Great Friday===\n[[File:Toronto-Apokathylosis-2012-04-13.jpg|left|thumb|The crucified Christ, just before the [[Deposition from the Cross]] and the placing of the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]] in the Sepulcher.]]\nIn the afternoon, around 3&nbsp;pm, all gather for the '''''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTqiy-p7EkA Vespers of the Taking-Down from the Cross]''''', commemorating the [[Deposition from the Cross]]. The Gospel reading is a [[concatenation]] taken from all four of the Gospels.

The epitaphios itself represents the body of Jesus wrapped in a burial shroud, and is a roughly full-size cloth icon of the body of Christ. Then the priest may deliver a [[homily]] and everyone comes forward to venerate the epitaphios.

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe [[Troparion]] (hymn of the day) of Good Friday is:\n<blockquote><poem>\nThe noble [[Joseph of Arimathea|Joseph]], when he had taken down Thy most pure Body from the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|tree]], wrapped it in fine linen, and anointed it with spices, and placed it in a new tomb.\nGlory to the [[God the Father|Father]], and to the [[Jesus|Son]], and to the [[Holy Spirit]], both now and ever, and unto ages of ages.

In recent times,{{When|date=April 2017}} revised editions of the [[Book of Common Prayer|Prayer Book]] and [[Common Worship]] have re-introduced pre-[[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] forms of observance of Good Friday corresponding to those in today's Roman Catholic Church, with special nods to the rites that had been observed in the Church of England prior to the [[English Reformation|Henrican, Edwardian and Elizabethan reforms]], including Creeping to the Cross.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Lutheran Church==\n[[File:Chancel of Grace Lutheran Church on Good Friday.jpg|thumb|The [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with black [[parament]]s on Good Friday, the liturgical colour associated with Good Friday in the Lutheran Churches.]]\nIn [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] tradition from the 16th to the 20th century, Good Friday was the most important religious holiday, and abstention from all worldly works was expected. During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|none{{!}}400px\n}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music \u2013 Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music |publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism from non-observers==\nSome [[Baptist]] congregations,<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and [[the resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha.

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''.

The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.
