Her works are held by many important [[art collection]]s worldwide.\n\nIn ''I'm Not The Girl Who Misses Much'' (1986) Rist dances before a camera in a black dress with uncovered breasts. The images are often [[monochromatic]] and [[focus (optics)|fuzzy]]. Rists repeatedly sings \"I'm not the girl who misses much,\" a reference to the first line of the [[song]] \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" by [[the Beatles]]. As the video approaches its end, the image becomes increasingly blue and fuzzy and the sound stops.<ref>Holly, Rogers, Sounding the Gallery: Video and the Rise of Art-Music [Oxford University Press, 2013]</ref>\n\nRist achieved notoriety with ''Pickelporno'' (''Pimple porno'') (1992), a work about the female body and sexual excitation. The [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera moves over the bodies of a couple. The images are charged by intense colors, and are simultaneously strange, sensual, and ambiguous.\n\n''Sip My Ocean'' (1996), a video projected as a mirrored reflection on two adjoining walls, shows a dreamlike series of images of a bikini-clad woman swimming underwater among sinking tea cups, televisions, and other domestic objects.  It is accompanied by a soundtrack of Rist singing Chris Isaak\u2019s \"[[Wicked Game]]\", occasionally punctuated by Rist's repeated shrieking of the lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t want to fall in love.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/5208|title=Sip My Ocean|date=1996-01-01|work=Guggenheim|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>\n\n''Ever is Over All'' (1997) shows in [[slow-motion]] a young woman walking along a city street, smashing the windows of parked cars with a large hammer in the shape of a tropical flower. At one point a police officer greets her. The audio video installation has been purchased by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]].\n\nRist's nine video segments titled ''Open My Glade'' were played once every hour on a screen at [[Times Square]] in New York City, a project of the ''Messages to the Public'' program, which was founded in 1980.\n\n''Pour Your Body Out'' was a commissioned multimedia installation organized by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] and installed in the atrium of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in early 2009. In an interview with [[Phong Bui]] published in [[The Brooklyn Rail]], Rist said she chose the atrium for the installation \"because it reminds me of a church's interior where you\u2019re constantly reminded that the spirit is good and the body is bad. This spirit goes up in space but the body remains on the ground.

The images are often [[monochromatic]] and [[focus (optics)|fuzzy]]. Rists repeatedly sings \"I'm not the girl who misses much,\" a reference to the first line of the [[song]] \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" by [[the Beatles]]. As the video approaches its end, the image becomes increasingly blue and fuzzy and the sound stops.<ref>Holly, Rogers, Sounding the Gallery: Video and the Rise of Art-Music [Oxford University Press, 2013]</ref>\n\nRist achieved notoriety with ''Pickelporno'' (''Pimple porno'') (1992), a work about the female body and sexual excitation. The [[fisheye lens|fisheye]] camera moves over the bodies of a couple. The images are charged by intense colors, and are simultaneously strange, sensual, and ambiguous.\n\n''Sip My Ocean'' (1996), a video projected as a mirrored reflection on two adjoining walls, shows a dreamlike series of images of a bikini-clad woman swimming underwater among sinking tea cups, televisions, and other domestic objects.  It is accompanied by a soundtrack of Rist singing Chris Isaak\u2019s \"[[Wicked Game]]\", occasionally punctuated by Rist's repeated shrieking of the lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t want to fall in love.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/5208|title=Sip My Ocean|date=1996-01-01|work=Guggenheim|access-date=2018-03-03}}</ref>\n\n''Ever is Over All'' (1997) shows in [[slow-motion]] a young woman walking along a city street, smashing the windows of parked cars with a large hammer in the shape of a tropical flower. At one point a police officer greets her. The audio video installation has been purchased by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]].\n\nRist's nine video segments titled ''Open My Glade'' were played once every hour on a screen at [[Times Square]] in New York City, a project of the ''Messages to the Public'' program, which was founded in 1980.\n\n''Pour Your Body Out'' was a commissioned multimedia installation organized by [[Klaus Biesenbach]] and installed in the atrium of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in early 2009. In an interview with [[Phong Bui]] published in [[The Brooklyn Rail]], Rist said she chose the atrium for the installation \"because it reminds me of a church's interior where you\u2019re constantly reminded that the spirit is good and the body is bad. This spirit goes up in space but the body remains on the ground. This piece is really about bringing those two differences together.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bui|first=Phong|title=In Conversation: Pipilotti Rist with Phong Bui|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=January 2009|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2008/12/art/pipilotti-rist-with-phong-bui}}</ref>\n\n=== Collections ===\nRist's work is held in the permanent collections of museums and galleries including the [[Museum of Modern Art]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/artists/8297?locale=en|title=Pipilotti Rist {{!}} MoMA|website=MoMA|access-date=27 March 2018}}</ref> the [[Solomon R.
