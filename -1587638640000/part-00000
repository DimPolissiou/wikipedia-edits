It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

This meeting was totally unorganized. This meeting also repeated the demands such as self-rule, the problems in the [[African diaspora|Diaspora]] and the African-European relationship. The following was addressed at the meeting:\n\n* The development of Africa should be for the benefit of Africans and not merely for the profits of Europeans.\n* There should be home rule and a responsible government for British West Africa and the [[British West Indies]].\n* The Abolition of the pretension of a white minority to dominate a black majority in Kenya, [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa.\n* [[Lynching]] and mob law in the US should be suppressed.\n\nBefore the Congress met in London, [[Isaac B\u00e9ton]] of the French Committee wrote a letter to Du Bois, telling him that the French group would not be sending delegates. However, in one of the reports he published in the ''[[Crisis]]'', Du Bois drew on words spoken by [[Ida Gibbs Hunt]] and [[Rayford Logan]] to imply that the French Committee had sent delegates. As long-time African-American residents of France, Hunt and Logan had travelled independently to the meeting, and Hunt and B\u00e9ton were perturbed that Du Bois had implied they represented France.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Brian Russell|title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era|year=2013|publisher=University of Virginia Press|location=Charlottesville|pages=125\u2013126}}</ref>\n\n== 4th Pan-African Congress ==\nIn 1927, The Fourth Pan-African Congress was held in [[New York City]] and adopted resolutions that were similar to the Third Pan-African Congress meetings.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Pan-African Vision | work=The Story of Africa: Between World Wars (1914\u20131945) | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=16 April 2008| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/13chapter5.shtml }}</ref>\n\n== 5th Pan-African Congress ==\n\n[[File:Manchester-fifth-pan-african-conference-1.jpg|thumb|The commemorating plaque in [[Manchester]]]]\n\nThe Fifth Pan-African Congress was held in [[Manchester]], United Kingdom, from 15th\u201321st October 1945.

It also  led partially to the creation of the [[Pan-African Federation]], founded in 1946 by Nkrumah and Kenyatta.\n\nThere were 33 delegates from the West Indies and 35 from various British organizations, including the [[West African Students Union]]. The presence of 77-year-old Du Bois was historic, as he had organized the First Pan-African Congress in 1919.\n\nThe British Press scarcely mentioned the conference.

It demands that the riches of the continent be used for the enlistment of its people. It calls for the financial and economic unification of markets and a new political landscape for the continent. Even though Pan-Africanism as a movement began in 1776, it was the fifth Pan-African congress that advanced Pan-Africanism and applied it to decolonize the African continent.<ref>{{cite web | title=Road to Pan-Africanism|first=Motsoko |last=Pheko| work=The Sowetan| date=15 November 1999 | url=http://www.panafricanperspective.com/pheko.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe people in Manchester were politically conscious and that was one of the reasons why it was selected as the venue for the fifth Pan-African congress. The fifth congress was organized by people of African origin living in Manchester. According to the Mancunian historian Simon Katzenellenboggen it has a great significance as it was an important step towards the end of those imperial powers in Africa. Unlike the four earlier congresses, the fifth one involved people from the African Diaspora, including Afro-Caribbeans and Afro-Americans. Manchester had a significant part to play in helping the African countries to march forward in their fight to independence.<ref>{{cite web |title=It began in Manchester \u2014 Manchester and The Pan-African Movement |publisher=BBC News; Black History Month |date=14 October 2005| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2005/10/14/151005_pan_african_congress_feature.shtml}}\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[First Pan-African Conference]]\n* [[Pan-Africanism]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Pan-African Congress}}\n* [https://snccdigital.org/our-voices/internationalism/part-4/ SNCC Digital Gateway: Organizing 6PAC] Digital documentary website created by the SNCC Legacy Project and Duke University, telling the story of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee & grassroots organizing from the inside-out\n* [http://lucas.leeds.ac.uk/article/remembering-the-fifth-pan-african-congress-christian-hogsbjerg/ \"Remembering the Fifth Pan-African Congress - Christian H\u00f8gsbjerg], ''[[Leeds African Studies Bulletin]]'', 77 (2015\u201316). \n* B.

It is the sole body given the legislative prerogatives by the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish Constitution]]. It was founded in [[Ankara]] on 23 April 1920 in the midst of the [[Turkish War of Independence|National Campaign]]. The parliament was fundamental in the efforts of ''[[Mare\u015fal (Turkey)|Mare\u015fal]]'' [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], 1st [[President of the Republic of Turkey]], and his colleagues to found a new state out of the remnants of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of Turkey}}\nTurkey has had a history of parliamentary government before the establishment of the current national parliament. These include attempts at curbing absolute monarchy during the [[Ottoman Empire]] through constitutional monarchy, as well as establishments of caretaker national assemblies immediately prior to the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 but after the ''de facto'' dissolution of the Ottoman Empire earlier in the decade.\n\n=== Parliamentary practice before the Republican era ===\n\n==== Ottoman Empire ====\n{{Main|General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)}}\nThere were two parliamentary governments during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period in what is now Turkey. The [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional Era]] lasted for only two years, elections being held only twice. After the first elections, there were a number of criticisms of the government due to the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]] by the representatives, and the assembly was dissolved and an election called on 28 June 1877. The second assembly was also dissolved by the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] on 14 February 1878, the result being the return of absolute monarchy with Abdul Hamid II in power and the suspension of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]], which had come with the democratic reforms resulting in the first constitutional era.<ref>{{Cite web |title=T\u00fcrk Demokrasi Tarihinde I.

The constitution that was written for the first parliament included control of the sultan on the public and was removed during 1909, 1912, 1914 and 1916, in a session known as the \"declaration of freedom\".  Most of the modern parliamentary rights that were not granted in the first constitution were granted, such as the abolition of the right of the Sultan to deport citizens that were claimed to have committed harmful activities, the establishment of a free press, a ban on censorship. Freedom to hold meetings and establish political parties was recognized, and the government was held responsible to the assembly, not to the sultan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l\u0131nda II.

({{lang-tr|{{italics correction|[[Majlis|Meclis]]}}}} or ''Parlamento''), is the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[legislature]]. It is the sole body given the legislative prerogatives by the [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkish Constitution]]. It was founded in [[Ankara]] on 23 April 1920 in the midst of the [[Turkish War of Independence|National Campaign]]. The parliament was fundamental in the efforts of ''[[Mare\u015fal (Turkey)|Mare\u015fal]]'' [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], 1st [[President of the Republic of Turkey]], and his colleagues to found a new state out of the remnants of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n==History==\n{{Politics of Turkey}}\nTurkey has had a history of parliamentary government before the establishment of the current national parliament. These include attempts at curbing absolute monarchy during the [[Ottoman Empire]] through constitutional monarchy, as well as establishments of caretaker national assemblies immediately prior to the declaration of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 but after the ''de facto'' dissolution of the Ottoman Empire earlier in the decade.\n\n=== Parliamentary practice before the Republican era ===\n\n==== Ottoman Empire ====\n{{Main|General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire|First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)}}\nThere were two parliamentary governments during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period in what is now Turkey. The [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Constitutional Era]] lasted for only two years, elections being held only twice. After the first elections, there were a number of criticisms of the government due to the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878]] by the representatives, and the assembly was dissolved and an election called on 28 June 1877. The second assembly was also dissolved by the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] on 14 February 1878, the result being the return of absolute monarchy with Abdul Hamid II in power and the suspension of the [[Ottoman constitution of 1876]], which had come with the democratic reforms resulting in the first constitutional era.<ref>{{Cite web |title=T\u00fcrk Demokrasi Tarihinde I.

The constitution that was written for the first parliament included control of the sultan on the public and was removed during 1909, 1912, 1914 and 1916, in a session known as the \"declaration of freedom\".  Most of the modern parliamentary rights that were not granted in the first constitution were granted, such as the abolition of the right of the Sultan to deport citizens that were claimed to have committed harmful activities, the establishment of a free press, a ban on censorship. Freedom to hold meetings and establish political parties was recognized, and the government was held responsible to the assembly, not to the sultan.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Y\u00fcz\u00fcnc\u00fc Y\u0131l\u0131nda II.
