It is a successor to [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3), also developed by Dolby, and has a number of improvements including support for a wider range of data rates (32&nbsp;kbit/s to 6144&nbsp;kbit/s), increased channel count and multi-program support (via substreams), and additional tools (algorithms) for representing compressed data and counteracting artifacts. While Dolby Digital (AC-3) supports up to five full-bandwidth [[audio channel]]s at a maximum bitrate of 640&nbsp;kbit/s, E-AC-3 supports up to 15 full-bandwidth audio channels at a maximum bitrate of 6.144&nbsp;[[Megabits per second|Mbit/s]].\n\nThe full set of technical specifications for E-AC-3 (and AC-3) are standardized and published in Annex E of [[ATSC]] A/52:2012,<ref name=\"DDplus specification\">[https://www.atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/A52-201212-17.pdf Dolby Digital Plus technical specification] at https://www.atsc.org/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsc.org/standard/a522012-digital-audio-compression-ac-3-e-ac-3-standard-12172012/|title=A/52:2018: Digital Audio Compression (AC-3) (E-AC-3) Standard|website=ATSC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> as well as Annex E of [[ETSI]] TS 102 366<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=52774|title=Work Programme - Work Item Detailed Report|website=portal.etsi.org|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> V1.2.1 (2008\u201308), published by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]].\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Specifications===\nDolby Digital Plus is capable of the following:\n\n* Coded bitrate: 0.032 to 6.144&nbsp;Mbit/s\n* Audio channels: 1.0 to 15.1 (i.e. from mono to 15 full range channels and a low frequency effects channel)\n* Number of audio programs per bitstream: 8\n* Sample rate: 32, 44.1 or 48&nbsp;kHz\n\n===Structure===\nA Dolby Digital Plus service consists of one or more ''substreams''. There are three types of substreams:\n\n* Independent substreams, which can contain a single program of up to 5.1 channels. Up to eight dependent substreams may be present in a Dolby Digital Plus stream. The channels present in an independent substream are limited to the traditional 5.1 channels: Left (L), Right (R), Center (C), Left Surround (Ls), and Right Surround (Rs) channels, as well as a Low Frequency Effects (Lfe) channel.\n* Legacy substreams, which contain a single 5.1 program, and which correspond directly to Dolby Digital content. At most a single legacy substream may be present in a DD+ stream.\n* Dependent substreams, which contain additional channels beyond the traditional 5.1 channels. As dependent substreams have the same structure as independent substreams, each dependent substream may contain up to five full-bandwidth channels and one low-frequency channel; however these channels may be assigned to different speaker placements. Metadata in the substream describes the purpose of each included channel.\n\nAll DD+ streams must contain at least one independent substream or legacy substream, which contains the first (or only) 5.1 channels of the primary audio program. Additional independent substreams may be used for secondary audio programs such as foreign language soundtracks, commentary, or descriptions/voiceovers for the visually impaired. Dependent substreams may be provided for programs that have additional soundstage channels beyond 5.1.\n\nWithin each substream, provision is made for encoding five full-bandwidth channels, one low-frequency channel, and one coupling channel. The coupling channels is used for medium-to-high-frequency information which is common to multiple full-bandwidth channels. Its content is mixed in with the other channels in a fashion prescribed by the metadata, it is not reproduced as a discrete channel by the decoder.\n\nDolby Digital Plus includes comprehensive bitstream metadata for decoder control over output loudness (via dialnorm), downmixing, and reversible dynamic range control (via DRC).\n\n===Syntax===\nDolby Digital Plus is nominally a 16-bit-aligned protocol, though very few fields in the syntax respect any byte or word boundaries. As many syntax elements are optional or variable-length, including some whose presence or length is dependent on complex preceding calculations, and there is little redundancy in the syntax, DD+ can be extremely difficult to parse correctly, with syntactically valid but incorrect parsings easily produced by defective encoders.\n\nA DD+ stream is a collection of fixed-length ''syncframe'' packets, each of which corresponds to either 256, 512, 768, or 1536 consecutive time-domain audio samples. (The 1536-sample case is the most common case, and corresponds to Dolby Digital; the shorter subframe lengths are intended for use in interactive applications like video games where reducing encoder latency is an important concern). Each syncframe is independently decodable, and belongs to a specific substream within the service. A syncframe consists of the following syntax elements (some of which may be elided when a Dolby Digital Plus service is encapsulated into another format or transport):\n* A 16-bit sync word, which has the value 0x0b77.\n* A Bitstream Info (BSI) section, which includes key metadata such as the frame size, the bitstream identifier (which specifies the version of syntax used), channel mode, the substream identifier, the encoded dialog level (dialnorm), and metadata to guide decoder production of a downmix.\n* An Audio Frame section, which contains decoding information common to all audio blocks within the syncframe, including the necessary information to determine how exponents and mantissas are packed.\n* One, two, three, or six Audio Block sections. These sections contain additional decoding metadata, as well as the encoded and quantized frequency coefficients. Each Audio Block corresponds to 256 PCM samples in each channel.\n* A final section containing user-defined auxiliary data, any necessary padding to produce uniform syncframe lengths, and a 16-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]] code for error detection.\n\n====Storage of transform coefficients====\nAt the heart of both Dolby Digital and DD+ is a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT), which is used to transform the audio signal into the frequency domain; within each block up to 256 frequency coefficients may be transmitted. Coefficients are transmitted in a binary floating-point format, with exponents transmitted separately from mantissas. This allows for highly efficient coding.\n\nExponents for each channel are encoded in a highly packed differential format, with the deltas between consecutive frequency bins (other than the first) being given in the stream. Three formats, or ''exponent strategies'', are used; these are known as \"D15\", \"D25\", and \"D45\". In D15, each bin has a unique exponent, while in D25 and D45, delta values correspond to either pairs or quads of frequency bins. Audio blocks other than the first in a syncframe may additionally reuse the prior block's exponent set (this is required for channels that use the Adaptive Hybrid Transform).\n\nThe decoded exponents, along with a set of metadata parameters, is used to derive the bit allocation pointers (BAPs), which specify the number of bits allocated to each mantissa. Bins which correspond to frequencies in which human hearing is more precise are allocated more bits; bins which correspond to frequencies that humans are less sensitive to are allocated fewer. Anywhere between zero and 16 bits may be allocated for each mantissa; if zero bits are transmitted, a dither function may be optionally applied to generate the frequency coefficient.\n\n===Algorithm===\nDolby Digital Plus, like many lossy audio codecs, uses a heavily quantized frequency-domain representation of the signal to achieve [[coding gain]]; this section describes the operation of the base transform as well as various optional \"tools\" specified by the standard, which are used to achieve either greater compression or to reduce audible coding artifacts.\n\n====Modified discrete cosine transform====\nBoth Dolby Digital and DD+ encoder converts a multichannel audio signal to the frequency domain using the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT), with a switchable block length of either 256 or 512 samples (the latter is used with stationary signals, the former with transient signals). The frequency domain representation is then quantized according to a psycho-acoustic model and transmitted. A floating-point format for frequency coefficients is used, and mantissas and exponents are stored and transmitted separately, with both being heavily compressed.\n\n====Adaptive hybrid transform (AHT)====\nFor highly stationary signals, such as long notes in musical performance, the Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT) is used. This tool is unique to Dolby Digital Plus (and unsupported in Dolby Digital), and uses an additional Type II [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) to combine six adjacent transform blocks (located within a syncframe) into an effectively longer block. In addition to the two-stage transform, a different bit-allocation structure is used, and two ways of representing encoded mantissas are deployed: use of [[vector quantization]], which gives the highest coding gain, and use of gain-adapted quantization (GAQ) when greater signal-fidelity is required. Gain-adaptive quantization may be independently enabled for each frequency bin within a channel, and permits variable-length mantissa encoding.\n\n====Coupling====\nAs many multichannel audio programs have high degrees of correlation between individual channels, a coupling channel is typically used. High frequency information which is common among two or more channels is transmitted in a separate channel (one that is not reproduced by a decoder, but only mixed back into the original channels) known as the coupling channel; along with coefficients known as \"coupling coordinates\" that guide the decoder on how to reconstruct the original channels.\n\nDolby Digital Plus supports a more elaborate version of the coupling tool known as Enhanced Coupling (ECPL). This algorithm, which is considerably more expensive to process (both for encoders and decoders) allows phase information to be included in coupling coordinates, allowing for phase relationships between channels that are coupled to be preserved.\n\n====Spectral extension====\nDolby Digital Plus provides another tool for high frequencies. As high frequency components are often harmonics of lower-frequency sounds, Spectral Extension (SPX) allows high frequency components to be synthesized algorithmically from lower-frequency components. This tool is also unique to Dolby Digital Plus, and unsupported in Dolby Digital.\n\n====Rematrixing====\nStereo programs are typically rematrixed and encoded as an L+R and L-R channel. This is done both to increase coding gain (the L-R channel can typically be heavily compressed, and the subsequent un-matrixing will cause many compression artifacts to cancel), and to preserve phase relationships necessary for proper playback of [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded material.\n\n====Transient pre-noise processing====\nTransient pre-noise processing (TPNP) is a Dolby Digital Plus-specific tool to reduce the resulting artifacts of signal quantization and other compression techniques. Unlike the other tools described above, which operate in the frequency domain and precede the conversion back into PCM samples, TPNP is a tool which essentially performs a windowed cut-and-paste operation on the time-domain signal to erase certain predictable quantization artifacts.\n\n===Relation to Dolby Digital===\nDolby Digital Plus bitstreams are not directly [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with legacy [[Dolby Digital]] decoders. However, Dolby Digital Plus is a functional superset of Dolby Digital, and decoders include a mandatory component that directly converts (without decoding and re-encoding) the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to a Dolby Digital bitstream (operating at 640&nbsp;kbit/s) for carriage via legacy S/PDIF connections (including S/PDIF over HDMI) to external decoders (e.g. AVRs, etc.). All Dolby Digital Plus decoders can decode Dolby Digital bitstreams.\n\n<!-- This content reads like press release:\nThe Dolby Digital Plus coding system is the only commercialized coding system that can create a single multichannel bitstream where the decoder can scale the number of decoded output channels and simultaneously optimize the playback loudness and dynamic range for any device type and application. Including: AVRs, TVs, STBs, PCs, Tablets, Mobile Phones, etc. As an example, a single multichannel bitstream can simultaneously provide full dynamic range for home theater playback and a compressed dynamic range 2-channel downmix at a reference output loudness tailored for internal speakers and headphones on portable/mobile devices. This unique feature is enabled within the Dolby Digital Plus decoder (via specific decoder operating modes) which leverage specific metadata carried in the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream authored during the production process and/or within the encoder itself. This approach provides content creators and/or distributors with the ability to create a single asset (stream) that can scale and optimize the playback experience across a wide range of devices and applications. Thereby eliminating the need (and cost) to create multiple versions of the same content \"pre-produced\" for each device type and application. Specific playback behaviors (to ensure optimum experience) are also under direct control of the content creator and/or distributor via the use of metadata created in production and carried in the bitstream for use during decoding/playback.-->\n\n===Dynamic range compression===\nOne design goal of DD+ is quality playback in a variety of environments, ranging from home theaters and other acoustically controlled environments where high dynamic range playback is feasible, to portable and automotive environments where lots of background noise is present, and dynamic range compression may be necessary to make all parts of an audio program audible.\n\nDD+ provides the following operating modes for different listener/viewer environments.\n\nDolby Digital Plus Decoder Operating Modes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Application\n|-\n| Line || \u221231 LKFS || Home Theatre Playback{{snd}} Provides Full \"cinema\" Dynamic Range\n|-\n| RF || \u221220 LKFS || TV Speaker Playback{{snd}} Provides Typical \"broadcast\" Dynamic Range\n|-\n| Portable || \u221211 LKFS || Portable Device Speaker & Headphone Playback{{snd}} Provides Minimum Dynamic Range (similar to music production/mixing/mastering techniques)\n|}\nNote: All of the decoder operating modes (listed above) are available in every Dolby Digital Plus decoder. The default operating mode is governed by device category and application. In some devices, users may also have a choice (via menu) to select an alternate mode that suits their particular taste and/or application.\n\nIn addition, Dolby Digital and DD+ contain additional metadata to permit error-free translation into range-restricted downstream channels, such as RF modulation, where excessive output signal amplitude may result in significant distortion or modulation errors.\n\n==Encapsulation, use, and storage of Dolby Digital streams==\n\n===Physical transport for consumer devices===\nIEC 61937-3: defines how to transmit Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams via an IEC 60958/61937 (S/PDIF) interface. However, the [[S/PDIF]] interface has insufficient bandwidth to transport Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams at the 3.0Mbit/s datarate specified by HD DVD; lower datarates are possible.\n\nMuch consumer gear, and even some professional gear, does not recognize Dolby Digital Plus as an encoded format, and will treat DD+ signals over a S/PDIF or similar interface, or stored in a .WAV file or similar container format, as though they were linear PCM data. This is not problematic if the data is passed unchanged, but any gain scaling or sample rate conversion, operations which are aurally harmless to PCM data, will corrupt and destroy a Dolby Digital Plus stream. (Older codecs such as DTS or AC-3 are more likely to be recognized as compressed formats and protected from such processing).\n\nDolby Digital Plus may be transmitted across HDMI&nbsp;1.3 or newer, according to IEC&nbsp;61937-3.\n\n===Physical transport for professional devices and applications===\nAs the [[AES3|AES-3]] interface is the professional analog to S/PDIF, Dolby Digital Plus streams may be carried over AES-3 connections with sufficient bandwidth, and/or over other interfaces that encapsulate AES-3 (such as SMPTE 259M and SMPTE 299M embedded audio). Additional standards promulgated by SMPTE specify the encoding of Dolby transports, including Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and [[Dolby E]] (a professional-only codec used in audio/video applications) on an AES interface. The SMPTE 337 standard specifies the signalling and carriage of signals that are not PCM audio over an AES-3 interface, and the SMPTE 340-2008 standard specifies how Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby Digital are to be transmitted over that interface. The combination of SMPTE 340-2008 and 337M allow the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to be stored and transported within professional production, contribution and distribution workflows prior to emission to consumers.\n\n===Consumer broadcast in digital television systems===\nEither DD+ or Dolby Digital is specified by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] as the primary audio codec for the ATSC [[digital television]] system, and is commonly used for other DTV applications (such as cable and satellite broadcast) in countries which use ATSC for digital television.\n\nFor broadcast (emission) to consumers, the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream is packetized in an MPEG elementary stream, and multiplexed (with video) into an MPEG Transport Stream. In ATSC systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ATSC A/53 Part 3 & Part 6. In DVB systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ETSI TS 101 154 and ETSI EN 300 468.\n\nDolby Digital Plus is seeing increasing use in digital television systems, particular in cable and satellite systems, as a replacement for Dolby Digital. Many such applications don't take advantage of its higher channel count or ability to support multiple independent programs; instead it is used as a higher-efficiency codec than AC-3.\n\n===HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc===\n{{Main|Comparison of high definition optical disc formats#Technical details}}\nBoth the now-defunct [[HD DVD]] standard, and [[Blu-ray Disc]] include Dolby Digital Plus. It is a mandatory component of HD&nbsp;DVD and an optional component of Blu-ray. The maximum number of discrete coded channels is the same for both formats: 7.1. However, HD&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray impose different technical constraints on the supported audio-codecs. Hence, the usage of DD+ differs substantially between HD&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray Disc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitrate comparison\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Codec\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\" | HD DVD\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Blu-ray Disc\n|-\n!

An HD DVD movie may use DD+ as the primary (or only) audio track. An HD DVD player is required to support DD+ audio by decoding and outputting it to the player's output jacks. As stored on disc, the DD+ bitstream can carry for any number of audio channels up to the maximum allowed, at any bitrate up to 3.0&nbsp;Mbit/s.\n\nOn Blu-ray Disc, DD+ is an optional codec, and is deployed as an extension to a \"core\" AC-3 5.1 audiotrack. The AC-3 core is encoded at 640&nbsp;kbit/s, carries 5 primary channels (and 1 LFE), and is independently playable as a movie audio track by any Blu-ray Disc player. The DD+ extension bitstream is used on players that support it by replacing the rear channels in the 5.1 setup with higher fidelity versions, along with providing a possible channel extension to 6.1 or 7.1. The complete audio track is allowed a combined bitrate of 1.7&nbsp;Mbit/s: 640&nbsp;kbit/s for the AC-3 5.1 core, and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s for the DD+ extension. During playback, both the core and extension bitstreams contribute to the final audio-output, according to rules embedded in the bitstream metadata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/ae9297097696f3d06417a6e8a5368d5f38a6edb4|title=avcodec/eac3: add support for dependent stream \u00b7 FFmpeg/FFmpeg@ae92970|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Media players and downmixing===\nGenerally, a Dolby Digital Plus bitstream can only be transported over an HDMI&nbsp;1.3 or greater link. Older receivers support earlier versions of HDMI, or only have support for the [[S/PDIF]] system for digital audio, or analog inputs.\n\nFor non-HDMI&nbsp;1.3 links, the player can decode the audio and then transmit it via a variety of different methods.\n* Earlier versions of HDMI, such as HDMI&nbsp;1.1, support [[PCM audio]], where the player decodes the audio and transmits it losslessly as PCM over HDMI to the receiver.\n* Some receivers and players support analog surround sound, and the player can decode the audio, and transmit it to the receiver as analog audio.\n\nMost receivers and players support S/PDIF. This lower bandwidth digital connection is not capable of transmitting lossless PCM audio with more than two channels, but a player can transmit a S/PDIF compatible audio stream to the receiver in one of the following ways:\n* [[Blu-ray Disc]] players can take advantage of the legacy 5.1 AC-3 bitstream embedded in the E-AC-3 bitstream, transmitting just the AC-3 bitstream with no modifications.\n* Players supporting the [[HD DVD]] standard can transcode the decoded audio into another format. Depending upon the method and options available to the player, this can be done with relatively little quality loss. Dolby's reference decoder, available to all licensees, exploits the common heritage between AC-3 and E-AC-3 by performing the operation in the frequency domain. Hybrid re-compression avoids unnecessary end-to-end decompression and subsequent recompression (E-AC-3 \u2192 LPCM \u2192 AC-3). In addition to AC-3, some HD DVD players transcode audio compatible with S/PDIF into 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s [[DTS (sound system)|DTS audio]]. While S/PDIF can carry Dolby Digital Plus at lower bitrates, the HD DVD standard specifies a bitrate for DD+ which is too high for a S/PDIF interface to transmit.\n\nShould the player need to decode the audio for a non-HDMI&nbsp;1.3 receiver, the results should be predictable.

While Dolby Digital (AC-3) supports up to five full-bandwidth [[audio channel]]s at a maximum bitrate of 640&nbsp;kbit/s, E-AC-3 supports up to 15 full-bandwidth audio channels at a maximum bitrate of 6.144&nbsp;[[Megabits per second|Mbit/s]].\n\nThe full set of technical specifications for E-AC-3 (and AC-3) are standardized and published in Annex E of [[ATSC]] A/52:2012,<ref name=\"DDplus specification\">[https://www.atsc.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/A52-201212-17.pdf Dolby Digital Plus technical specification] at https://www.atsc.org/</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.atsc.org/standard/a522012-digital-audio-compression-ac-3-e-ac-3-standard-12172012/|title=A/52:2018: Digital Audio Compression (AC-3) (E-AC-3) Standard|website=ATSC|language=en|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> as well as Annex E of [[ETSI]] TS 102 366<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=52774|title=Work Programme - Work Item Detailed Report|website=portal.etsi.org|access-date=2019-06-19}}</ref> V1.2.1 (2008\u201308), published by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]].\n\n==Technical details==\n\n===Specifications===\nDolby Digital Plus is capable of the following:\n\n* Coded bitrate: 0.032 to 6.144&nbsp;Mbit/s\n* Audio channels: 1.0 to 15.1 (i.e. from mono to 15 full range channels and a low frequency effects channel)\n* Number of audio programs per bitstream: 8\n* Sample rate: 32, 44.1 or 48&nbsp;kHz\n\n===Structure===\nA Dolby Digital Plus service consists of one or more ''substreams''. There are three types of substreams:\n\n* Independent substreams, which can contain a single program of up to 5.1 channels. Up to eight dependent substreams may be present in a Dolby Digital Plus stream. The channels present in an independent substream are limited to the traditional 5.1 channels: Left (L), Right (R), Center (C), Left Surround (Ls), and Right Surround (Rs) channels, as well as a Low Frequency Effects (Lfe) channel.\n* Legacy substreams, which contain a single 5.1 program, and which correspond directly to Dolby Digital content. At most a single legacy substream may be present in a DD+ stream.\n* Dependent substreams, which contain additional channels beyond the traditional 5.1 channels. As dependent substreams have the same structure as independent substreams, each dependent substream may contain up to five full-bandwidth channels and one low-frequency channel; however these channels may be assigned to different speaker placements. Metadata in the substream describes the purpose of each included channel.\n\nAll DD+ streams must contain at least one independent substream or legacy substream, which contains the first (or only) 5.1 channels of the primary audio program. Additional independent substreams may be used for secondary audio programs such as foreign language soundtracks, commentary, or descriptions/voiceovers for the visually impaired. Dependent substreams may be provided for programs that have additional soundstage channels beyond 5.1.\n\nWithin each substream, provision is made for encoding five full-bandwidth channels, one low-frequency channel, and one coupling channel. The coupling channels is used for medium-to-high-frequency information which is common to multiple full-bandwidth channels. Its context is mixed in with the other channels in a fashion prescribed by the metadata, it is not reproduced as a discrete channel by the decoder.\n\nDolby Digital Plus includes comprehensive bitstream metadata for decoder control over output loudness (via dialnorm), downmixing, and reversible dynamic range control (via DRC).\n\n===Syntax===\nDolby Digital Plus is nominally a 16-bit-aligned protocol, though very few fields in the syntax respect any byte or word boundaries. As many syntax elements are optional or variable-length, including some whose presence or length is dependent on complex preceding calculations, and there is little redundancy in the syntax, DD+ can be extremely difficult to parse correctly, with syntactically valid but incorrect parsings easily produced by defective encoders.\n\nA DD+ stream is a collection of fixed-length ''syncframe'' packets, each of which corresponds to either 256, 512, 768, or 1536 consecutive time-domain audio samples. (The 1536-sample case is the most common case, and corresponds to Dolby Digital; the shorter subframe lengths are intended for use in interactive applications like video games where reducing encoder latency is an important concern). Each syncframe is independently decodable, and belongs to a specific substream within the service. A syncframe consists of the following syntax elements (some of which may be elided when a Dolby Digital Plus service is encapsulated into another format or transport):\n* A 16-bit sync word, which has the value 0x0b77.\n* A Bitstream Info (BSI) section, which includes key metadata such as the frame size, the bitstream identifier (which specifies the version of syntax used), channel mode, the substream identifier, the encoded dialog level (dialnorm), and metadata to guide decoder production of a downmix.\n* An Audio Frame section, which contains decoding information common to all audio blocks within the syncframe, including the necessary information to determine how exponents and mantissas are packed.\n* One, two, three, or six Audio Block sections. These sections contain additional decoding metadata, as well as the encoded and quantized frequency coefficients. Each Audio Block corresponds to 256 PCM samples in each channel.\n* A final section containing user-defined auxiliary data, any necessary padding to produce uniform syncframe lengths, and a 16-bit [[cyclic redundancy check]] code for error detection.\n\n====Storage of transform coefficients====\nAt the heart of both Dolby Digital and DD+ is a [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT), which is used to transform the audio signal into the frequency domain; within each block up to 256 frequency coefficients may be transmitted. Coefficients are transmitted in a binary floating-point format, with exponents transmitted separately from mantissas. This allows for highly efficient coding.\n\nExponents for each channel are encoded in a highly packed differential format, with the deltas between consecutive frequency bins (other than the first) being given in the stream. Three formats, or ''exponent strategies'', are used; these are known as \"D15\", \"D25\", and \"D45\". In D15, each bin has a unique exponent, while in D25 and D45, delta values correspond to either pairs or quads of frequency bins. Audio blocks other than the first in a syncframe may additionally reuse the prior block's exponent set (this is required for channels that use the Adaptive Hybrid Transform).\n\nThe decoded exponents, along with a set of metadata parameters, is used to derive the bit allocation pointers (BAPs), which specify the number of bits allocated to each mantissa. Bins which correspond to frequencies in which human hearing is more precise are allocated more bits; bins which correspond to frequencies that humans are less sensitive to are allocated fewer. Anywhere between zero and 16 bits may be allocated for each mantissa; if zero bits are transmitted, a dither function may be optionally applied to generate the frequency coefficient.\n\n===Algorithm===\nDolby Digital Plus, like many lossy audio codecs, uses a heavily quantized frequency-domain representation of the signal to achieve [[coding gain]]; this section describes the operation of the base transform as well as various optional \"tools\" specified by the standard, which are used to achieve either greater compression or to reduce audible coding artifacts.\n\n====Modified discrete cosine transform====\nBoth Dolby Digital and DD+ encoder converts a multichannel audio signal to the frequency domain using the [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT), with a switchable block length of either 256 or 512 samples (the latter is used with stationary signals, the former with transient signals). The frequency domain representation is then quantized according to a psycho-acoustic model and transmitted. A floating-point format for frequency coefficients is used, and mantissas and exponents are stored and transmitted separately, with both being heavily compressed.\n\n====Adaptive hybrid transform (AHT)====\nFor highly stationary signals, such as long notes in musical performance, the Adaptive Hybrid Transform (AHT) is used. This tool is unique to Dolby Digital Plus (and unsupported in Dolby Digital), and uses an additional Type II [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) to combine six adjacent transform blocks (located within a syncframe) into an effectively longer block. In addition to the two-stage transform, a different bit-allocation structure is used, and two ways of representing encoded mantissas are deployed: use of [[vector quantization]], which gives the highest coding gain, and use of gain-adapted quantization (GAQ) when greater signal-fidelity is required. Gain-adaptive quantization may be independently enabled for each frequency bin within a channel, and permits variable-length mantissa encoding.\n\n====Coupling====\nAs many multichannel audio programs have high degrees of correlation between individual channels, a coupling channel is typically used. High frequency information which is common among two or more channels is transmitted in a separate channel (one that is not reproduced by a decoder, but only mixed back into the original channels) known as the coupling channel; along with coefficients known as \"coupling coordinates\" that guide the decoder on how to reconstruct the original channels.\n\nDolby Digital Plus supports a more elaborate version of the coupling tool known as Enhanced Coupling (ECPL). This algorithm, which is considerably more expensive to process (both for encoders and decoders) allows phase information to be included in coupling coordinates, allowing for phase relationships between channels that are coupled to be preserved.\n\n====Spectral extension====\nDolby Digital Plus provides another tool for high frequencies. As high frequency components are often harmonics of lower-frequency sounds, Spectral Extension (SPX) allows high frequency components to be synthesized algorithmically from lower-frequency components. This tool is also unique to Dolby Digital Plus, and unsupported in Dolby Digital.\n\n====Rematrixing====\nStereo programs are typically rematrixed and encoded as an L+R and L-R channel. This is done both to increase coding gain (the L-R channel can typically be heavily compressed, and the subsequent un-matrixing will cause many compression artifacts to cancel), and to preserve phase relationships necessary for proper playback of [[Dolby Surround]]-encoded material.\n\n====Transient pre-noise processing====\nTransient pre-noise processing (TPNP) is a Dolby Digital Plus-specific tool to reduce the resulting artifacts of signal quantization and other compression techniques. Unlike the other tools described above, which operate in the frequency domain and precede the conversion back into PCM samples, TPNP is a tool which essentially performs a windowed cut-and-paste operation on the time-domain signal to erase certain predictable quantization artifacts.\n\n===Relation to Dolby Digital===\nDolby Digital Plus bitstreams are not directly [[Backward compatibility|backward compatible]] with legacy [[Dolby Digital]] decoders. However, Dolby Digital Plus is a functional superset of Dolby Digital, and decoders include a mandatory component that directly converts (without decoding and re-encoding) the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to a Dolby Digital bitstream (operating at 640&nbsp;kbit/s) for carriage via legacy S/PDIF connections (including S/PDIF over HDMI) to external decoders (e.g. AVRs, etc.). All Dolby Digital Plus decoders can decode Dolby Digital bitstreams.\n\n<!-- This content reads like press release:\nThe Dolby Digital Plus coding system is the only commercialized coding system that can create a single multichannel bitstream where the decoder can scale the number of decoded output channels and simultaneously optimize the playback loudness and dynamic range for any device type and application. Including: AVRs, TVs, STBs, PCs, Tablets, Mobile Phones, etc. As an example, a single multichannel bitstream can simultaneously provide full dynamic range for home theater playback and a compressed dynamic range 2-channel downmix at a reference output loudness tailored for internal speakers and headphones on portable/mobile devices. This unique feature is enabled within the Dolby Digital Plus decoder (via specific decoder operating modes) which leverage specific metadata carried in the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream authored during the production process and/or within the encoder itself. This approach provides content creators and/or distributors with the ability to create a single asset (stream) that can scale and optimize the playback experience across a wide range of devices and applications. Thereby eliminating the need (and cost) to create multiple versions of the same content \"pre-produced\" for each device type and application. Specific playback behaviors (to ensure optimum experience) are also under direct control of the content creator and/or distributor via the use of metadata created in production and carried in the bitstream for use during decoding/playback.-->\n\n===Dynamic range compression===\nOne design goal of DD+ is quality playback in a variety of environments, ranging from home theaters and other acoustically controlled environments where high dynamic range playback is feasible, to portable and automotive environments where lots of background noise is present, and dynamic range compression may be necessary to make all parts of an audio program audible.\n\nDD+ provides the following operating modes for different listener/viewer environments.\n\nDolby Digital Plus Decoder Operating Modes:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Mode !! Reference Loudness (LKFS) !! Application\n|-\n| Line || \u221231 LKFS || Home Theatre Playback{{snd}} Provides Full \"cinema\" Dynamic Range\n|-\n| RF || \u221220 LKFS || TV Speaker Playback{{snd}} Provides Typical \"broadcast\" Dynamic Range\n|-\n| Portable || \u221211 LKFS || Portable Device Speaker & Headphone Playback{{snd}} Provides Minimum Dynamic Range (similar to music production/mixing/mastering techniques)\n|}\nNote: All of the decoder operating modes (listed above) are available in every Dolby Digital Plus decoder. The default operating mode is governed by device category and application. In some devices, users may also have a choice (via menu) to select an alternate mode that suits their particular taste and/or application.\n\nIn addition, Dolby Digital and DD+ contain additional metadata to permit error-free translation into range-restricted downstream channels, such as RF modulation, where excessive output signal amplitude may result in significant distortion or modulation errors.\n\n==Encapsulation, use, and storage of Dolby Digital streams==\n\n===Physical transport for consumer devices===\nIEC 61937-3: defines how to transmit Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams via an IEC 60958/61937 (S/PDIF) interface. However, the [[S/PDIF]] interface has insufficient bandwidth to transport Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitstreams at the 3.0Mbit/s datarate specified by HD DVD; lower datarates are possible.\n\nMuch consumer gear, and even some professional gear, does not recognize Dolby Digital Plus as an encoded format, and will treat DD+ signals over a S/PDIF or similar interface, or stored in a .WAV file or similar container format, as though they were linear PCM data. This is not problematic if the data is passed unchanged, but any gain scaling or sample rate conversion, operations which are aurally harmless to PCM data, will corrupt and destroy a Dolby Digital Plus stream. (Older codecs such as DTS or AC-3 are more likely to be recognized as compressed formats and protected from such processing).\n\nDolby Digital Plus may be transmitted across HDMI&nbsp;1.3 or newer, according to IEC&nbsp;61937-3.\n\n===Physical transport for professional devices and applications===\nAs the [[AES3|AES-3]] interface is the professional analog to S/PDIF, Dolby Digital Plus streams may be carried over AES-3 connections with sufficient bandwidth, and/or over other interfaces that encapsulate AES-3 (such as SMPTE 259M and SMPTE 299M embedded audio). Additional standards promulgated by SMPTE specify the encoding of Dolby transports, including Dolby Digital, Dolby Digital Plus, and [[Dolby E]] (a professional-only codec used in audio/video applications) on an AES interface. The SMPTE 337 standard specifies the signalling and carriage of signals that are not PCM audio over an AES-3 interface, and the SMPTE 340-2008 standard specifies how Dolby Digital Plus and Dolby Digital are to be transmitted over that interface. The combination of SMPTE 340-2008 and 337M allow the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream to be stored and transported within professional production, contribution and distribution workflows prior to emission to consumers.\n\n===Consumer broadcast in digital television systems===\nEither DD+ or Dolby Digital is specified by the [[Advanced Television Systems Committee]] as the primary audio codec for the ATSC [[digital television]] system, and is commonly used for other DTV applications (such as cable and satellite broadcast) in countries which use ATSC for digital television.\n\nFor broadcast (emission) to consumers, the Dolby Digital Plus bitstream is packetized in an MPEG elementary stream, and multiplexed (with video) into an MPEG Transport Stream. In ATSC systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ATSC A/53 Part 3 & Part 6. In DVB systems, the specification for carrying Dolby Digital Plus is described in ETSI TS 101 154 and ETSI EN 300 468.\n\nDolby Digital Plus is seeing increasing use in digital television systems, particular in cable and satellite systems, as a replacement for Dolby Digital. Many such applications don't take advantage of its higher channel count or ability to support multiple independent programs; instead it is used as a higher-efficiency codec than AC-3.\n\n===HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc===\n{{Main|Comparison of high definition optical disc formats#Technical details}}\nBoth the now-defunct [[HD DVD]] standard, and [[Blu-ray Disc]] include Dolby Digital Plus. It is a mandatory component of HD&nbsp;DVD and an optional component of Blu-ray. The maximum number of discrete coded channels is the same for both formats: 7.1. However, HD&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray impose different technical constraints on the supported audio-codecs. Hence, the usage of DD+ differs substantially between HD&nbsp;DVD and Blu-ray Disc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Dolby Digital (AC-3) and Dolby Digital Plus (E-AC-3) bitrate comparison\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Codec\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\" | HD DVD\n! colspan=3 style=\"text-align:center;\" | Blu-ray Disc\n|-\n!

An HD DVD movie may use DD+ as the primary (or only) audio track. An HD DVD player is required to support DD+ audio by decoding and outputting it to the player's output jacks. As stored on disc, the DD+ bitstream can carry for any number of audio channels up to the maximum allowed, at any bitrate up to 3.0&nbsp;Mbit/s.\n\nOn Blu-ray Disc, DD+ is an optional codec, and is deployed as an extension to a \"core\" AC-3 5.1 audiotrack. The AC-3 core is encoded at 640&nbsp;kbit/s, carries 5 primary channels (and 1 LFE), and is independently playable as a movie audio track by any Blu-ray Disc player. The DD+ extension bitstream is used on players that support it by replacing the rear channels in the 5.1 setup with higher fidelity versions, along with providing a possible channel extension to 6.1 or 7.1. The complete audio track is allowed a combined bitrate of 1.7&nbsp;Mbit/s: 640&nbsp;kbit/s for the AC-3 5.1 core, and 1&nbsp;Mbit/s for the DD+ extension. During playback, both the core and extension bitstreams contribute to the final audio-output, according to rules embedded in the bitstream metadata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/commit/ae9297097696f3d06417a6e8a5368d5f38a6edb4|title=avcodec/eac3: add support for dependent stream \u00b7 FFmpeg/FFmpeg@ae92970|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2019-06-10}}</ref>\n\n===Media players and downmixing===\nGenerally, a Dolby Digital Plus bitstream can only be transported over an HDMI&nbsp;1.3 or greater link. Older receivers support earlier versions of HDMI, or only have support for the [[S/PDIF]] system for digital audio, or analog inputs.\n\nFor non-HDMI&nbsp;1.3 links, the player can decode the audio and then transmit it via a variety of different methods.\n* Earlier versions of HDMI, such as HDMI&nbsp;1.1, support [[PCM audio]], where the player decodes the audio and transmits it losslessly as PCM over HDMI to the receiver.\n* Some receivers and players support analog surround sound, and the player can decode the audio, and transmit it to the receiver as analog audio.\n\nMost receivers and players support S/PDIF. This lower bandwidth digital connection is not capable of transmitting lossless PCM audio with more than two channels, but a player can transmit a S/PDIF compatible audio stream to the receiver in one of the following ways:\n* [[Blu-ray Disc]] players can take advantage of the legacy 5.1 AC-3 bitstream embedded in the E-AC-3 bitstream, transmitting just the AC-3 bitstream with no modifications.\n* Players supporting the [[HD DVD]] standard can transcode the decoded audio into another format. Depending upon the method and options available to the player, this can be done with relatively little quality loss. Dolby's reference decoder, available to all licensees, exploits the common heritage between AC-3 and E-AC-3 by performing the operation in the frequency domain. Hybrid re-compression avoids unnecessary end-to-end decompression and subsequent recompression (E-AC-3 \u2192 LPCM \u2192 AC-3). In addition to AC-3, some HD DVD players transcode audio compatible with S/PDIF into 1.5&nbsp;Mbit/s [[DTS (sound system)|DTS audio]]. While S/PDIF can carry Dolby Digital Plus at lower bitrates, the HD DVD standard specifies a bitrate for DD+ which is too high for a S/PDIF interface to transmit.\n\nShould the player need to decode the audio for a non-HDMI&nbsp;1.3 receiver, the results should be predictable. The DD+ specification explicitly defines [[downmixing]] modes and mechanics, so any source soundfield (up to 14.1) can be reproduced predictably for any listening environment (down to a single channel).\n\n==See also==\n* [[DTS (sound system)#DTS-HD High Resolution Audio|DTS-HD High Resolution Audio]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Dolby Laboratories}}\n{{Compression Software Implementations}}\n\n[[Category:Film sound production]]\n[[Category:Digital audio]]\n[[Category:Audio codecs]]\n[[Category:High-definition television]]\n[[Category:Dolby Laboratories]]\n", "name_user": "Hnapel", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStructure:typo or otherwise it doesn't make sense imo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital_Plus"}

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the [[metre per second]], but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the [[kilometre per hour]] or, in the US and the UK, [[miles per hour]]. For air and marine travel the [[Knot (unit)|knot]] is commonly used.\n\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to [[special relativity]], is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum ''c'' = {{val|299792458}} metres per second (approximately {{val|1079000000|u=km/h}} or {{val|671000000|u=mph}}). [[Matter]] cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of [[rapidity]] replaces the classical idea of speed.\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Historical definition ===\nItalian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\">Hewitt (2006), p. 42</ref> In equation form, that is\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{d}{t},</math>\n\nwhere <math>v</math> is speed, <math>d</math> is distance, and <math>t</math> is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50&nbsp;km/h, slow to 0&nbsp;km/h, and then reach 30&nbsp;km/h).\n\n===Instantaneous speed===\nSpeed at some instant, or assumed constant during a [[infinitesimal|very short]] period of time, is called ''instantaneous speed''. By looking at a [[speedometer]], one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\"/> A car travelling at 50&nbsp;km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50&nbsp;km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25&nbsp;km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833&nbsp;m.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed <math>v</math> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous [[velocity]] <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, that is, the [[derivative]] of the position <math>\\boldsymbol{r}</math> with respect to [[time]]:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=113-01-33|title=IEC 60050 - Details for IEV number 113-01-33: \"speed\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Electropedia: The World's Online Electrotechnical Vocabulary|access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref>\n:<math>v = \\left|\\boldsymbol v\\right| = \\left|\\dot {\\boldsymbol r}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d\\boldsymbol r}{dt}\\right|\\,.</math>\n\nIf <math>s</math> is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time <math>t</math>, the speed equals the time derivative of <math>s</math>:<ref name=\":0\" />\n:<math>v = \\frac{ds}{dt}.</math>\n\nIn the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to <math>v=s/t</math>.  The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.\n\n===Average speed===\n\nDifferent from instantaneous speed, ''average speed'' is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).\n\nAverage speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\" /> If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to\n\n:<math>d = \\boldsymbol{\\bar{v}}t\\,.</math>\n\nUsing this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.\n\nExpressed in graphical language, the [[slope]] of a [[tangent line]] at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a [[chord (geometry)|chord line]] of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord. Average speed of an object is\nVav = s\u00f7t\n\n===Difference between speed and velocity===\nSpeed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas ''velocity'' describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs|year=1901|pages=125|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=149}} This is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector physics.</ref> If a car is said to travel at 60&nbsp;km/h, its ''speed'' has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60&nbsp;km/h to the north, its ''velocity'' has now been specified.\n\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a [[circle]]. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average ''velocity'' is zero, but its average ''speed'' is found by dividing the [[circumference]] of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average ''velocity'' is calculated by considering only the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] between the starting and end points, whereas the average ''speed'' considers only the total [[distance]] travelled.\n\n===Tangential speed===\n{{Classical mechanics|rotational}}\nLinear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while '''tangential speed''' (or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 131\">Hewitt (2006), p. 131</ref> A point on the outside edge of a [[merry-go-round]] or [[turntable]] travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed, and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as ''tangential speed'' because the direction of motion is [[Tangent lines to circles|tangent]] to the [[circumference]] of the circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.\n\n[[Rotational speed]] (or ''angular speed'') involves the number of revolutions per unit of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in terms of the number of \"radians\" turned in a unit of time. There are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2{{pi}} radians exactly). When a direction is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed.\n\nTangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 131\"/> However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero. Towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis.<ref>Hewitt (2006), p. 132</ref> In equation form:\n\n:<math>v \\propto \\!\\, r \\omega\\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''v'' is tangential speed and \u03c9 (Greek letter [[omega]]) is rotational speed. One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for \u03c9), and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value for ''r''). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast. Move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation.\n\nWhen proper units are used for tangential speed ''v'', rotational speed \u03c9, and radial distance ''r'', the direct proportion of ''v'' to both ''r'' and \u03c9 becomes the exact equation\n\n:<math>v = r\\omega\\,.</math>\n\nThus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same \u03c9, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.\n\n==Units==\n{{main|Conversion of units#Speed or velocity}}\nUnits of speed include:\n*[[metres per second]] (symbol m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup> or m/s), the [[SI derived unit]];\n*[[kilometres per hour]] (symbol km/h);\n*[[miles per hour]] (symbol mi/h or mph);\n*[[knot (unit)|knots]] ([[nautical mile]]s per hour, symbol kn or kt);\n*[[Foot per second|feet per second]] (symbol fps or ft/s);\n*[[Mach number]] ([[dimensionless]]), speed divided by the [[speed of sound]];\n*in [[natural units]] (dimensionless), speed divided by the [[speed of light]] in vacuum (symbol ''c'' = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}).\n\n{{Speed conversions}}\n\n==Examples of different speeds==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Orders of magnitude (speed)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of speed is the [[metre per second]], but the most common unit of speed in everyday usage is the [[kilometre per hour]] or, in the US and the UK, [[miles per hour]]. For air and marine travel the [[Knot (unit)|knot]] is commonly used.\n\nThe fastest possible speed at which energy or information can travel, according to [[special relativity]], is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum ''c'' = {{val|299792458}} metres per second (approximately {{val|1079000000|u=km/h}} or {{val|671000000|u=mph}}). [[Matter]] cannot quite reach the speed of light, as this would require an infinite amount of energy. In relativity physics, the concept of [[rapidity]] replaces the classical idea of speed.\n\n==Definition==\n\n=== Historical definition ===\nItalian physicist [[Galileo Galilei]] is usually credited with being the first to measure speed by considering the distance covered and the time it takes. Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\">Hewitt (2006), p. 42</ref> In equation form, that is\n\n:<math>v = \\frac{d}{t},</math>\n\nwhere <math>v</math> is speed, <math>d</math> is distance, and <math>t</math> is time. A cyclist who covers 30 metres in a time of 2 seconds, for example, has a speed of 15 metres per second. Objects in motion often have variations in speed (a car might travel along a street at 50&nbsp;km/h, slow to 0&nbsp;km/h, and then reach 30&nbsp;km/h).\n\n===Instantaneous speed===\nSpeed at some instant, or assumed constant during a [[infinitesimal|very short]] period of time, is called ''instantaneous speed''. By looking at a [[speedometer]], one can read the instantaneous speed of a car at any instant.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\"/> A car travelling at 50&nbsp;km/h generally goes for less than one hour at a constant speed, but if it did go at that speed for a full hour, it would travel 50&nbsp;km. If the vehicle continued at that speed for half an hour, it would cover half that distance (25&nbsp;km). If it continued for only one minute, it would cover about 833&nbsp;m.\n\nIn mathematical terms, the instantaneous speed <math>v</math> is defined as the magnitude of the instantaneous [[velocity]] <math>\\boldsymbol{v}</math>, that is, the [[derivative]] of the position <math>\\boldsymbol{r}</math> with respect to [[time]]:<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/display?openform&ievref=113-01-33|title=IEC 60050 - Details for IEV number 113-01-33: \"speed\"|last=|first=|date=|website=Electropedia: The World's Online Electrotechnical Vocabulary|access-date=2017-06-08}}</ref>\n:<math>v = \\left|\\boldsymbol v\\right| = \\left|\\dot {\\boldsymbol r}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{d\\boldsymbol r}{dt}\\right|\\,.</math>\n\nIf <math>s</math> is the length of the path (also known as the distance) travelled until time <math>t</math>, the speed equals the time derivative of <math>s</math>:<ref name=\":0\" />\n:<math>v = \\frac{ds}{dt}.</math>\n\nIn the special case where the velocity is constant (that is, constant speed in a straight line), this can be simplified to <math>v=s/t</math>.  The average speed over a finite time interval is the total distance travelled divided by the time duration.\n\n===Average speed===\n\nDifferent from instantaneous speed, ''average speed'' is defined as the total distance covered divided by the time interval. For example, if a distance of 80 kilometres is driven in 1 hour, the average speed is 80 kilometres per hour. Likewise, if 320 kilometres are travelled in 4 hours, the average speed is also 80 kilometres per hour. When a distance in kilometres (km) is divided by a time in hours (h), the result is in kilometres per hour (km/h).\n\nAverage speed does not describe the speed variations that may have taken place during shorter time intervals (as it is the entire distance covered divided by the total time of travel), and so average speed is often quite different from a value of instantaneous speed.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 42\" /> If the average speed and the time of travel are known, the distance travelled can be calculated by rearranging the definition to\n\n:<math>d = \\boldsymbol{\\bar{v}}t\\,.</math>\n\nUsing this equation for an average speed of 80 kilometres per hour on a 4-hour trip, the distance covered is found to be 320 kilometres.\n\nExpressed in graphical language, the [[slope]] of a [[tangent line]] at any point of a distance-time graph is the instantaneous speed at this point, while the slope of a [[chord (geometry)|chord line]] of the same graph is the average speed during the time interval covered by the chord. Average speed of an object is\nVav = s\u00f7t\n\n===Difference between speed and velocity===\nSpeed denotes only how fast an object is moving, whereas ''velocity'' describes both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edwin Bidwell|title=Vector analysis: a text-book for the use of students of mathematics and physics, founded upon the lectures of J. Willard Gibbs|year=1901|pages=125|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015000962285?urlappend=%3Bseq=149}} This is the likely origin of the speed/velocity terminology in vector physics.</ref> If a car is said to travel at 60&nbsp;km/h, its ''speed'' has been specified. However, if the car is said to move at 60&nbsp;km/h to the north, its ''velocity'' has now been specified.\n\nThe big difference can be discerned when considering movement around a [[circle]]. When something moves in a circular path and returns to its starting point, its average ''velocity'' is zero, but its average ''speed'' is found by dividing the [[circumference]] of the circle by the time taken to move around the circle. This is because the average ''velocity'' is calculated by considering only the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] between the starting and end points, whereas the average ''speed'' considers only the total [[distance]] travelled.\n\n===Tangential speed===\n{{Classical mechanics|rotational}}\nLinear speed is the distance travelled per unit of time, while '''tangential speed''' (or tangential velocity) is the linear speed of something moving along a circular path.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 131\">Hewitt (2006), p. 131</ref> A point on the outside edge of a [[merry-go-round]] or [[turntable]] travels a greater distance in one complete rotation than a point nearer the center. Travelling a greater distance in the same time means a greater speed, and so linear speed is greater on the outer edge of a rotating object than it is closer to the axis. This speed along a circular path is known as ''tangential speed'' because the direction of motion is [[Tangent lines to circles|tangent]] to the [[circumference]] of the circle. For circular motion, the terms linear speed and tangential speed are used interchangeably, and both use units of m/s, km/h, and others.\n\n[[Rotational speed]] (or ''angular speed'') involves the number of revolutions per unit of time. All parts of a rigid merry-go-round or turntable turn about the axis of rotation in the same amount of time. Thus, all parts share the same rate of rotation, or the same number of rotations or revolutions per unit of time. It is common to express rotational rates in revolutions per minute (RPM) or in terms of the number of \"radians\" turned in a unit of time. There are little more than 6 radians in a full rotation (2{{pi}} radians exactly). When a direction is assigned to rotational speed, it is known as rotational velocity or angular velocity. Rotational velocity is a vector whose magnitude is the rotational speed.\n\nTangential speed and rotational speed are related: the greater the RPMs, the larger the speed in metres per second. Tangential speed is directly proportional to rotational speed at any fixed distance from the axis of rotation.<ref name=\"Hewitt 2006, p. 131\"/> However, tangential speed, unlike rotational speed, depends on radial distance (the distance from the axis). For a platform rotating with a fixed rotational speed, the tangential speed in the centre is zero. Towards the edge of the platform the tangential speed increases proportional to the distance from the axis.<ref>Hewitt (2006), p. 132</ref> In equation form:\n\n:<math>v \\propto \\!\\, r \\omega\\,,</math>\n\nwhere ''v'' is tangential speed and \u03c9 (Greek letter [[omega]]) is rotational speed. One moves faster if the rate of rotation increases (a larger value for \u03c9), and one also moves faster if movement farther from the axis occurs (a larger value for ''r''). Move twice as far from the rotational axis at the centre and you move twice as fast. Move out three times as far and you have three times as much tangential speed. In any kind of rotating system, tangential speed depends on how far you are from the axis of rotation.\n\nWhen proper units are used for tangential speed ''v'', rotational speed \u03c9, and radial distance ''r'', the direct proportion of ''v'' to both ''r'' and \u03c9 becomes the exact equation\n\n:<math>v = r\\omega\\,.</math>\n\nThus, tangential speed will be directly proportional to ''r'' when all parts of a system simultaneously have the same \u03c9, as for a wheel, disk, or rigid wand.\n\n==Units==\n{{main|Conversion of units#Speed or velocity}}\nUnits of speed include:\n*[[metres per second]] (symbol m&nbsp;s<sup>\u22121</sup> or m/s), the [[SI derived unit]];\n*[[kilometres per hour]] (symbol km/h);\n*[[miles per hour]] (symbol mi/h or mph);\n*[[knot (unit)|knots]] ([[nautical mile]]s per hour, symbol kn or kt);\n*[[Foot per second|feet per second]] (symbol fps or ft/s);\n*[[Mach number]] ([[dimensionless]]), speed divided by the [[speed of sound]];\n*in [[natural units]] (dimensionless), speed divided by the [[speed of light]] in vacuum (symbol ''c'' = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}).\n\n{{Speed conversions}}\n\n==Examples of different speeds==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2013}}\n{{example farm|section|date=May 2014}}\n{{Main|Orders of magnitude (speed)}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
