Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut.

Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives.

Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

In the 19th century, oystering boomed in New Haven, Bridgeport, and Norwalk and achieved modest success in neighboring towns.

Before then, [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and Hartford alternated as capitals.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Constitutional history===\n\n{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}\n\nConnecticut is known as the \"Constitution State\". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

A local Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1921. In 1922, discovery of oil by wildcatter A. E. Humphreys dramatically transformed Kosse into a temporary oil boom town with thousands of new residents.  However, the numerous wells drilled around Kosse did not turn out to be producers, and Kosse's oil boom came to a rapid close early in 1923.\n\nThe [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] severely impacted Kosse as businesses closed and people left in search of greater employment opportunities.

On 12 June 1514, Cochin and Goa became two prominent mission stations under the newly created [[Diocese of Funchal]] in [[Madeira]]. In 1534, [[Pope Paul III]] by the Bull Quequem Reputamus, raised Funchal as an [[archdiocese]] and [[Archdiocese of Goa|Goa]] as its [[suffragan]], deputing the whole of India under the [[diocese of Goa]]. This created an [[episcopal see]]&nbsp;\u2013 [[suffragan]] to [[Diocese of Funchal|Funchal]], with a jurisdiction extending potentially over all past and future conquests from the [[Cape of Good Hope]] to China.\n\nAfter four decades of prosperous trading, the missionaries started the proselytisation around 1540 and during this period, foreign missionaries also made many new converts to Christianity. Early Roman Catholic missionaries, particularly the Portuguese, led by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Saint|St]] [[Francis Xavier]] (1506\u20131552), expanded from their bases on the west coast making many converts. The Portuguese colonial government supported the mission. At the same time many [[New Christian]]s from Portugal migrated to India as a result of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|inquisition in Portugal]]. Many of them were suspected of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s, converted Jews who were secretly practising their old religion.

The whole of the East came under the jurisdiction of [[Archdiocese of Goa|Goa]] and its boundaries extended to almost half of the world: from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to Burma, China and Japan in East Asia. In 1576, the suffragan See of Macao (China) was added; and in 1588, that of Funai in Japan.\n\nThe death of the last [[metropolitan bishop]]&nbsp;\u2013 Archbishop Abraham of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]], an ancient body formerly part of the [[Church of the East]]{{sfn|Frykenberg|2013|p=93}}<ref>Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 343</ref> in 1597; gave the then Archbishop of Goa [[Aleixo de Menezes|Menezes]] an opportunity to bring the native church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. He was able to secure the submission of [[Archdeacon George]], the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]] between 20 and 26 June 1599,<ref name=\"synod\">[http://www.synodofdiamper.com/synod.php Synod of Diamper] on Synod of Diamper Church website.</ref> which introduced a number of reforms to the church and brought it fully into the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church. Following the Synod, Menezes consecrated Francis Ros, S. J. as Archbishop of the [[Diocese of Angamaly|Archdiocese of Angamal\u00e9]] for the Saint Thomas Christians; thus created another suffragan see to Archdiocese of Goa and [[Latin]]isation of St Thomas Christians started. The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] were pressured to acknowledge the authority of the Pope and most of them eventually accepted the Catholic faith, but a part of them switched to [[West Syriac Rite]].<ref name=\"synod\" /> Resentment of these measures led to some part of the community to join the [[Archdeacon]], [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], in swearing never to submit to the Portuguese or to accept the Communion with Rome in the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653. Those who accepted the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] theological and liturgical tradition of Mar Gregorios became known as [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobites]]. The ones who continued with  Latin theological and liturgy tradition and stayed faithful to the Synod of Diamper later Roman Catholic Syrian Christians accept East Syriac (in1896) liturgy.\n\nThe [[Diocese of Angamaly]] was transferred to Diocese of Craganore in 1605; while, in 1606 a sixth suffragan see to Goa was established at San Thome, Mylapore, near the modern Madras, and the site of the National Shrine of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] Basilica. The suffragan sees added later to Goa. were the prelacy of Mozambique (1612) and in 1690 two other sees at Peking and Nanking in China.\n\n[[Mangalore]] is another significant region on the west coast which has a huge Christian population. In 1321, the French Dominican friar [[Jordanus]] Catalani of Severac (in south-western France), who also worked in [[Quilon]] arrived in [[Bhatkal]], a place near Mangalore and established a missionary station there. Many locals were converted to Christianity by [[Jordanus]].<ref name=\"JOR\" /> The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] were however unable to establish their presence in Mangalore as a result of the conquests of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] ruler [[Krishnadevaraya]] and [[Abbakka Rani]] of [[Ullal]], the Bednore Queen of Mangalore. Most of [[Mangalorean Catholics]] were not originally from [[Mangalore]] but are descendants of [[Goan Catholics]] who fled [[Goa]] during the Portuguese-Maratha Wars and the [[Goan Inquisition]].\n\nThe origin of Christianity in North Konkan, was due to the proselytising activities of the Portuguese in the 16th century.

It extended to the Krishna river, with a number of outlying stations beyond it. The mission of Cochin, on the Malabar Coast, was also one of the most fruitful. Several missions were also established in the interior northwards, e.g., that of Agra and Lahore in 1570 and that of Tibet in 1624. Still, even with these efforts, the greater part even of the coast line was by no means fully worked, and many vast tracts of the interior northwards were practically untouched.\n\nWith the decline of the Portuguese power, other colonial powers&nbsp;\u2013 namely the Dutch and British and Christian organisations gained influence.\n\n=== Syrian Christians in India ===\n{{See also|Saint Thomas Christians}}\n[[Thomas the Apostle]] is credited by tradition for founding the Indian Church in 52 AD.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=285}}<ref>N.M.Mathew.

When the Portuguese established themselves in India in the 16th century, they found the Church in Kerala as an administratively independent community. Following the arrival of Vasco de Gama in 1498, the Portuguese came to South India and established their political power there. They brought missionaries to carry out evangelistic work in order to establish churches in communion with Rome [[under the Portuguese patronage]]. These missionaries were eager to bring the Indian Church under the Pope's control. They succeeded in their efforts in 1599 with the [[Synod of Diamper]]. The representatives of various parishes who attended the assembly were forced by Portuguese authorities to accept the Papal authority.\n\nFollowing the synod, the Indian Church was governed by Portuguese prelates. They were generally unwilling to respect the integrity of the local church. This resulted in disaffection which led to a general revolt in 1653 known as the \"[[Coonan Cross Oath]]\". Under the leadership of their elder Thomas, Nazranis around Cochin gathered at Mattancherry church on Friday, 24 January 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3) and made an oath that is known as the Great Oath of Bent Cross. The following oath was read aloud and the people touching a stone-cross repeated it loudly: \"By the Father, Son and Holy Spirit that henceforth we would not adhere to the Franks, nor accept the faith of the Pope of Rome.\"<ref>The Missionary Register for M DCCC XXII.

Those who were not able to touch the cross tied ropes on the cross, held the rope in their hands and made the oath. Because of the weight it is believed by the followers that the cross bent a little and so it is known as \"Oath of the bent cross\" (Coonen Kurisu Sathyam). This demanded administrative autonomy for the local church. Since it had no bishop, it faced serious difficulties. It appealed to several eastern Christian churches for help. The Antiochene Syrian Patriarch responded and sent metropolitan Mar Gregorios of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] to India in 1665. He confirmed Marthoma I as the bishop and worked together with him to organize the Church.When these churches is also the part of [[Oriental Orthodox]], which is also known as [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Malankara Orthodox Church]]\n\n=== Arrival of Protestant missions ===\nBeginning about 1700 Protestant missionaries began working throughout India, leading to the establishment of different Christian communities across the Indian Subcontinent.\n\n===Lutherans===\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata|St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta]] - seat of the Anglican Diocese of Calcutta, Church of North India]]\nThe first Protestant missionaries to set foot in India were two [[Lutherans]] from Germany, [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg|Bartholom\u00e4us Ziegenbalg]] and [[Heinrich Pl\u00fctschau]], who began work in 1705 in the Danish settlement of Tranquebar.

He translated the Bible into Bengali, Sanskrit, and numerous other languages and dialects.  He worked in India despite the hostility of the British East India Company until his death in 1834. Carey and his colleagues, Joshua Marshman and William Ward, blended science, Christianity, and constructive Orientalism in their work at the Danish settlement of Serampore, near Calcutta. Carey saw the dissemination of European science and Christianity as mutually supportive and equally important civilizing missions. He also supported a revival of Sanskrit science.

The church experienced sporadic growth and instability in South India due to corruption among church ministers, lack of funds for outreach, and lack of identity formation and commitment to the church among new members. Since 1998, more capable and committed leadership has been in place, which has led the church to expand with congregations in Uthamapalayam, Chennai, and Madurai all in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Community of Christ in India|last=Howlett|first=David|publisher=Community of Christ|year=2015|isbn=|location=Independence, MO|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn Odisha, the Community of Christ has experienced significant growth since the first members were baptized in November 1965. The American leadership of the church including Apostle Charles D. Neff believed that the gospel of Jesus Christ had to be indigenized in its own way by Indians, just as Americans had done with Christianity themselves. In this way, the church focused its teachings on physical and spiritual healing and well-being with the goal of improving people's lives here and now. In particular, the church has found success among the Sora people, oftentimes with whole villages converting to Christianity. The church has also found success among the Kui people many of whom had no contact with Christianity previously. As of 2015, there are 5,700 baptized members and 7,000 more people who identify as Christians who attend 102 Community of Christ congregations in Odisha.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the church began to be established in Andhra Pradesh. A sewing center has been built to teach local community members basic skills with both Hindus and Christians invited to attend classes.  Unlike in Odisha, most converts have been single individuals and not whole communities. The majority of these converts are women and many regular members have not officially joined due to family concerns but still actively participate. By 2015, there were 25 congregations in Andhra Pradesh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Community of Christ recently celebrated their 50th anniversary of being established in India with a conference that included a gathering of 14,000 people and a visit by Community of Christ's Prophet/President [[Stephen M.

The advent of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the English has had a great deal of influence on the art and architecture of the church in [[Kerala]].<ref name=\"thinkers.net\" /> The description of the visits of a Portuguese Archbishop Dom Menezes to various churches before the arrival of western powers in [[India]] throws some light on the structures and arrangements of the churches before western elements and types were introduced into [[Kerala]]. There were three striking objects of significance in front of the typical [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] churches, either inside the courtyard or just outside it:\n* The open-air granite (rock) cross called the Nasrani Sthamba\n* ''Kodimaram'' (''Dwajasthamba'') or flag-staff made of [[Kerala]]'s famed teak wood and often enclosed in copper hoses or paras\n* The rock ''Deepasthamba'' or lampstand.<ref name=\"scribd.com\" />\n\nThe ornate monumentality of the European churches was introduced to [[India]] when parts of [[Malabar Coast]] came under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese in the 16th century. They introduced the Romano-Portuguese style, which was assimilated with such artistic and structural finesse by the artists of [[Kerala]], that it created some of the finest pieces of artistry. This laid the foundations for Indian [[Baroque]].<ref name=\"scribd.com\" /> After the arrival of [[Vasco da Gama]] and more especially after the commencement of Portuguese rule in India, distinct patterns of Christian art developed within the areas of Portuguese influence, mostly along the coasts of the peninsula. The Portuguese were great builders and promoted architecture more than any other form of fine art. [[St. Francis Church, Kochi]] is the first European place of worship in India and incidentally also the place where [[Vasco da Gama]] was first buried. The Christian art of Goa reached its climax in church building.<ref name=\"scribd.com\" />\n\nIndian Christian art and architecture during the [[British Raj]] has expanded into several different styles as a result of extensive church building in different parts of the country. The style that was most patronised is generally referred to as the [[British Regency]] style which included [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]].<ref>Singh et al 2007, p. 69.</ref> Most Protestant cathedrals and churches in India conform to this style.

Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tippu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, areca nut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tippu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Maculay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.{{sfn|Bernard|1995|p=79}}\n\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|right|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]His persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of [[forced conversion]]s of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref name=\"Dalrymple1\">{{harvnb|Dalrymple |2009|pp=28|ref=Dalrymple}}</ref> During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics.

The apostle's ministry reputedly resulted in many conversions throughout this northern kingdom, including the king and his brother.<ref name=\"AFM\" /> The ''Acts of Thomas'' identifies his second mission in India with a kingdom ruled by King Mahadwa, one of the rulers of a 1st-century dynasty in southern India.

On 12 June 1514, Cochin and Goa became two prominent mission stations under the newly created [[Diocese of Funchal]] in [[Madeira]]. In 1534, [[Pope Paul III]] by the Bull Quequem Reputamus, raised Funchal as an [[archdiocese]] and [[Archdiocese of Goa|Goa]] as its [[suffragan]], deputing the whole of India under the [[diocese of Goa]].

Early Roman Catholic missionaries, particularly the Portuguese, led by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Saint|St]] [[Francis Xavier]] (1506\u20131552), expanded from their bases on the west coast making many converts. The Portuguese colonial government supported the mission. At the same time many [[New Christian]]s from Portugal migrated to India as a result of the [[Portuguese Inquisition|inquisition in Portugal]]. Many of them were suspected of being [[Crypto-Jew]]s, converted Jews who were secretly practising their old religion.

The whole of the East came under the jurisdiction of [[Archdiocese of Goa|Goa]] and its boundaries extended to almost half of the world: from the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to Burma, China and Japan in East Asia. In 1576, the suffragan See of Macao (China) was added; and in 1588, that of Funai in Japan.\n\nThe death of the last [[metropolitan bishop]]&nbsp;\u2013 Archbishop Abraham of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]], an ancient body formerly part of the [[Church of the East]]{{sfn|Frykenberg|2013|p=93}}<ref>Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 343</ref> in 1597; gave the then Archbishop of Goa [[Aleixo de Menezes|Menezes]] an opportunity to bring the native church under the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. He was able to secure the submission of [[Archdeacon George]], the highest remaining representative of the native church hierarchy. Menezes convened the [[Synod of Diamper]] between 20 and 26 June 1599,<ref name=\"synod\">[http://www.synodofdiamper.com/synod.php Synod of Diamper] on Synod of Diamper Church website.</ref> which introduced a number of reforms to the church and brought it fully into the [[Latin Rite]] of the Catholic Church. Following the Synod, Menezes consecrated Francis Ros, S. J. as Archbishop of the [[Diocese of Angamaly|Archdiocese of Angamal\u00e9]] for the Saint Thomas Christians; thus created another suffragan see to Archdiocese of Goa and [[Latin]]isation of St Thomas Christians started. The [[Saint Thomas Christians]] were pressured to acknowledge the authority of the Pope and most of them eventually accepted the Catholic faith, but a part of them switched to [[West Syriac Rite]].<ref name=\"synod\" /> Resentment of these measures led to some part of the community to join the [[Archdeacon]], [[Mar Thoma I|Thomas]], in swearing never to submit to the Portuguese or to accept the Communion with Rome in the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653. Those who accepted the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] theological and liturgical tradition of Mar Gregorios became known as [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church|Jacobites]]. The ones who continued with  Latin theological and liturgy tradition and stayed faithful to the Synod of Diamper later Roman Catholic Syrian Christians accept East Syriac (in1896) liturgy.\n\nThe [[Diocese of Angamaly]] was transferred to Diocese of Craganore in 1605; while, in 1606 a sixth suffragan see to Goa was established at San Thome, Mylapore, near the modern Madras, and the site of the National Shrine of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] Basilica. The suffragan sees added later to Goa. were the prelacy of Mozambique (1612) and in 1690 two other sees at Peking and Nanking in China.\n\n[[Mangalore]] is another significant region on the west coast which has a huge Christian population. In 1321, the French Dominican friar [[Jordanus]] Catalani of Severac (in south-western France), who also worked in [[Quilon]] arrived in [[Bhatkal]], a place near Mangalore and established a missionary station there. Many locals were converted to Christianity by [[Jordanus]].<ref name=\"JOR\" /> The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] were however unable to establish their presence in Mangalore as a result of the conquests of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] ruler [[Krishnadevaraya]] and [[Abbakka Rani]] of [[Ullal]], the Bednore Queen of Mangalore. Most of [[Mangalorean Catholics]] were not originally from [[Mangalore]] but are descendants of [[Goan Catholics]] who fled [[Goa]] during the Portuguese-Maratha Wars and the [[Goan Inquisition]].\n\nThe origin of Christianity in North Konkan, was due to the proselytising activities of the Portuguese in the 16th century. The French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac (in south-western France) started evangelising activities in [[Thane|Thana]].<ref>[http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/pdf/gazeetter_reprint/Thane-I/population_christians.html#2 Gazetteers Of The Bombay Presidency&nbsp;\u2013 Thana]</ref> On the occasion of ''The Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria'', the Christians of North [[Konkan]], in [[Maharashtra]] who were known as ''Portuguese Christians'' discarded that name and adopted the designation ''[[Indian people|East Indians]]''.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.east-indians.com/history.pdf |title='''East Indians''' (the indigenous Catholic inhabitants of Bombay, Salsette and Bassein) |accessdate=2 March 2008 |publisher=The East Indian Community}}</ref> [[Marathi Christians]] are Protestants and are therefore distinct from [[India|East Indian]] Christians who are predominantly Roman Catholics and inhabitants of the North Konkan region.

It extended to the Krishna river, with a number of outlying stations beyond it. The mission of Cochin, on the Malabar Coast, was also one of the most fruitful. Several missions were also established in the interior northwards, e.g., that of Agra and Lahore in 1570 and that of Tibet in 1624. Still, even with these efforts, the greater part even of the coast line was by no means fully worked, and many vast tracts of the interior northwards were practically untouched.\n\nWith the decline of the Portuguese power, other colonial powers&nbsp;\u2013 namely the Dutch and British and Christian organisations gained influence.\n\n=== Syrian Christians in India ===\n{{See also|Saint Thomas Christians}}\n[[Thomas the Apostle]] is credited by tradition for founding the Indian Church in 52 AD.{{sfn|Fahlbusch|2008|p=285}}<ref>N.M.Mathew.

When the Portuguese established themselves in India in the 16th century, they found the Church in Kerala as an administratively independent community. Following the arrival of Vasco de Gama in 1498, the Portuguese came to South India and established their political power there. They brought missionaries to carry out evangelistic work in order to establish churches in communion with Rome [[under the Portuguese patronage]]. These missionaries were eager to bring the Indian Church under the Pope's control. They succeeded in their efforts in 1599 with the [[Synod of Diamper]]. The representatives of various parishes who attended the assembly were forced by Portuguese authorities to accept the Papal authority.\n\nFollowing the synod, the Indian Church was governed by Portuguese prelates. They were generally unwilling to respect the integrity of the local church. This resulted in disaffection which led to a general revolt in 1653 known as the \"[[Coonan Cross Oath]]\". Under the leadership of their elder Thomas, Nazranis around Cochin gathered at Mattancherry church on Friday, 24 January 1653 (M.E. 828 Makaram 3) and made an oath that is known as the Great Oath of Bent Cross. The following oath was read aloud and the people touching a stone-cross repeated it loudly: \"By the Father, Son and Holy Spirit that henceforth we would not adhere to the Franks, nor accept the faith of the Pope of Rome.\"<ref>The Missionary Register for M DCCC XXII.

Those who were not able to touch the cross tied ropes on the cross, held the rope in their hands and made the oath. Because of the weight it is believed by the followers that the cross bent a little and so it is known as \"Oath of the bent cross\" (Coonen Kurisu Sathyam). This demanded administrative autonomy for the local church. Since it had no bishop, it faced serious difficulties. It appealed to several eastern Christian churches for help. The Antiochene Syrian Patriarch responded and sent metropolitan Mar Gregorios of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]] to India in 1665. He confirmed Marthoma I as the bishop and worked together with him to organize the Church.When these churches is also the part of [[Oriental Orthodox]], which is also known as [[Jacobite Syrian Christian Church]] and [[Malankara Orthodox Church]]\n\n=== Arrival of Protestant missions ===\nBeginning about 1700 Protestant missionaries began working throughout India, leading to the establishment of different Christian communities across the Indian Subcontinent.\n\n===Lutherans===\n[[File:St Paul's Cathedral.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata|St. Paul's Cathedral, Calcutta]] - seat of the Anglican Diocese of Calcutta, Church of North India]]\nThe first Protestant missionaries to set foot in India were two [[Lutherans]] from Germany, [[Bartholomaeus Ziegenbalg|Bartholom\u00e4us Ziegenbalg]] and [[Heinrich Pl\u00fctschau]], who began work in 1705 in the Danish settlement of Tranquebar.

Carey saw the dissemination of European science and Christianity as mutually supportive and equally important civilizing missions. He also supported a revival of Sanskrit science. Carey played a key role in the establishment of the Agricultural Society of India. Ward, beginning in 1806, published important commentaries on ancient Hindu medical and astronomy texts.

The church experienced sporadic growth and instability in South India due to corruption among church ministers, lack of funds for outreach, and lack of identity formation and commitment to the church among new members. Since 1998, more capable and committed leadership has been in place, which has led the church to expand with congregations in Uthamapalayam, Chennai, and Madurai all in Tamil Nadu.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Community of Christ in India|last=Howlett|first=David|publisher=Community of Christ|year=2015|isbn=|location=Independence, MO|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn Odisha, the Community of Christ has experienced significant growth since the first members were baptized in November 1965. The American leadership of the church including Apostle Charles D. Neff believed that the gospel of Jesus Christ had to be indigenized in its own way by Indians, just as Americans had done with Christianity themselves. In this way, the church focused its teachings on physical and spiritual healing and well-being with the goal of improving people's lives here and now. In particular, the church has found success among the Sora people, oftentimes with whole villages converting to Christianity. The church has also found success among the Kui people many of whom had no contact with Christianity previously. As of 2015, there are 5,700 baptized members and 7,000 more people who identify as Christians who attend 102 Community of Christ congregations in Odisha.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy the 1970s, the church began to be established in Andhra Pradesh. A sewing center has been built to teach local community members basic skills with both Hindus and Christians invited to attend classes.  Unlike in Odisha, most converts have been single individuals and not whole communities. The majority of these converts are women and many regular members have not officially joined due to family concerns but still actively participate. By 2015, there were 25 congregations in Andhra Pradesh.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Community of Christ recently celebrated their 50th anniversary of being established in India with a conference that included a gathering of 14,000 people and a visit by Community of Christ's Prophet/President [[Stephen M.

The advent of the Portuguese, the Dutch, the French, and the English has had a great deal of influence on the art and architecture of the church in [[Kerala]].<ref name=\"thinkers.net\" /> The description of the visits of a Portuguese Archbishop Dom Menezes to various churches before the arrival of western powers in [[India]] throws some light on the structures and arrangements of the churches before western elements and types were introduced into [[Kerala]]. There were three striking objects of significance in front of the typical [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] churches, either inside the courtyard or just outside it:\n* The open-air granite (rock) cross called the Nasrani Sthamba\n* ''Kodimaram'' (''Dwajasthamba'') or flag-staff made of [[Kerala]]'s famed teak wood and often enclosed in copper hoses or paras\n* The rock ''Deepasthamba'' or lampstand.<ref name=\"scribd.com\" />\n\nThe ornate monumentality of the European churches was introduced to [[India]] when parts of [[Malabar Coast]] came under the jurisdiction of the Portuguese in the 16th century. They introduced the Romano-Portuguese style, which was assimilated with such artistic and structural finesse by the artists of [[Kerala]], that it created some of the finest pieces of artistry. This laid the foundations for Indian [[Baroque]].<ref name=\"scribd.com\" /> After the arrival of [[Vasco da Gama]] and more especially after the commencement of Portuguese rule in India, distinct patterns of Christian art developed within the areas of Portuguese influence, mostly along the coasts of the peninsula. The Portuguese were great builders and promoted architecture more than any other form of fine art. [[St. Francis Church, Kochi]] is the first European place of worship in India and incidentally also the place where [[Vasco da Gama]] was first buried. The Christian art of Goa reached its climax in church building.<ref name=\"scribd.com\" />\n\nIndian Christian art and architecture during the [[British Raj]] has expanded into several different styles as a result of extensive church building in different parts of the country. The style that was most patronised is generally referred to as the [[British Regency]] style which included [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture]].<ref>Singh et al 2007, p. 69.</ref> Most Protestant cathedrals and churches in India conform to this style.

Many churches in the [[Malabar (Northern Kerala)|Malabar]] and [[Cochin]] were damaged. The old Syrian Nasrani seminary at Angamaly which had been the center of Catholic religious education for several centuries was razed to the ground by Tippu's soldiers. A lot of centuries old religious manuscripts were lost forever. The church was later relocated to Kottayam where it still exists to this date. The Mor Sabor church at Akaparambu and the Martha Mariam Church attached to the seminary were destroyed as well. Tipu's army set fire to the church at Palayoor and attacked the Ollur Church in 1790. Furthernmore, the Arthat church and the Ambazhakkad seminary was also destroyed. Over the course of this invasion, many Saint Thomas Christians were killed or forcibly converted to Islam. Most of the coconut, areca nut, pepper and cashew plantations held by the Saint Thomas Christian farmers were also indiscriminately destroyed by the invading army. As a result, when Tippu's army invaded Guruvayur and adjacent areas, the Syrian Christian community fled Calicut and small towns like Arthat to new centres like Kunnamkulam, Chalakudi, Ennakadu, Cheppadu, Kannankode, [[Mavelikkara]], etc. where there were already Christians. They were given refuge by Sakthan Tamburan, the ruler of Cochin and Karthika Thirunal, the ruler of Travancore, who gave them lands, plantations and encouraged their businesses. Colonel Maculay, the British resident of Travancore also helped them.{{sfn|Bernard|1995|p=79}}\n\n[[File:James Scurry.jpg|thumb|right|The British officer [[James Scurry]], who was detained a prisoner for 10 years by Tipu Sultan along with the Mangalorean Catholics]]His persecution of Christians also extended to captured British soldiers. For instance, there were a significant amount of [[forced conversion]]s of British captives between 1780 and 1784. Following their disastrous defeat at the [[battle of Pollilur]], 7,000 British men along with an unknown number of women were held captive by Tipu in the fortress of Seringapatnam. Of these, over 300 were circumcised and given Muslim names and clothes and several British regimental drummer boys were made to wear ''[[ghagra cholis]]'' and entertain the court as ''nautch'' girls or dancing girls. After the 10-year-long captivity ended, James Scurry, one of those prisoners, recounted that he had forgotten how to sit in a chair and use a knife and fork. His English was broken and stilted, having lost all his vernacular idiom. His skin had darkened to the swarthy complexion of [[negro]]es, and moreover, he had developed an aversion to wearing European clothes.<ref name=\"Dalrymple1\">{{harvnb|Dalrymple |2009|pp=28|ref=Dalrymple}}</ref> During the surrender of the Mangalore fort which was delivered in an armistice by the British and their subsequent withdrawal, all the [[Mestizos]] and remaining non-British foreigners were killed, together with 5,600 Mangalorean Catholics.

{"title_page": "Dosage compensation", "text_new": "'''Dosage compensation''' is the process by which organisms equalize the expression of genes between members of different biological sexes. Across species, different [[sexes]] are often characterized by different types and numbers of [[sex chromosome]]s. In order to neutralize the large difference in [[gene dosage]] produced by differing numbers of sex chromosomes among the sexes, various [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary branches]] have acquired various methods to equalize [[gene expression]] among the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of [[genes]], different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual ''gene'' is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the ''expression'' from each gene. For example, in [[humans]], females (XX) silence the transcription of one [[X chromosome]] of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.<ref name= \"Brockdorff\">{{cite journal | last1 = Brockdorff |first1=N.|last2= Turner |first2=B.M. | year = 2015 | title = Dosage compensation in mammals | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = a019406 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a019406|pmc=4355265 | pmid=25731764}}</ref>\n\nThere are three main mechanisms of achieving dosage compensation which are widely documented in the literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Mus musculus]]''; this is called [[X-inactivation]]), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory research setting. A summary of these forms of dosage compensation is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of dosage compensation, which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and [[monotreme]] species).\n\n[[File:Summary of dosage compensation.png|thumb|Three main mechanisms of dosage compensation observed in common model eukaryotic organisms.]]\n\n== Random inactivation of one \u2640 X ==\n\nOne logical way to equalize gene expression amongst males and females that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression of one of the X chromosomes in an XX, or female, [[homogametic]] individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice.<ref name=\"Brockdorff\"/>\n\nThe evidence for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists\u2019 understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, [[Murray Barr]] and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of \u201cnucleolar satellites,<ref name= \"Barr\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barr |first1=M.L.|author-link1=Murray Barr|last2=Bertram |first2= E.G. | year = 1949 | title = A morphological distinction between [[neurones]] of the male and female, and the behaviour of the nucleolar satellite during accelerated nucleoprotein synthesis | journal = Nature | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 676\u2013677 | doi=10.1038/163676a0 | pmid=18120749}}</ref> which they observed were present in the mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed [[heterochromatin]], but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.\n\nThen, in 1959 [[Susumu Ohno]] proved that these satellite-like structures found exclusively in female cells were actually derived from female X chromosomes.<ref name= \"Ohno\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ohno|first1= Susumu|author-link1=Susumu Ohno | year = 1959 | title = Sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes | journal = Teratology | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 111 | doi = 10.1002/tera.1420040116 }}</ref> He called these structures [[Barr bodies]] after one of the investigators who originally documented their existence. Ohno\u2019s studies of Barr bodies in female mammals with multiple X chromosomes revealed that such females used Barr bodies to inactivate all but one of their X chromosomes. Thus, Ohno described the \u201cn-1\u201d rule to predict the number of Barr bodies in a female with n number of X chromosomes in her karyotype.<ref name=\"Ohno\"/>\n\nSimultaneously, [[Mary F. Lyon]] began investigating manipulations of X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately linked to the X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying,<ref name= \"Lyon\">{{cite journal | last1 = Lyon|first1= M.F.|author-link1=Mary F. Lyon | year = 1961 | title = Gene action in the X-chromosome of the mouse (''Mus musculus'' L.) | journal = Nature | volume = 190 | issue = | pages = 372\u2013373 | doi=10.1038/190372a0 | pmid=13764598}}</ref> which explained the [[heterogeneous]] fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as [[X-inactivation]], and is sometimes referred to as \u201clyonization\u201d.<ref name=\"Brockdorff\"/> This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of [[tortoiseshell cat]]s. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell.<ref name=\"Ahn\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ahn|first1= J.|last2= Lee|first2= J. | year = 2008 | title = X chromosome: X inactivation | journal = Nature Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| page = 24 }}</ref> Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, it makes sense that whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.\n\nCompounding on Lyon's discoveries, in 1962 [[Ernest Beutler]] used female [[fibroblast]] cell lineages grown in culture to demonstrate the heritability of lyonization or random X-inactivation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1= = Beutler|first1= Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Beutler|last2= Yeh |first2=Mary |last3=Fairbanks|first3= Virgil F. | year = 1962 | title = The normal human female as a mosaic of X-chromosome activity: studies using the gene for g-6-pd-deficiency as a marker | journal = [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 9\u201316 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.48.1.9 | pmid=13868717 | pmc=285481}}</ref> By analyzing the differential expression of two existing, viable alleles for the X-linked enzyme [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] (G6PD) gene, Beutler observed that the inactivation of the gene was heritable across passaged generations of the cells.<ref name=\"Beutler, E 2008\">{{cite journal | last1 = Beutler|first1= Ernest|author-link1=Ernest Beutler | year = 2008 | title = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency: a historical perspective | url = | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = | pages = 16\u201324 | doi=10.1182/blood-2007-04-077412 | pmid=18156501| doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThis pattern of dosage compensation, caused by random X-inactivation, is regulated across development in female mammals, following concerted patterns throughout development; for example, at the beginning of most female mammal development, both X chromosomes are initially expressed, but gradually undergo epigenetic processes to eventually achieve random inactivation of one X.<ref name=\"Beutler, E 2008\"/> In [[germ cells]], inactivated X chromosomes are then once again activated to ensure their expression in [[gametes]] produced by female mammals.<ref name=\"Brockdorff\" />\n\nThus, dosage compensation in mammals is largely achieved through the silencing of one of two female X chromosomes via X-inactivation. This process involves [[histone]] tail modifications, DNA [[methylation]] patterns, and reorganization of large-scale [[chromatin]] structure encoded by the X-ist gene.<ref name=\"Brockdorff\" /> In spite of these extensive modifications, not all genes along the X chromosome are subject to X-inactivation; active expression at some loci is required for [[homologous recombination]] with the pseudo-autosomal region ([[Pseudoautosomal region|PAR]]) of the [[Y chromosome]] during meiosis.<ref name=\"Veitia\">{{cite journal|last1=Veitia|first1=RA|last2=Veyrunes|first2=F|last3=Bottani|first3=S|last4=Birchler|first4=JA|title=X chromosome inactivation and active X upregulation in therian mammals: facts, questions, and hypotheses|journal=Journal of Molecular Cell Biology|date=February 2015|volume=7|issue=1|pages=2\u201311|doi=10.1093/jmcb/mjv001|pmid=25564545|doi-access=free}}</ref> Additionally, 10-25% of human X chromosome genes,<ref name=\"Carrel and Willard\">{{cite journal | last1 = Carrel |first1=L.|last2= Willard|first2= H.F. | year = 2005 | title = X-inactivation profile reveals extensive variability in X-linked gene expression in females | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7031| pages = 400\u20134 | doi=10.1038/nature03479 | pmid=15772666}}</ref> and 3-7% of mouse X chromosome genes <ref name=\"Berletch\">{{cite journal|last1=Berletch|first1=JB|last2=Ma|first2=W|last3=Yang|first3=F|last4=Shendure|first4=J|last5=Noble|first5=WS|last6=Disteche|first6=CM|last7=Deng|first7=X|title=Escape from X inactivation varies in mouse tissues|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=March 2015|volume=11|issue=3|pages=e1005079|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005079|pmid=25785854|pmc=4364777}}</ref> outside of the PARs show weak expression from the inactive X chromosome.\n\n== Two-fold increased transcription of a single \u2642 X ==\n\nAnother mechanism common for achieving equal X-related genetic expression between males and females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, heterogametic male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in homogametic females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in ''Drosophila''.<ref name=\"Lucchesi, J.C. 2015\">{{cite journal | last1= Lucchesi|first1= J.C.|last2= Kuroda|first2= M.I. | year = 2015 | title = Dosage compensation in ''Drosophila'' | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume =  7| issue = | page =  a019398| doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a019398 | pmc = 4448616 | pmid=25934013}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of dosage compensation actually originated from an understanding of organisms in which males upregulated X-linked genes two-fold, and was much later extended to account for the observation of the once mysterious Barr bodies. As early as 1932, [[H.J. Muller]] carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an X-linked gene. Muller introduced a [[mutant]] gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase \u201cdosage compensation\u201d to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization.<ref name=\"Muller\">{{cite journal | last1 = Muller|first1= HJ | year = 1932 | title = Further studies on the nature and causes of gene mutations | journal = Proc 6th Int Congr Genet | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013255 }}</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, it was not until Ardhendu Mukherjee and W. Beermann performed more advanced [[autoradiography]] experiments in 1965 that scientists could confirm that transcription of genes in the single male X chromosome was double that observed in the two female X chromosomes.<ref name=\"Mukherjee\">{{cite journal |last1=Mukherjee |first1=A.S.|last2= Beermann|first2= W. | year = 1965 | title = Synthesis of [[ribonucleic acid]] by the X-chromosomes of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' and the problem of dosage compensation | journal = Nature | volume = 207 | issue = | pages = 785\u2013786 |pmid=5885936| doi=10.1038/207785a0}}</ref> Mukherjee and Beermann confirmed this by designing a cellular autoradiography experiment that allowed them to visualize incorporation of [3H]uridine into ribonucleic acid of the X chromosomes.

Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated.<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles.<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene,<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.\n\n=== Plants ===\n\nIn addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. ''[[Silene latifolia]]'' plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meadows|first1=R|title=Sex chromosome equality in plants|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2012|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1001312|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001312|pmid=22529748|pmc=3328425}}</ref> have shown male ''S. latifolia'' expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the ''S. latifolia'' did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, it has been suggested that ''S. latiforia'' and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either [[aneuploidy]] or [[polyploid]]y. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.\n\n== X chromosome inactivation and embryonic stem cells ==\nXCI is initiated very early during female embryonic development or upon differentiation of female embryonic stem (ES) cells and results in inactivation of one X chromosome in every female somatic cell.

Across species, different [[sexes]] are often characterized by different types and numbers of [[sex chromosome]]s. In order to neutralize the large difference in [[gene dosage]] produced by differing numbers of sex chromosomes among the sexes, various [[phylogenetic tree|evolutionary branches]] have acquired various methods to equalize [[gene expression]] among the sexes. Because sex chromosomes contain different numbers of [[genes]], different species of organisms have developed different mechanisms to cope with this inequality. Replicating the actual ''gene'' is impossible; thus organisms instead equalize the ''expression'' from each gene. For example, in [[humans]], females (XX) silence the transcription of one [[X chromosome]] of each pair, and transcribe all information from the other, expressed X chromosome. Thus, human females have the same number of expressed X-linked genes as do human males (XY), both sexes having essentially one X chromosome per cell, from which to transcribe and express genes.<ref name= \"Brockdorff\">{{cite journal | last1 = Brockdorff |first1=N.|last2= Turner |first2=B.M. | year = 2015 | title = Dosage compensation in mammals | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = | page = a019406 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a019406|pmc=4355265 | pmid=25731764}}</ref>\n\nThere are three main mechanisms of achieving dosage compensation which are widely documented in the literature and which are common to most species. These include random inactivation of one female X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Mus musculus]]''; this is called [[X-inactivation]]), a two-fold increase in the transcription of a single male X chromosome (as observed in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''), and decreased transcription by half in both of the X chromosomes of a hermaphroditic organism (as observed in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''). These mechanisms have been widely studied and manipulated in model organisms commonly used in the laboratory research setting. A summary of these forms of dosage compensation is illustrated below. However, there are also other less common forms of dosage compensation, which are not as widely researched and are sometimes specific to only one species (as observed in certain bird and [[monotreme]] species).\n\n[[File:Summary of dosage compensation.png|thumb|Three main mechanisms of dosage compensation observed in common model eukaryotic organisms.]]\n\n== Random inactivation of one \u2640 X ==\n\nOne logical way to equalize gene expression amongst males and females that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression of one of the X chromosomes in an XX, or female, [[homogametic]] individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice.<ref name=\"Brockdorff\"/>\n\nThe evidence for this mechanism of dosage compensation was discovered prior to scientists\u2019 understanding of what its implications were. In 1949, [[Murray Barr]] and Ewert Bertram published data describing the presence of \u201cnucleolar satellites,<ref name= \"Barr\">{{cite journal | last1 = Barr |first1=M.L.|author-link1=Murray Barr|last2=Bertram |first2= E.G. | year = 1949 | title = A morphological distinction between [[neurones]] of the male and female, and the behaviour of the nucleolar satellite during accelerated nucleoprotein synthesis | journal = Nature | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 676\u2013677 | doi=10.1038/163676a0 | pmid=18120749}}</ref> which they observed were present in the mature somatic tissue of different female species. Further characterization of these satellites revealed that they were actually packages of condensed [[heterochromatin]], but a decade would pass before scientists grasped the significance of this specialized DNA.\n\nThen, in 1959 [[Susumu Ohno]] proved that these satellite-like structures found exclusively in female cells were actually derived from female X chromosomes.<ref name= \"Ohno\">{{cite journal | last1 = Ohno|first1= Susumu|author-link1=Susumu Ohno | year = 1959 | title = Sex chromosomes and sex-linked genes | journal = Teratology | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 111 | doi = 10.1002/tera.1420040116 }}</ref> He called these structures [[Barr bodies]] after one of the investigators who originally documented their existence. Ohno\u2019s studies of Barr bodies in female mammals with multiple X chromosomes revealed that such females used Barr bodies to inactivate all but one of their X chromosomes. Thus, Ohno described the \u201cn-1\u201d rule to predict the number of Barr bodies in a female with n number of X chromosomes in her karyotype.<ref name=\"Ohno\"/>\n\nSimultaneously, [[Mary F. Lyon]] began investigating manipulations of X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately linked to the X chromosome.

As early as 1932, [[H.J. Muller]] carried out a set of experiments which allowed him to track the expression of eye color in flies, which is an X-linked gene. Muller introduced a [[mutant]] gene that caused loss of pigmentation in fly eyes, and subsequently noted that males with only one copy of the mutant gene had similar pigmentation to females with two copies of the mutant gene. This led Muller to coin the phrase \u201cdosage compensation\u201d to describe the observed phenomenon of gene expression equalization.<ref name=\"Muller\">{{cite journal | last1 = Muller|first1= HJ | year = 1932 | title = Further studies on the nature and causes of gene mutations | journal = Proc 6th Int Congr Genet | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 213\u2013255 }}</ref>\n\nDespite these advances, it was not until Ardhendu Mukherjee and W.

Thus, the investigators concluded that the two-fold increase in the rate of [[RNA synthesis]] in the X chromosome of the male relative to those of the female could account for Muller's hypothesized dosage compensation.\n\nIn the case of two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome, there is no use for a Barr body, and the male organism must use different genetic machinery to increase the transcriptional output of their single X chromosome.

In fact, xol-1 is often referred to in the literature as the master sex regulatory gene of C. elegans.

This consequent decrease in xol-1 expression then allows higher SDC-2 expression levels, which aids in the formation and function of the DCC complex in the XX hermaphroditic worms, and in turn results in equalized expression of X-linked genes in the hermaphrodite.\n\nThough all of the above-mentioned XSEs act to reduce xol-1 expression, experimentally reducing expression levels of these individual XSEs has been shown to have a minimal effect on sex determination and successful dosage compensation.<ref name=\"Gladden\" /> This could be in part because these genes encode different proteins that act cooperatively rather than in an isolated fashion; for example, SEX-1 is a nuclear hormone receptor, while FOX-1 is an RNA-binding protein with properties capable of inducing post-transcriptional modifications in the xol-1 target.<ref name=\"Gladden\" /><ref name=\"Skipper\" /><ref name=\"Nicoll\" >{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicoll M, Akerib CC, Meyer BJ| year = 1997 | title = X-chromosome-counting mechanisms that determine nematode sex | journal = Nature | volume = 388 | issue = | pages = 200\u2013204 }}</ref> However, reducing the level of more than one XSE in different combinational permutations seems to have an additive effect on ensuring proper sex determination and resultant dosage compensation mechanics.<ref name=\"Gladden\" /> This supports the hypothesis that these XSEs act together to achieve the desired sex determination and dosage compensation fate.

It is associated with female-specific hyper-acetylation of lysine 16 on histone 4 near the MHM locus on the Z chromosome.

While monotremes use an XX/XY system, unlike other mammals, monotremes have more than two sex chromosomes. The male short-beaked echidna, for example, has nine sex chromosomes\u20145 Xs and 4 Ys, and the male platypus has 5 Xs and 5 Ys.\n\nPlatypuses are a monotreme species whose mechanism of sex determination has been extensively studied. There is some contention in academia about the evolutionary origin and the proper [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of platypuses. A recent study<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> revealed that four platypus X chromosomes, as well as a Y chromosome, are homologous to some regions on the avian Z chromosome. Specifically, platypus X1 shares homology with the chicken Z chromosome, and both share homology with the human chromosome 9. This homology is important when considering the mechanism of dosage compensation in monotremes. In 50% of female platypus cells, only one of the alleles on these X chromosomes is expressed while in the remaining 50% multiple alleles are expressed. This, combined with the portions that are homologous to chicken Z and human 9 chromosomes imply that this level of incomplete silencing may be the ancestral form of dosage compensation.\n\nRegardless of their ambiguous evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an [[XY sex-determination system]], with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the homogametic sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex.<ref name=\"Gr\u00fctzner\" >{{cite journal|last1=Gr\u00fctzner|first1=F|last2=Graves|first2=JA|title=A platypus' eye view of the mammalian genome|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics & Development|date=December 2004|volume=14|issue=6|pages=642\u20139|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2004.09.006|pmid=15531159}}</ref> Because the entire genome of the platypus has yet to be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes),<ref name=\"Deakin\" >{{cite journal|last1=Deakin|first1=JE|last2=Hore|first2=TA|last3=Koina|first3=E|last4=Marshall Graves|first4=JA|title=The status of dosage compensation in the multiple X chromosomes of the platypus|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=25 July 2008|volume=4|issue=7|pages=e1000140|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000140|pmid=18654631|pmc=2453332}}</ref> there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated.<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles.<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene,<ref name=\"Deakin\" /> alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.\n\n=== Plants ===\n\nIn addition to humans and flies, some plants also make use of the XX/XY dosage compensation systems. ''[[Silene latifolia]]'' plants are also either male (XY) or female (XX), with the Y chromosome being smaller, with fewer genes expressed, than the X chromosome. Two separate studies <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Meadows|first1=R|title=Sex chromosome equality in plants|journal=PLoS Biology|date=2012|volume=10|issue=4|pages=e1001312|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001312|pmid=22529748|pmc=3328425}}</ref> have shown male ''S. latifolia'' expression of X-linked genes to be about 70% of the expression in females. If the ''S. latifolia'' did not practice dosage compensation, the expected level of X-linked gene expression in males would be 50% that of females, thus the plant practices some degree of dosage compensation but, because male expression is not 100% that of females, it has been suggested that ''S. latiforia'' and its dosage compensation system is still evolving. Additionally, in plant species that lack dimorphic sex chromosomes, dosage compensation can occur when aberrant meiotic events or mutations result in either [[aneuploidy]] or [[polyploid]]y. Genes on the affected chromosome may be upregulated or down-regulated to compensate for the change in the normal number of chromosomes present.\n\n== X Chromosome Inactivation and Embryonic Stem Cells ==\nXCI is initiated very early during female embryonic development or upon differentiation of female embryonic stem (ES) cells and results in inactivation of one X chromosome in every female somatic cell.

After that there was a gap of long four years in the WDM3A production line in [[Diesel Locomotive Works|DLW]]. These new locomotives had their control stand shifted to the left side of the cabin. Meanwhile, Diesel Loco Modernisation Works (erstwhile Diesel Modification Works which again was known as Diesel Component Works) in Patiala started rebuilding the existing [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM2]] locomotives, which had reached midlife, with upgraded powerpacks. DLMW Patiala re-calibrates the powerpack and upgrades the output power rating to 3100HP.<ref>{{cite web| publisher=Indian Railways| url=http://www.dmw.indianrailways.gov.in/works/uploads/File/Company%20Profile.pdf| accessdate=March 2, 2018}}</ref> DLW again started building WDM3A from the year 2000 and continued till the end of 2002 with locomotive road numbers in the range 14058\u201314143. All the locomotives rebuilt by DLMW and later batch from DLW had regular WDM2 type square short hood profile and control stand position. DLW again built WDM3A variant locomotives, during 2005\u20132006, in the road number range 14144-14167 which were classified as [[WDM3B]] due to their difference in bogie design from classic ALCo asymmetrical trimount to HAHS design which was employed in WDG2 and later WDM3D classes too. Most of the WDM3B were later converted to WDM3D. In 2011, DLMW rebuilt locomotive number 16502 as WDM3A and equipped it with an Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system jointly developed by Engine Research Laboratory of IIT Kanpur, Engine Development Directorate of RDSO, and DLMW Patiala.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= Indian Railways |website= iitk.ac.in |title= Direction Article Development of EFI for 204-stroke locomotive diesel engine |url= https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/Index_files/Popular%20Publication/Direction%20Article%20Development%20of%20EFI%20for%204-stroke%20locomotive%20diesel%20engine.pdf |date= 2018 |accessdate= March 2, 2018}}</ref>  DLMW continues to rebuild WDM2 as WDM3A and recently they have started rebuilding the DLW built WDM3A too when they reach their midlife.

After that there was a gap of long four years in the WDM3A production line in [[Diesel Locomotive Works|DLW]]. These new locomotives had their control stand shifted to the left side of the cabin. Meanwhile, Diesel Loco Modernisation Works (erstwhile Diesel Modification Works which again was known as Diesel Component Works) in Patiala started rebuilding the existing [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM2]] locomotives, which had reached midlife, with upgraded powerpacks.

DLW again built WDM3A variant locomotives, during 2005\u20132006, in the road number range 14144-14167 which were classified as [[WDM3B]] due to their difference in bogie design from classic ALCo asymmetrical trimount to HAHS design which was employed in WDG2 and later WDM3D classes too. Most of the WDM3B were later converted to WDM3D. In 2011, DLMW rebuilt locomotive number 16502 as WDM3A and equipped it with an Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) system jointly developed by Engine Research Laboratory of IIT Kanpur, Engine Development Directorate of RDSO, and DLMW Patiala.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= Indian Railways |website= iitk.ac.in |title= Direction Article Development of EFI for 204-stroke locomotive diesel engine |url= https://www.iitk.ac.in/erl/Index_files/Popular%20Publication/Direction%20Article%20Development%20of%20EFI%20for%204-stroke%20locomotive%20diesel%20engine.pdf |date= 2018 |accessdate= March 2, 2018}}</ref>  DLMW continues to rebuild WDM2 as WDM3A and recently they have started rebuilding the DLW built WDM3A too when they reach their midlife.

He explained that in order to develop full flexibility, the student must restore his own primal nature, through several Taoist yoga practices, as follows: yin ''asanas''\u2014mostly sitting or lying postures; yang ''asanas''\u2014more active, strenuous postures; Taoist Flow yoga\u2014both yin and yang yoga postures practiced in continuous, smooth and circular motions; ''[[Chi Kung]]''\u2014involving simple and gentle movement and breathing techniques; and Taoist alchemy\u2014based, supposedly, upon the Taoist theory of the five elements used in [[Chinese medicine]].

Yin could be described as stable, immobile, feminine, passive, cold, and downward moving. Yang is understood to be changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving. The sun is considered yang, the moon yin.<ref name=About>{{cite web |url=http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/Yin-Yoga.htm |title=Yin Yoga |last1=Pizer |first1=Ann |date=May 17, 2012 |publisher=about.com Yoga |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> In the body, the relatively stiff connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, fascia) are considered yin, while the more mobile and pliable muscles and blood are called yang.

For example, in Seal pose, in which a practitioner lies face down and raises the trunk, the upward movement is gradual and entirely supported by the arms, while the legs are relaxed, whereas in [[Bhujangasana]] (Cobra Pose), the practitioner actively curves the spine upward in an arc using arms and lower back muscles, and reaches back with the legs strongly.<ref name=\"Maria 2008\"/> Because Yin Yoga does not make practitioners hot, the temperature of the room is kept a little higher than usual.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=33}}\n\n==Practice==\n\nZink's approach to Yin Yoga consists of both yin and yang postures, and incorporates movement in between postures as a yang element.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yogamagazine.com/yin-yoga/ |title=Yin Yoga |publisher=Yoga Magazine |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> In contrast, Yin Yoga sessions taught by Grilley and Powers consist of a series of long-held, passive floor poses that primarily affect the lower part of the body\u2014the hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine\u2014about 18 to 24 in number. These areas are especially rich in connective tissues, the \"loading\" of which (Yin Yoga teachers avoid the word \"stretching\") is a main focus in this style of yoga.<ref name=\"Maria 2008\"/> \n\nDuring the long hold times of the yin asanas, teachers usually give \"dharma talks\", informal monologues that often explain the physiology and anatomy of poses, including the meridian lines being affected.

Yin could be described as stable, immobile, feminine, passive, cold, and downward moving. Yang is understood to be changing, mobile, masculine, active, hot, and upward moving. The sun is considered yang, the moon yin.<ref name=About>{{cite web |url=http://yoga.about.com/od/typesofyoga/a/Yin-Yoga.htm |title=Yin Yoga |last1=Pizer |first1=Ann |date=May 17, 2012 |publisher=about.com Yoga |accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref> In the body, the relatively stiff connective tissues (tendons, ligaments, fascia) are considered yin, while the more mobile and pliable muscles and blood are called yang. More passive asanas in yoga are considered yin, whereas the more active, dynamic asanas are described as yang.<ref name=\"Maria 2008\"/>\n\nYin Yoga employs specific sequences of poses to stimulate particular [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridians]], or subtle channels, as understood in [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]]; these are the equivalent of the [[nadi (yoga)|nadi]] channels in hatha yoga.<ref name=Surrender>{{cite news |title=Sweet Surrender |author=Ferretti, Andrea |url=http://www.yogajournal.com/practice/2545 |newspaper=[[Yoga Journal]] |date=June 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with its roots in Taoist Yoga, Zink says that Yin Yoga has a deeper purpose: to \"open the heart and invoke the primal self.\"<ref name=\"yogamagazine1\"/> Powers says one of the primary objectives of yin practice is the cultivation of inner stillness.<ref name=\"Yoga Journal\"/>\n\n===Distinction from conventional yoga===\n\nAlthough many Yin Yoga poses closely resemble the asanas of [[Yoga as exercise|conventional or \"yang\" yoga]], they have different names, in part to alert those familiar with conventional yoga not to perform them in the same way.<ref name=About/> In general, the poses of Yin Yoga are performed with little muscular exertion. For example, in Seal pose, in which a practitioner lies face down and raises the trunk, the upward movement is gradual and entirely supported by the arms, while the legs are relaxed, whereas in [[Bhujangasana]] (Cobra Pose), the practitioner actively curves the spine upward in an arc using arms and lower back muscles, and reaches back with the legs strongly.<ref name=\"Maria 2008\"/> Because yin yoga does not make practitioners hot, the temperature of the room is kept a little higher than usual.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=33}}\n\n==Practice==\n\nZink's approach to Yin Yoga consists of both yin and yang postures, and incorporates movement in between postures as a yang element.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yogamagazine.com/yin-yoga/ |title=Yin Yoga |publisher=Yoga Magazine |accessdate=February 12, 2013}}</ref> In contrast, Yin Yoga sessions taught by Grilley and Powers consist of a series of long-held, passive floor poses that primarily affect the lower part of the body\u2014the hips, pelvis, inner thighs, lower spine\u2014about 18 to 24 in number. These areas are especially rich in connective tissues, the \"loading\" of which (Yin Yoga teachers avoid the word \"stretching\") is a main focus in this style of yoga.<ref name=\"Maria 2008\"/> \n\nDuring the long hold times of the yin asanas, teachers usually give \"dharma talks\", informal monologues that often explain the physiology and anatomy of poses, including the meridian lines being affected.
