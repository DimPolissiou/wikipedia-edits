It was quickly extinguished without anyone onboard being injured; however, minor amounts of smoke was detected by passengers as far up as Deck 8.\n\n''Coral Princess'' experienced an engine fire at approximately 2130 local time on 15 January 2020 while in the [[Drake Passage]] en route to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]].

A news item on 2 April 2020 stated that \"Passengers have been confined to their rooms...when the company noticed a higher than normal number of flu-like cases on board\".  Reports then specified that that \"out of 13 passengers and crew tested for COVID-19 on board the Coral Princess, 12 were positive\". Officials in [[Broward County, Florida]] said that a plan was not yet in place to handle the situation. The ship had departed [[San Antonio, Chile]] on 5 March 2020, when the cruise line was still in full operation, and was not allowed to disembark passengers at [[Buenos Aires]] on 19 and 20 March. Passengers were in full lockdown as the vessel approached Florida.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cruisehive.com/princess-cruise-ship-with-12-covid-19-cases-hopes-to-dock-in-fort-lauderdale/38822 |title=Princess Cruise Ship With 12 COVID-19 Cases Hopes to Dock in Fort Lauderdale |work=Cruise Hive |date=3 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/coral-princess-cruise-ship-12-183437177.html |title=Coral Princess cruise ship with 12 COVID-19 cases on board hopes to dock in Florida |work=Yahoo, Miami Herald |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA previous ship, the [[Holland America Line]]'s [[MS Zaandam]], also with confirmed COVD-19 cases, had finally received permission on 2 April for most of her passengers to disembark at Port Everglades.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cruise-ship-sick-passengers-sister-ship-will-be-allowed-dock-n1174796 |title=Cruise ship with sick passengers and sister ship will be allowed to dock in Florida |last=Burke |first=Minyvonne |work=NBC News |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Coral Princess was diverted and finally docked at the [[Port of Miami]] on the afternoon of 4 April with its over 1,000 passengers and 878 crew members.

The vessel, along with [[sister ship]] {{MS|Island Princess|2003|2}}, was launched in 2002.  ''Coral Princess'' and ''Island Princess'' are part of the only five [[Panamax]] ships operated by Princess Cruises.\n\n==Route==\nDuring summer months, ''Coral Princess''{{'}}s main itinerary consists of 7-day Alaskan cruises from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Alaska]], US. During fall, winter and spring, ''Coral Princess'' runs 11-day [[Panama Canal]] partial-transit cruises with stops in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Colon, Panama]], either [[Ocho Rios, Jamaica]], or [[Grand Cayman]] (alternating cruises), [[Limon, Costa Rica]], and [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], with [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], as its turnaround port.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn May 2, 2013, ''Coral Princess'' suffered a fire when some flammable material in the engineering spaces accidentally ignited in the middle of the night.  It was quickly extinguished without anyone onboard being injured; however, minor amounts of smoke was detected by passengers as far up as Deck 8.\n\n''Coral Princess'' experienced an engine fire at approximately 2130 local time on 15 January 2020 while in the [[Drake Passage]] en route to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]. At the time of the fire, ''Coral Princess'' was {{convert|4|nmi}} north of [[Elephant Island]] in [[Antarctica]].

A news item on 2 April 2020 stated that \"Passengers have been confined to their rooms...when the company noticed a higher than normal number of flu-like cases on board\".  Reports then specified that that \"out of 13 passengers and crew tested for COVID-19 on board the Coral Princess, 12 were positive\". Officials in [[Broward County, Florida]] said that a plan was not yet in place to handle the situation. The ship had departed [[San Antonio, Chile]] on 5 March 2020, when the cruise line was still in full operation, and was not allowed to disembark passengers at [[Buenos Aires]] on 19 and 20 March. Passengers were in full lockdown as the vessel approached Florida. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cruisehive.com/princess-cruise-ship-with-12-covid-19-cases-hopes-to-dock-in-fort-lauderdale/38822 |title=Princess Cruise Ship With 12 COVID-19 Cases Hopes to Dock in Fort Lauderdale |work=Cruise Hive |date=3 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/coral-princess-cruise-ship-12-183437177.html |title=Coral Princess cruise ship with 12 COVID-19 cases on board hopes to dock in Florida |work=Yahoo, Miami Herald |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> \n\nA previous ship, the [[Holland America Line]]'s [[MS Zaandam]], also with confirmed COVD-19 cases, had finally received permission on 2 April for most of her passengers to disembark at Port Everglades.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cruise-ship-sick-passengers-sister-ship-will-be-allowed-dock-n1174796 |title=Cruise ship with sick passengers and sister ship will be allowed to dock in Florida |last=Burke |first=Minyvonne |work=NBC News |date=2 April 2020 |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Coral Princess was diverted and finally docked at the [[Port of Miami]] on the afternoon of 4 April with its over 1,000 passengers and 878 crew members.
