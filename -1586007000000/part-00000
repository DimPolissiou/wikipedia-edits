Arthur discovers she has been hiding the cheques around the house, and when Maggie adds them up they find out that it is a substantial sum of money. It is temporarily misplaced for a while when Maggie soaks them in the teapot. This is convenient for Arthur, who is looking for a loan to buy Robert's old car. Robert had originally offered it for AUD4000, but raises his price to AUD5000 when he realises this is how much money Maggie has. Arthur and Robert's plans are interrupted when Maggie attempts to cash in the cheques at the bank and a misunderstanding occurs with where the money will be deposited.\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#002FA7\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|9 || '''\"The Divorce\"''' || align=\"center\"|11 March 1985 || align=\"center\"|202 \n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Arthur is finalising divorce proceedings with his ex-wife Deidre, much to Maggie's consternation who believes a married couple are married for life.

Maggie blames Arthur for spreading a culture of divorce. She then stirs up the dispute when Liz arrives by falsely implicating Arthur in an affair with Liz.\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#002FA7\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|10 || '''\"The Funeral\"''' || align=\"center\"|18 March 1985 || align=\"center\"|203 \n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| The Beare family attend the funeral of Arthur and Robert's Uncle Andrew.  Along the way to the funeral, Maggie stops the procession to buy a bag of oranges on sale, which she later drops accidentally into the open grave.  Returning home with Arthur's other uncle, Tom, Maggie forgets his name repeatedly and gives him a cup of tea, with many cubes of sugar or saccharin. Tom then collapses on the couch and dies, and Maggie and the brothers argue over what to do with the body. Maggie brings another bag of oranges to the funeral, this time not dropping them.\n|-\n|colspan=\"4\" bgcolor=\"#002FA7\"|\n|-\n| align=\"center\"|11 || '''\"The Promotion\"''' || align=\"center\"|25 March 1985 || align=\"center\"|204 \n|-\n|colspan=\"4\"| Arthur is offered a new job doing press relations for the ruling [[Australian Labor Party]] of Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]], which will involve moving to Canberra.  Trying to convince Maggie to move with him proves harder than anticipated, however. Robert tries to thwart Arthur so that he will have to stay in Sydney to look after Maggie, who then sprays paint on Arthur's shirt on the morning of the interview instead of water before ironing it. Arthur is awarded the job and although Maggie encourages him beforehand, she faints and is hospitalised.

Much to Arthur's surprise, Maggie becomes the centre of Arthur's friends' attention for the night.

Maggie then uses Arthur's money and defeats all the others, winning a large amount of money, and refuses to give Arthur any of the winnings.
