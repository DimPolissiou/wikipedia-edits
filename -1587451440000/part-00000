While on hiatus, she enters school but it was midway through after the students have already formed their social circles. To maintain the status quo, no one has befriended her and her existence remains largely ignored. However, she has lately realized through experiments that aside from school, there were other areas where people have also become unable to acknowledge her existence. Those areas continue to grow and is becoming inconvenient.

Mai then makes an appointment with Sakuta to go out with her, but denying it is a date. Before it begins, Sakuta gets involved in a misunderstanding with a girl over a lost child in which the two kick each other's buttocks, delaying his arrival. When they go out together, Mai also makes an appointment to meet with her mother, to inform the latter about her decision. However, even her mother cannot see her, even does not remember her.

Worried about her, their mother suffered a mental breakdown and Sakuta received the scars on his chest. When reading a note in a book she had loaned to Kotomi, Kaede collapses as her past recollections slowly start to return, though at the risk of forgetting her current life. The Azusagawa siblings try to go to Kaede's school, but the trauma returns when Kaede spots other students. Instead, the two visit a zoo to cheer her up before returning to the now-empty school at night. With no one around, Kaede is comforted by the trip and proclaims she is ready to attend school again. The next morning, however, Kaede's old self has returned at the price of her recent memories.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = The Dawn After an Endless Night\n| AltTitle        = Akenai Yoru no Yoake\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u660e\u3051\u306a\u3044\u591c\u306e\u591c\u660e\u3051}})\n| DirectedBy      = Hidetoshi Takahashi\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|12|27}}\n| Aux4            = <ref>{{cite web |url=https://ao-buta.com/story/13.html |title=\u660e\u3051\u306a\u3044\u591c\u306e\u591c\u660e\u3051 |website=Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai Official Site |publisher=Aniplex |language=Japanese |accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = While visiting Kaede in the hospital, Sakuta breaks into tears and regrets his inability to save her previous life, causing his scars to reopen. An older Shoko, whom he had met when he was younger, treats his injuries. As he is bathing, she reads entries from Kaede's diary that she began writing shortly after her initial memory loss; expecting to regain her old memories and Sakuta to respond negatively, Kaede created her list of goals to provide him with happy recollections once she reverted to her past self. The next day, Sakuta spots a note left by Shoko before finding out both versions of her have disappeared entirely; Rio suggests Shoko was an illusion created by Sakuta. Upon coming home, Mai reads the note and storms away, prompting Sakuta to follow her to her filming location. On an impromptu date, Mai apologizes for not being there to help him through his crisis, to which he answers he is simply happy to have her by his side. In a post-credits scene, Sakuta and Kaede pack their bags at the hospital when he thanks her and she states her interest in going to school, knowing she is no longer alone.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official|https://dengekibunko.jp/special/aobuta/}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{official|http://ao-buta.com/|Anime series official website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{official|https://ao-buta.com/themovie/|Film official website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|light novel|22165}}\n\n{{CloverWorks}}\n\n[[Category:2014 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Aniplex franchises]]\n[[Category:ASCII Media Works manga]]\n[[Category:CloverWorks]]\n[[Category:Crunchyroll Anime Awards winners]]\n[[Category:Dengeki Bunko]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Psychological anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Supernatural anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Yen Press titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai\n| image           = Seishun Buta Yar\u014d light novel volume 1 cover.jpg\n| caption         = The cover of the first light novel, depicting Mai Sakurajima.\n| ja_kanji        = \u9752\u6625\u30d6\u30bf\u91ce\u90ce\n| ja_romaji       = Seishun Buta Yar\u014d\n| genre           = [[Psychological]], [[supernatural]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2018-09-22/aniplex-of-america-adds-rascal-does-not-dream-of-bunny-girl-senpai-and-dakaichi-im-being-harassed-by-the-sexiest-man-of-the-year-to-fall-2018-anime-line-up/.137191|title=Aniplex of America Adds Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai and DAKAICHI \u2013 I'm being harassed by the sexiest man of the year - to Fall 2018 Anime Line-Up|work=Anime News Network|date=September 22, 2018|accessdate=October 7, 2018}}</ref><!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

Her name, however, has been erased from the journal. Mai Sakurajima, a teen celebrity, had gone to the Fujisawa Library that day to test if people there could still see her. While on hiatus, she enters school but it was midway through after the students have already formed their social circles. To maintain the status quo, no one has befriended her and her existence remains largely ignored. However, she has lately realized through experiments that aside from school, there were other areas where people have also become unable to acknowledge her existence. Those areas continue to grow and is becoming inconvenient. Believing that she has the Adolescence Syndrome, an urban legend about special powers that affected his sister in the past, Sakuta tries to help figure out what was happening to prevent her from disappearing completely.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = On First Dates, Trouble Is Essential\n| AltTitle        = Hatsu D\u0113to ni Haran wa Tsukimono\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u521d\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6ce2\u4e71\u306f\u4ed8\u304d\u7269}})\n| DirectedBy      = Kazuki Horiguchi\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|11}}\n| Aux4            = <ref>{{cite web |url=https://ao-buta.com/story/02.html |title=\u521d\u30c7\u30fc\u30c8\u306b\u6ce2\u4e71\u306f\u4ed8\u304d\u7269 |website=Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai Official Site |publisher=Aniplex |language=Japanese |accessdate=October 8, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rio Futaba explains her understanding of \"Adolescence Syndrome\" using [[quantum mechanics]] and [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]]. Sakuta continues discussing with Mai about her situation. Sakuta reveals he gets to know about Mai's conflict with her manager (also her mother) from Nanjo, with the cost of offering the photo of his scars. Mai then contacts Fumika, requesting the latter not to publicize Sakuta's photo, with the cost of offering her exclusive interview about her decision to return to entertainment \u2013 not through her mother. Mai then makes an appointment with Sakuta to go out with her, but denying it is a date. Before it begins, Sakuta gets involved in a misunderstanding with a girl over a lost child in which the two kick each other's buttocks, delaying his arrival. When they go out together, Mai also makes an appointment to meet with her mother, to inform the latter about her decision. However, even her mother cannot see her, even does not remember her. Sakuta then decides to bring Mai to travel farther to find out whether there are anyone else who can see her and remember her, but in vain. At night, they have to rest in the same room in the hotel. When Mai is taking a bath, Sakuta contacts Yuma and Rio, and finds they still remembered Mai. Then Sakuta and Mai sleep on the same bed, and discusses whether Sakuta would forget her, too.

As such, Sakuta attempts to stay awake as midterm exams approach. While studying with Mai, she induces him into sleeping with pills and bids him farewell.

While hiding in a desk, Tomoe explains her best friend had a crush on Maezawa, hence her reluctance.

Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment of the viral S protein (maybe also HE if present) to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive-stranded RNA-virus transcription, using the premature termination model of subgenomic RNA transcription is the method of transcription. Translation takes place by -1 ribosomal frameshifting. Cattle, pig, and horse serve as the natural host. Transmission is thought to be via the [[faecal-oral route]].<ref name=ViralZone />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !!

Commonly known as ''Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol'' (anglicised as '''Granuaile''') in [[Irish folklore]], she is a well-known historical figure in 16th-century [[Early Modern Ireland 1536-1691|Irish history]]. Her name was rendered in contemporary English documents in various ways, including Gr\u00e1inne O'Maly, Graney O'Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O'Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O'Maly, and Granee O'Maillie.

Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"''<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref>\n\nUpon her father's death she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille. Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time. She was probably formally educated, since she is believed to have spoken in [[Latin]] with Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in 1593.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=36}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to O'Flaherty==\n[[File:Clare Island.jpg|thumb|250px|Clare Island, associated with Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]]\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was married in 1546 to [[\u00d3 Flaithbertaigh|D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]], ''[[t\u00e1naiste]]'' or heir to the \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ([[O'Flaherty]]) title, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the \u00d3 M\u00e1ille chieftain. As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]] tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.\n* M\u00e9adhbh (Maeve):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Said to be much like her mother, she married Ricard Deamhan an Chorr\u00e1in a B\u00farc, 'the Devil's Hook', with whom she had several children. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this, she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him.\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers,<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>  and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]).\n\nShe allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover, but soon he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. This earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nNot satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, taking it for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers.

Her reply is not recorded.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=56}}</ref>\n\n==Autonomous status==\nIn 1576, Grace engaged in the [[surrender and regrant]] process with the Lord Deputy Sir [[Henry Sidney]] in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. In 1593, when her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa were captured by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland\". It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the women came to an agreement that included that Elizabeth would remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille would stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nBingham was removed but several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and soon Elizabeth sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\n== Death ==\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\nMore than 20 years after her death, an English [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the [[Irish people]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=53}}</ref><ref>Calendar of State Papers Relating to Ireland (James I) 1623, no. 997. (London 1860\u20131912)</ref>\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&nbsp;...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n<blockquote>Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref></blockquote>\n\nA story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?''\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol.

The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart (''Cathair na Mart'' - \"fort of the slaughtered cows\"), an O'Malley fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650\u201351)]], and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's great-great granddaughter.\n\nThere is a bronze statue of O'Malley by the artist Michael Cooper \u2013 the brother-in-law of [[Jeremy Browne, 11th Marquess of Sligo|the 11th Marquess of Sligo]] \u2013 in the grounds of Westport House.<ref>'Westport House A Brief History' Westport House 2008</ref> Westport House also contains a comprehensive exhibition on the life of O'Malley compiled by author [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], a leading authority on Granuaile.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nO'Malley's life has inspired many musicians, novelists, and playwrights to create works based on her life and adventures and she has been used as a [[National personification|personification]] of Ireland:<ref>{{cite book |first=James |last=Hardiman |author-link=James Hardiman |title=Irish Minstrelsy; or Bardic Remains of Ireland, Volume 2 |year=1831 |page=[https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog/page/n154 140] |url=https://archive.org/details/irishminstrelsy00hardgoog}}\n<blockquote>Her name has been frequently used by our Bards, to designate Ireland.

Marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh (D\u00f3nal \"the warlike\") \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tiob\u00f3id a B\u00farc (Tibbot Bourke) and Murchadh \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O'Flaherty), and her half-brother D\u00f3nal an Ph\u00edopa (\"D\u00f3nal of the Pipes\"), were taken captive by the English governor of [[Connacht]], [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Sir Richard Bingham]], O'Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen [[Elizabeth I]] at her court in [[Greenwich Palace]].\n\n==Early life==\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille was born in Ireland around 1530, when [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] was [[King of England]] and held the title [[Lord of Ireland]]. Under the policies of the [[English government]] at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish princes and lords were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O'Malley's life as the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]] gathered pace.\n\nEoghan Dubhdara \u00d3 M\u00e1ille, her father,<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=20}}</ref> and his family were based in [[Clew Bay]], [[County Mayo]]. He was lord of the [[O'Malley (surname)|\u00d3 M\u00e1ille dynasty]] and ruler of Umall, descended from [[Maille mac Conall]]. The U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille (O'Malleys) were one of the seafaring families of Connacht, and they built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of [[Murrisk]]<ref name=\"Chambers 2003 20\"/> in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the [[Mac William \u00cdochtar|Mac Uilliam \u00cdochtair]] branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourkes (De Burca) were originally [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] but by N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's lifetime completely [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]]. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also a N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O'Malley had a half-brother called D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa, the son of her father.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=21}}</ref> Although typically during this period sons would inherit, O'Malley \"was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities\".<ref>[http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/22130/1/Granuaile.pdf O'Connell ]</ref>\n\nWith shore castles like [[Carrickkildavnet Castle|Carrickkildavnet]], the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille taxed all those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family (see [[Chiefs of the Name]]) was known simply by his surname as \u00d3 M\u00e1ille (anglicised as The O'Malley). Local folklore had it that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship's ropes, she cut off most of her hair to embarrass her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname \"Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol\" ({{IPA-ga|\u02c8\u0261\u02e0\u027e\u02e0\u0251\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259 w\u0268\u02d0l\u02e0}}; from ''maol'' meaning bald or having cropped hair), usually anglicised as Granuaile ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0261|r|\u0254\u02d0|nj|\u0259|\u02c8|w|e\u026a|l}}).<ref>as used to name the ships ILV ''Granuaile'' of the [[Commissioners of Irish Lights]]</ref> The nickname may also come from \"Gr\u00e1inne Umhaill\" (\"Gr\u00e1inne of Umhall\", Umhall being a historical district of west [[Connacht]] dominated by the U\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille).<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p= 57}}</ref>\n\nAs a child she most likely lived at her family's residence of Belclare and [[Clare Island]],<ref name=\"chambers39\"/> but she may have been fostered to another family, for [[fosterage]] was traditional among [[Irish people|Irish]] nobility at the time.

As \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh ''t\u00e1naiste'', D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling [[Iar Connacht]], the area roughly equivalent to modern [[Connemara]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=42}}</ref>\n\nShe bore three children during her marriage to D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh:\n* Eoghan (Owen):<ref name=\"chambers44\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=44}}</ref> The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving.

N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille and a B\u00farc were supposedly very close, more than once saving her from death.\n* Murchadh (Murrough):<ref name=\"chambers44\"/> Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her gender. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O'Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After D\u00f3nal an Chogaidh's death, O'Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to \u00d3 Mh\u00e1ille territory, taking with her many O'Flaherty followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=45}}</ref>\n\nIn 1565, D\u00f3nal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding [[Lough Corrib]]; this was, undoubtedly, part of D\u00f3nal's wider struggle with the Joyces for control of [[Castlekirk|Hen's Castle]] on the lough. Gr\u00e1inne returned to her own lands and established her principal residence on Clare Island (now called [[Granuaile's Castle]]). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair only lasted briefly as he was killed by the MacMahons of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, Gr\u00e1inne attacked the MacMahon castle of Doona in [[Blacksod Bay]] and killed her lover's murderers on Cahir Island. Her attack on Doona Castle earned her the nickname 'Dark Lady of Doona'.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dib.cambridge.org/viewReadPage.do?articleId=a6886&searchClicked=clicked&quickadvsearch=yes |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography - Cambridge University Press |website=dib.cambridge.org |access-date=2017-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Marriage to Burke==\n[[File:Carrickahowley (Rockfleet) Castle County Mayo.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rockfleet Castle]]]]\nBy 1566, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had married a second time, this time to [[Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn Bourke|Risde\u00e1rd an Iarainn (\"Iron Richard\") Bourke]], his nickname deriving from his ironworks at [[Burrishoole]], the place of his principal castle and residence.<ref>{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=63}}</ref> [[Tibbot ne Long Bourke, 1st Viscount Mayo|The 1st Viscount Mayo]] was a child of this marriage. \n\nStill not satisfied with her revenge, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.<ref name=\"chambers55-56\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|pp=55\u201356}}</ref> Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers.

Because Rockfleet was over a week's march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.\n\nIn 1593, in his letter to protesting N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was ''\"nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years\"''.<ref name=\"chambers52\">{{harvnb|Chambers|2003|p=52}}</ref><ref>Lambeth Palace Library MS 601, p. 111</ref> Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.\n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] over her part of the country. An expedition from [[Galway]] led by Sheriff [[William \u00d3ge Martyn]] attacked [[Granuaile's Castle|her castle at Clare Island]] in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.\n\n==Meeting with Elizabeth==\n{{More footnotes|date=August 2008}}\n[[File:The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth I.jpg|thumb|250px|The meeting of Grace O'Malley and Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;I (a later illustration from ''Anthologia Hibernica'', vol. 11, 1793)]]\nIn the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's power was steadily encroached upon. In 1593, when her two sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother D\u00f3nal na P\u00edopa were captured by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. Elizabeth I famously sent N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille a list of questions, which were answered and returned to Elizabeth. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille then met with the Queen at [[Greenwich Palace]], wearing a fine gown, the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth's royal Court. \n\nN\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille refused to bow before Elizabeth because she didn't recognise her as the \"Queen of Ireland\". It's also rumoured that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth's courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled.\n\nSome also reported that N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.\n\nTheir discussion was carried out in Latin, as N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille spoke no English and Queen Elizabeth I spoke no Irish.<ref name=\"Chambers, Anne 2003\" /> After much talk, the women came to an agreement that included that Elizabeth would remove Bingham from his position in Ireland, and N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille would stop supporting the Irish lords' rebellions.\n\nBingham was removed but several of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's other demands (including the return of the cattle and land that Bingham had stolen from her) remained unmet, and soon Elizabeth sent Bingham back into Ireland. Upon Bingham's return, N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille realised that the meeting with Elizabeth had been useless, and went back to supporting Irish insurgents during the ''[[Nine Years War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]].''\n\nShe most likely died at [[Rockfleet Castle]] around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth's death, though the year and place of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's death are disputed. Her family's usual burial place was in [[Clare Island Abbey]].\n\n==Biographical sources==\nO'Malley's biography has been written by Irish historian and novelist [[Anne Chambers (author)|Anne Chambers]], who has described O'Malley as:\n<blockquote>\"a fearless leader, by land and by sea, a political pragmatist and politician, a ruthless plunderer, a mercenary, a rebel, a shrewd and able negotiator, the protective matriarch of her family and tribe, a genuine inheritor of the Mother Goddess and Warrior Queen attributes of her remote ancestors. Above all else, she emerges as a woman who broke the mould and thereby played a unique role in history.\"<ref> Granuaile: Grace O'Malley: Grace O'Malley - Ireland's Pirate Queen, by Anne Chambers; Foreword; Gill & Macmillan Ltd, 2006; {{ISBN|0717151743}}, 9780717151745</ref></blockquote>\n\nDocumentary evidence for N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille's life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The O'Malley family \"book\", a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen \"Articles of Interrogatory\", questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I.<ref>See the supplement to Chambers, 2003.</ref> She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir Henry Sidney]], to his son [[Phillip Sidney|Phillip]] in 1577: \"There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men&nbsp;...\"<ref>Lambeth Palace Library, ms. no 601, p. 10, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 85</ref>\n\nLocal traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the [[Ordnance Survey Memoirs of Ireland|Ordnance Survey of Ireland]]. In a letter of 1838 he describes her as being \"most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally\".\n\n<blockquote>Charles Cormick of Erris, now 74 years and six weeks old, saw and conversed with Elizabeth O'Donnell of Newtown within the Mullet, who died about 65 years ago who had seen and intimately known a Mr Walsh who remembered Gr\u00e1inne. Walsh died at the age of 107 and his father was the same age as Gr\u00e1inne.<ref>Gaisford St Lawrence Papers, cited in Chambers 2003, p. 73</ref></blockquote>\n\nA story is recorded of N\u00ed Mh\u00e1ille chiding her son T\u00edobo\u00edd in the course of an attack on Kinturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: \"''An ag iarraidh dul i bhfolach ar mo th\u00f3in at\u00e1 t\u00fa, an \u00e1it a dt\u00e1inig t\u00fa as?''\" (\"Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?\").<ref name=\"Ordnance Survey Letters 2003\">Ordnance Survey Letters, Mayo, vol.

The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the [[Siege of Limerick (1650\u201351)]], and his wife Maude Bourke.
