The key performance features of a fighter include not only its [[firepower]] but also its high speed and [[maneuverability]] relative to the target aircraft.\n\nThe fighter's main tactical purpose is to establish [[air supremacy|air superiority]] over the battlefield. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.\n\nMany fighters have secondary capabilities such as [[ground-attack aircraft|ground attack]] and some types, such as [[fighter-bomber]]s,  are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, these include the [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], [[heavy fighter]], and [[night fighter]].\n\n==Classification==\nA fighter aircraft is primarily designed for [[air-to-air combat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fighter |title=Fighter \u2014Definition and More from the Free Merriam Webster Dictionary. |date=22 September 2011 |work=Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109080608/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fighter |archive-date=9 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> A given type may be designed for specific combat conditions, and in some cases for additional roles such as air-to-ground fighting. Historically the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]] referred to them as \"[[Scout (aircraft)|scouts]]\" until the early 1920s, while the [[U.S. Army]] called them \"pursuit\" aircraft until the late 1940s. The UK changed to calling them fighters in the 1920s, while the US Army did so in the 1940s. A short-range fighter designed to defend against incoming enemy aircraft is known as an [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].\n\nRecognised classes of fighter include:\n*[[Air superiority fighter]]\n*[[Fighter-bomber]]\n*[[Heavy fighter]]\n*[[Interceptor aircraft|Interceptor]]\n*[[Light fighter]]\n*[[All-weather fighter]] (including the [[night fighter]])\n*[[Reconnaissance fighter]]\n*[[Strategic fighter]] (including the [[escort fighter]] and [[strike fighter]])\n\nOf these, the [[Fighter-bomber]], [[reconnaissance fighter]] and [[strike fighter]] classes are dual-role, possessing qualities of the fighter alongside some other battlefield role. Some fighter designs may be developed in variants performing other roles entirely, such as [[ground-attack aircraft|ground attack]] or unarmed [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. This may be for political or national security reasons, for advertising purposes, or other reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/nonstandard-mds.html |title=Non-Standard DOD Aircraft Designations |author=Andreas Parsch |date=22 September 2011 |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927004151/http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/nonstandard-mds.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sopwith Camel]] and other \"fighting scouts\" of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work. In World War II, the [[USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or [[dive bombers]], and types such as the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] that were no longer competitive as aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack. Several aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-117, have received fighter designations though they had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons. The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the [[U.S. Navy]], but it was canceled. This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for \"attack\" or \"strike\" operations against ground targets by means of [[strafing]] or dropping small bombs and incendiaries. Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types.\n\nSome of the most expensive fighters such as the US [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and Russian [[Sukhoi Su-27]] were employed as all-weather [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] as well as [[air superiority fighter]] aircraft, while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers. An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target (or intercept) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcentralwis.net/wimuzikman/airterms.html|title=Military Aircraft Terminology|website=www.northcentralwis.net|access-date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727014559/http://www.northcentralwis.net/wimuzikman/airterms.html|archive-date=27 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of military nomenclature, a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use, along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft. The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries&nbsp;\u2013 in the English-speaking world, \"F\" is now used to indicate a fighter (e.g. [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire F.22]]), though when the pursuit designation was used in the US, they were \"P\" types (e.g. [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]). In Russia \"I\" was used ([[Polikarpov I-16]]), while the French continue to use \"C\" ([[Nieuport 17|Nieuport 17 C.1]]).\n\n===Air superiority fighter===\n{{main|Air superiority fighter}}\nAs fighter types have proliferated, the air superiority fighter emerged as a specific role at the pinnacle of speed, manoeuvrability and air-to-air weapon systems, able to hold its own against all other fighters and establish its dominance in the skies above the battlefield.\n\n===Interceptor===\n{{main|Interceptor aircraft}}\nThe interceptor is a fighter designed specifically to intercept and engage approaching enemy aircraft. There are two general classes of interceptor: relatively [[Light fighter|lightweight]] aircraft in the point-defence role, built for fast reaction, high performance and with a short range, and heavier aircraft with more comprehensive avionics and designed to fly at night or in all weathers and to operate over longer [[Range (aeronautics)|range]]s. Originating during World War I, by 1929 this class of fighters had become known as the interceptor.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1929/1929-1%20-%201764.html The Gloster S.S.8], ''Flight'', 6 December 1929, Page 1273: \"the type of single-seater fighter known as an \"Interceptor\" is a class of aircraft designed, as the title suggests, for intercepting hostile   aircraft.\"</ref>\n\n===Night and all-weather fighters===\n{{main|Night fighter}}\nThe equipment necessary for daytime flight is inadequate when flying at night or in poor visibility. The night fighter was developed during World War I with additional equipment to aid the pilot in flying straight, navigating and finding the target. From modified variants of the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c]] in 1915, the night fighter has evolved into the highly capable all-weather fighter.<ref>Gunston, Bill (1976), ''Night Fighters: A Development and Combat History', Patrick Stephens.[https://archive.org/details/nightfightersdev0000guns <!-- quote=\"first night fighter\". -->]</ref>\n\n===Strategic fighters===\n{{main|Strategic fighter}}\nThe strategic fighter is a fast, heavily-armed and long-range type, able to act as an [[escort fighter]] protecting [[bomber aircraft|bombers]], to carry out offensive sorties of its own as a [[penetration fighter]] and maintain standing patrols at significant distance from its home base.<ref>Gunston, Bill (1970), ''Warplanes of the Third Reich'', Macdonald and Jane's. p.573.</ref>\n\n[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] are vulnerable due to their low speed and poor maneuvrability. The escort fighter was developed during World War II to come between the bombers and enemy attackers as a protective shield. The primary requirement was for long range, with several [[heavy fighter]]s given the role. However they too proved unwieldy and vulnerable, so as the war progressed techniques such as [[drop tank]]s were developed to extend the range of more nimble conventional fighters.\n\nThe [[penetration fighter]] is typically also fitted for the [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] role, and so is able to defend itself while conducting attack sorties.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|Landing on {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} in a [[Sopwith Pup]] scout]]\n\nSince World War I, achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in [[conventional warfare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/aspc/text/theory/mitch.htm |title=Mitchell's Theory |date=22 September 2011 |work=Air & Space Power Course |publisher=College of Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120010348/http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/aspc/text/theory/mitch.htm |archive-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nFighters continued to be developed throughout World War I, to deny enemy aircraft and [[airship|dirigibles]] the ability to gather information by [[reconnaissance]] over the battlefield. Early fighters were very small and lightly armed by later standards, and most were [[biplane]]s built with a wooden frame covered with fabric, and a maximum airspeed of about {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}. As control of the airspace over armies became increasingly important, all of the major powers developed fighters to support their military operations. Between the wars, wood was largely replaced in part or whole by metal tubing, and finally aluminum stressed skin structures (monocoque) began to predominate.\n\nBy [[World War II]], most fighters were all-metal [[monoplane]]s armed with batteries of [[machine gun]]s or [[Autocannon|cannons]] and some were capable of speeds approaching {{convert|400|mph|abbr=on}}. Most fighters up to this point had one engine, but a number of twin-engine fighters were built; however they were found to be outmatched against single-engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks, such as night fighters equipped with primitive radar sets.\n\n[[File:Hawker Sea Hurricanes.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Sea Hurricanes]] in formation]]\nBy the end of the war, [[turbojet]] engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the turbojet engine was far less than a piston engine, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements.  This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape, and [[G-suit]]s to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers.\n\n[[File:MiG-17 underside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] underside]]\nIn the 1950s, [[radar]] was fitted to day fighters, since due to ever increasing air-to-air weapon ranges, pilots could no longer see far enough ahead to prepare for the opposition. Subsequently, radar capabilities grew enormously and are now the primary method of [[target acquisition]]. Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure, but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2, past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack.\n\n[[Air-to-air missile]]s largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained, however the [[Vietnam War]] showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between 20 and 30&nbsp;mm in [[caliber]]) in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles.\n\n[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[F-22A Raptor]] stealth fighter.]]\nIn the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engined support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible. Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress.\n\nWith the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient. To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China. The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines, eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces. Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application. Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components, and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weight\u2014most modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers.\n\nBecause of the importance of air superiority, since the early days of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers, and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/08/exclusive-us-air-force-combat.html |title=Xclusive: US Air Force combat fleet's true operational costs revealed |author=[[Stephen Trimble]] |date=22 September 2011 |work=Stephen Trimble's The Dew Line |publisher=Flight Global |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129021417/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/08/exclusive-us-air-force-combat.html |archive-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe global combat aircraft market was worth $45.75&nbsp;billion in 2017 and is projected by [[Frost & Sullivan]] at $47.2&nbsp;billion in 2026: 35% modernization programs and 65% aircraft purchases, dominated by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35]] with 3,000 deliveries over 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/combat-aircraft-market-strong-over-next-decade-repo-455132/ |title= Combat aircraft market strong over next decade: report |date= 18 January 2019 |author= Garrett Reim |work= Flightglobal |access-date= 19 January 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190119174527/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/combat-aircraft-market-strong-over-next-decade-repo-455132/ |archive-date= 19 January 2019 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Piston engine fighters==\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Vickers F.B.5. Gunbus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] ]]\n{{further|Aviation in World War I}}\n\nThe word \"fighter\" was first used to describe a two-seater aircraft with sufficient lift to carry a machine gun and its operator as well as the [[Aviator|pilot]]. Some of the first such \"fighters\" belonged to the \"gunbus\" series of experimental gun carriers of the British [[Vickers]] company that culminated in the [[Vickers F.B.5|Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] of 1914. The main drawback of this type of aircraft was its lack of speed. Planners quickly realized that an aircraft intended to destroy its kind in the air had to be fast enough to catch its quarry.\n\nOne of the first companies to develop an armed aircraft was Vickers. Their Type 18 Destroyer of 1913 was a two-seat pusher type, with the pilot behind and an observer/gunner in front and a machine gun fitted in the nose on a pivoting mount. It would be developed as the [[Vickers F.B.5|F.B.5 \"Gunbus\"]] and introduced into service in 1915.<ref>Munson (1976), pp.101-2</ref>\n\nHowever at the outbreak of [[World War I]], front-line aircraft were unarmed and used almost entirely for [[reconnaissance]]. On 15 August 1914, [[Miodrag Tomi\u0107]] encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The enemy pilot shot at Tomi\u0107's plane with a revolver.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} Tomi\u0107 produced a pistol of his own and fired back.{{sfn|Blume|1968|p=291}}{{sfnm|1a1=Glenny|1y=2012|1p=316|2a1=Buttar|2y=2014|2p=298}} It was considered the first exchange of fire between aircraft in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxGkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298|title=Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914|first=Prit|last=Buttar|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|via=Google Books}}</ref> Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} Machine guns were soon fitted to existing reconnaissance types for use by the observer, but none of these was a true fighter plane.\n\nAnother type of military aircraft was to form the basis for an effective \"fighter\" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on the small fast aircraft developed before the war for such [[Air racing|air races]] as the Gordon Bennett Cup and [[Schneider Trophy]]. The military '''[[Scout (aircraft)|scout]]''' airplane was not expected to carry serious armament, but rather to rely on its speed to reach the scout or reconnoiter location and return quickly to report&nbsp;\u2013 essentially an aerial horse. British scout aircraft, in this sense, included the [[Sopwith Tabloid]] and [[Bristol Scout]]. French equivalents included the [[Morane-Saulnier N]].\n\nThe next advance came with the fixed forward-firing machine gun, so that the pilot pointed the whole plane at the target and fired the gun, instead of relying on a second gunner. [[Roland Garros (aviator)]] bolted metal deflector plates to the propeller so that it would not shoot itself out of the sky and a number of [[Morane-Saulnier N]]s were modified. The technique proved effective, however the deflected bullets were still highly dangerous.<ref>Angelucci, A. and Matricardi, P. ''World Aircraft: Origins - World War I'', Sampson Low, 1977, p.110.</ref>\n\nThe next fighter manufactured in any quantity was the [[Fokker E.I]] ''Eindecker'' and its derivatives, whose introduction in 1915, only a few months after the appearance of the slower Gunbus, ushered in what the Allies came to call the \"[[Fokker scourge]]\" and a period of air superiority for the German forces. Although it still had mediocre flying qualities, the Fokker's unique innovation was an [[interrupter gear]] which allowed the gun to fire through the propeller arc without hitting the blades.<ref>Munson (1976), p.161.</ref>\n\n[[File:Airco D.H.2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[Airco DH.2]] \"pusher\" scout]]\nSoon after the commencement of the war, pilots armed themselves with pistols, [[carbines]], [[grenade]]s, and an assortment of improvised weapons. Many of these proved ineffective as the pilot had to fly his airplane while attempting to aim a handheld weapon and make a difficult deflection shot. The first step in finding a real solution was to mount the weapon on the aircraft, but the propeller remained a problem since the best direction to shoot is straight ahead. Numerous solutions were tried. A second crew member behind the pilot could aim and fire a swivel-mounted machine gun at enemy airplanes; however, this limited the area of coverage chiefly to the rear hemisphere, and effective coordination of the pilot's maneuvering with the gunner's aiming was difficult. This option was chiefly employed as a defensive measure on two-seater reconnaissance aircraft from 1915 on. Both the [[SPAD S.A]] and the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9]] added a second crewman ahead of the engine in a pod but this was both hazardous to the second crewman and limited performance. The [[Sopwith L.R.T.Tr.]] similarly added a pod on the top wing with no better luck.\n\n[[File:BillyBishop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Billy Bishop]] sitting in his [[Nieuport 23]] with the machine gun (just visible at the top of the picture) mounted to fire over the propeller.]]\nAn alternative was to build a [[Pusher configuration|\"pusher\"]] scout such as the [[Airco DH.2]], with the propeller mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar [[Tractor configuration|\"tractor\"]] aircraft.\n\nA better solution for a single seat scout was to mount the machine gun (rifles and pistols having been dispensed with) to fire forwards but outside the propeller arc. Wing guns were tried but the unreliable weapons available required frequent clearing of [[Firearm malfunction|jammed rounds and misfires]] and remained impractical until after the war. Mounting the machine gun over the top wing worked well and was used long after the ideal solution was found. The [[Nieuport 11]] of 1916 and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] of 1918 both used this system with considerable success; however, this placement made aiming difficult and the location made it difficult for a pilot to both maneuver and have access to the [[Gun breech|gun's breech]]. The British [[Foster mounting]] was specifically designed for this kind of application, fitted with the [[Lewis Gun|Lewis Machine gun]], which due to its design was unsuitable for synchronizing.\n\n[[File:Fokker M5K-MG E5-15.jpg|thumb|The actual aircraft used by Wintgens in his pioneering aerial engagement, his [[Fokker M.5K/MG]] with [[IdFlieg]] military serial number \"E.5/15\", as it appeared at the time of the engagement.]]\nThe need to arm a [[tractor scout]] with a forward-firing gun whose bullets passed through the propeller arc was evident even before the outbreak of war and inventors in both France and Germany devised [[Synchronization gear|mechanisms]] that could time the firing of the individual rounds to avoid hitting the propeller blades. [[Franz Schneider (engineer)|Franz Schneider]], a Swiss engineer, had patented such a device in Germany in 1913, but his original work was not followed up. French aircraft designer [[Raymond Saulnier (aircraft manufacturer)|Raymond Saulnier]] patented a practical device in April 1914, but trials were unsuccessful because of the propensity of the machine gun employed to [[hang fire]] due to unreliable ammunition.\n\nIn December 1914, French aviator [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] asked Saulnier to install his synchronization gear on Garros' [[Morane-Saulnier Type L]]. Unfortunately the gas-operated [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss]] machine gun he was provided had an erratic rate of fire and it was impossible to synchronize it with a spinning propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were armored and fitted with metal wedges to protect the pilot from [[ricochet]]s. Garros' modified monoplane was first flown in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon thereafter. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans.\n\nMeanwhile, the synchronization gear (called the ''Noodleteuerung'' in German, for \"pushrod control system\") devised by the engineers of [[Anthony Fokker]]'s firm was the first system to see production contracts, and would make the [[Fokker Eindecker|Fokker ''Eindecker'']] monoplane a feared name over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], despite its being an adaptation of an obsolete pre-war French [[Morane-Saulnier]] racing airplane, with a mediocre performance and poor flight characteristics. The first victory for the ''Eindecker'' came on 1 July 1915, when ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]], flying with the ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]] 6'' unit on the Western Front, forced down a Morane-Saulnier Type L two-seat \"parasol\" monoplane just east of [[Luneville]]. Wintgens' aircraft, one of the five [[Fokker M.5]]K/MG production prototype examples of the ''Eindecker'', was armed with a synchronized, air-cooled aviation version of the [[Parabellum MG14]] machine gun.\n\n[[File:Sopwith Camel 1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Camel]] at the [[Royal Air Force Museum|RAF Museum]] ]]\nThe success of the ''Eindecker'' kicked off a competitive cycle of improvement among the combatants, both sides striving to build ever more capable single-seat fighters. The [[Albatros D.I]] and [[Sopwith Pup]] of 1916 set the classic pattern followed by fighters for about twenty years. Most were [[biplane]]s and only rarely monoplanes or [[triplane]]s. The strong box structure of the biplane provided a rigid wing that allowed the accurate lateral control essential for dogfighting. They had a single operator, who flew the aircraft and also controlled its armament. They were armed with one or two [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] or [[Vickers]] machine guns, which were easier to synchronize than other types, firing through the propeller arc. Gun breeches were directly in front of the pilot, with obvious implications in case of accidents, but jams could be cleared in flight, while aiming was simplified.\n\nThe use of metal aircraft structures was pioneered before World War I by Breguet but would find its biggest proponent in Anthony Fokker, who used chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure of all his fighter designs, while the innovative German engineer [[Hugo Junkers]] developed two all-metal, single-seat fighter monoplane designs with [[cantilever]] wings: the strictly experimental [[Junkers J 2]] private-venture aircraft, made with steel, and some forty examples of the [[Junkers D.I]], made with corrugated [[duralumin]], all based on his experience in creating the pioneering [[Junkers J 1|Junkers J&nbsp;1]] all-metal airframe technology demonstration aircraft of late 1915. While Fokker would pursue steel tube fuselages with wooden wings until the late 1930s, and Junkers would focus on corrugated sheet metal, Dornier was the first to build a fighter (The [[Dornier-Zeppelin D.I]]) made with pre-stressed sheet aluminum and having cantilevered wings, a form that would replace all others in the 1930s.\n\nAs collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as [[Oswald Boelcke]], [[Max Immelmann]], and [[Edward Mannock]] developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness.\n\n[[File:Fordi.jpg|thumb|German Fokker Triplanes of ''[[Jasta]]'' 26 in World War I]]\nAllied and&nbsp;\u2013 before 1918&nbsp;\u2013 German pilots of World War I were not equipped with [[parachute]]s, so in-flight fires or structural failure were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year. The well known and feared [[Manfred von Richthofen]] \"Red Baron\" was wearing one when he was killed, but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.<ref>Lee, Arthur Gould.

In France, Italy and Russia, where large budgets continued to allow major development, both monoplanes and all metal structures were common. By the end of the 1920s, however, those countries overspent themselves and were overtaken in the 1930s by those powers that hadn't been spending heavily, namely the British, the Americans and the Germans.\n\n[[File:HawkerFury43sqn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hawker Fury]] of 43 Squadron, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], a typical late inter-war biplane]]\nGiven limited defense budgets, air forces tended to be conservative in their aircraft purchases, and biplanes remained popular with pilots because of their agility, and remained in service long after they had ceased to be competitive. Designs such as the [[Gloster Gladiator]], [[Fiat CR.42]], and [[Polikarpov I-15]] were common even in the late 1930s, and many were still in service as late as 1942. Up until the mid-1930s, the majority of fighters in the US, the UK, Italy and Russia remained fabric-covered biplanes.\n\nFighter armament eventually began to be mounted inside the wings, outside the arc of the propeller, though most designs retained two synchronized machine guns directly ahead of the pilot, where they were more accurate (that being the strongest part of the structure, reducing the vibration to which the guns were subjected to). Shooting with this traditional arrangement was also easier for the further reason that the guns shot directly ahead in the direction of the aircraft's flight, up to the limit of the guns range; unlike wing-mounted guns which to be effective required to be [[Gun harmonisation|harmonised]], that is, preset to shoot at an angle by ground crews so that their bullets would converge on a target area a set distance ahead of the fighter. Rifle-caliber .30 and .303 in (7.62&nbsp;mm) caliber guns remained the norm, with larger weapons either being too heavy and cumbersome or deemed unnecessary against such lightly built aircraft. It was not considered unreasonable to use World War I-style armament to counter enemy fighters as there was insufficient air-to-air combat during most of the period to disprove this notion.\n\nThe [[rotary engine]], popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, its development having reached the point where rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary [[radial engine]] though major advances led to inline engines, which gained ground with several exceptional engines\u2014including the {{convert|1145|cuin|l|abbr=on|adj=on}} V-12 [[Curtiss D-12]]. [[Aircraft engine]]s increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} in the 900-kg [[Fokker D.VII]] of 1918 to {{convert|900|hp|abbr=on}} in the 2,500-kg [[Curtiss P-36]] of 1936. The debate between the sleek [[Straight engine|in-line engines]] versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing in-line units. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) cooling system, but had increased drag. In-line engines often had a better [[power-to-weight ratio]], but there were radial engines that kept working even after having suffered significant battle damage.\n\n[[File:peashooter.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|An early monoplane fighter: the [[Boeing]] [[P-26 Peashooter]], which first flew in 1932]]\nSome air forces experimented with \"[[heavy fighter]]s\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of [[light bomber|light]] or [[medium bomber]] types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters.\n\nThe primary driver of fighter innovation, right up to the period of rapid re-armament in the late 1930s, were not military budgets, but civilian aircraft racing. Aircraft designed for these races introduced innovations like streamlining and more powerful engines that would find their way into the fighters of World War II. The most significant of these was the [[Schneider Trophy]] races, where competition grew so fierce, only national governments could afford to enter.\n\n[[File:Dewoitine D26 HB-RAI 1.jpg|thumb|left|Parasol monoplanes were popular in many European countries, and paved the way for cantilever low-wing monoplanes. This is a restored Swiss Air Force [[Dewoitine D.26]]]]\nAt the very end of the inter-war period in Europe came the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This was just the opportunity the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', and the Soviet Union's [[Soviet Air Forces|Red Air Force]] needed to test their latest aircraft. Each party sent numerous aircraft types to support their sides in the conflict. In the [[dogfight]]s over Spain, the latest [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters did well, as did the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16]]. The German design had considerably more room for development however and the lessons learned led to greatly improved models in World War II. The Russians, whose side lost, failed to keep up and despite newer models coming into service, I-16s were outfought by the improved Bf 109s in World War II, while remaining the most common Soviet front-line fighter into 1942.  For their part, the Italians developed several monoplanes such as the [[Fiat G.50]], but being short on funds, were forced to continue operating obsolete [[Fiat CR.42]] biplanes.\n\nFrom the early 1930s the Japanese had been at war against both the Chinese Nationalists and the Russians in China, and used the experience to improve both training and aircraft, replacing biplanes with modern cantilever monoplanes and creating a cadre of exceptional pilots for use in the Pacific War.  In the United Kingdom, at the behest of [[Neville Chamberlain]], (more famous for his 'peace in our time' speech) the entire British aviation industry was retooled, allowing it to change quickly from fabric covered metal framed biplanes to cantilever stressed skin monoplanes in time for the war with Germany.\n\nThe period of improving the same biplane design over and over was now coming to an end, and the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] finally started to supplant the [[Gloster Gladiator]] and [[Hawker Fury]] biplanes but many of the former remained in front-line service well past the start of World War II. While not a combatant themselves in Spain, they absorbed many of the lessons learned in time to use them.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War also provided an opportunity for updating fighter tactics. One of the innovations to result from the aerial warfare experience this conflict provided was the development of the \"[[finger-four]]\" formation by the German pilot [[Werner M\u00f6lders]]. Each fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (German: ''Staffel'') was divided into several flights (''Schw\u00e4rme'') of four aircraft. Each ''Schwarm'' was divided into two ''Rotten'', which was a pair of aircraft. Each ''Rotte'' was composed of a leader and a wingman. This flexible formation allowed the pilots to maintain greater situational awareness, and the two ''Rotten'' could split up at any time and attack on their own. The finger-four would become widely adopted as the fundamental tactical formation over the course of World War.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bf 109 G-2 trop RAF Museum London.jpg|thumb|left|[[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/Trop]] 'Black 6']]\n{{further|Aviation in World War II}}\nWorld War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] noted the effect of airpower: \"Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as [[ground-attack aircraft|tactical air support]] and [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].\n\n[[File:Mitsubishi Zero-Yasukuni.jpg|thumb|The long-range [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] typified the highly maneuverable, but lightly armored, fighter design.]]\n[[File:Macchi MC-200 920901-F-1234P-073.jpg|thumb|[[Macchi MC.200]] in the markings of 372\u00b0 Sq. ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'']]\nFighter design varied widely among combatants.  The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese [[Nakajima Ki-27]], [[Nakajima Ki-43]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] and the Italian [[Fiat G.50]] and [[Macchi MC.200]].  In contrast, designers in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create [[g-force|''g''-forces]] unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower.  In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.\n\n====European theater====\n[[File:Flight!

During the [[Battle of Britain]], however, British [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters.  Additionally Britain's radar-based [[Dowding system]] directing fighters onto German attacks and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving the UK from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI NR.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire XVI]] was typical of World War II fighters optimized for high level speeds and good climb rates.]]\n[[File:P-47 Thunderbolt 42-25068 2012 (7977124689).jpg|thumb|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]]]]\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], [[Soviet Air Force|Soviet fighter forces]] were overwhelmed during the opening phases of [[Operation Barbarossa]].  This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the [[Great Purge]], and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent [[Polikarpov I-15|I-15]] [[biplane]] and the [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]]. More modern Soviet designs, including the [[MiG-3]], [[LaGG-3]] and [[Yak-1]], had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, [[Axis powers|Axis]] air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights.\n\nIn the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. Since 1942 Soviet designs such as the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-5]] had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of [[Lend-Lease]], with the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids.  The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the [[Wehrmacht]].\n\n[[File:Me 262 flight show at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reproduction of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] in flight in 2006.

The [[Gloster Meteor]] was the first British jet fighter and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only [[jet aircraft]] to achieve combat operations during World War II.]]\n\nMeanwhile, air combat on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] had a much different character.  Much of this combat was centered around the [[strategic bombing]] campaigns of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] against German industry intended to wear down the Luftwaffe.  Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts.  The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped [[night fighter]]s for these battles.  The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany.  Unescorted [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf 109s and Fw 190s).  With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], American fighters were able to escort far into Germany on daylight raids and established control of the skies over Western Europe.\n\nBy the time of [[Operation Overlord]] in June 1944, the Allies had gained near complete air superiority over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].  This cleared the way both for intensified strategic bombing of German cities and industries, and for the [[tactical bombing]] of battlefield targets.  With the Luftwaffe largely cleared from the skies, Allied fighters increasingly served as attack aircraft.\n\nAllied fighters, by gaining air superiority over the European battlefield, played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Axis, which Reichmarshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander of the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' summed up when he said: \"When I saw [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"<ref>Sherman, Steven.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] primarily operated the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] flew the [[Nakajima Ki-27]] and the [[Nakajima Ki-43]], initially enjoying great success, as these fighters generally had better range, maneuverability, speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts.<ref name=\"Eden p. 370\">Eden p. 370</ref><ref>Ireland & Grove p. 182</ref> Additionally, Japanese pilots had received excellent training and many were combat veterans from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan's campaigns in China]].  They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies, who at this stage of the war were often disorganized, under-trained and poorly equipped, and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u20131942)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaysia and Singapore]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]] and [[Burma Campaign 1942\u20131943|Burma]].\n\n[[File:F4F-3 new pitot tube of later model.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat]], early 1942]]\nBy mid-1942, the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the [[Brewster Buffalo]] and the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan's Zero, others such as the Army's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] and the Navy's [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat]] possessed attributes such as superior firepower, ruggedness and dive speed, and the Allies soon developed tactics (such as the [[Thach Weave]]) to take advantage of these strengths.  These changes soon paid dividends, as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]] and [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]].  In China, the [[Flying Tigers]] also used the same tactics with some success, although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there.\n\n[[File:Ki-43-I captured in flight over Brisbane 1943.jpg|thumb|Captured Nakajima Ki-43-I under evaluation by the Allies]]\nBy 1943, the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign's air campaigns.  Several factors contributed to this shift.  First, the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] and second-generation Allied fighters such as the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcat]] and later the [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], began arriving in numbers.  These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability.  Other problems with Japan's fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed, such as their lack of armor and light armament, which made them inadequate as bomber interceptors or ground-attack planes&nbsp;\u2013 roles Allied fighters excelled at.  Most importantly, Japan's training program failed to provide enough well-trained pilots to replace losses.  In contrast, the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs.\n\n[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|thumb|Lockheed [[P-38 Lightning]]s in formation]]\nBy mid-1944, Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater, which would not be contested again during the war.  The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], a lopsided Allied victory in which Japanese fliers were downed in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great turkey shoot.\n\n[[File:Hellcats F6F-3, May 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Grumman F6F-3 Hellcats, May 1943]]\nLate in the war, Japan did begin to produce new fighters such as the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] and the [[Kawanishi N1K]] to replace the venerable Zero, but these were produced only in small numbers, and in any case by that time Japan lacked trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount a sustained challenge to Allied fighters.  During the closing stages of the war, Japan's fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]], and was largely relegated to [[Kamikaze]] tactics.\n\n====Technological innovations====\nFighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. [[Reciprocating engine|Piston-engine]]s, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between {{convert|1000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}  and {{convert|1400|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while by the end of the war many could produce over {{convert|2000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.  For example, the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a {{convert|1030|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin II]], while [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|variants]] produced in 1945 were equipped with the {{convert|2035|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon 61]]. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of [[compressibility]] created as aircraft and their propellers approached the [[sound barrier]], and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance.  German [[Fighter aircraft#First generation subsonic jet fighters (mid-1940s to mid-1950s)|jet]] and [[Fighter aircraft#Rocket-powered fighters|rocket]]-powered fighters entered combat in 1944, too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the [[Gloster Meteor]], also entered service.\n\n[[File:P-51-361.jpg|thumb|North American P-51D Mustang during WWII]]\nWorld War II fighters also increasingly featured [[monocoque]] construction, which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while adding structural strength. [[Laminar flow]] wings, which improved high speed performance, also came into use on fighters such as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], while the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] featured [[swept wing]]s that dramatically reduced [[Wave drag|drag]] at high subsonic speeds.\n\n[[File:FW190-D9.jpg|thumb|left|Focke-Wulf Fw 190D-9 fighter-bomber]]\n[[Armament]] also advanced during the war.  The rifle-caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era. Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons, which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 rather than relying on [[kinetic energy]] from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft, such as a fuel line or control cable, or the pilot. Cannons could bring down even [[heavy bomber]]s with just a few hits, but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast-moving fighters in a dogfight.  Eventually, most fighters mounted cannons, sometimes in combination with machine guns.\n\n[[File:ME-110G-2 at RAF Hendon.jpg|thumb|German Bf 110G-4 [[night fighter]] with nose-mounted radar at the [[RAF Museum]] in London]]\nThe British epitomized this shift. Their standard early war fighters mounted eight [[.303 British|{{convert|.303|in|mm|adj=on}} caliber]] machine guns, but by mid-war they often featured a combination of machine guns and [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20&nbsp;mm cannons]], and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a native cannon design, so instead placed multiple [[M2 Browning|.50&nbsp;caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[heavy machine gun]]s on their fighters.  Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and [[Air-to-ground weaponry|air-to-surface ordnance]] such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into [[close air support]] roles as [[fighter-bomber]]s. Although they carried less ordnance than [[light bomber|light]] and [[medium bomber|medium]] bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles.  Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which reduced [[Lift (force)|lift]] and increased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for the fighter escorts that bombers required.  Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], Britain's [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Hawker Tempest]], and America's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters.\n\n[[File:Northrop P-61 green airborne.jpg|left|thumb|A Northrop P-61 Black Widow of 419th Night Fighter Squadron]]\nWorld War II also saw the first use of airborne [[radar]] on fighters.  The primary purpose of these radars was to help [[night fighter]]s locate enemy bombers and fighters.  Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets, they could not be carried on conventional single-engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger [[heavy fighter]]s or [[light bomber]]s such as Germany's [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]], Britain's [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], and America's [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20]], which then served as night fighters.  The [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]], a purpose-built night fighter, was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design. Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar, and Germany's radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo-American efforts, while other combatants developed few radar-equipped fighters.\n\n===Post\u2013World War II period===\n[[File:LavochkinLa-9.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[Lavochkin La-9]]]]\n\nSeveral prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston-engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946. A typical example is the [[Lavochkin La-9]] 'Fritz', which was an evolution of the successful wartime [[Lavochkin La-7]] 'Fin'. Working through a series of prototypes, the La-120, La-126 and La-130, the [[Lavochkin|Lavochkin design bureau]] sought to replace the La-7's wooden airframe with a metal one, as well as fit a [[Laminar flow|laminar-flow]] wing to improve maneuver performance, and increased armament. The La-9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948; it also served as the basis for the development of a long-range escort fighter, the [[Lavochkin La-11|La-11]] 'Fang', of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947\u20131951. Over the course of the Korean War, however, it became obvious that the day of the piston-engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter.\n\n[[File:Ryan FR-1 Fireball VF-66 North Island 1945.jpg|thumb|A [[Ryan Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]] of [[VF-66]] at NAS North Island, 1945. This aircraft featured a piston engine for range and a jet engine in the tail for speed.]]\nThis period also witnessed experimentation with jet-assisted piston engine aircraft. La-9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary [[Pulse jet engine|pulsejet engines]] (the La-9RD) and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary [[ramjet|ramjet engines]] (the La-138); however, neither of these entered service. One that did enter service \u2013 with the U.S. Navy in March 1945 \u2013 was the [[FR Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]]; production was halted with the war's end on [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ-Day]], with only 66 having been delivered, and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947. The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop-turbojet-powered pre-production prototypes of the [[Consolidated Vultee XP-81]] fighter, but this program was also canceled by VJ Day, with 80% of the engineering work completed.\n\n==Rocket-powered fighters==\n{{main|Rocket-powered aircraft}}\n[[File:Me163efJM.jpg|thumb|The [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] was the fastest aircraft of WWII]]\n\nThe first [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was the [[Lippisch Ente]], which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928.<ref>Darling, David.

Only two were built.\n\nIn the 1950s, the British developed mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and jet engines to cover the performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable [[gliding]] return. The [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following [[Saunders-Roe SR.177|SR.177]]) obsolete. The American [[Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor]] (the first U.S. fighter to exceed [[Mach number|Mach 1]] in level flight) met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service. The only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was [[JATO|Rocket-Assisted Take Off]] (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the [[zero-length launch]], RATO-based takeoff scheme from special [[launch platform]]s, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in [[surface-to-air missile]] technology.\n\n==Jet-powered fighters==\n{{See also|Jet aircraft|Jet engine}}\n\nIt has become common in the aviation community to classify jet fighters by \"generations\" for historical purposes.<ref>For one representation, see: Yoon, Joe.

These timeframes also encompass the peak period of service entry for such aircraft.\n\n===First-generation subsonic jet fighters (mid-1940s to mid-1950s)===\n{{Main|First-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262A at the National Museum of the USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Messerschmitt Me 262A at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial, subsonic jet-fighter designs introduced late in World War II (1939\u20131945) and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed [[swept wing|unswept wings]]. Guns and cannon remained the principal armament. The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet-powered aircraft forward. Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines developed, and they approached transonic flight-speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off, making further speed increases nearly impossible.\n\n[[File:Gloster Meteor Mk III ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Gloster Meteor]]]]\nThe first jets developed during World War II and saw combat in the last two years of the war. [[Messerschmitt]] developed the first operational jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]]A, primarily serving with the Luftwaffe's [[JG 7]], the world's first jet-fighter wing. It was considerably faster than contemporary piston-driven aircraft, and in the hands of a competent pilot, proved quite difficult for Allied pilots to defeat. The Luftwaffe never deployed the design in numbers sufficient to stop the Allied air campaign, and a combination of fuel shortages, pilot losses, and technical difficulties with the engines kept the number of sorties low. Nevertheless, the Me 262 indicated the obsolescence of piston-driven aircraft. Spurred by reports of the German jets, Britain's [[Gloster Meteor]] entered production soon after, and the two entered service around the same time in 1944. Meteors commonly served to intercept the [[V-1 flying bomb]], as they were faster than available piston-engined fighters at the low altitudes used by the flying bombs. Nearer the end of World War II, the first military [[Light fighter#Early light jet fighters|jet-powered light-fighter]] design, the Luftwaffe intended the [[Heinkel He 162]]A ''Spatz'' (sparrow) to serve as a simple jet fighter for German home defense, with a few examples seeing squadron service with [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] by [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)#1945|April 1945]]. By the end of the war almost all work on piston-powered fighters had ended. A few designs combining piston- and jet-engines for propulsion \u2013 such as the [[Ryan FR Fireball]] \u2013 saw brief use, but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new fighters were jet-powered.\n\n[[File:Production P-80s af.jpg|thumb|left|USAF [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed P-80B Shooting Stars]] at Langley AFB]]\nDespite their advantages, the early jet-fighters were far from perfect. The operational lifespan of turbines were very short and engines were temperamental, while power could be adjusted only slowly and acceleration was poor (even if top speed was higher) compared to the final generation of piston fighters. Many squadrons of piston-engined fighters remained in service until the early to mid-1950s, even in the air forces of the major powers (though the types retained were the best of the World War II designs). Innovations including [[ejection seats]], [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]] and [[stabilator|all-moving tailplanes]] became widespread in this period.\n\nThe Americans began using jet fighters operationally after World War II, the wartime [[Bell P-59]] having proven a failure. The [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] (soon re-designated F-80) was less elegant than the swept-wing Me 262, but had a cruise speed ({{convert|660|km/h|mph|abbr= on}}) as high as the maximum speed attainable by many piston-engined fighters. The British designed several new jets, including the distinctive single-engined [[twin boom]] [[de Havilland Vampire]] which Britain sold to the air forces of many nations.\n\nThe British transferred the technology of the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] jet-engine to the Soviets, who soon put it to use in their advanced [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] fighter, which used fully [[swept wing]]s that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight-winged designs such as the F-80. The MiG-15s' top speed of {{convert|1075|km/h|0|abbr= on}} proved quite a shock to the American F-80 pilots who encountered them in the [[Korean War]], along with their armament of two 23&nbsp;mm cannons and a single 37&nbsp;mm cannon. Nevertheless, in the first jet-versus-jet dogfight, which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950, an F-80 shot down two North Korean MiG-15s.\n\n[[File:F2H Banshee VF-11 over Wonsan colour 1952.jpg|thumb|left| A US Navy [[McDonnell F2H Banshee|McDonnell F2H-2 Banshee]] over [[Wonsan]], North Korea, 1952]]\nThe Americans responded by rushing their own swept-wing fighter \u2013 the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] \u2013 into battle against the MiGs, which had similar [[Transonic speed|transsonic]] performance. The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses, but were similar enough that victory could go either way. While the Sabres focused primarily on downing MiGs and scored favorably against those flown by the poorly-trained North Koreans, the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service.\n\nThe world's navies also transitioned to jets during this period, despite the need for [[Aircraft catapult|catapult-launching]] of the new aircraft. The [[U.S. Navy]] adopted the [[Grumman F9F Panther]] as their primary jet fighter in the Korean War period, and it was one of the first jet fighters to employ an [[afterburner]]. The [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Sea Vampire]] became the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Radar was used on specialized night-fighters such as the [[Douglas F3D Skyknight]], which also downed MiGs over Korea, and later fitted to the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]] and swept-wing [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] and [[McDonnell F3H Demon]] as all-weather / night fighters. Early versions of [[Infra-red]] (IR) [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAMs) such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and radar-guided missiles such as the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] whose descendants remain in use {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}}, were first introduced on swept-wing subsonic Demon and Cutlass naval fighters.\n\n===Second-generation jet fighters (mid-1950s to early 1960s)===\n[[File:Lightning.inflight.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[English Electric Lightning]]]]\n{{main|Second-generation jet fighter}}\n\nTechnological breakthroughs, lessons learned from the aerial battles of the [[Korean War]], and a focus on conducting operations in a [[nuclear warfare]] environment shaped the development of second-generation fighters. Technological advances in [[aerodynamics]], [[Aircraft engine|propulsion]] and aerospace building-materials (primarily [[aluminium alloy|aluminum alloy]]s) permitted designers to experiment with [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] innovations such as [[swept wing]]s, [[delta wing]]s, and [[area rule|area-ruled]] fuselages. Widespread use of afterburning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation.\n\n[[File:Two Mirage III of the Royal Australian Air Force 1.JPEG|thumb|left| [[Dassault Mirage III]]]]\nFighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to carry aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning- and tracking-radars. Similarly, advances in guided-missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive-homing [[Infrared homing|infrared-guided (IR) missiles]] became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow [[field of view]] (typically no more than 30\u00b0), which limited their effective use to only close-range, [[tail-chase engagement]]s. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced{{by whom|date=August 2019}} as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These [[semi-active radar homing]] (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of [[Beyond Visual Range missile|\"beyond-visual-range\"]] (BVR) combat, and much effort concentrated on further development of this technology.\n\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21PF USAF.jpg|thumb|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21F]] interceptor]]\nThe prospect of a potential [[third world war]] featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear-weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptors]], such as the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]F; and [[fighter-bomber]]s, such as the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[Sukhoi Su-7B]]. [[Dogfight]]ing, ''per se'', became de-emphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond-visual ranges. As a result, strategists designed interceptors with a large missile-payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of high speed, altitude ceiling and [[rate of climb]]. With a primary air-defense role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defense interceptors often had limited range and little, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air-superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional [[gravity bomb]]s, and some were also equipped to deliver a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].\n\n===Third-generation jet fighters (early 1960s to circa 1970)===\n{{main|Third-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:QF-4 Holloman AFB.jpg|thumb|U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]\n[[File:Ecuadorian Air Force Dassault Mirage F1E.jpg|left|thumb| [[Ecuadorian Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage F1]]E]]\nThe third generation witnessed continued maturation of second-generation innovations, but it is most marked by renewed emphases on maneuverability and on traditional ground-attack capabilities. Over the course of the 1960s, increasing combat experience with guided missiles demonstrated that combat would devolve into close-in dogfights. Analog [[avionics]] began to appear, replacing older \"steam-gauge\" cockpit instrumentation. Enhancements to the aerodynamic performance of third-generation fighters included [[flight control surfaces]] such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], powered [[Leading edge slats|slats]], and [[blown flap]]s. A number of technologies would be tried for [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing]], but [[thrust vectoring]] would be successful on the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]].\n\nGrowth in air-combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air-to-air missiles, radar systems, and other avionics. While guns remained standard equipment (early models of F-4 being a notable exception), air-to-air missiles became the primary weapons for air-superiority fighters, which employed more sophisticated radars and medium-range RF AAMs to achieve greater \"stand-off\" ranges, however, kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) for spoofing radar seekers. Infrared-homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45\u00b0, which strengthened their tactical usability. Nevertheless, the low dogfight [[loss exchange ratio|loss-exchange ratios]] experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U.S. Navy to establish its famous [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|\"TOPGUN\"]] fighter-weapons school, which provided a graduate-level curriculum to train fleet fighter-pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and [[Dissimilar air combat training]] (DACT) tactics and techniques.\n\n[[File:MiG-23 Flogger G.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[MiG-23]]MLA \"Flogger-G\"]]\nThis era also saw an expansion in ground-attack capabilities, principally in guided missiles, and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack, including [[Terrain-following radar|terrain-avoidance systems]]. [[Air-to-surface missile]]s (ASM) equipped with electro-optical (E-O) contrast seekers \u2013 such as the initial model of the widely used [[AGM-65 Maverick]] \u2013 became standard weapons, and [[laser-guided bomb]]s (LGBs) became widespread in an effort to improve precision-attack capabilities. Guidance for such [[precision-guided munition]]s (PGM) was provided by externally-mounted [[targeting pods]], which were introduced{{by whom|date=August 2019}} in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe third generation also led to the development of new automatic-fire weapons, primarily [[Chain gun|chain-guns]] that use an electric motor to drive the mechanism of a cannon. This allowed a plane to carry a single multi-barrel weapon (such as the [[M61 Vulcan|20&nbsp;mm Vulcan]]), and provided greater accuracy and rates of fire. Powerplant reliability increased, and jet engines became \"smokeless\" to make it harder to sight aircraft at long distances.\n\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 010124-D-0000X-001.jpg|thumb|[[Shenyang J-8]]D in flight]]\nDedicated ground-attack aircraft (like the [[A-6 Intruder|Grumman A-6 Intruder]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[A-7 Corsair II|LTV A-7 Corsair II]]) offered longer range, more sophisticated night-attack systems or lower cost than supersonic fighters. With [[variable-geometry]] wings, the supersonic [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] introduced the [[Pratt & Whitney TF30]], the first turbofan equipped with afterburner. The ambitious project sought to create a versatile common fighter for many roles and services. It would serve well as an all-weather bomber, but lacked the performance to defeat other fighters. The [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell F-4 Phantom]] was designed around radar and missiles as an [[night fighter|all-weather interceptor]], but emerged as a versatile strike-bomber nimble enough to prevail in air combat, adopted by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. Despite numerous shortcomings that would be not be fully addressed until newer fighters, the Phantom claimed 280 aerial kills (more than any other U.S. fighter) over Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/Where-Have-All-the-Phantoms-Gone.html?c=y&page=5|title= History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places \u2013 Air & Space Magazine|work= airspacemag.com|accessdate= 1 April 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130512102520/http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/Where-Have-All-the-Phantoms-Gone.html?c=y&page=5|archive-date= 12 May 2013|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref> With range and payload capabilities that rivaled that of World War II bombers such as [[B-24 Liberator]], the Phantom would become a highly successful multirole aircraft.\n\n===Fourth-generation jet fighters (circa 1970 to mid-1990s)===\n{{main| Fourth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F-16 CJ Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb| A USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] taking off]]\n[[File:Saab JAS-39 Gripen of the Czech Air Force taking off from AFB \u010c\u00e1slav.jpg|thumb| [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|Saab JAS-39 Gripen]] of the [[Czech Air Force]] taking off from AFB \u010c\u00e1slav.]]\n[[File:43+98 German Air Force Panavia Tornado IDS ILA Berlin 2016 06.jpg|thumb| Side view of a [[German Air Force]] [[Panavia Tornado]].]]\n[[File:CF-188A BANKING.jpg|thumb| A Royal Canadian Air Force [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet]]]] Fourth-generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations, and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics- and weapon-systems. Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the [[Energy-Maneuverability theory|Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) theory]] developed by Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and mathematician Thomas Christie, based upon Boyd's combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter-tactics instructor during the 1960s. E-M theory emphasized the value of [[aircraft-specific energy]] maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting \"inside\" an adversary's decision-making cycle, a process Boyd called the \"[[OODA loop]]\" (for \"Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action\"). This approach emphasized aircraft designs capable of performing \"fast transients\" \u2013 quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction \u2013 as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone.\n\nE-M characteristics were first applied to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft with a larger, [[Lift (force)|higher-lift]] wing. The small size would minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and increase the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]], while the larger wing would minimize [[wing loading]]; while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range, it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing. The efforts of Boyd's \"[[Fighter mafia]]\" would result in the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]'s).\n\nThe F-16's maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called \"[[relaxed static stability]]\" (RSS), was made possible by introduction of the \"fly-by-wire\" (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight-control system]] (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and in system-integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement, but began to be replaced by digital flight-control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. Likewise, [[FADEC|Full Authority Digital Engine Controls]] (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls, earned it the [[sobriquet]] of \"the electric jet\". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs.\n\n[[File:F-15C.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] ]]\nOther innovative technologies introduced in fourth-generation fighters included [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[fire-control radar]]s (providing a \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" capability), [[head-up display]]s (HUD), [[HOTAS|\"hands on throttle-and-stick\"]] (HOTAS) controls, and [[multi-function display]]s (MFD), all essential equipment {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}}. Aircraft designers began to incorporate [[composite material]]s in the form of [[Composite honeycomb|bonded-aluminum honeycomb]] structural elements and [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|graphite epoxy]] [[laminate]] skins to reduce weight. [[Infra-red search and track|Infrared search-and-track]] (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. \"All-aspect\" IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range [[Active radar homing|active-radar-homing]] RF AAM entered service with the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], which solely equipped the [[F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment.\n\n[[File:DeutschMiG-29G(DF-SD-05-07712).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mikoyan MiG-29]] ]]\nAnother revolution came in the form of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardization of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and lubrication points, and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 [[man-hour]]s of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day. Some modern military aircraft only require 10-man-hours of work per hour of flight time, and others are even more efficient.\n\nAerodynamic innovations included [[Camber (aerodynamics)|variable-camber]] wings and exploitation of the [[Vortex lift|vortex lift effect]] to achieve higher [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] through the addition of [[Leading edge extension|leading-edge extension]] devices such as [[Strake (aviation)|strakes]].\n\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-27SKM at MAKS-2005 airshow.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Su-27]] 'Flanker']]\nUnlike interceptors of the previous eras, most fourth-generation air-superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters (although the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]] and [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado ADV]] are notable exceptions). The continually rising cost of fighters, however, continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters. The need for both types of fighters led to the \"high/low mix\" concept, which envisioned a high-capability and high-cost core of dedicated air-superiority fighters (like the F-15 and [[Su-27]]) supplemented by a larger contingent of lower-cost [[multi-role fighter]]s (such as the F-16 and [[MiG-29]]).\n\n[[File:Mirage 2000C in-flight 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage 2000]]]]\nMost fourth-generation fighters, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], [[HAL Tejas]], [[JF-17]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000]], are true multirole warplanes, designed as such from the start. This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became ''pass\u00e9'' (with the [[Panavia Tornado]] being an exception in this regard). Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated [[ground-attack aircraft]] such as the [[Sukhoi Su-25]] and the [[Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]].\n\nA typical [[US Air Force]] fighter [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of the period might contain a mix of one air superiority [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (F-15C), one strike fighter squadron (F-15E), and two multirole fighter squadrons (F-16C).<ref name=Worley>{{cite book|title=Shaping U.S. military forces: revolution or relevance in a post\u2013Cold War world|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99031-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1ME5BWMnmgC&pg=PA125|author=Duane Robert Worley|accessdate=20 January 2011|page=125}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most novel technology introduced for combat aircraft was ''[[Stealth technology|stealth]]'', which involves the use of special \"low-observable\" (L-O) materials and design techniques to reduce the susceptibility of an aircraft to detection by the enemy's sensor systems, particularly radars. The first [[stealth aircraft]] introduced were the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] attack aircraft (introduced in 1983) and the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] bomber (first flew in 1989). Although no stealthy fighters per se appeared among the fourth generation, some radar-absorbent coatings and other L-O treatments developed for these programs are reported to have been subsequently applied to fourth-generation fighters.\n\n===4.5th-generation jet fighters (1990s to 2000)===\n[[File:IAF Tejas full size (32941198511).jpg|thumb|left|[[HAL Tejas]] ]]\n\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a \"[[peace dividend]]\". Air force inventories were cut. Research and development programs working on \"fifth-generation\" fighters took serious hits. Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s, and those that survived were \"stretched out\". While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses, it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long-term. In this instance, however, it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers, avionics and other flight electronics, which had become possible largely due to the advances made in [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] and [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor]] technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth-generation designs \u2013 or redesigns \u2013 with significantly enhanced capabilities. These improved designs have become known as \"Generation 4.5\" fighters, recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations, and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth-generation technologies.\n\n[[File:RSAF Typhoon at Malta - Gordon Zammit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Eurofighter Typhoon]] ]]\nThe primary characteristics of this sub-generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials, modest signature reduction (primarily RF \"stealth\"), and highly integrated systems and weapons. These fighters have been designed to operate in a \"[[Network-centric warfare|network-centric]]\" battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft. Key weapons technologies introduced include [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond-visual-range]] (BVR) AAMs; [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-guided weapons, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radars; [[Helmet mounted display|helmet-mounted sights]]; and improved secure, jamming-resistant [[Data link|datalinks]]. Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4.5th generation fighters, and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of \"[[supercruise]]\" ability. Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal-aspect [[radar cross section]] (RCS) signature-reduction techniques including [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials]] (RAM), L-O coatings and limited shaping techniques.\n[[File:Rafale receives fuel from a KC-10.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|French Air Force [[Dassault Rafale]] during aerial refueling]]\n\"Half-generation\" designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory to previous iterations; however, these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight, greater fuel fractions to increase range, and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors. Prime examples of such aircraft, which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of [[Carbon fiber|carbon-fiber composites]], include the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Dassault Rafale]], and [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]].\n\nApart from these fighter jets, most of the 4.5 generation aircraft are actually modified variants of existing airframes from the earlier fourth generation fighter jets. Such fighter jets are generally heavier and examples include the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], which is an evolution of the 1970s [[F/A-18 Hornet]] design, the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], which is a ground-attack/multi-role variant of the [[F-15 Eagle]], the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] variants of the [[Sukhoi Su-30]] and the [[Mikoyan MiG-29M|MiG-29M]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-35|MiG-35]], upgraded versions of the [[Mikoyan MiG-29]]. The Su-30MKI and MiG-35 feature [[thrust vectoring]] engine nozzles to enhance maneuvering. The upgraded version of F-16 is also considered a member of the 4.5 generation aircraft.<ref>IBP, Inc (March 2009), US Aviation and Aerospace Industry Handbook Volume 2 Military Equipment and Developments, p. 54\u201355</ref>\n\n4.5 generation fighters first entered service in the early 1990s, and most of them are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level of stealth technology needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat.\n\nThe U.S. government has defined 4.5 generation fighter aircraft as those that \"(1) have advanced capabilities, including\u2014 (A) AESA radar; (B) high capacity data-link; and (C) enhanced avionics; and (2) have the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments.\"<ref>[http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543 CRS RL33543, Tactical Aircraft Modernization: Issues for Congress 9 July 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830143750/http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543/ |date=30 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |title=H.R.2647: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \u2013 U.S. Congress \u2013 OpenCongress |work=OpenCongress |accessdate=1 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103092023/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |archivedate=3 November 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Fifth-generation jet fighters (2005 to the present)===\n{{main|Fifth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F22 Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|A flight of two USAF [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\nCurrently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction [[Active electronically scanned array|AESA]] radars with [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|high-bandwidth]], low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The [[Infra-red search and track]] sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced [[avionics]], [[glass cockpit]]s, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor [[data fusion]] for vastly improved [[situational awareness]] while easing the pilot's workload.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html LockMart's 5TH Generation Fighters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806082314/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html |date=6 August 2009 }}</ref> Avionics suites rely on extensive use of [[VHSIC|very high-speed integrated circuit]] (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed [[Bus (computing)|data buses]]. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a \"first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability\".\n\n[[File:Sukhoi T-50 Maksimov.jpg|thumb|Russian Air Force [[Sukhoi Su-57]]]]\n[[File:J-20 at Airshow China 2016.jpg|thumb|PLAAF [[Chengdu J-20]]]]\nA key attribute of fifth-generation fighters is a small [[radar cross-section]]. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced to the point where it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, [[Thermosetting plastic|thermoset]] and [[Thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the [[Northrop YF-23]]), and coating internal and external metal areas with [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials and paint]] (RAM/RAP).\n\nThe AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters (and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4.5 aircraft designs, as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth-generation aircraft). In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features, it enables the fighter to function as a sort of \"mini-[[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]]\", providing high-gain [[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic support measures]] (ESM) and [[electronic warfare]] (EW) jamming functions.  Other technologies common to this latest generation of fighters includes integrated electronic warfare system (INEWS) technology, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI) avionics technology, centralized \"vehicle health monitoring\" systems for ease of maintenance, [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optics data transmission]], [[stealth technology]] and even hovering capabilities.  Maneuver performance remains important and is enhanced by thrust-vectoring, which also helps reduce takeoff and landing distances. Supercruise may or may not be featured; it permits flight at supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburner \u2013 a device that significantly increases IR signature when used in full military power.\n\n[[File:F-35A flight (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|USAF [[Lockheed Martin F-35A]]]]\nSuch aircraft are sophisticated and expensive. The fifth generation was ushered in by the [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor]] in late 2005. The U.S. Air Force originally planned to acquire 650 F-22s, but now only 187 will be built. As a result, its unit [[flyaway cost]] (FAC) is around US$150&nbsp;million. To spread the development costs \u2013 and production base \u2013 more broadly, the [[Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program enrolls eight other countries as cost- and risk-sharing partners. Altogether, the nine partner nations anticipate procuring over 3,000 [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] fighters at an anticipated average FAC of $80\u201385&nbsp;million. The F-35, however, is designed to be a family of three aircraft, a [[CTOL|conventional take-off and landing]] (CTOL) fighter, a [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical landing]] (STOVL) fighter, and a [[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR) fighter, each of which has a different unit price and slightly varying specifications in terms of fuel capacity (and therefore range), size and [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]].\n\nOther countries have initiated fifth-generation fighter development projects, with Russia's [[Sukhoi Su-57]] and [[Mikoyan LMFS]]. In December 2010, it was discovered that China is developing the 5th generation fighter [[Chengdu J-20]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/chinese-j20-stealth-fighter-image-military-power |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Jonathan |last1=Watts |first2=Julian |last2=Borger |title=Chinese jet fighter 'sighting' raises fears over region's military power balance |date=5 January 2011 |access-date=17 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110025310/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/chinese-j20-stealth-fighter-image-military-power |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The J-20 took its maiden flight in January 2011.

From the late 1950s forward guided missiles came into use for air to air combat. Throughout this history fighters which by surprise or maneuver attain a good firing position have achieved the kill about one third to one half the time, no matter what weapons were carried.<ref>Sprey, p.54.</ref> The only major historic exception to this has been the low effectiveness shown by guided missiles in the first one to two decades of their existence.<ref>Sprey, pp. 116\u2013132.</ref><ref>Higby, p.3, pp. 7\u201314.</ref>\n[[File:F-104 Waffenschacht.jpg|thumb|M61 20&nbsp;mm gun installation on West German [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] ]]\nFrom WWI to the present fighter aircraft have featured machine guns and [[autocannons|automatic cannons]] as weapons, and they are still considered as essential back-up weapons today. The power of air-to-air guns has increased greatly over time, and has kept them relevant in the guided missile era.<ref>Shaw, Robert (Cmdr, USN), ''Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering'', Naval Institute Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-87021-059-9}}, pp. 1\u201321.</ref> In WWI two rifle caliber machine guns was the typical armament <!-- majority of aircraft been French, German (7.92 mm) or British (0.303) --> producing a weight of fire of about {{convert|0.4|kg|abbr=on}} per second.  The standard WWII American fighter armament of six 0.50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns fired a bullet weight of approximately 3.7&nbsp;kg/sec (8.1&nbsp;lbs/sec), at a muzzle velocity of 856&nbsp;m/s (2,810&nbsp;ft/s). British and German aircraft tended to use a mix of machine guns and autocannon, the latter firing explosive projectiles. The modern [[M61 Vulcan]] 20&nbsp;mm rotating barrel Gatling gun that is standard on current American fighters fires a projectile weight of about 10&nbsp;kg/s (22&nbsp;lb/s), nearly three times that of six 0.50-cal machine guns, with higher velocity of 1,052&nbsp;m/s (3450&nbsp;ft/s) supporting a flatter trajectory, and with exploding projectiles.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p.6.</ref> Modern fighter gun systems also feature ranging radar and lead computing electronic gun sights to ease the problem of aim point to compensate for projectile drop and time of flight (target lead) in the complex three dimensional maneuvering of air-to-air combat. However, getting in position to use the guns is still a challenge. The range of guns is longer than in the past but still quite limited compared to missiles, with modern gun systems having a maximum effective range of approximately 1,000 meters.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p. 15.</ref> High probability of kill also requires firing to usually occur from the rear hemisphere of the target.<ref>Shaw, 1985, pp. 16\u201324.</ref> Despite these limits, when pilots are well trained in air-to-air gunnery and these conditions are satisfied, gun systems are tactically effective and highly cost efficient. The cost of a gun firing pass is far less than firing a missile,<ref>Accurate data on modern gun pass cost is difficult to acquire, but during the Korean War was approximately $120.  In 1970 a heat seeking missile shot was approximately $7000, and a radar guided missile shot about $40,000.  Source: Stevenson, \"The Pentagon Paradox\", p.125.</ref> and the projectiles are not subject to the thermal and electronic countermeasures than can sometimes defeat missiles. When the enemy can be approached to within gun range, the lethality of guns is approximately a 25% to 50% chance of \"kill per firing pass\".<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp. 113\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe range limitations of guns, and the desire to overcome large variations in fighter pilot skill and thus achieve higher force effectiveness, led to the development of the guided [[air-to-air missile]]. There are two main variations, heat-seeking (infrared homing), and radar guided. Radar missiles are typically several times heavier and more expensive than heat-seekers, but with longer range, greater destructive power, and ability to track through clouds.\n\nThe highly successful [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] heat-seeking (infrared homing) short-range missile was developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s. These small missiles are easily carried by lighter fighters, and provide effective ranges of approximately 10 to 35&nbsp;km (~6 to 22 miles). Beginning with the AIM-9L in 1977, subsequent versions of Sidewinder have added [[all-aspect]] capability, the ability to use the lower heat of air to skin friction on the target aircraft to track from the front and sides. The latest (2003 service entry) AIM-9X also features \"off-boresight\" and \"lock on after launch\" capabilities, which allow the pilot to make a quick launch of a missile to track a target anywhere within the pilot's vision. The AIM-9X development cost was U.S. $3&nbsp;billion in mid to late 1990s dollars,<ref>\"AIM-9X Sidewinder Air-to-air Missile\", Raytheon Systems Company, available at http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/pdf/navy/00aim9x.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201123404/http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/pdf/navy/00aim9x.pdf |date=1 February 2017 }}</ref> and 2015 per unit procurement cost is $0.6&nbsp;million each. The missile weighs 85.3&nbsp;kg (188&nbsp;lbs), and has a maximum range of 35&nbsp;km (22 miles) at higher altitudes. Like most air-to-air missiles, lower altitude range can be as limited as only about one third of maximum due to higher drag and less ability to coast downward.<ref>''Modern Fighter Combat'', Mike Spick, p.14.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of heat-seeking missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War,<ref>Sprey, 1982, p.82.</ref> but improved to approximately 15%\u201340% over the course of the war. The [[AIM-4 Falcon]] used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%.<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp.116\u2013118.</ref> Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], achieving 60 kills and 10 losses.<ref>Coram, p.219</ref> However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]].

In the historically more common [[semi-active radar homing]] case the missile homes in on radar signals transmitted from launching aircraft and reflected from the target. This has the disadvantage that the firing aircraft must maintain radar lock on the target and is thus less free to maneuver and more vulnerable to attack. A widely deployed missile of this type was the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], which entered service in 1954 and was produced in improving versions until 1997. In more advanced [[active radar homing]] the missile is guided to the vicinity of the target by internal data on its projected position, and then \"goes active\" with an internally carried small radar system to conduct terminal guidance to the target. This eliminates the requirement for the firing aircraft to maintain radar lock, and thus greatly reduces risk. A prominent example is the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], which was first fielded in 1991 as the AIM-7 replacement, and which has no firm retirement date {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. The current AIM-120D version has a maximum high altitude range of greater than 160&nbsp;km (>99 miles), and cost approximately $2.4&nbsp;million each (2016). As is typical with most other missiles, range at lower altitude may be as little as one third that of high altitude.\n\nIn the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] radar guided missiles in a row without a hit.<ref>Stevenson, p. 9.</ref> Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only four of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles.<ref>Burton, James (Col., U.S. Air Force), ''The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard'', Chapter 1, Kindle Location 471, Naval Institute Press, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-61251-369-0}}.</ref> The United States invested over $10&nbsp;billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s.<ref>Stevenson, p. 36.</ref> Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over $130&nbsp;million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, \u221219s, and \u221221s, with new cost of $0.3&nbsp;million to $3&nbsp;million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness.\n[[File:ILA 2008 PD 446.JPG|left|thumb|An [[Meteor (missile)|MBDA Meteor]], an [[Active radar homing|ARH]] [[Beyond-visual-range missile|BVR]] [[Air-to-air missile|AAM]] used on the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]], [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35]], and [[Dassault Rafale]].|alt=]]\nHowever, continuing heavy development investment and rapidly advancing electronic technology led to significant improvement in radar missile reliabilities from the late 1970s onward.

Taking maximum advantage of complicated missile parameters in both attack and defense against competent opponents does take considerable experience and skill,<ref>Shaw, pp.45\u201361.</ref> but against surprised opponents lacking comparable capability and countermeasures, air-to-air missile warfare is relatively simple. By partially automating air-to-air combat and reducing reliance on gun kills mostly achieved by only a small expert fraction of fighter pilots, air-to-air missiles now serve as highly effective force multipliers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of fighter aircraft]]\n* [[Warbird]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{citation |title=Gripen, the First Fourth Generation Fighter |first1=Jan |last1=Ahlgren|first2=Anders |last2=Linner |first3=Lars |last3=Wigert |publisher=Swedish Air Force and Saab Aerospace |date= 2002|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard |first=James |last=Burton |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date= 1993 |isbn=978-1-61251-369-0}}\n*{{citation |title= Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939 |first=Alvin |last=Coox |publisher=Stanford University Press |date= 1985 |isbn=0-8047-1160-7}}\n*{{citation |title=Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War |first=Robert |last=Coram |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |date=2002 |isbn=0-316-88146-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316881463 }}\n*{{citation |title=The Fighter Aircraft Pocket Book|first=Roy|last=Cross|publisher=Jarrold and Sons, Ltd.|date= 1962}}\n*{{citation |title= The Encyclopedia of Aircraft of WWII |first=Paul |last=Eden |publisher=Amber Books, Ltd, London |date= 2004 |isbn=1-904687-07-5}}\n*{{citation |title=Jane's War at Sea |first1=Eric |last1=Grove |first2=Bernard |last2=Ireland |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers, UK |date=1997 |isbn=0-00-472065-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/janeswaratsea18900irel }}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Air Combat |first1=Bill|last1=Gunston|first2=Mike|last2=Spick|publisher=Crescent Books|date= 1983|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security |first=Grant T. |last=Hammond |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |date= 2001 |isbn=1-56098-941-6}}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Combat Aircraft Design |first=Klaus |last=Huenecke |publisher=Airlife Publishing Limited |date=1987 |isbn=0-517-412659 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modernaircombata0000guns }}\n*{{citation |title=Fighter Facts and Fallacies |first=John |last=Lee |publisher=William Morrow and Company |date= 1942 }}\n*Munson, Kenneth (1976).

The key performance features of a fighter include not only its [[firepower]] but also its high speed and [[maneuverability]] relative to the target aircraft.\n\nThe fighter's main tactical purpose is to establish [[air supremacy|air superiority]] over the battlefield. The success or failure of a combatant's efforts to gain air superiority hinges on several factors including the skill of its pilots, the tactical soundness of its doctrine for deploying its fighters, and the numbers and performance of those fighters.\n\nMany fighters have secondary capabilities such as [[ground-attack aircraft|ground attack]] and some types, such as [[fighter-bomber]]s,  are designed from the outset for dual roles. Other fighter designs are highly specialized while still filling the main air superiority role, these include the [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], [[heavy fighter]], and [[night fighter]].\n\n==Classification==\nA fighter aircraft is primarily designed for [[air-to-air combat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fighter |title=Fighter \u2014Definition and More from the Free Merriam Webster Dictionary. |date=22 September 2011 |work=Merriam Webster Dictionary |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109080608/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fighter |archive-date=9 November 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref> A given type may be designed for specific combat conditions, and in some cases for additional roles such as air-to-ground fighting. Historically the British [[Royal Flying Corps]] and [[Royal Air Force]] referred to them as \"[[Scout (aircraft)|scouts]]\" until the early 1920s, while the [[U.S. Army]] called them \"pursuit\" aircraft until the late 1940s. The UK changed to calling them fighters in the 1920s, while the US Army did so in the 1940s. A short-range fighter designed to defend against incoming enemy aircraft is known as an [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]].\n\nRecognised classes of fighter include:\n*[[Air superiority fighter]]\n*[[Fighter-bomber]]\n*[[Heavy fighter]]\n*[[Interceptor aircraft|Interceptor]]\n*[[Light fighter]]\n*[[All-weather fighter]] (including the [[night fighter]])\n*[[Reconnaissance fighter]]\n*[[Strategic fighter]] (including the [[escort fighter]] and [[strike fighter]])\n\nOf these, the [[Fighter-bomber]], [[reconnaissance fighter]] and [[strike fighter]] classes are dual-role, possessing qualities of the fighter alongside some other battlefield role. Some fighter designs may be developed in variants performing other roles entirely, such as [[ground-attack aircraft|ground attack]] or unarmed [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. This may be for political or national security reasons, for advertising purposes, or other reasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/nonstandard-mds.html |title=Non-Standard DOD Aircraft Designations |author=Andreas Parsch |date=22 September 2011 |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927004151/http://www.designation-systems.net/usmilav/nonstandard-mds.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Sopwith Camel]] and other \"fighting scouts\" of World War I performed a great deal of ground-attack work. In World War II, the [[USAAF]] and [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] often favored fighters over dedicated light bombers or [[dive bombers]], and types such as the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] and [[Hawker Hurricane]] that were no longer competitive as aerial combat fighters were relegated to ground attack. Several aircraft, such as the F-111 and F-117, have received fighter designations though they had no fighter capability due to political or other reasons. The F-111B variant was originally intended for a fighter role with the [[U.S. Navy]], but it was canceled. This blurring follows the use of fighters from their earliest days for \"attack\" or \"strike\" operations against ground targets by means of [[strafing]] or dropping small bombs and incendiaries. Versatile multirole fighter-bombers such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]] are a less expensive option than having a range of specialized aircraft types.\n\nSome of the most expensive fighters such as the US [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]] and Russian [[Sukhoi Su-27]] were employed as all-weather [[interceptor aircraft|interceptors]] as well as [[air superiority fighter]] aircraft, while commonly developing air-to-ground roles late in their careers. An interceptor is generally an aircraft intended to target (or intercept) bombers and so often trades maneuverability for climb rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northcentralwis.net/wimuzikman/airterms.html|title=Military Aircraft Terminology|website=www.northcentralwis.net|access-date=18 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180727014559/http://www.northcentralwis.net/wimuzikman/airterms.html|archive-date=27 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs a part of military nomenclature, a letter is often assigned to various types of aircraft to indicate their use, along with a number to indicate the specific aircraft. The letters used to designate a fighter differ in various countries&nbsp;\u2013 in the English-speaking world, \"F\" is now used to indicate a fighter (e.g. [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] or [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire F.22]]), though when the pursuit designation was used in the US, they were \"P\" types (e.g. [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]]). In Russia \"I\" was used ([[Polikarpov I-16]]), while the French continue to use \"C\" ([[Nieuport 17|Nieuport 17 C.1]]).\n\n===Air superiority fighter===\n{{main|Air superiority fighter}}\nAs fighter types have proliferated, the air superiority fighter emerged as a specific role at the pinnacle of speed, manoeuvrability and air-to-air weapon systems, able to hold its own against all other fighters and establish its dominance in the skies above the battlefield.\n\n===Interceptor===\n{{main|Interceptor aircraft}}\nThe interceptor is a fighter designed specifically to intercept and engage approaching enemy aircraft. There are two general classes of interceptor: relatively [[Light fighter|lightweight]] aircraft in the point-defence role, built for fast reaction, high performance and with a short range, and heavier aircraft with more comprehensive avionics and designed to fly at night or in all weathers and to operate over longer [[Range (aeronautics)|range]]s. Originating during World War I, by 1929 this class of fighters had become known as the interceptor.<ref>[https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1929/1929-1%20-%201764.html The Gloster S.S.8], ''Flight'', 6 December 1929, Page 1273: \"the type of single-seater fighter known as an \"Interceptor\" is a class of aircraft designed, as the title suggests, for intercepting hostile   aircraft.\"</ref>\n\n===Night and all-weather fighters===\n{{main|Night fighter}}\nThe equipment necessary for daytime flight is inadequate when flying at night or in poor visibility. The night fighter was developed during World War I with additional equipment to aid the pilot in flying straight, navigating and finding the target. From modified variants of the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c]] in 1915, the night fighter has evolved into the highly capable all-weather fighter.<ref>Gunston, Bill (1976), ''Night Fighters: A Development and Combat History', Patrick Stephens.[https://archive.org/details/nightfightersdev0000guns <!-- quote=\"first night fighter\". -->]</ref>\n\n===Strategic fighters===\n{{main|Strategic fighter}}\nThe strategic fighter is a fast, heavily-armed and long-range type, able to act as an [[escort fighter]] protecting [[bomber aircraft|bombers]], to carry out offensive sorties of its own as a [[penetration fighter]] and maintain standing patrols at significant distance from its home base.<ref>Gunston, Bill (1970), ''Warplanes of the Third Reich'', Macdonald and Jane's. p.573.</ref>\n\n[[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] are vulnerable due to their low speed and poor maneuvrability. The escort fighter was developed during World War II to come between the bombers and enemy attackers as a protective shield. The primary requirement was for long range, with several [[heavy fighter]]s given the role. However they too proved unwieldy and vulnerable, so as the war progressed techniques such as [[drop tank]]s were developed to extend the range of more nimble conventional fighters.\n\nThe [[penetration fighter]] is typically also fitted for the [[ground-attack aircraft|ground-attack]] role, and so is able to defend itself while conducting attack sorties.\n\n==Historical overview==\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|Landing on {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} in a [[Sopwith Pup]] scout]]\n\nSince World War I, achieving and maintaining air superiority has been considered essential for victory in [[conventional warfare]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/aspc/text/theory/mitch.htm |title=Mitchell's Theory |date=22 September 2011 |work=Air & Space Power Course |publisher=College of Aerospace Doctrine, Research and Education |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120010348/http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/aspc/text/theory/mitch.htm |archive-date=20 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nFighters continued to be developed throughout World War I, to deny enemy aircraft and [[airship|dirigibles]] the ability to gather information by [[reconnaissance]] over the battlefield. Early fighters were very small and lightly armed by later standards, and most were [[biplane]]s built with a wooden frame covered with fabric, and a maximum airspeed of about {{convert|100|mph|abbr=on}}. As control of the airspace over armies became increasingly important, all of the major powers developed fighters to support their military operations. Between the wars, wood was largely replaced in part or whole by metal tubing, and finally aluminum stressed skin structures (monocoque) began to predominate.\n\nBy [[World War II]], most fighters were all-metal [[monoplane]]s armed with batteries of [[machine gun]]s or [[Autocannon|cannons]] and some were capable of speeds approaching {{convert|400|mph|abbr=on}}. Most fighters up to this point had one engine, but a number of twin-engine fighters were built; however they were found to be outmatched against single-engine fighters and were relegated to other tasks, such as night fighters equipped with primitive radar sets.\n\n[[File:Hawker Sea Hurricanes.jpg|thumb|[[Hawker Hurricane|Hawker Sea Hurricanes]] in formation]]\nBy the end of the war, [[turbojet]] engines were replacing piston engines as the means of propulsion, further increasing aircraft speed. Since the weight of the turbojet engine was far less than a piston engine, having two engines was no longer a handicap and one or two were used, depending on requirements.  This in turn required the development of ejection seats so the pilot could escape, and [[G-suit]]s to counter the much greater forces being applied to the pilot during maneuvers.\n\n[[File:MiG-17 underside.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] underside]]\nIn the 1950s, [[radar]] was fitted to day fighters, since due to ever increasing air-to-air weapon ranges, pilots could no longer see far enough ahead to prepare for the opposition. Subsequently, radar capabilities grew enormously and are now the primary method of [[target acquisition]]. Wings were made thinner and swept back to reduce transonic drag, which required new manufacturing methods to obtain sufficient strength. Skins were no longer sheet metal riveted to a structure, but milled from large slabs of alloy. The sound barrier was broken, and after a few false starts due to required changes in controls, speeds quickly reached Mach 2, past which aircraft cannot maneuver sufficiently to avoid attack.\n\n[[Air-to-air missile]]s largely replaced guns and rockets in the early 1960s since both were believed unusable at the speeds being attained, however the [[Vietnam War]] showed that guns still had a role to play, and most fighters built since then are fitted with cannon (typically between 20 and 30&nbsp;mm in [[caliber]]) in addition to missiles. Most modern combat aircraft can carry at least a pair of air-to-air missiles.\n\n[[File:Lockheed Martin F-22.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[F-22A Raptor]] stealth fighter.]]\nIn the 1970s, turbofans replaced turbojets, improving fuel economy enough that the last piston engined support aircraft could be replaced with jets, making multi-role combat aircraft possible. Honeycomb structures began to replace milled structures, and the first composite components began to appear on components subjected to little stress.\n\nWith the steady improvements in computers, defensive systems have become increasingly efficient. To counter this, stealth technologies have been pursued by the United States, Russia, India and China. The first step was to find ways to reduce the aircraft's reflectivity to radar waves by burying the engines, eliminating sharp corners and diverting any reflections away from the radar sets of opposing forces. Various materials were found to absorb the energy from radar waves, and were incorporated into special finishes that have since found widespread application. Composite structures have become widespread, including major structural components, and have helped to counterbalance the steady increases in aircraft weight\u2014most modern fighters are larger and heavier than World War II medium bombers.\n\nBecause of the importance of air superiority, since the early days of aerial combat armed forces have constantly competed to develop technologically superior fighters and to deploy these fighters in greater numbers, and fielding a viable fighter fleet consumes a substantial proportion of the defense budgets of modern armed forces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/08/exclusive-us-air-force-combat.html |title=Xclusive: US Air Force combat fleet's true operational costs revealed |author=[[Stephen Trimble]] |date=22 September 2011 |work=Stephen Trimble's The Dew Line |publisher=Flight Global |access-date=25 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120129021417/http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/the-dewline/2011/08/exclusive-us-air-force-combat.html |archive-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe global combat aircraft market was worth $45.75&nbsp;billion in 2017 and is projected by [[Frost & Sullivan]] at $47.2&nbsp;billion in 2026: 35% modernization programs and 65% aircraft purchases, dominated by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35]] with 3,000 deliveries over 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/combat-aircraft-market-strong-over-next-decade-repo-455132/ |title= Combat aircraft market strong over next decade: report |date= 18 January 2019 |author= Garrett Reim |work= Flightglobal |access-date= 19 January 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190119174527/https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/combat-aircraft-market-strong-over-next-decade-repo-455132/ |archive-date= 19 January 2019 |url-status= live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Piston engine fighters==\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Vickers F.B.5. Gunbus.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] ]]\n{{further|Aviation in World War I}}\n\nThe word \"fighter\" was first used to describe a two-seater aircraft with sufficient lift to carry a machine gun and its operator as well as the [[Aviator|pilot]]. Some of the first such \"fighters\" belonged to the \"gunbus\" series of experimental gun carriers of the British [[Vickers]] company that culminated in the [[Vickers F.B.5|Vickers F.B.5 Gunbus]] of 1914. The main drawback of this type of aircraft was its lack of speed. Planners quickly realized that an aircraft intended to destroy its kind in the air had to be fast enough to catch its quarry.\n\nOne of the first companies to develop an armed aircraft was Vickers. Their Type 18 Destroyer of 1913 was a two-seat pusher type, with the pilot behind and an observer/gunner in front and a machine gun fitted in the nose on a pivoting mount. It would be developed as the [[Vickers F.B.5|F.B.5 \"Gunbus\"]] and introduced into service in 1915.<ref>Munson (1976), pp.101-2</ref>\n\nHowever at the outbreak of [[World War I]], front-line aircraft were unarmed and used almost entirely for [[reconnaissance]]. On 15 August 1914, [[Miodrag Tomi\u0107]] encountered an enemy plane while conducting a reconnaissance flight over Austria-Hungary. The enemy pilot shot at Tomi\u0107's plane with a revolver.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} Tomi\u0107 produced a pistol of his own and fired back.{{sfn|Blume|1968|p=291}}{{sfnm|1a1=Glenny|1y=2012|1p=316|2a1=Buttar|2y=2014|2p=298}} It was considered the first exchange of fire between aircraft in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PxGkAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA298|title=Collision of Empires: The War on the Eastern Front in 1914|first=Prit|last=Buttar|date=20 June 2014|publisher=Bloomsbury USA|via=Google Books}}</ref> Within weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian aircraft were armed.{{sfn|Glenny|2012|p=316}} Machine guns were soon fitted to existing reconnaissance types for use by the observer, but none of these was a true fighter plane.\n\nAnother type of military aircraft was to form the basis for an effective \"fighter\" in the modern sense of the word. It was based on the small fast aircraft developed before the war for such [[Air racing|air races]] as the Gordon Bennett Cup and [[Schneider Trophy]]. The military '''[[Scout (aircraft)|scout]]''' airplane was not expected to carry serious armament, but rather to rely on its speed to reach the scout or reconnoiter location and return quickly to report&nbsp;\u2013 essentially an aerial horse. British scout aircraft, in this sense, included the [[Sopwith Tabloid]] and [[Bristol Scout]]. French equivalents included the [[Morane-Saulnier N]].\n\nThe next advance came with the fixed forward-firing machine gun, so that the pilot pointed the whole plane at the target and fired the gun, instead of relying on a second gunner. [[Roland Garros (aviator)]] bolted metal deflector plates to the propeller so that it would not shoot itself out of the sky and a number of [[Morane-Saulnier N]]s were modified. The technique proved effective, however the deflected bullets were still highly dangerous.<ref>Angelucci, A. and Matricardi, P. ''World Aircraft: Origins - World War I'', Sampson Low, 1977, p.110.</ref>\n\nThe next fighter manufactured in any quantity was the [[Fokker E.I]] ''Eindecker'' and its derivatives, whose introduction in 1915, only a few months after the appearance of the slower Gunbus, ushered in what the Allies came to call the \"[[Fokker scourge]]\" and a period of air superiority for the German forces. Although it still had mediocre flying qualities, the Fokker's unique innovation was an [[interrupter gear]] which allowed the gun to fire through the propeller arc without hitting the blades.<ref>Munson (1976), p.161.</ref>\n\n[[File:Airco D.H.2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[Airco DH.2]] \"pusher\" scout]]\nSoon after the commencement of the war, pilots armed themselves with pistols, [[carbines]], [[grenade]]s, and an assortment of improvised weapons. Many of these proved ineffective as the pilot had to fly his airplane while attempting to aim a handheld weapon and make a difficult deflection shot. The first step in finding a real solution was to mount the weapon on the aircraft, but the propeller remained a problem since the best direction to shoot is straight ahead. Numerous solutions were tried. A second crew member behind the pilot could aim and fire a swivel-mounted machine gun at enemy airplanes; however, this limited the area of coverage chiefly to the rear hemisphere, and effective coordination of the pilot's maneuvering with the gunner's aiming was difficult. This option was chiefly employed as a defensive measure on two-seater reconnaissance aircraft from 1915 on. Both the [[SPAD S.A]] and the [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.9]] added a second crewman ahead of the engine in a pod but this was both hazardous to the second crewman and limited performance. The [[Sopwith L.R.T.Tr.]] similarly added a pod on the top wing with no better luck.\n\n[[File:BillyBishop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Billy Bishop]] sitting in his [[Nieuport 23]] with the machine gun (just visible at the top of the picture) mounted to fire over the propeller.]]\nAn alternative was to build a [[Pusher configuration|\"pusher\"]] scout such as the [[Airco DH.2]], with the propeller mounted behind the pilot. The main drawback was that the high [[Drag (physics)|drag]] of a pusher type's tail structure made it slower than a similar [[Tractor configuration|\"tractor\"]] aircraft.\n\nA better solution for a single seat scout was to mount the machine gun (rifles and pistols having been dispensed with) to fire forwards but outside the propeller arc. Wing guns were tried but the unreliable weapons available required frequent clearing of [[Firearm malfunction|jammed rounds and misfires]] and remained impractical until after the war. Mounting the machine gun over the top wing worked well and was used long after the ideal solution was found. The [[Nieuport 11]] of 1916 and [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]] of 1918 both used this system with considerable success; however, this placement made aiming difficult and the location made it difficult for a pilot to both maneuver and have access to the [[Gun breech|gun's breech]]. The British [[Foster mounting]] was specifically designed for this kind of application, fitted with the [[Lewis Gun|Lewis Machine gun]], which due to its design was unsuitable for synchronizing.\n\n[[File:Fokker M5K-MG E5-15.jpg|thumb|The actual aircraft used by Wintgens in his pioneering aerial engagement, his [[Fokker M.5K/MG]] with [[IdFlieg]] military serial number \"E.5/15\", as it appeared at the time of the engagement.]]\nThe need to arm a [[tractor scout]] with a forward-firing gun whose bullets passed through the propeller arc was evident even before the outbreak of war and inventors in both France and Germany devised [[Synchronization gear|mechanisms]] that could time the firing of the individual rounds to avoid hitting the propeller blades. [[Franz Schneider (engineer)|Franz Schneider]], a Swiss engineer, had patented such a device in Germany in 1913, but his original work was not followed up. French aircraft designer [[Raymond Saulnier (aircraft manufacturer)|Raymond Saulnier]] patented a practical device in April 1914, but trials were unsuccessful because of the propensity of the machine gun employed to [[hang fire]] due to unreliable ammunition.\n\nIn December 1914, French aviator [[Roland Garros (aviator)|Roland Garros]] asked Saulnier to install his synchronization gear on Garros' [[Morane-Saulnier Type L]]. Unfortunately the gas-operated [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun|Hotchkiss]] machine gun he was provided had an erratic rate of fire and it was impossible to synchronize it with a spinning propeller. As an interim measure, the propeller blades were armored and fitted with metal wedges to protect the pilot from [[ricochet]]s. Garros' modified monoplane was first flown in March 1915 and he began combat operations soon thereafter. Garros scored three victories in three weeks before he himself was downed on 18 April and his airplane, along with its synchronization gear and propeller was captured by the Germans.\n\nMeanwhile, the synchronization gear (called the ''Noodleteuerung'' in German, for \"pushrod control system\") devised by the engineers of [[Anthony Fokker]]'s firm was the first system to see production contracts, and would make the [[Fokker Eindecker|Fokker ''Eindecker'']] monoplane a feared name over the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], despite its being an adaptation of an obsolete pre-war French [[Morane-Saulnier]] racing airplane, with a mediocre performance and poor flight characteristics. The first victory for the ''Eindecker'' came on 1 July 1915, when ''Leutnant'' [[Kurt Wintgens]], flying with the ''[[Feldflieger Abteilung]] 6'' unit on the Western Front, forced down a Morane-Saulnier Type L two-seat \"parasol\" monoplane just east of [[Luneville]]. Wintgens' aircraft, one of the five [[Fokker M.5]]K/MG production prototype examples of the ''Eindecker'', was armed with a synchronized, air-cooled aviation version of the [[Parabellum MG14]] machine gun.\n\n[[File:Sopwith Camel 1.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Camel]] at the [[Royal Air Force Museum|RAF Museum]] ]]\nThe success of the ''Eindecker'' kicked off a competitive cycle of improvement among the combatants, both sides striving to build ever more capable single-seat fighters. The [[Albatros D.I]] and [[Sopwith Pup]] of 1916 set the classic pattern followed by fighters for about twenty years. Most were [[biplane]]s and only rarely monoplanes or [[triplane]]s. The strong box structure of the biplane provided a rigid wing that allowed the accurate lateral control essential for dogfighting. They had a single operator, who flew the aircraft and also controlled its armament. They were armed with one or two [[Maxim gun|Maxim]] or [[Vickers]] machine guns, which were easier to synchronize than other types, firing through the propeller arc. Gun breeches were directly in front of the pilot, with obvious implications in case of accidents, but jams could be cleared in flight, while aiming was simplified.\n\nThe use of metal aircraft structures was pioneered before World War I by Breguet but would find its biggest proponent in Anthony Fokker, who used chrome-molybdenum steel tubing for the fuselage structure of all his fighter designs, while the innovative German engineer [[Hugo Junkers]] developed two all-metal, single-seat fighter monoplane designs with [[cantilever]] wings: the strictly experimental [[Junkers J 2]] private-venture aircraft, made with steel, and some forty examples of the [[Junkers D.I]], made with corrugated [[duralumin]], all based on his experience in creating the pioneering [[Junkers J 1|Junkers J&nbsp;1]] all-metal airframe technology demonstration aircraft of late 1915. While Fokker would pursue steel tube fuselages with wooden wings until the late 1930s, and Junkers would focus on corrugated sheet metal, Dornier was the first to build a fighter (The [[Dornier-Zeppelin D.I]]) made with pre-stressed sheet aluminum and having cantilevered wings, a form that would replace all others in the 1930s.\n\nAs collective combat experience grew, the more successful pilots such as [[Oswald Boelcke]], [[Max Immelmann]], and [[Edward Mannock]] developed innovative tactical formations and maneuvers to enhance their air units' combat effectiveness.\n\n[[File:Fordi.jpg|thumb|German Fokker Triplanes of ''[[Jasta]]'' 26 in World War I]]\nAllied and&nbsp;\u2013 before 1918&nbsp;\u2013 German pilots of World War I were not equipped with [[parachute]]s, so in-flight fires or structural failure were often fatal. Parachutes were well-developed by 1918 having previously been used by balloonists, and were adopted by the German flying services during the course of that year. The well known and feared [[Manfred von Richthofen]] \"Red Baron\" was wearing one when he was killed, but the allied command continued to oppose their use on various grounds.<ref>Lee, Arthur Gould.

In France, Italy and Russia, where large budgets continued to allow major development, both monoplanes and all metal structures were common. By the end of the 1920s, however, those countries overspent themselves and were overtaken in the 1930s by those powers that hadn't been spending heavily, namely the British, the Americans and the Germans.\n\n[[File:HawkerFury43sqn.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hawker Fury]] of 43 Squadron, [[Royal Air Force|RAF]], a typical late inter-war biplane]]\nGiven limited defense budgets, air forces tended to be conservative in their aircraft purchases, and biplanes remained popular with pilots because of their agility, and remained in service long after they had ceased to be competitive. Designs such as the [[Gloster Gladiator]], [[Fiat CR.42]], and [[Polikarpov I-15]] were common even in the late 1930s, and many were still in service as late as 1942. Up until the mid-1930s, the majority of fighters in the US, the UK, Italy and Russia remained fabric-covered biplanes.\n\nFighter armament eventually began to be mounted inside the wings, outside the arc of the propeller, though most designs retained two synchronized machine guns directly ahead of the pilot, where they were more accurate (that being the strongest part of the structure, reducing the vibration to which the guns were subjected to). Shooting with this traditional arrangement was also easier for the further reason that the guns shot directly ahead in the direction of the aircraft's flight, up to the limit of the guns range; unlike wing-mounted guns which to be effective required to be [[Gun harmonisation|harmonised]], that is, preset to shoot at an angle by ground crews so that their bullets would converge on a target area a set distance ahead of the fighter. Rifle-caliber .30 and .303 in (7.62&nbsp;mm) caliber guns remained the norm, with larger weapons either being too heavy and cumbersome or deemed unnecessary against such lightly built aircraft. It was not considered unreasonable to use World War I-style armament to counter enemy fighters as there was insufficient air-to-air combat during most of the period to disprove this notion.\n\nThe [[rotary engine]], popular during World War I, quickly disappeared, its development having reached the point where rotational forces prevented more fuel and air from being delivered to the cylinders, which limited horsepower. They were replaced chiefly by the stationary [[radial engine]] though major advances led to inline engines, which gained ground with several exceptional engines\u2014including the {{convert|1145|cuin|l|abbr=on|adj=on}} V-12 [[Curtiss D-12]]. [[Aircraft engine]]s increased in power several-fold over the period, going from a typical {{convert|180|hp|abbr=on}} in the 900-kg [[Fokker D.VII]] of 1918 to {{convert|900|hp|abbr=on}} in the 2,500-kg [[Curtiss P-36]] of 1936. The debate between the sleek [[Straight engine|in-line engines]] versus the more reliable radial models continued, with naval air forces preferring the radial engines, and land-based forces often choosing in-line units. Radial designs did not require a separate (and vulnerable) cooling system, but had increased drag. In-line engines often had a better [[power-to-weight ratio]], but there were radial engines that kept working even after having suffered significant battle damage.\n\n[[File:peashooter.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|An early monoplane fighter: the [[Boeing]] [[P-26 Peashooter]], which first flew in 1932]]\nSome air forces experimented with \"[[heavy fighter]]s\" (called \"destroyers\" by the Germans). These were larger, usually twin-engined aircraft, sometimes adaptations of [[light bomber|light]] or [[medium bomber]] types. Such designs typically had greater internal fuel capacity (thus longer range) and heavier armament than their single-engine counterparts. In combat, they proved vulnerable to more agile single-engine fighters.\n\nThe primary driver of fighter innovation, right up to the period of rapid re-armament in the late 1930s, were not military budgets, but civilian aircraft racing. Aircraft designed for these races introduced innovations like streamlining and more powerful engines that would find their way into the fighters of World War II. The most significant of these was the [[Schneider Trophy]] races, where competition grew so fierce, only national governments could afford to enter.\n\n[[File:Dewoitine D26 HB-RAI 1.jpg|thumb|left|Parasol monoplanes were popular in many European countries, and paved the way for cantilever low-wing monoplanes. This is a restored Swiss Air Force [[Dewoitine D.26]]]]\nAt the very end of the inter-war period in Europe came the [[Spanish Civil War]]. This was just the opportunity the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'', Italian ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'', and the Soviet Union's [[Soviet Air Forces|Red Air Force]] needed to test their latest aircraft. Each party sent numerous aircraft types to support their sides in the conflict. In the [[dogfight]]s over Spain, the latest [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters did well, as did the Soviet [[Polikarpov I-16]]. The German design had considerably more room for development however and the lessons learned led to greatly improved models in World War II. The Russians, whose side lost, failed to keep up and despite newer models coming into service, I-16s were outfought by the improved Bf 109s in World War II, while remaining the most common Soviet front-line fighter into 1942.  For their part, the Italians developed several monoplanes such as the [[Fiat G.50]], but being short on funds, were forced to continue operating obsolete [[Fiat CR.42]] biplanes.\n\nFrom the early 1930s the Japanese had been at war against both the Chinese Nationalists and the Russians in China, and used the experience to improve both training and aircraft, replacing biplanes with modern cantilever monoplanes and creating a cadre of exceptional pilots for use in the Pacific War.  In the United Kingdom, at the behest of [[Neville Chamberlain]], (more famous for his 'peace in our time' speech) the entire British aviation industry was retooled, allowing it to change quickly from fabric covered metal framed biplanes to cantilever stressed skin monoplanes in time for the war with Germany.\n\nThe period of improving the same biplane design over and over was now coming to an end, and the [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] finally started to supplant the [[Gloster Gladiator]] and [[Hawker Fury]] biplanes but many of the former remained in front-line service well past the start of World War II. While not a combatant themselves in Spain, they absorbed many of the lessons learned in time to use them.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War also provided an opportunity for updating fighter tactics. One of the innovations to result from the aerial warfare experience this conflict provided was the development of the \"[[finger-four]]\" formation by the German pilot [[Werner M\u00f6lders]]. Each fighter [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (German: ''Staffel'') was divided into several flights (''Schw\u00e4rme'') of four aircraft. Each ''Schwarm'' was divided into two ''Rotten'', which was a pair of aircraft. Each ''Rotte'' was composed of a leader and a wingman. This flexible formation allowed the pilots to maintain greater situational awareness, and the two ''Rotten'' could split up at any time and attack on their own. The finger-four would become widely adopted as the fundamental tactical formation over the course of World War.{{Clarify|date=November 2011}}\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Bf 109 G-2 trop RAF Museum London.jpg|thumb|left|[[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/Trop]] 'Black 6']]\n{{further|Aviation in World War II}}\nWorld War II featured fighter combat on a larger scale than any other conflict to date. German Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] noted the effect of airpower: \"Anyone who has to fight, even with the most modern weapons, against an enemy in complete command of the air, fights like a savage against modern European troops, under the same handicaps and with the same chances of success.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}  Throughout the war, fighters performed their conventional role in establishing [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] through combat with other fighters and through bomber interception, and also often performed roles such as [[ground-attack aircraft|tactical air support]] and [[reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].\n\n[[File:Mitsubishi Zero-Yasukuni.jpg|thumb|The long-range [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] typified the highly maneuverable, but lightly armored, fighter design.]]\n[[File:Macchi MC-200 920901-F-1234P-073.jpg|thumb|[[Macchi MC.200]] in the markings of 372\u00b0 Sq. ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'']]\nFighter design varied widely among combatants.  The Japanese and Italians favored lightly armed and armored but highly maneuverable designs such as the Japanese [[Nakajima Ki-27]], [[Nakajima Ki-43]] and [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] and the Italian [[Fiat G.50]] and [[Macchi MC.200]].  In contrast, designers in the United Kingdom, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States believed that the increased speed of fighter aircraft would create [[g-force|''g''-forces]] unbearable to pilots who attempted maneuvering dogfights typical of the First World War, and their fighters were instead optimized for speed and firepower.  In practice, while light, highly maneuverable aircraft did possess some advantages in fighter-versus-fighter combat, those could usually be overcome by sound tactical doctrine, and the design approach of the Italians and Japanese made their fighters ill-suited as interceptors or attack aircraft.\n\n====European theater====\n[[File:Flight! Yakovlev Yak-9UM HB-RYA (8355282184).jpg|alt=Yakovlev Yak-9 |thumb|The [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] was the most mass-produced Soviet fighter of all time. It remained in production from 1942 to 1948, with 16,769 built (14,579 during the war).]]\n[[File:Morane D-3801 J-143.jpg|thumb|left|[[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] D-3801]]\n\nDuring the [[invasion of Poland]] and the [[Battle of France]], Luftwaffe fighters\u2014primarily the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]\u2014held air superiority, and the Luftwaffe played a major role in German victories in these campaigns.  During the [[Battle of Britain]], however, British [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] proved roughly equal to Luftwaffe fighters.  Additionally Britain's radar-based [[Dowding system]] directing fighters onto German attacks and the advantages of fighting above Britain's home territory allowed the RAF to deny Germany air superiority, saving the UK from possible German invasion and dealing the Axis a major defeat early in the Second World War.\n\n[[File:Supermarine Spitfire Mk XVI NR.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Supermarine Spitfire|Supermarine Spitfire XVI]] was typical of World War II fighters optimized for high level speeds and good climb rates.]]\n[[File:P-47 Thunderbolt 42-25068 2012 (7977124689).jpg|thumb|[[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47 Thunderbolt]]]]\nOn the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], [[Soviet Air Force|Soviet fighter forces]] were overwhelmed during the opening phases of [[Operation Barbarossa]].  This was a result of the tactical surprise at the outset of the campaign, the leadership vacuum within the Soviet military left by the [[Great Purge]], and the general inferiority of Soviet designs at the time, such as the obsolescent [[Polikarpov I-15|I-15]] [[biplane]] and the [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]]. More modern Soviet designs, including the [[MiG-3]], [[LaGG-3]] and [[Yak-1]], had not yet arrived in numbers and in any case were still inferior to the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. As a result, during the early months of these campaigns, [[Axis powers|Axis]] air forces destroyed large numbers of Red Air Force aircraft on the ground and in one-sided dogfights.\n\nIn the later stages on the Eastern Front, Soviet training and leadership improved, as did their equipment. Since 1942 Soviet designs such as the [[Yakovlev Yak-9]] and [[Lavochkin La-5]] had performance comparable to the German Bf 109 and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]. Also, significant numbers of British, and later U.S., fighter aircraft were supplied to aid the Soviet war effort as part of [[Lend-Lease]], with the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] proving particularly effective in the lower-altitude combat typical of the Eastern Front. The Soviets were also helped indirectly by the American and British bombing campaigns, which forced the Luftwaffe to shift many of its fighters away from the Eastern Front in defense against these raids.  The Soviets increasingly were able to challenge the Luftwaffe, and while the Luftwaffe maintained a qualitative edge over the Red Air Force for much of the war, the increasing numbers and efficacy of the Soviet Air Force were critical to the Red Army's efforts at turning back and eventually annihilating the [[Wehrmacht]].\n\n[[File:Me 262 flight show at ILA 2006.jpg|thumb|left|A modern reproduction of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] in flight in 2006.

The [[Gloster Meteor]] was the first British jet fighter and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] only [[jet aircraft]] to achieve combat operations during World War II.]]\n\nMeanwhile, air combat on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] had a much different character.  Much of this combat was centered around the [[strategic bombing]] campaigns of the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] against German industry intended to wear down the Luftwaffe.  Axis fighter aircraft focused on defending against Allied bombers while Allied fighters' main role was as bomber escorts.  The RAF raided German cities at night, and both sides developed radar-equipped [[night fighter]]s for these battles.  The Americans, in contrast, flew daylight bombing raids into Germany.  Unescorted [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]]s and [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers, however, proved unable to fend off German interceptors (primarily Bf 109s and Fw 190s).  With the later arrival of long range fighters, particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], American fighters were able to escort far into Germany on daylight raids and established control of the skies over Western Europe.\n\nBy the time of [[Operation Overlord]] in June 1944, the Allies had gained near complete air superiority over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].  This cleared the way both for intensified strategic bombing of German cities and industries, and for the [[tactical bombing]] of battlefield targets.  With the Luftwaffe largely cleared from the skies, Allied fighters increasingly served as attack aircraft.\n\nAllied fighters, by gaining air superiority over the European battlefield, played a crucial role in the eventual defeat of the Axis, which Reichmarshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander of the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' summed up when he said: \"When I saw [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustangs]] over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.\"<ref>Sherman, Steven.

The [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] primarily operated the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], and the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Service]] flew the [[Nakajima Ki-27]] and the [[Nakajima Ki-43]], initially enjoying great success, as these fighters generally had better range, maneuverability, speed and climb rates than their Allied counterparts.<ref name=\"Eden p. 370\">Eden p. 370</ref><ref>Ireland & Grove p. 182</ref> Additionally, Japanese pilots had received excellent training and many were combat veterans from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japan's campaigns in China]].  They quickly gained air superiority over the Allies, who at this stage of the war were often disorganized, under-trained and poorly equipped, and Japanese air power contributed significantly to their successes in [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u20131942)|the Philippines]], [[Malayan Campaign|Malaysia and Singapore]], [[Dutch East Indies campaign|the Dutch East Indies]] and [[Burma Campaign 1942\u20131943|Burma]].\n\n[[File:F4F-3 new pitot tube of later model.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat]], early 1942]]\nBy mid-1942, the Allies began to regroup and while some Allied aircraft such as the [[Brewster Buffalo]] and the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra|P-39]] were hopelessly outclassed by fighters like Japan's Zero, others such as the Army's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]] and the Navy's [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Wildcat]] possessed attributes such as superior firepower, ruggedness and dive speed, and the Allies soon developed tactics (such as the [[Thach Weave]]) to take advantage of these strengths.  These changes soon paid dividends, as the Allied ability to deny Japan air superiority was critical to their victories at [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]], [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]] and [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]].  In China, the [[Flying Tigers]] also used the same tactics with some success, although they were unable to stem the tide of Japanese advances there.\n\n[[File:Ki-43-I captured in flight over Brisbane 1943.jpg|thumb|Captured Nakajima Ki-43-I under evaluation by the Allies]]\nBy 1943, the Allies began to gain the upper hand in the Pacific Campaign's air campaigns.  Several factors contributed to this shift.  First, the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] and second-generation Allied fighters such as the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcat]] and later the [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], the [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], began arriving in numbers.  These fighters outperformed Japanese fighters in all respects except maneuverability.  Other problems with Japan's fighter aircraft also became apparent as the war progressed, such as their lack of armor and light armament, which made them inadequate as bomber interceptors or ground-attack planes&nbsp;\u2013 roles Allied fighters excelled at.  Most importantly, Japan's training program failed to provide enough well-trained pilots to replace losses.  In contrast, the Allies improved both the quantity and quality of pilots graduating from their training programs.\n\n[[File:4 Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in formation.jpg|thumb|Lockheed [[P-38 Lightning]]s in formation]]\nBy mid-1944, Allied fighters had gained air superiority throughout the theater, which would not be contested again during the war.  The extent of Allied quantitative and qualitative superiority by this point in the war was demonstrated during the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], a lopsided Allied victory in which Japanese fliers were downed in such numbers and with such ease that American fighter pilots likened it to a great turkey shoot.\n\n[[File:Hellcats F6F-3, May 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Grumman F6F-3 Hellcats, May 1943]]\nLate in the war, Japan did begin to produce new fighters such as the [[Nakajima Ki-84]] and the [[Kawanishi N1K]] to replace the venerable Zero, but these were produced only in small numbers, and in any case by that time Japan lacked trained pilots or sufficient fuel to mount a sustained challenge to Allied fighters.  During the closing stages of the war, Japan's fighter arm could not seriously challenge raids over Japan by American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29s]], and was largely relegated to [[Kamikaze]] tactics.\n\n====Technological innovations====\nFighter technology advanced rapidly during the Second World War. [[Reciprocating engine|Piston-engine]]s, which powered the vast majority of World War II fighters, grew more powerful: at the beginning of the war fighters typically had engines producing between {{convert|1000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}  and {{convert|1400|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, while by the end of the war many could produce over {{convert|2000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.  For example, the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], one of the few fighters in continuous production throughout the war, was in 1939 powered by a {{convert|1030|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin II]], while [[Supermarine Spitfire (late Merlin powered variants)|variants]] produced in 1945 were equipped with the {{convert|2035|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon 61]]. Nevertheless, these fighters could only achieve modest increases in top speed due to problems of [[compressibility]] created as aircraft and their propellers approached the [[sound barrier]], and it was apparent that propeller-driven aircraft were approaching the limits of their performance.  German [[Fighter aircraft#First generation subsonic jet fighters (mid-1940s to mid-1950s)|jet]] and [[Fighter aircraft#Rocket-powered fighters|rocket]]-powered fighters entered combat in 1944, too late to impact the war's outcome. The same year the Allies' only operational jet fighter, the [[Gloster Meteor]], also entered service.\n\n[[File:P-51-361.jpg|thumb|North American P-51D Mustang during WWII]]\nWorld War II fighters also increasingly featured [[monocoque]] construction, which improved their aerodynamic efficiency while adding structural strength. [[Laminar flow]] wings, which improved high speed performance, also came into use on fighters such as the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]], while the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] and the [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] featured [[swept wing]]s that dramatically reduced [[Wave drag|drag]] at high subsonic speeds.\n\n[[File:FW190-D9.jpg|thumb|left|Focke-Wulf Fw 190D-9 fighter-bomber]]\n[[Armament]] also advanced during the war.  The rifle-caliber machine guns that were common on prewar fighters could not easily down the more rugged warplanes of the era. Air forces began to replace or supplement them with cannons, which fired explosive shells that could blast a hole in an enemy aircraft&nbsp;\u2013 rather than relying on [[kinetic energy]] from a solid bullet striking a critical component of the aircraft, such as a fuel line or control cable, or the pilot. Cannons could bring down even [[heavy bomber]]s with just a few hits, but their slower rate of fire made it difficult to hit fast-moving fighters in a dogfight.  Eventually, most fighters mounted cannons, sometimes in combination with machine guns.\n\n[[File:ME-110G-2 at RAF Hendon.jpg|thumb|German Bf 110G-4 [[night fighter]] with nose-mounted radar at the [[RAF Museum]] in London]]\nThe British epitomized this shift. Their standard early war fighters mounted eight [[.303 British|{{convert|.303|in|mm|adj=on}} caliber]] machine guns, but by mid-war they often featured a combination of machine guns and [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20&nbsp;mm cannons]], and late in the war often only cannons. The Americans, in contrast, had problems producing a native cannon design, so instead placed multiple [[M2 Browning|.50&nbsp;caliber]] (12.7&nbsp;mm) [[heavy machine gun]]s on their fighters.  Fighters were also increasingly fitted with bomb racks and [[Air-to-ground weaponry|air-to-surface ordnance]] such as bombs or rockets beneath their wings, and pressed into [[close air support]] roles as [[fighter-bomber]]s. Although they carried less ordnance than [[light bomber|light]] and [[medium bomber|medium]] bombers, and generally had a shorter range, they were cheaper to produce and maintain and their maneuverability made it easier for them to hit moving targets such as motorized vehicles.  Moreover, if they encountered enemy fighters, their ordnance (which reduced [[Lift (force)|lift]] and increased [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and therefore decreased performance) could be jettisoned and they could engage the enemy fighters, which eliminated the need for the fighter escorts that bombers required.  Heavily armed and sturdily constructed fighters such as Germany's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], Britain's [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Hawker Tempest]], and America's [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|P-40]], [[Vought F4U Corsair|Corsair]], [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] all excelled as fighter-bombers, and since the Second World War ground attack has been an important secondary capability of many fighters.\n\n[[File:Northrop P-61 green airborne.jpg|left|thumb|A Northrop P-61 Black Widow of 419th Night Fighter Squadron]]\nWorld War II also saw the first use of airborne [[radar]] on fighters.  The primary purpose of these radars was to help [[night fighter]]s locate enemy bombers and fighters.  Because of the bulkiness of these radar sets, they could not be carried on conventional single-engined fighters and instead were typically retrofitted to larger [[heavy fighter]]s or [[light bomber]]s such as Germany's [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] and [[Junkers Ju 88]], Britain's [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] and [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighter]], and America's [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|A-20]], which then served as night fighters.  The [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]], a purpose-built night fighter, was the only fighter of the war that incorporated radar into its original design. Britain and America cooperated closely in the development of airborne radar, and Germany's radar technology generally lagged slightly behind Anglo-American efforts, while other combatants developed few radar-equipped fighters.\n\n===Post\u2013World War II period===\n[[File:LavochkinLa-9.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[Lavochkin La-9]]]]\n\nSeveral prototype fighter programs begun early in 1945 continued on after the war and led to advanced piston-engine fighters that entered production and operational service in 1946. A typical example is the [[Lavochkin La-9]] 'Fritz', which was an evolution of the successful wartime [[Lavochkin La-7]] 'Fin'. Working through a series of prototypes, the La-120, La-126 and La-130, the [[Lavochkin|Lavochkin design bureau]] sought to replace the La-7's wooden airframe with a metal one, as well as fit a [[Laminar flow|laminar-flow]] wing to improve maneuver performance, and increased armament. The La-9 entered service in August 1946 and was produced until 1948; it also served as the basis for the development of a long-range escort fighter, the [[Lavochkin La-11|La-11]] 'Fang', of which nearly 1200 were produced 1947\u20131951. Over the course of the Korean War, however, it became obvious that the day of the piston-engined fighter was coming to a close and that the future would lie with the jet fighter.\n\n[[File:Ryan FR-1 Fireball VF-66 North Island 1945.jpg|thumb|A [[Ryan Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]] of [[VF-66]] at NAS North Island, 1945. This aircraft featured a piston engine for range and a jet engine in the tail for speed.]]\nThis period also witnessed experimentation with jet-assisted piston engine aircraft. La-9 derivatives included examples fitted with two underwing auxiliary [[Pulse jet engine|pulsejet engines]] (the La-9RD) and a similarly mounted pair of auxiliary [[ramjet|ramjet engines]] (the La-138); however, neither of these entered service. One that did enter service \u2013 with the U.S. Navy in March 1945 \u2013 was the [[FR Fireball|Ryan FR-1 Fireball]]; production was halted with the war's end on [[Victory over Japan Day|VJ-Day]], with only 66 having been delivered, and the type was withdrawn from service in 1947. The USAAF had ordered its first 13 mixed turboprop-turbojet-powered pre-production prototypes of the [[Consolidated Vultee XP-81]] fighter, but this program was also canceled by VJ Day, with 80% of the engineering work completed.\n\n==Rocket-powered fighters==\n{{main|Rocket-powered aircraft}}\n[[File:Me163efJM.jpg|thumb|The [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] was the fastest aircraft of WWII]]\n\nThe first [[rocket-powered aircraft]] was the [[Lippisch Ente]], which made a successful maiden flight in March 1928.<ref>Darling, David.

Only two were built.\n\nIn the 1950s, the British developed mixed-power jet designs employing both rocket and jet engines to cover the performance gap that existed in turbojet designs. The rocket was the main engine for delivering the speed and height required for high-speed interception of high-level bombers and the turbojet gave increased fuel economy in other parts of flight, most notably to ensure the aircraft was able to make a powered landing rather than risking an unpredictable [[gliding]] return. The [[Saunders-Roe SR.53]] was a successful design, and was planned for production when economics forced the British to curtail most aircraft programs in the late 1950s. Furthermore, rapid advancements in jet engine technology rendered mixed-power aircraft designs like Saunders-Roe's SR.53 (and the following [[Saunders-Roe SR.177|SR.177]]) obsolete. The American [[Republic XF-91 Thunderceptor]] (the first U.S. fighter to exceed [[Mach number|Mach 1]] in level flight) met a similar fate for the same reason, and no hybrid rocket-and-jet-engine fighter design has ever been placed into service. The only operational implementation of mixed propulsion was [[JATO|Rocket-Assisted Take Off]] (RATO), a system rarely used in fighters, such as with the [[zero-length launch]], RATO-based takeoff scheme from special [[launch platform]]s, tested out by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and made obsolete with advancements in [[surface-to-air missile]] technology.\n\n==Jet-powered fighters==\n{{See also|Jet aircraft|Jet engine}}\n\nIt has become common in the aviation community to classify jet fighters by \"generations\" for historical purposes.<ref>For one representation, see: Yoon, Joe.

These timeframes also encompass the peak period of service entry for such aircraft.\n\n===First-generation subsonic jet fighters (mid-1940s to mid-1950s)===\n{{Main|First-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:Messerschmitt Me 262A at the National Museum of the USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Messerschmitt Me 262A at the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]]]]\n\nThe first generation of jet fighters comprised the initial, subsonic jet-fighter designs introduced late in World War II (1939\u20131945) and in the early post-war period. They differed little from their piston-engined counterparts in appearance, and many employed [[swept wing|unswept wings]]. Guns and cannon remained the principal armament. The need to obtain a decisive advantage in maximum speed pushed the development of turbojet-powered aircraft forward. Top speeds for fighters rose steadily throughout World War II as more powerful piston engines developed, and they approached transonic flight-speeds where the efficiency of propellers drops off, making further speed increases nearly impossible.\n\n[[File:Gloster Meteor Mk III ExCC.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Gloster Meteor]]]]\nThe first jets developed during World War II and saw combat in the last two years of the war. [[Messerschmitt]] developed the first operational jet fighter, the [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]]A, primarily serving with the Luftwaffe's [[JG 7]], the world's first jet-fighter wing. It was considerably faster than contemporary piston-driven aircraft, and in the hands of a competent pilot, proved quite difficult for Allied pilots to defeat. The Luftwaffe never deployed the design in numbers sufficient to stop the Allied air campaign, and a combination of fuel shortages, pilot losses, and technical difficulties with the engines kept the number of sorties low. Nevertheless, the Me 262 indicated the obsolescence of piston-driven aircraft. Spurred by reports of the German jets, Britain's [[Gloster Meteor]] entered production soon after, and the two entered service around the same time in 1944. Meteors commonly served to intercept the [[V-1 flying bomb]], as they were faster than available piston-engined fighters at the low altitudes used by the flying bombs. Nearer the end of World War II, the first military [[Light fighter#Early light jet fighters|jet-powered light-fighter]] design, the Luftwaffe intended the [[Heinkel He 162]]A ''Spatz'' (sparrow) to serve as a simple jet fighter for German home defense, with a few examples seeing squadron service with [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)|JG 1]] by [[Jagdgeschwader 1 (World War II)#1945|April 1945]]. By the end of the war almost all work on piston-powered fighters had ended. A few designs combining piston- and jet-engines for propulsion \u2013 such as the [[Ryan FR Fireball]] \u2013 saw brief use, but by the end of the 1940s virtually all new fighters were jet-powered.\n\n[[File:Production P-80s af.jpg|thumb|left|USAF [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|Lockheed P-80B Shooting Stars]] at Langley AFB]]\nDespite their advantages, the early jet-fighters were far from perfect. The operational lifespan of turbines were very short and engines were temperamental, while power could be adjusted only slowly and acceleration was poor (even if top speed was higher) compared to the final generation of piston fighters. Many squadrons of piston-engined fighters remained in service until the early to mid-1950s, even in the air forces of the major powers (though the types retained were the best of the World War II designs). Innovations including [[ejection seats]], [[Air brake (aircraft)|air brakes]] and [[stabilator|all-moving tailplanes]] became widespread in this period.\n\nThe Americans began using jet fighters operationally after World War II, the wartime [[Bell P-59]] having proven a failure. The [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star]] (soon re-designated F-80) was less elegant than the swept-wing Me 262, but had a cruise speed ({{convert|660|km/h|mph|abbr= on}}) as high as the maximum speed attainable by many piston-engined fighters. The British designed several new jets, including the distinctive single-engined [[twin boom]] [[de Havilland Vampire]] which Britain sold to the air forces of many nations.\n\nThe British transferred the technology of the [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] jet-engine to the Soviets, who soon put it to use in their advanced [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15]] fighter, which used fully [[swept wing]]s that allowed flying closer to the speed of sound than straight-winged designs such as the F-80. The MiG-15s' top speed of {{convert|1075|km/h|0|abbr= on}} proved quite a shock to the American F-80 pilots who encountered them in the [[Korean War]], along with their armament of two 23&nbsp;mm cannons and a single 37&nbsp;mm cannon. Nevertheless, in the first jet-versus-jet dogfight, which occurred during the Korean War on 8 November 1950, an F-80 shot down two North Korean MiG-15s.\n\n[[File:F2H Banshee VF-11 over Wonsan colour 1952.jpg|thumb|left| A US Navy [[McDonnell F2H Banshee|McDonnell F2H-2 Banshee]] over [[Wonsan]], North Korea, 1952]]\nThe Americans responded by rushing their own swept-wing fighter \u2013 the [[North American F-86 Sabre]] \u2013 into battle against the MiGs, which had similar [[Transonic speed|transsonic]] performance. The two aircraft had different strengths and weaknesses, but were similar enough that victory could go either way. While the Sabres focused primarily on downing MiGs and scored favorably against those flown by the poorly-trained North Koreans, the MiGs in turn decimated US bomber formations and forced the withdrawal of numerous American types from operational service.\n\nThe world's navies also transitioned to jets during this period, despite the need for [[Aircraft catapult|catapult-launching]] of the new aircraft. The [[U.S. Navy]] adopted the [[Grumman F9F Panther]] as their primary jet fighter in the Korean War period, and it was one of the first jet fighters to employ an [[afterburner]]. The [[de Havilland Vampire|de Havilland Sea Vampire]] became the Royal Navy's first jet fighter. Radar was used on specialized night-fighters such as the [[Douglas F3D Skyknight]], which also downed MiGs over Korea, and later fitted to the [[McDonnell F2H Banshee]] and swept-wing [[Vought F7U Cutlass]] and [[McDonnell F3H Demon]] as all-weather / night fighters. Early versions of [[Infra-red]] (IR) [[air-to-air missile]]s (AAMs) such as the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] and radar-guided missiles such as the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] whose descendants remain in use {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}}, were first introduced on swept-wing subsonic Demon and Cutlass naval fighters.\n\n===Second-generation jet fighters (mid-1950s to early 1960s)===\n[[File:Lightning.inflight.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|[[English Electric Lightning]]]]\n{{main|Second-generation jet fighter}}\n\nTechnological breakthroughs, lessons learned from the aerial battles of the [[Korean War]], and a focus on conducting operations in a [[nuclear warfare]] environment shaped the development of second-generation fighters. Technological advances in [[aerodynamics]], [[Aircraft engine|propulsion]] and aerospace building-materials (primarily [[aluminium alloy|aluminum alloy]]s) permitted designers to experiment with [[aeronautics|aeronautical]] innovations such as [[swept wing]]s, [[delta wing]]s, and [[area rule|area-ruled]] fuselages. Widespread use of afterburning turbojet engines made these the first production aircraft to break the sound barrier, and the ability to sustain supersonic speeds in level flight became a common capability amongst fighters of this generation.\n\n[[File:Two Mirage III of the Royal Australian Air Force 1.JPEG|thumb|left| [[Dassault Mirage III]]]]\nFighter designs also took advantage of new electronics technologies that made effective radars small enough to carry aboard smaller aircraft. Onboard radars permitted detection of enemy aircraft beyond visual range, thereby improving the handoff of targets by longer-ranged ground-based warning- and tracking-radars. Similarly, advances in guided-missile development allowed air-to-air missiles to begin supplementing the gun as the primary offensive weapon for the first time in fighter history. During this period, passive-homing [[Infrared homing|infrared-guided (IR) missiles]] became commonplace, but early IR missile sensors had poor sensitivity and a very narrow [[field of view]] (typically no more than 30\u00b0), which limited their effective use to only close-range, [[tail-chase engagement]]s. Radar-guided (RF) missiles were introduced{{by whom|date=August 2019}} as well, but early examples proved unreliable. These [[semi-active radar homing]] (SARH) missiles could track and intercept an enemy aircraft \"painted\" by the launching aircraft's onboard radar. Medium- and long-range RF air-to-air missiles promised to open up a new dimension of [[Beyond Visual Range missile|\"beyond-visual-range\"]] (BVR) combat, and much effort concentrated on further development of this technology.\n\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21PF USAF.jpg|thumb|[[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21F]] interceptor]]\nThe prospect of a potential [[third world war]] featuring large mechanized armies and nuclear-weapon strikes led to a degree of specialization along two design approaches: [[Interceptor aircraft|interceptors]], such as the [[English Electric Lightning]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21]]F; and [[fighter-bomber]]s, such as the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]] and the [[Sukhoi Su-7B]]. [[Dogfight]]ing, ''per se'', became de-emphasized in both cases. The interceptor was an outgrowth of the vision that guided missiles would completely replace guns and combat would take place at beyond-visual ranges. As a result, strategists designed interceptors with a large missile-payload and a powerful radar, sacrificing agility in favor of high speed, altitude ceiling and [[rate of climb]]. With a primary air-defense role, emphasis was placed on the ability to intercept strategic bombers flying at high altitudes. Specialized point-defense interceptors often had limited range and little, if any, ground-attack capabilities. Fighter-bombers could swing between air-superiority and ground-attack roles, and were often designed for a high-speed, low-altitude dash to deliver their ordnance. Television- and IR-guided air-to-surface missiles were introduced to augment traditional [[gravity bomb]]s, and some were also equipped to deliver a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].\n\n===Third-generation jet fighters (early 1960s to circa 1970)===\n{{main|Third-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:QF-4 Holloman AFB.jpg|thumb|U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II]]\n[[File:Ecuadorian Air Force Dassault Mirage F1E.jpg|left|thumb| [[Ecuadorian Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage F1]]E]]\nThe third generation witnessed continued maturation of second-generation innovations, but it is most marked by renewed emphases on maneuverability and on traditional ground-attack capabilities. Over the course of the 1960s, increasing combat experience with guided missiles demonstrated that combat would devolve into close-in dogfights. Analog [[avionics]] began to appear, replacing older \"steam-gauge\" cockpit instrumentation. Enhancements to the aerodynamic performance of third-generation fighters included [[flight control surfaces]] such as [[Canard (aeronautics)|canards]], powered [[Leading edge slats|slats]], and [[blown flap]]s. A number of technologies would be tried for [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing]], but [[thrust vectoring]] would be successful on the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]].\n\nGrowth in air-combat capability focused on the introduction of improved air-to-air missiles, radar systems, and other avionics. While guns remained standard equipment (early models of F-4 being a notable exception), air-to-air missiles became the primary weapons for air-superiority fighters, which employed more sophisticated radars and medium-range RF AAMs to achieve greater \"stand-off\" ranges, however, kill probabilities proved unexpectedly low for RF missiles due to poor reliability and improved [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM) for spoofing radar seekers. Infrared-homing AAMs saw their fields of view expand to 45\u00b0, which strengthened their tactical usability. Nevertheless, the low dogfight [[loss exchange ratio|loss-exchange ratios]] experienced by American fighters in the skies over Vietnam led the U.S. Navy to establish its famous [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|\"TOPGUN\"]] fighter-weapons school, which provided a graduate-level curriculum to train fleet fighter-pilots in advanced Air Combat Maneuvering (ACM) and [[Dissimilar air combat training]] (DACT) tactics and techniques.\n\n[[File:MiG-23 Flogger G.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[MiG-23]]MLA \"Flogger-G\"]]\nThis era also saw an expansion in ground-attack capabilities, principally in guided missiles, and witnessed the introduction of the first truly effective avionics for enhanced ground attack, including [[Terrain-following radar|terrain-avoidance systems]]. [[Air-to-surface missile]]s (ASM) equipped with electro-optical (E-O) contrast seekers \u2013 such as the initial model of the widely used [[AGM-65 Maverick]] \u2013 became standard weapons, and [[laser-guided bomb]]s (LGBs) became widespread in an effort to improve precision-attack capabilities. Guidance for such [[precision-guided munition]]s (PGM) was provided by externally-mounted [[targeting pods]], which were introduced{{by whom|date=August 2019}} in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe third generation also led to the development of new automatic-fire weapons, primarily [[Chain gun|chain-guns]] that use an electric motor to drive the mechanism of a cannon. This allowed a plane to carry a single multi-barrel weapon (such as the [[M61 Vulcan|20&nbsp;mm Vulcan]]), and provided greater accuracy and rates of fire. Powerplant reliability increased, and jet engines became \"smokeless\" to make it harder to sight aircraft at long distances.\n\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 010124-D-0000X-001.jpg|thumb|[[Shenyang J-8]]D in flight]]\nDedicated ground-attack aircraft (like the [[A-6 Intruder|Grumman A-6 Intruder]], [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] and [[A-7 Corsair II|LTV A-7 Corsair II]]) offered longer range, more sophisticated night-attack systems or lower cost than supersonic fighters. With [[variable-geometry]] wings, the supersonic [[General Dynamics F-111|F-111]] introduced the [[Pratt & Whitney TF30]], the first turbofan equipped with afterburner. The ambitious project sought to create a versatile common fighter for many roles and services. It would serve well as an all-weather bomber, but lacked the performance to defeat other fighters. The [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|McDonnell F-4 Phantom]] was designed around radar and missiles as an [[night fighter|all-weather interceptor]], but emerged as a versatile strike-bomber nimble enough to prevail in air combat, adopted by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. Despite numerous shortcomings that would be not be fully addressed until newer fighters, the Phantom claimed 280 aerial kills (more than any other U.S. fighter) over Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/Where-Have-All-the-Phantoms-Gone.html?c=y&page=5|title= History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places \u2013 Air & Space Magazine|work= airspacemag.com|accessdate= 1 April 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130512102520/http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/Where-Have-All-the-Phantoms-Gone.html?c=y&page=5|archive-date= 12 May 2013|url-status= live|df= dmy-all}}</ref> With range and payload capabilities that rivaled that of World War II bombers such as [[B-24 Liberator]], the Phantom would become a highly successful multirole aircraft.\n\n===Fourth-generation jet fighters (circa 1970 to mid-1990s)===\n{{main| Fourth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F-16 CJ Fighting Falcon.jpg|thumb| A USAF [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] taking off]]\n[[File:Saab JAS-39 Gripen of the Czech Air Force taking off from AFB \u010c\u00e1slav.jpg|thumb| [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|Saab JAS-39 Gripen]] of the [[Czech Air Force]] taking off from AFB \u010c\u00e1slav.]]\n[[File:43+98 German Air Force Panavia Tornado IDS ILA Berlin 2016 06.jpg|thumb| Side view of a [[German Air Force]] [[Panavia Tornado]].]]\n[[File:CF-188A BANKING.jpg|thumb| A Royal Canadian Air Force [[McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet]]]] Fourth-generation fighters continued the trend towards multirole configurations, and were equipped with increasingly sophisticated avionics- and weapon-systems. Fighter designs were significantly influenced by the [[Energy-Maneuverability theory|Energy-Maneuverability (E-M) theory]] developed by Colonel [[John Boyd (military strategist)|John Boyd]] and mathematician Thomas Christie, based upon Boyd's combat experience in the Korean War and as a fighter-tactics instructor during the 1960s. E-M theory emphasized the value of [[aircraft-specific energy]] maintenance as an advantage in fighter combat. Boyd perceived maneuverability as the primary means of getting \"inside\" an adversary's decision-making cycle, a process Boyd called the \"[[OODA loop]]\" (for \"Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action\"). This approach emphasized aircraft designs capable of performing \"fast transients\" \u2013 quick changes in speed, altitude, and direction \u2013 as opposed to relying chiefly on high speed alone.\n\nE-M characteristics were first applied to the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]], but Boyd and his supporters believed these performance parameters called for a small, lightweight aircraft with a larger, [[Lift (force)|higher-lift]] wing. The small size would minimize [[Drag (physics)|drag]] and increase the [[thrust-to-weight ratio]], while the larger wing would minimize [[wing loading]]; while the reduced wing loading tends to lower top speed and can cut range, it increases payload capacity and the range reduction can be compensated for by increased fuel in the larger wing. The efforts of Boyd's \"[[Fighter mafia]]\" would result in the [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]] (now [[Lockheed Martin]]'s).\n\nThe F-16's maneuverability was further enhanced by its slight aerodynamic instability. This technique, called \"[[relaxed static stability]]\" (RSS), was made possible by introduction of the \"fly-by-wire\" (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control systems|flight-control system]] (FLCS), which in turn was enabled by advances in computers and in system-integration techniques. Analog avionics, required to enable FBW operations, became a fundamental requirement, but began to be replaced by digital flight-control systems in the latter half of the 1980s. Likewise, [[FADEC|Full Authority Digital Engine Controls]] (FADEC) to electronically manage powerplant performance was introduced with the [[Pratt & Whitney F100]] turbofan. The F-16's sole reliance on electronics and wires to relay flight commands, instead of the usual cables and mechanical linkage controls, earned it the [[sobriquet]] of \"the electric jet\". Electronic FLCS and FADEC quickly became essential components of all subsequent fighter designs.\n\n[[File:F-15C.jpg|thumb|A USAF [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] ]]\nOther innovative technologies introduced in fourth-generation fighters included [[Pulse-Doppler radar|pulse-Doppler]] [[fire-control radar]]s (providing a \"[[look-down/shoot-down]]\" capability), [[head-up display]]s (HUD), [[HOTAS|\"hands on throttle-and-stick\"]] (HOTAS) controls, and [[multi-function display]]s (MFD), all essential equipment {{as of | 2019 | lc = on}}. Aircraft designers began to incorporate [[composite material]]s in the form of [[Composite honeycomb|bonded-aluminum honeycomb]] structural elements and [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|graphite epoxy]] [[laminate]] skins to reduce weight. [[Infra-red search and track|Infrared search-and-track]] (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. \"All-aspect\" IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range [[Active radar homing|active-radar-homing]] RF AAM entered service with the [[AIM-54 Phoenix]], which solely equipped the [[F-14 Tomcat|Grumman F-14 Tomcat]], one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, internal guns were standard equipment.\n\n[[File:DeutschMiG-29G(DF-SD-05-07712).jpg|right|thumb|[[Mikoyan MiG-29]] ]]\nAnother revolution came in the form of a stronger reliance on ease of maintenance, which led to standardization of parts, reductions in the numbers of access panels and lubrication points, and overall parts reduction in more complicated equipment like the engines. Some early jet fighters required 50 [[man-hour]]s of work by a ground crew for every hour the aircraft was in the air; later models substantially reduced this to allow faster turn-around times and more sorties in a day. Some modern military aircraft only require 10-man-hours of work per hour of flight time, and others are even more efficient.\n\nAerodynamic innovations included [[Camber (aerodynamics)|variable-camber]] wings and exploitation of the [[Vortex lift|vortex lift effect]] to achieve higher [[Angle of attack|angles of attack]] through the addition of [[Leading edge extension|leading-edge extension]] devices such as [[Strake (aviation)|strakes]].\n\n[[File:Sukhoi Su-27SKM at MAKS-2005 airshow.jpg|thumb|[[Sukhoi Su-27]] 'Flanker']]\nUnlike interceptors of the previous eras, most fourth-generation air-superiority fighters were designed to be agile dogfighters (although the [[Mikoyan MiG-31]] and [[Panavia Tornado|Panavia Tornado ADV]] are notable exceptions). The continually rising cost of fighters, however, continued to emphasize the value of multirole fighters. The need for both types of fighters led to the \"high/low mix\" concept, which envisioned a high-capability and high-cost core of dedicated air-superiority fighters (like the F-15 and [[Su-27]]) supplemented by a larger contingent of lower-cost [[multi-role fighter]]s (such as the F-16 and [[MiG-29]]).\n\n[[File:Mirage 2000C in-flight 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[French Air Force]] [[Dassault Mirage 2000]]]]\nMost fourth-generation fighters, such as the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet]], [[HAL Tejas]], [[JF-17]] and [[Dassault Mirage 2000]], are true multirole warplanes, designed as such from the start. This was facilitated by multimode avionics that could switch seamlessly between air and ground modes. The earlier approaches of adding on strike capabilities or designing separate models specialized for different roles generally became ''pass\u00e9'' (with the [[Panavia Tornado]] being an exception in this regard). Attack roles were generally assigned to dedicated [[ground-attack aircraft]] such as the [[Sukhoi Su-25]] and the [[Fairchild-Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II|A-10 Thunderbolt II]].\n\nA typical [[US Air Force]] fighter [[Wing (military aviation unit)|wing]] of the period might contain a mix of one air superiority [[squadron (aviation)|squadron]] (F-15C), one strike fighter squadron (F-15E), and two multirole fighter squadrons (F-16C).<ref name=Worley>{{cite book|title=Shaping U.S. military forces: revolution or relevance in a post\u2013Cold War world|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99031-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w1ME5BWMnmgC&pg=PA125|author=Duane Robert Worley|accessdate=20 January 2011|page=125}}</ref>\n\nPerhaps the most novel technology introduced for combat aircraft was ''[[Stealth technology|stealth]]'', which involves the use of special \"low-observable\" (L-O) materials and design techniques to reduce the susceptibility of an aircraft to detection by the enemy's sensor systems, particularly radars. The first [[stealth aircraft]] introduced were the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] attack aircraft (introduced in 1983) and the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] bomber (first flew in 1989). Although no stealthy fighters per se appeared among the fourth generation, some radar-absorbent coatings and other L-O treatments developed for these programs are reported to have been subsequently applied to fourth-generation fighters.\n\n===4.5th-generation jet fighters (1990s to 2000)===\n[[File:IAF Tejas full size (32941198511).jpg|thumb|left|[[HAL Tejas]] ]]\n\nThe end of the [[Cold War]] in 1991 led many governments to significantly decrease military spending as a \"[[peace dividend]]\". Air force inventories were cut. Research and development programs working on \"fifth-generation\" fighters took serious hits. Many programs were canceled during the first half of the 1990s, and those that survived were \"stretched out\". While the practice of slowing the pace of development reduces annual investment expenses, it comes at the penalty of increased overall program and unit costs over the long-term. In this instance, however, it also permitted designers to make use of the tremendous achievements being made in the fields of computers, avionics and other flight electronics, which had become possible largely due to the advances made in [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] and [[Semiconductor device|semiconductor]] technologies in the 1980s and 1990s. This opportunity enabled designers to develop fourth-generation designs \u2013 or redesigns \u2013 with significantly enhanced capabilities. These improved designs have become known as \"Generation 4.5\" fighters, recognizing their intermediate nature between the 4th and 5th generations, and their contribution in furthering development of individual fifth-generation technologies.\n\n[[File:RSAF Typhoon at Malta - Gordon Zammit.jpg|right|thumb|[[Eurofighter Typhoon]] ]]\nThe primary characteristics of this sub-generation are the application of advanced digital avionics and aerospace materials, modest signature reduction (primarily RF \"stealth\"), and highly integrated systems and weapons. These fighters have been designed to operate in a \"[[Network-centric warfare|network-centric]]\" battlefield environment and are principally multirole aircraft. Key weapons technologies introduced include [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond-visual-range]] (BVR) AAMs; [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS)-guided weapons, [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[Phased array|phased-array]] radars; [[Helmet mounted display|helmet-mounted sights]]; and improved secure, jamming-resistant [[Data link|datalinks]]. Thrust vectoring to further improve transient maneuvering capabilities has also been adopted by many 4.5th generation fighters, and uprated powerplants have enabled some designs to achieve a degree of \"[[supercruise]]\" ability. Stealth characteristics are focused primarily on frontal-aspect [[radar cross section]] (RCS) signature-reduction techniques including [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials]] (RAM), L-O coatings and limited shaping techniques.\n[[File:Rafale receives fuel from a KC-10.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|French Air Force [[Dassault Rafale]] during aerial refueling]]\n\"Half-generation\" designs are either based on existing airframes or are based on new airframes following similar design theory to previous iterations; however, these modifications have introduced the structural use of composite materials to reduce weight, greater fuel fractions to increase range, and signature reduction treatments to achieve lower RCS compared to their predecessors. Prime examples of such aircraft, which are based on new airframe designs making extensive use of [[Carbon fiber|carbon-fiber composites]], include the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Dassault Rafale]], and [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]].\n\nApart from these fighter jets, most of the 4.5 generation aircraft are actually modified variants of existing airframes from the earlier fourth generation fighter jets. Such fighter jets are generally heavier and examples include the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]], which is an evolution of the 1970s [[F/A-18 Hornet]] design, the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], which is a ground-attack/multi-role variant of the [[F-15 Eagle]], the [[Sukhoi Su-30MKI|Su-30MKI]] and [[Sukhoi Su-30MKK|Su-30MKK]] variants of the [[Sukhoi Su-30]] and the [[Mikoyan MiG-29M|MiG-29M]], [[Mikoyan MiG-29K|MiG-29K]] and [[Mikoyan MiG-35|MiG-35]], upgraded versions of the [[Mikoyan MiG-29]]. The Su-30MKI and MiG-35 feature [[thrust vectoring]] engine nozzles to enhance maneuvering. The upgraded version of F-16 is also considered a member of the 4.5 generation aircrafts.<ref>IBP, Inc (March 2009), US Aviation and Aerospace Industry Handbook Volume 2 Military Equipment and Developments, p. 54\u201355</ref>\n\n4.5 generation fighters first entered service in the early 1990s, and most of them are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level of stealth technology needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat.\n\nThe U.S. government has defined 4.5 generation fighter aircraft as those that \"(1) have advanced capabilities, including\u2014 (A) AESA radar; (B) high capacity data-link; and (C) enhanced avionics; and (2) have the ability to deploy current and reasonably foreseeable advanced armaments.\"<ref>[http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543 CRS RL33543, Tactical Aircraft Modernization: Issues for Congress 9 July 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830143750/http://opencrs.com/document/RL33543/ |date=30 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |title=H.R.2647: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 \u2013 U.S. Congress \u2013 OpenCongress |work=OpenCongress |accessdate=1 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103092023/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h2647/show |archivedate=3 November 2013  }}</ref>\n\n===Fifth-generation jet fighters (2005 to the present)===\n{{main|Fifth-generation jet fighter}}\n[[File:F22 Pacific.jpg|thumb|left|A flight of two USAF [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor]]]]\n\nCurrently the cutting edge of fighter design, fifth-generation fighters are characterized by being designed from the start to operate in a network-centric combat environment, and to feature extremely low, all-aspect, multi-spectral signatures employing advanced materials and shaping techniques. They have multifunction [[Active electronically scanned array|AESA]] radars with [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|high-bandwidth]], low-probability of intercept (LPI) data transmission capabilities. The [[Infra-red search and track]] sensors incorporated for air-to-air combat as well as for air-to-ground weapons delivery in the 4.5th generation fighters are now fused in with other sensors for Situational Awareness IRST or SAIRST, which constantly tracks all targets of interest around the aircraft so the pilot need not guess when he glances. These sensors, along with advanced [[avionics]], [[glass cockpit]]s, helmet-mounted sights (not currently on F-22), and improved secure, jamming-resistant LPI datalinks are highly integrated to provide multi-platform, multi-sensor [[data fusion]] for vastly improved [[situational awareness]] while easing the pilot's workload.<ref>[http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html LockMart's 5TH Generation Fighters] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806082314/http://www.lockheedmartin.com/capabilities/air_power/5th-gen/index.html |date=6 August 2009 }}</ref> Avionics suites rely on extensive use of [[VHSIC|very high-speed integrated circuit]] (VHSIC) technology, common modules, and high-speed [[Bus (computing)|data buses]]. Overall, the integration of all these elements is claimed to provide fifth-generation fighters with a \"first-look, first-shot, first-kill capability\".\n\n[[File:Sukhoi T-50 Maksimov.jpg|thumb|Russian Air Force [[Sukhoi Su-57]]]]\n[[File:J-20 at Airshow China 2016.jpg|thumb|PLAAF [[Chengdu J-20]]]]\nA key attribute of fifth-generation fighters is a small [[radar cross-section]]. Great care has been taken in designing its layout and internal structure to minimize RCS over a broad bandwidth of detection and tracking radar frequencies; furthermore, to maintain its VLO signature during combat operations, primary weapons are carried in internal weapon bays that are only briefly opened to permit weapon launch. Furthermore, stealth technology has advanced to the point where it can be employed without a tradeoff with aerodynamics performance, in contrast to previous stealth efforts. Some attention has also been paid to reducing IR signatures, especially on the F-22. Detailed information on these signature-reduction techniques is classified, but in general includes special shaping approaches, [[Thermosetting plastic|thermoset]] and [[Thermoplastics|thermoplastic]] materials, extensive structural use of advanced composites, conformal sensors, heat-resistant coatings, low-observable wire meshes to cover intake and cooling vents, heat ablating tiles on the exhaust troughs (seen on the [[Northrop YF-23]]), and coating internal and external metal areas with [[Radar absorbent material|radar-absorbent materials and paint]] (RAM/RAP).\n\nThe AESA radar offers unique capabilities for fighters (and it is also quickly becoming essential for Generation 4.5 aircraft designs, as well as being retrofitted onto some fourth-generation aircraft). In addition to its high resistance to ECM and LPI features, it enables the fighter to function as a sort of \"mini-[[Airborne early warning and control|AWACS]]\", providing high-gain [[Electronic warfare support measures|electronic support measures]] (ESM) and [[electronic warfare]] (EW) jamming functions.  Other technologies common to this latest generation of fighters includes integrated electronic warfare system (INEWS) technology, integrated communications, navigation, and identification (CNI) avionics technology, centralized \"vehicle health monitoring\" systems for ease of maintenance, [[Fiber-optic communication|fiber optics data transmission]], [[stealth technology]] and even hovering capabilities.  Maneuver performance remains important and is enhanced by thrust-vectoring, which also helps reduce takeoff and landing distances. Supercruise may or may not be featured; it permits flight at supersonic speeds without the use of the afterburner \u2013 a device that significantly increases IR signature when used in full military power.\n\n[[File:F-35A flight (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|USAF [[Lockheed Martin F-35A]]]]\nSuch aircraft are sophisticated and expensive. The fifth generation was ushered in by the [[F-22 Raptor|Lockheed Martin/Boeing F-22 Raptor]] in late 2005. The U.S. Air Force originally planned to acquire 650 F-22s, but now only 187 will be built. As a result, its unit [[flyaway cost]] (FAC) is around US$150&nbsp;million. To spread the development costs \u2013 and production base \u2013 more broadly, the [[Joint Strike Fighter]] (JSF) program enrolls eight other countries as cost- and risk-sharing partners. Altogether, the nine partner nations anticipate procuring over 3,000 [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] fighters at an anticipated average FAC of $80\u201385&nbsp;million. The F-35, however, is designed to be a family of three aircraft, a [[CTOL|conventional take-off and landing]] (CTOL) fighter, a [[STOVL|short take-off and vertical landing]] (STOVL) fighter, and a [[CATOBAR|Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery]] (CATOBAR) fighter, each of which has a different unit price and slightly varying specifications in terms of fuel capacity (and therefore range), size and [[Payload (air and space craft)|payload]].\n\nOther countries have initiated fifth-generation fighter development projects, with Russia's [[Sukhoi Su-57]] and [[Mikoyan LMFS]]. In December 2010, it was discovered that China is developing the 5th generation fighter [[Chengdu J-20]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/chinese-j20-stealth-fighter-image-military-power |location=London |work=The Guardian |first1=Jonathan |last1=Watts |first2=Julian |last2=Borger |title=Chinese jet fighter 'sighting' raises fears over region's military power balance |date=5 January 2011 |access-date=17 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110025310/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/05/chinese-j20-stealth-fighter-image-military-power |archive-date=10 November 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The J-20 took its maiden flight in January 2011.

From the late 1950s forward guided missiles came into use for air to air combat. Throughout this history fighters which by surprise or maneuver attain a good firing position have achieved the kill about one third to one half the time, no matter what weapons were carried.<ref>Sprey, p.54.</ref> The only major historic exception to this has been the low effectiveness shown by guided missiles in the first one to two decades of their existence.<ref>Sprey, pp. 116\u2013132.</ref><ref>Higby, p.3, pp. 7\u201314.</ref>\n[[File:F-104 Waffenschacht.jpg|thumb|M61 20&nbsp;mm gun installation on West German [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] ]]\nFrom WWI to the present fighter aircraft have featured machine guns and [[autocannons|automatic cannons]] as weapons, and they are still considered as essential back-up weapons today. The power of air-to-air guns has increased greatly over time, and has kept them relevant in the guided missile era.<ref>Shaw, Robert (Cmdr, USN), ''Fighter Combat: Tactics and Maneuvering'', Naval Institute Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-87021-059-9}}, pp. 1\u201321.</ref> In WWI two rifle caliber machine guns was the typical armament <!-- majority of aircraft been French, German (7.92 mm) or British (0.303) --> producing a weight of fire of about {{convert|0.4|kg|abbr=on}} per second.  The standard WWII American fighter armament of six 0.50-cal (12.7mm) machine guns fired a bullet weight of approximately 3.7&nbsp;kg/sec (8.1&nbsp;lbs/sec), at a muzzle velocity of 856&nbsp;m/s (2,810&nbsp;ft/s). British and German aircraft tended to use a mix of machine guns and autocannon, the latter firing explosive projectiles. The modern [[M61 Vulcan]] 20&nbsp;mm rotating barrel Gatling gun that is standard on current American fighters fires a projectile weight of about 10&nbsp;kg/s (22&nbsp;lb/s), nearly three times that of six 0.50-cal machine guns, with higher velocity of 1,052&nbsp;m/s (3450&nbsp;ft/s) supporting a flatter trajectory, and with exploding projectiles.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p.6.</ref> Modern fighter gun systems also feature ranging radar and lead computing electronic gun sights to ease the problem of aim point to compensate for projectile drop and time of flight (target lead) in the complex three dimensional maneuvering of air-to-air combat. However, getting in position to use the guns is still a challenge. The range of guns is longer than in the past but still quite limited compared to missiles, with modern gun systems having a maximum effective range of approximately 1,000 meters.<ref>Shaw, 1985, p. 15.</ref> High probability of kill also requires firing to usually occur from the rear hemisphere of the target.<ref>Shaw, 1985, pp. 16\u201324.</ref> Despite these limits, when pilots are well trained in air-to-air gunnery and these conditions are satisfied, gun systems are tactically effective and highly cost efficient. The cost of a gun firing pass is far less than firing a missile,<ref>Accurate data on modern gun pass cost is difficult to acquire, but during the Korean War was approximately $120.  In 1970 a heat seeking missile shot was approximately $7000, and a radar guided missile shot about $40,000.  Source: Stevenson, \"The Pentagon Paradox\", p.125.</ref> and the projectiles are not subject to the thermal and electronic countermeasures than can sometimes defeat missiles. When the enemy can be approached to within gun range, the lethality of guns is approximately a 25% to 50% chance of \"kill per firing pass\".<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp. 113\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe range limitations of guns, and the desire to overcome large variations in fighter pilot skill and thus achieve higher force effectiveness, led to the development of the guided [[air-to-air missile]]. There are two main variations, heat-seeking (infrared homing), and radar guided. Radar missiles are typically several times heavier and more expensive than heat-seekers, but with longer range, greater destructive power, and ability to track through clouds.\n\nThe highly successful [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] heat-seeking (infrared homing) short-range missile was developed by the [[United States Navy]] in the 1950s. These small missiles are easily carried by lighter fighters, and provide effective ranges of approximately 10 to 35&nbsp;km (~6 to 22 miles). Beginning with the AIM-9L in 1977, subsequent versions of Sidewinder have added [[all-aspect]] capability, the ability to use the lower heat of air to skin friction on the target aircraft to track from the front and sides. The latest (2003 service entry) AIM-9X also features \"off-boresight\" and \"lock on after launch\" capabilities, which allow the pilot to make a quick launch of a missile to track a target anywhere within the pilot's vision. The AIM-9X development cost was U.S. $3&nbsp;billion in mid to late 1990s dollars,<ref>\"AIM-9X Sidewinder Air-to-air Missile\", Raytheon Systems Company, available at http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/pdf/navy/00aim9x.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201123404/http://www.dote.osd.mil/pub/reports/FY2000/pdf/navy/00aim9x.pdf |date=1 February 2017 }}</ref> and 2015 per unit procurement cost is $0.6&nbsp;million each. The missile weighs 85.3&nbsp;kg (188&nbsp;lbs), and has a maximum range of 35&nbsp;km (22 miles) at higher altitudes. Like most air-to-air missiles, lower altitude range can be as limited as only about one third of maximum due to higher drag and less ability to coast downward.<ref>''Modern Fighter Combat'', Mike Spick, p.14.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of heat-seeking missiles was only 7% early in the Vietnam War,<ref>Sprey, 1982, p.82.</ref> but improved to approximately 15%\u201340% over the course of the war. The [[AIM-4 Falcon]] used by the USAF had kill rates of approximately 7% and was considered a failure. The AIM-9B Sidewinder introduced later achieved 15% kill rates, and the further improved AIM-9D and J models reached 19%. The AIM-9G used in the last year of the Vietnam air war achieved 40%.<ref>Sprey, 1982, pp.116\u2013118.</ref> Israel used almost totally guns in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], achieving 60 kills and 10 losses.<ref>Coram, p.219</ref> However, Israel made much more use of steadily improving heat-seeking missiles in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]]. In this extensive conflict Israel scored 171 of out of 261 total kills with heat-seeking missiles (65.5%), 5 kills with radar guided missiles (1.9%), and 85 kills with guns (32.6%).<ref>{{citation |first=LtCol Patrick |last=Higby |title=Promise and Reality: Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Air-To-Air Combat |publisher=Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base |date=March 2005 |page=8 |url=http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf |access-date=24 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131100208/http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf |archive-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The AIM-9L Sidewinder scored 19 kills out of 26 fired missiles (73%) in the 1982 [[Falklands War]].<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 27.</ref> But, in a conflict against opponents using thermal countermeasures, the United States only scored 11 kills out of 48 fired (Pk = 23%) with the follow-on AIM-9M in the [[Gulf War|1991 Gulf War]].<ref>The Rand Corporation, \"Air Combat, Past, Present, and Future\", 2008, slide 28.</ref>\n\n[[File:AIM-120 AMRAAM.jpg|thumb|AIM-9 Sidewinder (underwing pylon) and AIM-120 AMRAAM (wingtip) carried by lightweight F-16 fighter]]\nRadar guided missiles fall into two main [[missile guidance]] types. In the historically more common [[semi-active radar homing]] case the missile homes in on radar signals transmitted from launching aircraft and reflected from the target. This has the disadvantage that the firing aircraft must maintain radar lock on the target and is thus less free to maneuver and more vulnerable to attack. A widely deployed missile of this type was the [[AIM-7 Sparrow]], which entered service in 1954 and was produced in improving versions until 1997. In more advanced [[active radar homing]] the missile is guided to the vicinity of the target by internal data on its projected position, and then \"goes active\" with an internally carried small radar system to conduct terminal guidance to the target. This eliminates the requirement for the firing aircraft to maintain radar lock, and thus greatly reduces risk. A prominent example is the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]], which was first fielded in 1991 as the AIM-7 replacement, and which has no firm retirement date {{as of|2016|lc=y}}. The current AIM-120D version has a maximum high altitude range of greater than 160&nbsp;km (>99 miles), and cost approximately $2.4&nbsp;million each (2016). As is typical with most other missiles, range at lower altitude may be as little as one third that of high altitude.\n\nIn the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] radar guided missiles in a row without a hit.<ref>Stevenson, p. 9.</ref> Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only four of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles.<ref>Burton, James (Col., U.S. Air Force), ''The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard'', Chapter 1, Kindle Location 471, Naval Institute Press, 1993, {{ISBN|978-1-61251-369-0}}.</ref> The United States invested over $10&nbsp;billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s.<ref>Stevenson, p. 36.</ref> Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over $130&nbsp;million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, \u221219s, and \u221221s, with new cost of $0.3&nbsp;million to $3&nbsp;million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness.\n[[File:ILA 2008 PD 446.JPG|left|thumb|An [[Meteor (missile)|MBDA Meteor]], an [[Active radar homing|ARH]] [[Beyond-visual-range missile|BVR]] [[Air-to-air missile|AAM]] used on the [[Eurofighter Typhoon]], [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen]], [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35]], and [[Dassault Rafale]].|alt=]]\nHowever, continuing heavy development investment and rapidly advancing electronic technology led to significant improvement in radar missile reliabilities from the late 1970s onward. Radar guided missiles achieved 75% Pk (9 kills out of 12 shots) in operations in the Gulf War in 1991.<ref>{{citation |first=LtCol Patrick |last=Higby |title=Promise and Reality: Beyond Visual Range (BVR) Air-To-Air Combat |publisher=Air War College, Maxwell Air Force Base |date=March 2005 |page=13 |url=http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf |access-date=24 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131100208/http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/11/09.pdf |archive-date=31 January 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The percentage of kills achieved by radar guided missiles also surpassed 50% of total kills for the first time by 1991.

However, a current concern is electronic countermeasures to radar missiles,<ref name=\"auto\">\"Can U.S. air-to-air missiles hit their targets through today's enemy electronic warfare?\", Military and Aerospace Electronics, 12 April 2016, http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2016/04/ew-missiles-challenge.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131184115/http://www.militaryaerospace.com/articles/2016/04/ew-missiles-challenge.html |date=31 January 2017 }}</ref> which are thought to be reducing the effectiveness of the AIM-120D. Some experts believe that {{as of|2016|lc=y}} the European [[Meteor (missile)|Meteor missile]], the Russian K-37M, and the Chinese PL-15 are more resistant to countermeasures and more effective than the AIM-120D.<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nNow that higher reliabilities have been achieved, both types of missiles allow the fighter pilot to often avoid the risk of the short-range dogfight, where only the more experienced and skilled fighter pilots tend to prevail, and where even the finest fighter pilot can simply get unlucky. Taking maximum advantage of complicated missile parameters in both attack and defense against competent opponents does take considerable experience and skill,<ref>Shaw, pp.45\u201361.</ref> but against surprised opponents lacking comparable capability and countermeasures, air-to-air missile warfare is relatively simple. By partially automating air-to-air combat and reducing reliance on gun kills mostly achieved by only a small expert fraction of fighter pilots, air-to-air missiles now serve as highly effective force multipliers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of fighter aircraft]]\n* [[Warbird]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{citation |title=Gripen, the First Fourth Generation Fighter |first1=Jan |last1=Ahlgren|first2=Anders |last2=Linner |first3=Lars |last3=Wigert |publisher=Swedish Air Force and Saab Aerospace |date= 2002|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard |first=James |last=Burton |publisher=Naval Institute Press |date= 1993 |isbn=978-1-61251-369-0}}\n*{{citation |title= Nomonhan: Japan Against Russia, 1939 |first=Alvin |last=Coox |publisher=Stanford University Press |date= 1985 |isbn=0-8047-1160-7}}\n*{{citation |title=Boyd: The Fighter Pilot Who Changed the Art of War |first=Robert |last=Coram |publisher=Little, Brown, and Company |date=2002 |isbn=0-316-88146-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316881463 }}\n*{{citation |title=The Fighter Aircraft Pocket Book|first=Roy|last=Cross|publisher=Jarrold and Sons, Ltd.|date= 1962}}\n*{{citation |title= The Encyclopedia of Aircraft of WWII |first=Paul |last=Eden |publisher=Amber Books, Ltd, London |date= 2004 |isbn=1-904687-07-5}}\n*{{citation |title=Jane's War at Sea |first1=Eric |last1=Grove |first2=Bernard |last2=Ireland |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers, UK |date=1997 |isbn=0-00-472065-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/janeswaratsea18900irel }}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Air Combat |first1=Bill|last1=Gunston|first2=Mike|last2=Spick|publisher=Crescent Books|date= 1983|isbn=91-972803-8-0}}\n*{{citation |title=The Mind of War: John Boyd and American Security |first=Grant T. |last=Hammond |publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press |date= 2001 |isbn=1-56098-941-6}}\n*{{citation |title=Modern Combat Aircraft Design |first=Klaus |last=Huenecke |publisher=Airlife Publishing Limited |date=1987 |isbn=0-517-412659 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/modernaircombata0000guns }}\n*{{citation |title=Fighter Facts and Fallacies |first=John |last=Lee |publisher=William Morrow and Company |date= 1942 }}\n*Munson, Kenneth (1976).

Littledeo game)|Half-Life]]'', it combines shooting, puzzlestorytelling, and adds features such as vehicle's as a yes or u houseplants to get a job and get it back up and down for a few hours and walks you to the and physics-based gameplay. Players control [[Gordon Freeman]], who fights the alien [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] with allies including resistance fighter [[Alyx Vance]], using weapons such as the object-manipulating [[gravity gun]].\n\nThe game was created using Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], developed alongside. Development lasted five years and cost {{USD}}40 million. Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] set his team the goal of redefining the FPS genre, focusing on advanced [[Physics engine|physics systems]] and [[non-player character]]s. Valve announced ''Half-Life 2'' at [[E3 2003]] and released it through its new distribution service [[Steam (service)|Steam]] after delaying it by over a year. A year before release, a hacker stole an unfinished version and leaked it online.\n\n''Half-Life 2'' received acclaim for its advanced [[dynamical simulation|physics]], [[computer animation|animation]], [[sound recording and reproduction|sound]], [[Game AI|AI]], [[video game graphics|graphics]], and [[narrative]]. It won 39 [[Game of the Year]] awards, and has been cited as one of the [[greatest games of all time]]. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. It was followed by the [[Episodic video game|episodic]] sequels ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'' (2006) and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'' (2007). A prequel, ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'', was released in 2020.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Antlions1HL2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot of the player engaging a group of [[List of creatures in the Half-Life series#Antlion|antlions]] with a pulse rifle. Along the bottom of the screen, the player's health, suit charge level, and their ammunition is displayed.]]\nLike the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998), ''Half-Life 2'' is a single-player [[first-person shooter]] in which players control  [[Gordon Freeman]]. It has similar mechanics to ''Half-Life'', including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up their arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.\n\nA diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, such as the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors. Others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics and can send his team further from him or call them back.\n\nMany of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-orientated puzzles from ''Half-Life'', environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and [[buoyancy]]. For example; In chapter three, \"Route Kanal\", the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can build a crude staircase with the blocks, so the puzzle may be solved in multiple ways.\n\nPart-way through the game, Gordon acquires the [[Gravity Gun]], which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot control without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense, such as a file cabinet, or a deadly projectile, such as a gasoline can or [[Circular saw|buzzsaw]] blade.\n\nThe game never separates the player with pre-rendered [[cutscene]]s or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and the player can control Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to or told through the environment.\n\n== Plot ==\nSome years after [[Gordon Freeman]] and other scientists [[Half-Life (video game)|accidentally opened a portal to a dimension of hostile aliens]] at the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]], Freeman is awoken from stasis by the mysterious [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Half-Life: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|date=November 25, 1998|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=978-0-7615-1360-5}}</ref><ref name=\"pointinsertion1\" /> The portal attracted the attention of the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]], a technologically superior [[Multiverse|multidimensional]] empire which conquered Earth in seven hours. The Combine has implemented a brutal [[police state]] by biologically assimilating humans and other species, and preventing humans from breeding via a \"suppression field\". The G-Man inserts Gordon into a train arriving at [[City 17]], the site of the [[Citadel (Half-Life)|Combine Citadel]], where [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], former Black Mesa administrator who negotiated Earth's surrender, governs as the Combine's [[puppet ruler]].<ref name=\"blackmesaeast2\" />\n\nAfter eluding the Combine forces, Gordon joins resistance members including [[Barney Calhoun]], a former Black Mesa security guard working undercover as a Civil Protection officer; [[Eli Vance|Dr. Eli Vance]], former Black Mesa scientist and leader of the resistance; [[Alyx Vance]], Eli's daughter; and [[Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Kleiner]], an eccentric Black Mesa scientist. After donning his signature Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit and a failed attempt to teleport to the resistance base, [[Black Mesa East]], from Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon progresses there on foot through the city's canal system. With the Combine now informed of Freeman's presence, he obtains an [[airboat]] and battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.<ref name=\"redletterday1\" /><ref name=\"redletterday2\" />\n\nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist, [[Judith Mossman (Half-Life)|Dr. Judith Mossman]].<ref name=\"blackmesaeast1\" /> Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot [[Dog (Half-Life 2)|Dog]] and gives him a \"[[gravity gun]]\", an instrument that can manipulate large objects. When the base is attacked by Combine forces, Eli and Mossman are taken to [[Nova Prospekt]], a Combine prison. Separated from Alyx, Gordon detours through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm, aided by its last survivor, [[Father Grigori]]. Escaping the town, Gordon discovers a resistance outpost. He uses a customized [[dune buggy]] to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt, encountering Combine patrols and helping the resistance fend off raids.\n\nGordon lays siege to Nova Prospekt, using pheromone pods to command hordes of alien \"antlions\" that infest the coast. He reunites with Alyx in the prison and they locate Eli but discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, Mossman teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.\n\nReturning to Kleiner's lab, Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter malfunctioned and that a week has passed. In their absence, the resistance has fully mobilized against the Combine.<ref name=\"goneforaweek\" /> With the aid of Dog and Barney, Gordon fights his way inside the Citadel.<ref name=\"followfreeman! last\" /> A Combine \"confiscation chamber\" destroys all of Gordon's weapons except the gravity gun, which has inadvertently been supercharged, allowing Gordon to fight his way up the Citadel.\n\nGordon is captured in a Combine transport pod and taken to Breen's office, where he and Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Breen explains his plans to further conquer and suppress humanity with the Combine, contrary to what he told Mossman.<ref name=\"darkenergy while-face-to-face\">{{cite video game|title=Half-Life 2|developer=[[Valve Corporation|Valve]]|publisher=Valve|date=November 16, 2004 |platform=[[Windows]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Mac OS X]]|level=Chapter 13: Dark Energy|quote='''Dr. Breen''': Having both of you in my keeping ensures I can dictate the terms of any bargain I care to make with the Combine.}}</ref> Angry, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen can teleport them off-world. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon destroys its reactor with the gravity gun, killing Breen. Just before the Citadel is destroyed in an ensuing explosion, the G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions. He has frozen time from Gordon's perspective, and makes vague mentions of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", before he is placed back into stasis.<ref name=\"darkenergy final\" />\n\n== Development ==\n[[File:Gabe newell doug lombardi.jpg|thumb|Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] in 2007]]\nDevelopment of ''Half-Life 2'' began in June 1999, six months after the release of the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''. It was developed by a team of 82.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/|title=The Final Hours of Half-Life 2|last=Geoff|first=Keighley|authorlink=Geoff Keighley|date=|website=[[GameSpot]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref> Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] wanted to redefine the FPS genre, saying: \"Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless? If ''Half-Life 2'' isn't viewed as the best PC game of all time, it's going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Newell gave his team no deadline and a \"virtually unlimited\" budget, promising to fund the project himself if necessary.<ref name=\":0\" /> The game was built with Valve's new in-house [[game engine]], [[Source (game engine)|Source]], developed simultaneously.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhereas ''Half-Life'' was set in a single location, the Black Mesa research facility, Valve wanted \"a much more epic and global feel\" for the sequel. One concept had the player teleporting between planets, which was discarded as it would make continuity between levels difficult. At the suggestion of Bulgarian art director [[Viktor Antonov (art director)|Viktor Antonov]], the team settled on City 17, based on an Eastern European style. Players would start the game by boarding the ''Borealis'', an icebreaker bound for the city.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Nova Prospekt]] was conceived as a small rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland, and grew from a stopping-off point to the destination itself.<ref name=\"raisebar2\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=Prima Games|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7615-4364-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter observing how players had connected to minor characters in ''Half-Life'', the team developed the characterization, with more detailed character models and realistic animation. Animator Ken Birdwell studied the work of psychologist [[Paul Ekman]], who had researched how facial muscles express emotion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] created family relationships between the characters, saying: \"Characters in games don't really have families, but it's this basic dramatic unit everyone understands.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe team integrated the [[Havok physics engine]], which simulates real-world physics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-16-half-life-2-10-years-on|title=Half-Life 2: 10 years on|last=Stanton|first=Rich|date=2014-11-16|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> to reinforce the player's sense of presence and create new gameplay.<ref name=\":0\" /> To experiment, the team created a minigame, \"Zombie Basketball\", in which players used a physics-manipulating gun to throw zombies through hoops.<ref name=\":0\" /> In mid-2001, to test the engine, Valve built a simulated street war between rioting citizens and police, featuring tanks, [[Molotov cocktail]]s, hand-to-hand fighting, and looting. Designer John Guthrie described it as \"an early attempt at getting something ''\u2013'' anything ''\u2013'' in the game that used non-player characters and physics\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late 2001, Valve began creating a [[showreel]], hoping to demonstrate it at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2002.<ref name=\":0\" /> For several months, Newell let the team work without his input so he could provide unbiased feedback, and focused on developing [[Steam (service)|Steam]], Valve's upcoming digital distribution service. The team presented the showreel to Newell, showcasing physics, environments such as the ''Borealis'', and a dialogue-heavy scene with a scientist character, Dr. Kleiner. Newell felt the showreel did not adequately show how the physics would affect gameplay and that the Kleiner scene was overlong. Reflecting on the failure, Laidlaw said: \"The dramatic scenes with the characters are important, but they have to be in service of the interactivity and gameplay.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn September 2002, the team completed a second showreel, featuring a buggy race along the City 17 coast, an encounter with headcrabs on a pier, an alien strider attacking the city, and a greatly shortened Kleiner sequence. In October, Newell told the team they would announce ''Half-Life 2'' at E3 2003 and release it by the end of the year.<ref name=\":0\" /> As with the original ''Half-Life'', the team split into \"cabals\" working on different levels. Designers created levels using placeholder shapes and surfaces, which were then worked on by the artists.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:HalfLife2 City17 TrainStationSquare.jpg|thumb|A square in City 17, showing the Source engine's lighting and shadow effects]]Valve announced ''Half-Life 2'' at E3 2003, with demonstrations of the characters, animation, and physics. The reaction was positive, and the game won the E3 Game of the Show award. Newell also announced a release date, September 30, 2003, hoping this would motivate the team. The team worked long hours to meet the deadline, but by July it had become apparent that it could not be met. Rumors spread of a delay, but Valve made no announcement until September 23, when they released a statement targeting a \"holiday\" release, leading to fan backlash.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nNewell had been hesitant to announce a delay without a new release date and later said: \"We were paralyzed. We knew we weren't going to make the date we promised, and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing. But we didn't have a new date to give people either.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Video card|graphics card]] manufacturer [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] had arranged a promotional event on [[Alcatraz]] to coincide with the planned release of ''Half-Life 2''; Newell, unable to pull out of the event, gave a prepared speech, demonstrated the Source engine, and left without addressing questions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn early October, the ''Half-Life 2'' [[source code]] was leaked online by a German hacker, Axel Gembe, who had infiltrated Valve's internal network months earlier. A week later, Gembe leaked a playable version of ''Half-Life 2'' from that September, revealing how unfinished it was. The leaks damaged morale at Valve and slowed development.<ref name=\":0\" /> In March 2004, Gembe contacted Newell and identified himself, saying he was a fan and had not acted maliciously. Newell worked with the [[FBI]] to invite Gembe to a fake job interview, planning to have him arrested in the USA; however, police arrested him in Germany.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-21-the-boy-who-stole-half-life-2-article|title=The boy who stole Half-Life 2|last=Parkin|first=Simon|date=2014-05-25|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> In November 2006, Gembe was sentenced to two years' [[probation]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2004, the staff returned after Christmas to long hours, stressful working conditions, and no guarantee that the game, which was costing $1 million a month to develop, would be finished soon. However, Newell felt that progress was speeding up, with the team producing about three hours of gameplay per month. In March, they created the first version playable from start to finish and stopped production for a week to play through the game. Major changes by this point included the cutting of the ''Borealis'' sequence, the replacement of the jet ski with a hovercraft, and the physics-manipulating gravity gun being introduced earlier in the game. Feedback was positive across the company. Newell recalled: \"The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us. Then we knew it just had to get better ''\u2013''  but it was all there.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> After several months of bug fixes and playtesting, ''Half-Life 2'' was completed on October 13, 2004.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Release ==\nValve made a 1GB portion of ''Half-Life 2'' available for download in an encrypted format through Steam on August 26, 2004.

At this time, cyber caf\u00e9s were important for the Asian PC gaming market where PC and broadband penetration per capita were much lower (except [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news_6107712.html |title=Valve vs. Vivendi dogfight heats up in US District Court |first=Curt |last=Feldman |date=December 15, 2004 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930145805/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news_6107712.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Vivendi Universal Games, the distribution contract they signed with Valve included cyber caf\u00e9s.

Like the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', it combines shooting, puzzles, and storytelling, and adds features such as vehicles and physics-based gameplay. Players control [[Gordon Freeman]], who fights the alien [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]] with allies including resistance fighter [[Alyx Vance]], using weapons such as the object-manipulating [[gravity gun]].\n\nThe game was created using Valve's [[Source (game engine)|Source engine]], developed alongside. Development lasted five years and cost {{USD}}40 million. Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] set his team the goal of redefining the FPS genre, focusing on advanced [[Physics engine|physics systems]] and [[non-player character]]s. Valve announced ''Half-Life 2'' at [[E3 2003]] and released it through its new distribution service [[Steam (service)|Steam]] after delaying it by over a year. A year before release, a hacker stole an unfinished version and leaked it online.\n\n''Half-Life 2'' received acclaim for its advanced [[dynamical simulation|physics]], [[computer animation|animation]], [[sound recording and reproduction|sound]], [[Game AI|AI]], [[video game graphics|graphics]], and [[narrative]]. It won 39 [[Game of the Year]] awards, and has been cited as one of the [[greatest games of all time]]. By 2011, it had sold 12 million copies. It was followed by the [[Episodic video game|episodic]] sequels ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode One|Episode One]]'' (2006) and ''[[Half-Life 2: Episode Two|Episode Two]]'' (2007). A prequel, ''[[Half-Life: Alyx]]'', was released in 2020.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Antlions1HL2.jpg|left|thumb|A screenshot of the player engaging a group of [[List of creatures in the Half-Life series#Antlion|antlions]] with a pulse rifle. Along the bottom of the screen, the player's health, suit charge level, and their ammunition is displayed.]]\nLike the original ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' (1998), ''Half-Life 2'' is a single-player [[first-person shooter]] in which players control  [[Gordon Freeman]]. It has similar mechanics to ''Half-Life'', including health-and-weapon systems and periodic physics puzzles, except with the newer [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine and improved graphics. The player also starts without items, slowly building up their arsenal over the course of the game. Despite the game's mainly linear nature, much effort was put into making exploration rewarding and interesting; many optional areas can be missed or avoided.\n\nA diverse set of enemies is present, which usually require being approached with different tactics: some coordinate in groups to out-maneuver or out-position the player; others, such as the Manhack, fly directly at the player through small openings and tight corridors. Others use predictable but powerful attacks, while others hide before swiftly attacking the player. Gordon can kill most enemies with his weapons, or make use of indirect means, exploiting environmental hazards such as explosive pressurized canisters, gas fires or improvised traps. For some portions of the game, Gordon can be joined by up to four armed Resistance soldiers or medics and can send his team further from him or call them back.\n\nMany of the game's new features utilize its detailed physics simulation. Two sections of the game involve driving vehicles. Instead of button-orientated puzzles from ''Half-Life'', environmental puzzles are also introduced with makeshift mechanical systems, revolving around the player's new ability to pick up, move, and place objects. Solutions involve objects' physical properties, such as shape, weight, and [[buoyancy]]. For example; In chapter three, \"Route Kanal\", the player is required to stack cinder blocks on a makeshift see-saw ramp to proceed over a wall. Alternatively, the player can build a crude staircase with the blocks, so the puzzle may be solved in multiple ways.\n\nPart-way through the game, Gordon acquires the [[Gravity Gun]], which allows him to draw distant objects towards himself or forcefully push them away, as well as the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects that he cannot control without the weapon. These abilities are required to solve puzzles later in the game, and can also be used to great effect in combat, as any non-static object within proximity to the player has the potential to be used as a makeshift defense, such as a file cabinet, or a deadly projectile, such as a gasoline can or [[Circular saw|buzzsaw]] blade.\n\nThe game never separates the player with pre-rendered [[cutscene]]s or events; the story proceeds via exposition from other characters and in-world events, and the player can control Gordon for the entirety of the game. Much of the backstory to the game is simply alluded to or told through the environment.\n\n== Plot ==\nSome years after [[Gordon Freeman]] and other scientists [[Half-Life (video game)|accidentally opened a portal to a dimension of hostile aliens]] at the [[Black Mesa Research Facility]], Freeman is awoken from stasis by the mysterious [[G-Man (Half-Life)|G-Man]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Half-Life: Prima's Official Strategy Guide|last=Bell|first=Joe Grant|date=November 25, 1998|publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=978-0-7615-1360-5}}</ref><ref name=\"pointinsertion1\" /> The portal attracted the attention of the [[Combine (Half-Life)|Combine]], a technologically superior [[Multiverse|multidimensional]] empire which conquered Earth in seven hours. The Combine has implemented a brutal [[police state]] by biologically assimilating humans and other species, and preventing humans from breeding via a \"suppression field\". The G-Man inserts Gordon into a train arriving at [[City 17]], the site of the [[Citadel (Half-Life)|Combine Citadel]], where [[Wallace Breen|Dr. Wallace Breen]], former Black Mesa administrator who negotiated Earth's surrender, governs as the Combine's [[puppet ruler]].<ref name=\"blackmesaeast2\" />\n\nAfter eluding the Combine forces, Gordon joins resistance members including [[Barney Calhoun]], a former Black Mesa security guard working undercover as a Civil Protection officer; [[Eli Vance|Dr. Eli Vance]], former Black Mesa scientist and leader of the resistance; [[Alyx Vance]], Eli's daughter; and [[Isaac Kleiner|Dr. Kleiner]], an eccentric Black Mesa scientist. After donning his signature Hazardous Environment (HEV) suit and a failed attempt to teleport to the resistance base, [[Black Mesa East]], from Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon progresses there on foot through the city's canal system. With the Combine now informed of Freeman's presence, he obtains an [[airboat]] and battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city.<ref name=\"redletterday1\" /><ref name=\"redletterday2\" />\n\nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets another resistance scientist, [[Judith Mossman (Half-Life)|Dr. Judith Mossman]].<ref name=\"blackmesaeast1\" /> Alyx introduces Gordon to her pet robot [[Dog (Half-Life 2)|Dog]] and gives him a \"[[gravity gun]]\", an instrument that can manipulate large objects. When the base is attacked by Combine forces, Eli and Mossman are taken to [[Nova Prospekt]], a Combine prison. Separated from Alyx, Gordon detours through the zombie-infested town of Ravenholm, aided by its last survivor, [[Father Grigori]]. Escaping the town, Gordon discovers a resistance outpost. He uses a customized [[dune buggy]] to travel a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt, encountering Combine patrols and helping the resistance fend off raids.\n\nGordon lays siege to Nova Prospekt, using pheromone pods to command hordes of alien \"antlions\" that infest the coast. He reunites with Alyx in the prison and they locate Eli but discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, Mossman teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt.\n\nReturning to Kleiner's lab, Gordon and Alyx learn that the teleporter malfunctioned and that a week has passed. In their absence, the resistance has fully mobilized against the Combine.<ref name=\"goneforaweek\" /> With the aid of Dog and Barney, Gordon fights his way inside the Citadel.<ref name=\"followfreeman! last\" /> A Combine \"confiscation chamber\" destroys all of Gordon's weapons except the gravity gun, which has inadvertently been supercharged, allowing Gordon to fight his way up the Citadel.\n\nGordon is captured in a Combine transport pod and taken to Breen's office, where he and Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity.

It was developed by a team of 82.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/|title=The Final Hours of Half-Life 2|last=Geoff|first=Keighley|authorlink=Geoff Keighley|date=|website=[[GameSpot]]|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-11-30}}</ref> Valve president [[Gabe Newell]] wanted to redefine the FPS genre, saying: \"Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless? If ''Half-Life 2'' isn't viewed as the best PC game of all time, it's going to completely bum out most of the guys on this team.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Newell gave his team no deadline and a \"virtually unlimited\" budget, promising to fund the project himself if necessary.<ref name=\":0\" /> The game was built with Valve's new in-house [[game engine]], [[Source (game engine)|Source]], developed simultaneously.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhereas ''Half-Life'' was set in a single location, the Black Mesa research facility, Valve wanted \"a much more epic and global feel\" for the sequel. One concept had the player teleporting between planets, which was discarded as it would make continuity between levels difficult. At the suggestion of Bulgarian art director [[Viktor Antonov (art director)|Viktor Antonov]], the team settled on City 17, based on an Eastern European style. Players would start the game by boarding the ''Borealis'', an icebreaker bound for the city.<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Nova Prospekt]] was conceived as a small rail depot built on an old prison in the wasteland, and grew from a stopping-off point to the destination itself.<ref name=\"raisebar2\">{{cite book|title=Half-Life 2: Raising the Bar|last=Hodgson|first=David|publisher=Prima Games|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7615-4364-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter observing how players had connected to minor characters in ''Half-Life'', the team developed the characterization, with more detailed character models and realistic animation. Animator Ken Birdwell studied the work of psychologist [[Paul Ekman]], who had researched how facial muscles express emotion.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer [[Marc Laidlaw]] created family relationships between the characters, saying: \"Characters in games don't really have families, but it's this basic dramatic unit everyone understands.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe team integrated the [[Havok physics engine]], which simulates real-world physics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-16-half-life-2-10-years-on|title=Half-Life 2: 10 years on|last=Stanton|first=Rich|date=2014-11-16|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> to reinforce the player's sense of presence and create new gameplay.<ref name=\":0\" /> To experiment, the team created a minigame, \"Zombie Basketball\", in which players used a physics-manipulating gun to throw zombies through hoops.<ref name=\":0\" /> In mid-2001, to test the engine, Valve built a simulated street war between rioting citizens and police, featuring tanks, [[Molotov cocktail]]s, hand-to-hand fighting, and looting. Designer John Guthrie described it as \"an early attempt at getting something ''\u2013'' anything ''\u2013'' in the game that used non-player characters and physics\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn late 2001, Valve began creating a [[showreel]], hoping to demonstrate it at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2002.<ref name=\":0\" /> For several months, Newell let the team work without his input so he could provide unbiased feedback, and focused on developing [[Steam (service)|Steam]], Valve's upcoming digital distribution service. The team presented the showreel to Newell, showcasing physics, environments such as the ''Borealis'', and a dialogue-heavy scene with a scientist character, Dr. Kleiner. Newell felt the showreel did not adequately show how the physics would affect gameplay and that the Kleiner scene was overlong. Reflecting on the failure, Laidlaw said: \"The dramatic scenes with the characters are important, but they have to be in service of the interactivity and gameplay.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn September 2002, the team completed a second showreel, featuring a buggy race along the City 17 coast, an encounter with headcrabs on a pier, an alien strider attacking the city, and a greatly shortened Kleiner sequence. In October, Newell told the team they would announce ''Half-Life 2'' at E3 2003 and release it by the end of the year.<ref name=\":0\" /> As with the original ''Half-Life'', the team split into \"cabals\" working on different levels. Designers created levels using placeholder shapes and surfaces, which were then worked on by the artists.<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:HalfLife2 City17 TrainStationSquare.jpg|thumb|A square in City 17, showing the Source engine's lighting and shadow effects]]Valve announced ''Half-Life 2'' at E3 2003, with demonstrations of the characters, animation, and physics. The reaction was positive, and the game won the E3 Game of the Show award. Newell also announced a release date, September 30, 2003, hoping this would motivate the team. The team worked long hours to meet the deadline, but by July it had become apparent that it could not be met. Rumors spread of a delay, but Valve made no announcement until September 23, when they released a statement targeting a \"holiday\" release, leading to fan backlash.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nNewell had been hesitant to announce a delay without a new release date and later said: \"We were paralyzed. We knew we weren't going to make the date we promised, and that was going to be a huge fiasco and really embarrassing. But we didn't have a new date to give people either.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Video card|graphics card]] manufacturer [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] had arranged a promotional event on [[Alcatraz]] to coincide with the planned release of ''Half-Life 2''; Newell, unable to pull out of the event, gave a prepared speech, demonstrated the Source engine, and left without addressing questions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn early October, the ''Half-Life 2'' [[source code]] was leaked online by a German hacker, Axel Gembe, who had infiltrated Valve's internal network months earlier. A week later, Gembe leaked a playable version of ''Half-Life 2'' from that September, revealing how unfinished it was. The leaks damaged morale at Valve and slowed development.<ref name=\":0\" /> In March 2004, Gembe contacted Newell and identified himself, saying he was a fan and had not acted maliciously. Newell worked with the [[FBI]] to invite Gembe to a fake job interview, planning to have him arrested in the USA; however, police arrested him in Germany.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-21-the-boy-who-stole-half-life-2-article|title=The boy who stole Half-Life 2|last=Parkin|first=Simon|date=2014-05-25|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref> In November 2006, Gembe was sentenced to two years' [[probation]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2004, the staff returned after Christmas to long hours, stressful working conditions, and no guarantee that the game, which was costing $1 million a month to develop, would be finished soon. However, Newell felt that progress was speeding up, with the team producing about three hours of gameplay per month. In March, they created the first version playable from start to finish and stopped production for a week to play through the game. Major changes by this point included the cutting of the ''Borealis'' sequence, the replacement of the jet ski with a hovercraft, and the physics-manipulating gravity gun being introduced earlier in the game. Feedback was positive across the company. Newell recalled: \"The fact that you could go from one end of the game to the other was a really big thing for us. Then we knew it just had to get better ''\u2013''  but it was all there.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> After several months of bug fixes and playtesting, ''Half-Life 2'' was completed on October 13, 2004.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Release ==\nValve made a 1GB portion of ''Half-Life 2'' available for download in an encrypted format through Steam on August 26, 2004.

At this time, cyber caf\u00e9s were important for the Asian PC gaming market where PC and broadband penetration per capita were much lower (except [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news_6107712.html |title=Valve vs. Vivendi dogfight heats up in US District Court |first=Curt |last=Feldman |date=December 15, 2004 |website=GameSpot |accessdate=September 21, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930145805/http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/halflife2/news_6107712.html |archivedate=September 30, 2007}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Vivendi Universal Games, the distribution contract they signed with Valve included cyber caf\u00e9s. This would mean that only Vivendi Universal Games could distribute ''Half-Life 2'' to cyber caf\u00e9s&nbsp;\u2014 not Valve through the Steam system. On November 29, 2004, Judge Thomas S. Zilly, of [[United States district court|U.S. Federal District Court]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], ruled that Vivendi Universal Games and its affiliates are not authorized to distribute (directly or indirectly) Valve games through cyber caf\u00e9s to end users for [[Pay to Play|pay-to-play]] activities according to the parties' current publishing agreement. Also, Judge Zilly ruled in favor of the Valve motion regarding the contractual limitation of liability, allowing Valve to recover copyright damages for any infringement as allowed by law without regard to the publishing agreement's limitation of liability clause.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=October 3, 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4054643.stm |title=Half-Life 2 maker wins legal case |work=BBC |date=November 30, 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208192206/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4054643.stm |archivedate=February 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn April 29, 2005, the two parties announced a settlement agreement.

The major source of {{NOx}} production from nitrogen-bearing fuels such as certain coals and oil, is the conversion of fuel bound nitrogen to {{NOx}} during combustion.<ref name=Beychok/> During combustion, the nitrogen bound in the fuel is released as a [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] and ultimately forms free N<sub>2</sub>, or NO. Fuel {{NOx}} can contribute as much as 50% of total emissions through the combusting oil and as much as 80% through the combusting of coal.\n\nAlthough the complete mechanism is not fully understood, there are two primary pathways of formation. The first involves the oxidation of volatile nitrogen species during the initial stages of combustion. During the release and before the oxidation of the volatiles, nitrogen reacts to form several intermediaries which are then oxidized into NO. If the volatiles evolve into a reducing atmosphere, the nitrogen evolved can readily be made to form nitrogen gas, rather than {{NOx}}. The second pathway involves the combustion of nitrogen contained in the char matrix during the combustion of the [[Charring|char]] portion of the fuels. This reaction occurs much more slowly than the volatile phase. Only around 20% of the char nitrogen is ultimately emitted as {{NOx}}, since much of the {{NOx}} that forms during this process is reduced to nitrogen by the char, which is nearly pure carbon.\n\n==== Prompt ====\n\nNitrogen oxides are released during manufacturing of nitrogen fertilizers. Though nitrous oxide is emitted during its application, it is then reacted in atmosphere to form nitrogen oxides.

This has been deemed necessary by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to offset the combination of vehicle congestion, warm temperatures, extensive sunlight, PM, and topography that all contribute to the formation of ozone and smog.  CARB has established a special regulation for Alternative Diesel Fuels to ensure that any new fuels, including biodiesel, coming into the market do not substantially increase NOx emissions. The reduction of {{NOx}} emissions is one of the most important challenges for advances in vehicle technology. While diesel vehicles sold in the US since 2010 are dramatically cleaner than previous diesel vehicles, urban areas continue to seek more ways to reduce the formation of smog and ozone. {{NOx}} formation during combustion is associated with a number of factors such as combustion temperature.  As such, it can be observed that the vehicle drive cycle, or the load on the engine have more significant impact on NOx emissions than the type of fuel used.  This may be especially true for modern, clean diesel vehicles that continuously monitor engine operation electronically and actively control engine parameters and exhaust system operations to limit NOx emission to less than 0.2 g/km.  Low-temperature combustion or LTC technology<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\"/> may help reduce thermal formation of {{NOx}} during combustion, however a tradeoff exists as high temperature combustion produces less PM or soot and results in greater power and [[fuel efficiency]].\n\n== Regulation and emission control technologies ==\n[[Selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) and [[selective non-catalytic reduction]] (SNCR) reduce post combustion {{NOx}} by reacting the exhaust with [[urea]] or ammonia to produce nitrogen and water.

The major source of {{NOx}} production from nitrogen-bearing fuels such as certain coals and oil, is the conversion of fuel bound nitrogen to {{NOx}} during combustion.<ref name=Beychok/> During combustion, the nitrogen bound in the fuel is released as a [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] and ultimately forms free N<sub>2</sub>, or NO. Fuel {{NOx}} can contribute as much as 50% of total emissions through the combusting oil and as much as 80% through the combusting of coal.\n\nAlthough the complete mechanism is not fully understood, there are two primary pathways of formation. The first involves the oxidation of volatile nitrogen species during the initial stages of combustion. During the release and before the oxidation of the volatiles, nitrogen reacts to form several intermediaries which are then oxidized into NO. If the volatiles evolve into a reducing atmosphere, the nitrogen evolved can readily be made to form nitrogen gas, rather than {{NOx}}. The second pathway involves the combustion of nitrogen contained in the char matrix during the combustion of the [[Charring|char]] portion of the fuels. This reaction occurs much more slowly than the volatile phase.

This has been deemed necessary by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to offset the combination of vehicle congestion, warm temperatures, extensive sunlight, PM, and topography that all contribute to the formation of ozone and smog.  CARB has established a special regulation for Alternative Diesel Fuels to ensure that any new fuels, including biodiesel, coming into the market do not substantially increase NOx emissions. The reduction of {{NOx}} emissions is one of the most important challenges for advances in vehicle technology. While diesel vehicles sold in the US since 2010 are dramatically cleaner than previous diesel vehicles, urban areas continue to seek more ways to reduce the formation of smog and ozone. {{NOx}} formation during combustion is associated with a number of factors such as combustion temperature.  As such, it can be observed that the vehicle drive cycle, or the load on the engine have more significant impact on NOx emissions than the type of fuel used.  This may be especially true for modern, clean diesel vehicles that continuously monitor engine operation electronically and actively control engine parameters and exhaust system operations to limit NOx emission to less than 0.2 g/km.  Low-temperature combustion or LTC technology<ref name=\"sciencedirect.com\"/> may help reduce thermal formation of {{NOx}} during combustion, however a tradeoff exists as high temperature combustion produces less PM or soot and results in greater power and [[fuel efficiency]].\n\n== Regulation and emission control technologies ==\n[[Selective catalytic reduction]] (SCR) and [[selective non-catalytic reduction]] (SNCR) reduce post combustion {{NOx}} by reacting the exhaust with [[urea]] or ammonia to produce nitrogen and water.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financing difficulties & an ongoing recession which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled resulted in the building's ownership was reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 and with the structure reaming abandoned.

In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered.

The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule.

The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network.

This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto. These projects included the Bay West Teamway, Union Plaza, the Galleria (shopping centre), and Bremner Boulevard.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Air Canada]] purchased [[naming rights]] to the arena for US$30&nbsp;million for 20 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>.

Infill of the inner harbour began in the 1850's and accelerated with the arrival of the railroad resulting in the current day shape of downtown <ref>https://www.cgenarchive.org/toronto-lakeshores.html</ref>.  By 1858 the site was located between two warfs (Rees & Tinnings Warf). As land was expanded southward, it remained under Government control as possible locations of various Union Station expansions.  The majority of the land was still part of the lake up until the early 1900's. By 1925 The northern parcel of the property was turned into of Bayside Park, which had been part of an early proposal that was to have seen the lands south of the rail corridor transformed into an extensive lakeside park that followed today's Esplande. The remaining land was most likely under the control of Central Harbor Terminals<ref>https://maps.library.utoronto.ca/dvhmp/maps.html</ref>.\n\nIn the 1930s the property became the proposed home to [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building.  In the 1920's a postal handling facility already existed in the east wing of the city's then New Union Station (Downtown Toronto's 3rd major train station)<ref>{{cite book |last=Filey |first=Mike |author-link= |date=1992 |title=A Toronto Album 2: More Glimpses of the City That Was|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=K0tIsZ_TAIoC&pg=PA43 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn Press |page=43 |isbn=}}</ref>.

In 1937 the Postmaster General appealed to the Minister of Public Works to approve a new replacement facility at the corner of Bay & Fleet Street (now Lake Shore Boulevard). Approval was granted by the federal Department of Public Works in part to stimulate the depression impacted construction industry<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>. Design and construction of the warehouse built with steel & concrete would begin in 1938. Designed by [[Charles B.

Required modifications were made to the building to return it back to its postal delivery purposes as a result of alterations done by the Department of National Defence.  After the refurbishment work was completed in 1948, the building now possessed the capability and equipment for proper mail sorting and other mailing processing functions. Though it was designed as a mail sorting warehouse it was also the home of Postal Station \"A\" which served mostly institutional & commercial clients.  The Ground floor was where the mail was dropped off by both railway carts and postal vans. Unsorted mail was moved by conveyor belts to the top floor and via gravity fed mail chutes sorted by size & destination.  Eventually the sorted mail would end up back on the ground floor where it would be sent out for delivery<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://torontoplaques.com/Pages/Toronto_Postal_Delivery_Building.html|title=History|language=en|access-date=April 16, 2020</ref>.

The sculptors son Louis Temporale jr. helped with restoration efforts in 1998 and in 2016 was still critical of the lack of protection of the artwork by stadium ownership for over 20 years.

In a cost cutting move (part of larger overall service changes & cuts made to the Crown Corporation under the [[Brian Mulroney]] Conservatives), Canada Post decided to close the facility and move operations to an alternate more modern c.1970s letter processing faculty on nearby Eastern Avenue. A structure with easy access to highways was designed specificity for transport truck delivery of mail. By 1989, all of the old building's work was transferred here.<ref name=\":0\" />. The 1980s real estate boom saw the building site become surrounded by skyscrapers, hotels, convention centres, SkyDome stadium & condo towers.  In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|230,000|m2|sqft|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. Financial and development details of the purchase imposed various conditions prior to development, including rezoning by the city, remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\nDue to financing difficulties & an ongoing recession which saw many downtown Toronto high rise construction projects paused or cancelled resulted in the building's ownership was reverted back to Canada Post in 1993 and with the structure reaming abandoned. The Toronto Raptors purchased the unused building from Canada Post the following year.<ref name=\"rapnba\">{{cite web| url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/history/raptors_history.html/| title=Laying the Groundwork for the NBA in Toronto| website=nba.com| accessdate=October 14, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:Postal terminal now Air Canada Centre.jpg|thumb|left|The arena retains the eastern & southern walls of the original postal structure built, through a process of [[facadism]].]]\nConstruction of the arena was started by the Toronto Raptors, under their initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]]. In 1995, it had been decided that the NBA would expand into Canada. The Toronto Raptors were created and would need an indoor arena to play in. The Canada Post building was chosen to be the new home of the Raptors due to its downtown location and lot size. Other venues such as [[Exhibition Place]], North York Centre, Bay and Wellesley, and Bay and Dundas were also considered. The Canada Post building was purchased for {{CAD|60}} million.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Raptors initially played in SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) while the arena was constructed.<ref name=\"blogTo\">{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Bateman|title=That time the Raptors and the Maple Leafs moved to the ACC|url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2014/02/that_time_the_raptors_and_leafs_moved_to_the_acc/|website=blogTo|date=February 22, 2014|accessdate=December 4, 2017}}</ref> Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. The building retained the [[Art Deco]] Queenston limestone facade of the Toronto Postal Delivery Building along the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the ''[[Ontario Heritage Act]]''.\n\n====Arena 'Wars'====\nWhen MLGL ([[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment|Maple Leaf Gardens, Limited]] at the time the controlling company of the Toronto Maple Leafs) lost out on their desire to be the franchise owners of the Raptors, competition between the two organizations heated up centred around venues. MLGL declined to allow Maple Leaf Gardens to be used for the NBA upstart as a result pushing Bitove to secure rights to have the Raptors' opening seasons played at SkyDome until construction of the new stadium to be complete.\n\nThe 1930s-era Maple Leaf Gardens was showing its age; the Maple Leafs in desperate desire for a new facility began developing plans for building an all-new stadium with one of the key criteria for the new location that it must be within close walking proximity to both the subway system and GO Transit. During the early stages of construction, MLGL floated to the media plans for their own plans to build a competing single-use stadium on adjacent property just to the north of the stadium atop the train sheds at Union Station (similar to how [[Madison Square Garden]] was constructed) as the new home for the Toronto Maple Leafs.<ref name=ArenaWars>{{cite news|title=Leafs ready to Move (Page 2)|first=Craig|last=Daniels|date=April 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref> The reaction from Raptors was nothing but anger. \"This proposed (Maple Leaf) location really disturbs us\" stated team president Richard Peddie, who went on to say that they would fight the Leafs \"every step of the way\" and he didn't understand why the Leafs have refused to join with the Raptors at their site; claiming that the Leafs want to \"build virtually on top of us\".<ref name=\"ArenaWars\" /> The major problem of the Union Station proposal is the land that the stadium would be built on was actually City of Toronto land that was leased out to CN Rail and CP Rail, which were in a major, long-standing dispute over rent payments (dating back to 1969). As a result, MLGL offered the city $156 Million (1997 CAD) in cash & assets to settle any and all outstanding claims and to buy the air rights above the Union Station train platforms.\n\nDuring this period John Bitove who disputed over the future of the arena who as a result of a [[shotgun clause]] was forced to sell his stake to Allan Slaight (who wanted a joint arena deal with MLGL) and now with majority ownership immediately went into talks with MLGL which eventually purchased both the Raptors and their partially completed arena, which subsequently resulted in major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217&nbsp;million, MLGL increased the budget to $265&nbsp;million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref> The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>\n\n====Construction==== \nAfter the purchase of the Raptors and the Air Canada Centre the new owners entered into a design-build contract with PCL with the commitment to finish the stadium in 24-months by March 1st 1999<ref>https://canada.constructconnect.com/dcn/news/projects/2017/03/pcl-construction-reflects-on-building-the-air-canada-centre-1022273w</ref>.

The Raptors had attempted to play the April 19 match at Maple Leaf Gardens, but were unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors Move Final Game to Hamilton|date=January 7, 1998|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|url=https://www.apnews.com/7027ff09054e45b3b7471205f12cb521}}</ref>\n[[File:Air Canada Centre in 1999.jpg|thumb|right|Air Canada Centre in July 1999, five months after the arena opened]]\n\nOn December 30th 1998, the building's construction was completed, 9 days ahead of schedule. Opening events took place early the next year and [[Steve Stavro]] (who was the majority shareholder of MLGL) was named CEO. The initial hockey game took place February 20, 1999 (Toronto Maple Leafs vs. [[Montreal Canadiens]]), the first basketball Game on February 21, 1999 (Toronto Raptors vs. [[Vancouver Grizzlies]]), and the opening concert on February 22, 1999 ([[The Tragically Hip]]).<ref name=\":0\" /> Features of the new building consist of a {{convert|65000|sqft|adj=on}} arena and a {{convert|165000|sqft|adj=on}} office tower. There is also an east\u2013west covered, climate controlled galleria and walkway onsite that contains restaurants, the ticket office, and other commercial units. The Galleria also connects Scotiabank Arena to popular locations in the downtown core such as Union Station, Bay Street and York Street. Scotiabank Arena is connected to the underground PATH network. The Galleria also doubles as a historical museum by displaying numerous artifacts from the old Canada Post building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcl.com/Projects-that-Inspire/Pages/Air-Canada-Centre.aspx|title=Air Canada Centre|work=PCL Constructors|access-date=November 15, 2018|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nIn its first ten years of operation, the new arena had an estimated economic benefit of $2.4&nbsp;billion. This boosted Toronto's economy and led to further construction in the downtown core. Many projects in the area were completed ahead of schedule as a result of a desire to increase the infrastructure of downtown Toronto, and also from private funding (approximately $13&nbsp;million) that was invested in seeing the economic growth of Toronto.

Reference to weaving and spinning materials is found in the [[Vedic Literature]]. There was textile trade in India during the early centuries. A block printed and resist-dyed fabric, whose origin is from [[Gujarat]] was found in the tombs of [[Fostat]], Egypt. This proves that Indian export of cotton textiles to Egypt or the Nile Civilization in medieval times were to a large extent. Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the [[silk route]] in China <ref>{{cite web|title=History of Textile|url=http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm}}</ref>  to the western countries. The Indian silks were often exchanged with the western countries for their spices in the [[barter system]]. During the late 17th and 18th century there were large export of the Indian cotton to the western countries to meet the need of the European industries during [[industrial revolution]], apart from the domestic requirement at the [[Indian Ordnance Factories]].<ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=ocfs&page=about&lang=en</ref><ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=oefc&page=about&lang=en</ref>\n\nThe Textile industry was the major component of economic income in India before the English colonies. \"The hand-loom and the spinning-wheel, producing their regular myriads of spinners and weavers, were the pivots of the structure of that society,\" described by Karl Marx.<ref> Marx, Karl. \u201cThe British Rule in India.\u201d New York Daily Tribune, 25 June 1853.</ref> Due to the abolishment of slavery in the Americas, England began to search for another source of cheap cotton, and saw India as a ripe place for this. They convinced many farmers to switch from subsistence farming to producing and exporting huge amounts of cotton, after a long period of protectionism over the English textile industry.[https://www.thefridaytimes.com/weaving-misery/] Eventually, through colonization, the traditional method of artisan Textile production was destroyed, and replaced with large scale factory production.\n\n==Production==\nIndia is the second largest producer of fibre in the world and the major fibre produced is [[cotton]]. Other fibres produced in India include [[silk]], [[jute]], [[wool]], and [[man-made fibers]]. 60% of the Indian textile Industry is cotton based. The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textiles industry. In December 2010, the domestic cotton price was up by 50% as compared to the December 2009 prices. The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile (325 lakh bales for 2010 -11).<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\">{{cite web|last=Back to growth Trajectory|first=textile|title=SURVEY OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES|publisher=Hindu}}</ref> There has been increase in India's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years.<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\" /> The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country.\n*Man Made Fibres: This includes manufacturing of clothes using fibre or filament synthetic yarns. It is produced in the large power loom factories. They account for the largest sector of the textile production in India. This sector has a share of 62% of the India's total production and provides employment to about 4.8 million people.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\">{{cite web|title=Indian Textiles Industry|url=http://www.indialawoffices.com/pdf/textileindustry.pdf}}</ref>\n*The Cotton Sector: It is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries. It provides employment to a huge number of people but its productions and employment is seasonal depending upon the seasonal nature of the production.\n*The Handloom Sector: It is well developed and is mainly dependent on the SHGs for their funds. Its market share is 13%.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the total cloth produced in India.\n*The Woolen Sector: India is the 7th largest producer.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the wool in the world. India also produces 1.8% of the world's total wool.\n*The Jute Sector: The jute or the golden fibre in India is mainly produced in the Eastern states of India like Assam and West Bengal. India is the largest producer of jute in the world.\n*The Sericulture and Silk Sector: India is the second largest producer of silk in the world. India produces 18% of the world's total silk. Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga are the main types of silk produced in the country. It is a labour-intensive sector.\n\n== Cotton textile ==\nIn the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw materials, market, transport, labour, moist climate and other factors contributed to localisation. In the early twentieth century, this industry played a huge role in Bombay's economy but soon declined after independence.<ref name=\"BridgeWatson2010\">{{cite book|author1=Gary Bridge|author2=Sophie Watson|title=The Blackwell City Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2aC62fqCyQC&pg=PA75|date=8 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8983-5|pages=75\u201376}}</ref> While spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised.

Although India has a large share in world trade of cotton yarn, its trade in garments is only 4% of the world's total.\n\n== Jute textiles ==\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and the third largest exporter after Bangladesh. There were about 80 jute mills in India in 2010\u201311, most of which are located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks of the [[Hooghly River]], in a narrow belt (98&nbsp;km long and 3&nbsp;km wide).\n\nIn 2010-2011 the jute industry was supporting 0.37 million workers directly and another 400,000 small and marginal farmers who were engaged in the cultivation of jute.\n\nChallenges faced by the industry include stiff competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt and Thailand.

Reference to weaving and spinning materials is found in the [[Vedic Literature]]. There was textile trade in India during the early centuries. A block printed and resist-dyed fabric, whose origin is from [[Gujarat]] was found in the tombs of [[Fostat]], Egypt. This proves that Indian export of cotton textiles to Egypt or the Nile Civilization in medieval times were to a large extent. Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the [[silk route]] in China <ref>{{cite web|title=History of Textile|url=http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm}}</ref>  to the western countries. The Indian silks were often exchanged with the western countries for their spices in the [[barter system]]. During the late 17th and 18th century there were large export of the Indian cotton to the western countries to meet the need of the European industries during [[industrial revolution]], apart from the domestic requirement at the [[Indian Ordnance Factories]].<ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=ocfs&page=about&lang=en</ref><ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=oefc&page=about&lang=en</ref>\n\nThe Textile industry was the major component of economic income in India before the English colonies. \"The hand-loom and the spinning-wheel, producing their regular myriads of spinners and weavers, were the pivots of the structure of that society,\" described by Karl Marx.<ref> Marx, Karl. \u201cThe British Rule in India.\u201d New York Daily Tribune, 25 June 1853.</ref> Due to the abolishment of slavery in the Americas, England began to search for another source of cheap cotton, and saw India as a ripe place for this. They convinced many farmers to switch from subsistence farming to producing and exporting huge amounts of cotton, after a long period of protectionism over the English textile industry.[https://www.thefridaytimes.com/weaving-misery/] Eventually, through colonization, the traditional method of artisan Textile production was destroyed, and replaced with large scale factory production.\n\n==Production==\nIndia is the second largest producer of fibre in the world and the major fibre produced is [[cotton]]. Other fibres produced in India include [[silk]], [[jute]], [[wool]], and [[man-made fibers]]. 60% of the Indian textile Industry is cotton based. The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textiles industry. In December 2010, the domestic cotton price was up by 50% as compared to the December 2009 prices. The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile (325 lakh bales for 2010 -11).<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\">{{cite web|last=Back to growth Trajectory|first=textile|title=SURVEY OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES|publisher=Hindu}}</ref> There has been increase in India's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years.<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\" /> The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country.\n*Man Made Fibres: This includes manufacturing of clothes using fibre or filament synthetic yarns. It is produced in the large power loom factories. They account for the largest sector of the textile production in India. This sector has a share of 62% of the India's total production and provides employment to about 4.8 million people.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\">{{cite web|title=Indian Textiles Industry|url=http://www.indialawoffices.com/pdf/textileindustry.pdf}}</ref>\n*The Cotton Sector: It is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries. It provides employment to a huge number of people but its productions and employment is seasonal depending upon the seasonal nature of the production.\n*The Handloom Sector: It is well developed and is mainly dependent on the SHGs for their funds. Its market share is 13%.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the total cloth produced in India.\n*The Woolen Sector: India is the 7th largest producer.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the wool in the world. India also produces 1.8% of the world's total wool.\n*The Jute Sector: The jute or the golden fibre in India is mainly produced in the Eastern states of India like Assam and West Bengal. India is the largest producer of jute in the world.\n*The Sericulture and Silk Sector: India is the second largest producer of silk in the world. India produces 18% of the world's total silk. Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga are the main types of silk produced in the country. It is a labour-intensive sector.\n\n== Cotton textile ==\nIn the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw materials, market, transport, labour, moist climate and other factors contributed to localisation. In the early twentieth century, this industry played a huge role in Bombay's economy but soon declined after independence.<ref name=\"BridgeWatson2010\">{{cite book|author1=Gary Bridge|author2=Sophie Watson|title=The Blackwell City Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2aC62fqCyQC&pg=PA75|date=8 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8983-5|pages=75\u201376}}</ref> While spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised.

Apart from these, there are several thousand small factories with three to ten looms.\n\nIndia exports yarn to Japan, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, France, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and other countries. India has the second-largest installed capacity of spindles in the world, with 43.13 million spindles (30 March 2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.citiindia.com/images/database/table5.pdf|title = Installed capacity|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}</ref> after China. Although India has a large share in world trade of cotton yarn, its trade in garments is only 4% of the world's total.\n\n== Jute textiles ==\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and the third largest exporter after Bangladesh. There were about 80 jute mills in India in 2010\u201311, most of which are located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks of the [[Hooghly River]], in a narrow belt (98&nbsp;km long and 3&nbsp;km wide).\n\nIn 2010-2011 the jute industry was supporting 0.37 million workers directly and another 400,000 small and marginal farmers who were engaged in the cultivation of jute.\n\nChallenges faced by the industry include stiff competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt and Thailand.
