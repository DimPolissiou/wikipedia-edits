Seiko launched the [[Ruputer]] in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6&nbsp;MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).\n\nIn 1999, [[Samsung]] launched the world's first watch phone, the SPH-WP10.

After [[Alexander the Great]] died, the first Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy I Soter]]) announced himself king in 305 BC, and commissioned its construction shortly thereafter. The building was finished during the reign of his son, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], and took twelve years to complete at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s of silver.<ref>Over twenty-three tons of silver. \"This was an enormous sum, a tenth of the treasury when Ptolemy I assumed the throne. (In comparison, the [[Parthenon]] is estimated to have cost at least 469 talents of silver.)\"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/greece/paganism/pharos.html]</ref> The light was produced by a [[furnace]] at the top, and the tower was said to have been built mostly with solid blocks of [[limestone]]. Although, since the lighthouse was over 300 feet tall the use of limestone as the main material is doubtful due to the possibility of collapsing under its own weight. Rather, pink granite found nearby is more probable as it is much stronger and can withstand more weight.{{citation needed|reason=inadequacy of limestone is possible original research|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[Strabo]] reported that [[Sostratus of Cnidus|Sostratus]] had a dedication to the \"Saviour Gods\" inscribed in metal letters on the lighthouse.

Battuta noted that the wrecked condition of the lighthouse was then only noticeable by the rectangle tower and entrance ramp. Battuta's account measured each side of the tower to be 140 shibr (30.8 m, 101&nbsp;ft) on either side. Battuta detailed plans of Sultan [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] to build a new lighthouse near the site of the collapsed one, but the plans were never fulfilled after the sultan's death in 1341.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n==Destruction==\nThe lighthouse was partially cracked and damaged by earthquakes in 796 and 951, followed by structural collapse in the earthquake of 956, and then again in 1303 and 1323. Damaging earthquakes propagate from two well known tectonic boundaries, the [[African Plate|African-Arabian]] and [[Red Sea Rift|Red-Sea rift]] zones, respectively 350 and 520&nbsp;km from the lighthouses location. Documentation shows the 956 earthquake to be the first to cause structural collapse of the top 20+ metres of the construction. Documented repairs after the 956 earthquake include the installment of an Islamic style dome after the collapse of the statue that previously topped the monument. The most destructive earthquake in 1303 was an estimated intensity of VIII+ originating from the Greek island of [[Crete]] (280\u2013350&nbsp;km from Alexandria).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelnaby|first=Adel E.|last2=Elnashai|first2=Amr S.|date=October 2013|title=Integrity assessment of the Pharos of Alexandria during the AD 1303 earthquake|journal=Engineering Failure Analysis|volume=33|pages=119\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.engfailanal.2013.04.013}}</ref> Finally, the stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-[[Sultan of Egypt]], [[Qaitbay]], built a [[Citadel of Qaitbay|medieval fort]] on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone.\n\nThe 10th-century writer [[al-Mas'udi]] reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse's destruction, according to which at the time of Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] ({{reign|705|715}}) the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] sent a [[eunuch]] agent, who adopted [[Islam]], gained the [[Caliph]]'s confidence, and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse. The search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined, and the Pharos collapsed. The agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him.{{sfn|Eickhoff|1966|p=40}}\n\n==Archaeological research and rediscovery==\n\n[[File:AlexLighthouse01.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Lighthouse remains found in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].]]\n\nIn 1968, the lighthouse was rediscovered. [[UNESCO]] sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine [[archaeologists]], led by [[Honor Frost]], to the site. She confirmed the existence of ruins representing part of the lighthouse. Due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone, exploration was put on hold.<ref>Frost, H. (2000). From Byblos to Pharos: some archaeological considerations.

He worked with cinematographer [[Asma El Bakry|Asma el-Bakri]] who used a 35&nbsp;mm camera to capture the first underwater pictures of the scattered remains of collapsed columns and statues. Empereur's most significant findings consisted of blocks of granite 49\u201360 tonnes in mass often broken into multiple pieces, 30 [[sphinx]]es, 5 [[obelisk]]s and columns with carvings dating back [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] (1279\u20131213 BC). The cataloging of over 3,300 pieces was completed by Empereur and his team at the end of 1995 using a combination of photography and mapping.

(1988).&nbsp;''The seven wonders of the ancient world''. London ; New York: Routledge.</ref>\n\n''Pharos'' became the etymological origin of the word \"lighthouse\" in Greek (''\u03c6\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2''), many [[Romance languages]] such as French (''phare''), Italian and Spanish (''faro''), Catalan, Romanian (''far'') and Portuguese (''farol''), and even some Slavic languages like Bulgarian (''far''). In Turkish, Serbian and Russian, a derived word means \"[[headlight]]\" (''far''; ''\u0444\u0430\u0440; \u0444\u0430\u0440\u0430'').\n\n== Proposed reconstruction ==\nSince 1978 a number of proposals have been made to replace the lighthouse with a modern reconstruction. In 2015, the Egyptian government and the Alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of [[Alexandria Port]]. The plan was opposed by Alexandria-based sociologist Amro Ali.<ref>{{cite web|title=A frightening vision: on plans to rebuild the Alexandria Lighthouse|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/amro-ali/frightening-vision-on-plans-to-rebuild-alexandria-lighthouse|work=openDemocracy|date=July 7, 2015|author=Amro Ali}}</ref>\n\n==Pharos in culture==\n\n[[File:Book of Wonders folio 36a cropped.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|The lighthouse as depicted in the [[Book of Wonders]], a late 14th century Arabic text]]\n[[File:Pharos at Abuqir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Pharos of Abusir, an ancient funerary monument thought to be modelled after the Pharos at Alexandria, with which it is approximately contemporaneous]]\n\nThe lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of [[Alexandria]] and of the [[Alexandria Governorate]] with which the city is more or less coterminous.

Battuta noted that the wrecked condition of the lighthouse was then only noticeable by the rectangle tower and entrance ramp. Battuta's account measured each side of the tower to be 140 shibr (30.8 m, 101&nbsp;ft) on either side. Battuta detailed plans of Sultan [[An-Nasir Muhammad]] to build a new lighthouse near the site of the collapsed one, but the plans were never fulfilled after the sultan's death in 1341.<ref name=\":13\"/>\n\n==Destruction==\nThe lighthouse was partially cracked and damaged by earthquakes in 796 and 951, followed by structural collapse in the earthquake of 956, and then again in 1303 and 1323. Damaging earthquakes propagate from two well known tectonic boundaries, the [[African Plate|African-Arabian]] and [[Red Sea Rift|Red-Sea rift]] zones, respectively 350 and 520&nbsp;km from the lighthouses location. Documentation shows the 956 earthquake to be the first to cause structural collapse of the top 20+ metres of the construction. Documented repairs after the 956 earthquake include the installment of an Islamic style dome after the collapse of the statue that previously topped the monument. The most destructive earthquake in 1303 was an estimated intensity of VIII+ originating from the Greek island of [[Crete]] (280\u2013350&nbsp;km from Alexandria).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abdelnaby|first=Adel E.|last2=Elnashai|first2=Amr S.|date=October 2013|title=Integrity assessment of the Pharos of Alexandria during the AD 1303 earthquake|journal=Engineering Failure Analysis|volume=33|pages=119\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.engfailanal.2013.04.013}}</ref> Finally, the stubby remnant disappeared in 1480, when the then-[[Sultan of Egypt]], [[Qaitbay]], built a [[Citadel of Qaitbay|medieval fort]] on the larger platform of the lighthouse site using some of the fallen stone.\n\nThe 10th-century writer [[al-Mas'udi]] reports a legendary tale on the lighthouse's destruction, according to which at the time of Caliph [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] ({{reign|705|715}}) the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] sent a [[eunuch]] agent, who adopted [[Islam]], gained the [[Caliph]]'s confidence, and secured permission to search for hidden treasure at the base of the lighthouse. The search was cunningly made in such a manner that the foundations were undermined, and the Pharos collapsed. The agent managed to escape in a ship waiting for him.{{sfn|Eickhoff|1966|p=40}}\n\n==Archaeological research and rediscovery==\n\n[[File:AlexLighthouse01.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Lighthouse remains found in the [[Mediterranean Sea]].]]\n\nIn 1968, the lighthouse was rediscovered. [[UNESCO]] sponsored an expedition to send a team of marine [[archaeologists]], led by [[Honor Frost]], to the site. She confirmed the existence of ruins representing part of the lighthouse. Due to the lack of specialized archaeologists and the area becoming a military zone, exploration was put on hold.<ref>Frost, H. (2000). From Byblos to Pharos: some archaeological considerations.

Paris: UNESCO.</ref>\n\nFrench archaeologists led by [[Jean-Yves Empereur]] re-discovered the physical remains of the lighthouse in late 1994 on the floor of Alexandria's Eastern Harbour. He worked with cinematographer [[Asma El Bakry|Asma el-Bakri]] who used a 35&nbsp;mm camera to capture the first underwater pictures of the scattered remains of collapsed columns and statues. Empereur's most significant findings consisted of blocks of granite 49\u201360 tonnes in mass often broken into multiple pieces, 30 [[sphinx]]es, 5 [[obelisk]]s and columns with carvings dating back [[Ramesses II|Ramses II]] (1279\u20131213 BC). The cataloging of over 3,300 pieces was completed by Empereur and his team at the end of 1995 using a combination of photography and mapping. Thirty-six pieces of Empereur's granite blocks and other discoveries have been restored and are currently on display in Alexandria museums.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/raising-alexandria-151005550/|title=Raising Alexandria|last=Lawler|first=Andrew|website=Smithsonian|access-date=2019-04-29}}</ref> Subsequent satellite imaging has revealed further remains. In the early 1990s the underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] began exploration at the opposite side of the harbor from where Empereur's team had worked.

In 2015, the Egyptian government and the Alexandria governorate suggested building a skyscraper on the site of the lighthouse as part of the regeneration of the eastern harbour of [[Alexandria Port]]. The plan was opposed by Alexandria-based sociologist Amro Ali.<ref>{{cite web|title=A frightening vision: on plans to rebuild the Alexandria Lighthouse|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/north-africa-west-asia/amro-ali/frightening-vision-on-plans-to-rebuild-alexandria-lighthouse|work=openDemocracy|date=July 7, 2015|author=Amro Ali}}</ref>\n\n==Pharos in culture==\n\n[[File:Book of Wonders folio 36a cropped.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|The lighthouse as depicted in the [[Book of Wonders]], a late 14th century Arabic text]]\n[[File:Pharos at Abuqir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Pharos of Abusir, an ancient funerary monument thought to be modelled after the Pharos at Alexandria, with which it is approximately contemporaneous]]\n\nThe lighthouse remains a civic symbol of the city of [[Alexandria]] and of the [[Alexandria Governorate]] with which the city is more or less coterminous.

The same person then appeared shortly afterwards from the southern walkway and entered the house through the front door and the lights then came on.\n\nAt the same time Park witnessed this \"shadowy figure\" head towards the south walkway where the bloody glove would later be found, [[Kato Kaelin]] had just previously been on the telephone with his friend, Rachel Ferrara.

They buzzed the intercom at the property for over 30 minutes but received no response. They noted the Bronco was parked on Rockingham at an awkward angle, with its back end out more than the front, and had blood on the door, which they feared meant someone inside might be hurt. Detective Vannatter then instructed Fuhrman to scale the wall and unlock the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter.

The officer who responded to that call, Detective John Edwards, testified next that when he arrived, a severely beaten Nicole Brown Simpson ran from the bushes where she was hiding and to the detective screaming \"He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me,\" referring to O.J. Simpson. Pictures of Nicole Brown's face from that night were then shown to the jury to confirm his testimony.

I really don't know about taking that thing.\" The prosecution then called Denise Brown, Nicole Brown's sister, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. She also testified that Simpson was agitated with Nicole the night of his daughter's dance recital as well, the same night Nicole was murdered.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211050704/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/03.html|title=O.J.

Bodziak, testified that the bloody footprints found at the crime scene, leading away from the victims towards the back alleyway , and inside Simpson's Bronco were made from a rare and expensive pair of [[Bruno Magli]] Italian shoes. Bodziak determined the shoes were a size 12, the same size that Simpson wears. The prosecution discovered that the shoes are only sold at Bloomingdales, that only 29 pairs had been sold in the U.S and one of them was sold at the same store that Nicole Brown had purchased the gloves she gave Simpson and the prosecution believed he wore during the murders. Bodziak also testified that, although there are two sets of footprints at the crime scene, they were all made by the same shoes, indicating only one attacker was present. During cross-examination Bailey suggested the murderer deliberately wore shoes that were the wrong size, which Bodziak dismissed as \"ridiculous\".<ref name=\"Week 22\"/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Margolick|first=David|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/20/us/simpson-s-shoe-size-fits-bloody-prints-left-crime-scene-fbi-expert-says.html|title=Simpson's Shoe Size Fits Bloody Prints Left at the Crime Scene, an F.B.I.

On July 24, 1995, Dr. [[Fredric Rieders]], a forensic toxicologist who had analysed results provided by FBI special agent Roger Martz, testified that the level of EDTA in the evidence samples was higher than that which is normally found in blood: this appeared to support the claim they came from the reference vials.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ojsimpson.co/oj-simpson-fact-fiction-ep-12/|title=Was O.J.

The volume of DNA was so high that the defense conceded that it could not be explained by contamination in the lab, yet noted that it was unusual for that blood to have more DNA on it than the other samples collected at the crime scene, especially since it had been left exposed to the elements for several weeks and after the crime scene had supposedly been washed over.

He had received both blood reference vials from the victims earlier that day from the coroner and booked them immediately into evidence. Vannatter then drove back to Rockingham later that evening to hand deliver the reference vial for Simpson to Fung, which the defense alleged gave him opportunity to plant the blood. Fung testified he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom<ref name=\"Week 12\"/> but the prosecution later demonstrated that those blood stains are only visible underneath a microscope.\n\nDetective Vannatter denied planting Nicole Brown's blood on the socks. The video from Willie Ford indicated that the socks had already been collected and stored in the evidence van before Vannatter arrived and footage from the media cameras present appeared to prove that he never went inside the evidence van when he arrived at Rockingham.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=evidence+van&hl=en|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|last=Lee|first=Henry|last2=Tirnady|first2=Frank|date=2003-04-17|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n====Glove====\n[[File:Mfuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark Fuhrman in 2008]]\nThe last exhibit allegedly planted was the bloody glove found at Simpson's property by Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997|pp=208, 228\u2013228}} Unlike the sock and the back gate, the defense provided no physical or eyewitness evidence to support their claim that the prosecution could then refute.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=furthermore+no+trace+evidence+on+the+glove&hl=en|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|last=Lee|first=Henry|last2=Tirnady|first2=Frank|date=2003-04-17|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/150655-did-mark-fuhrman-plant-evidence-in-the-oj-simpson-case-he-evoked-the-fifth-amendment-in|title=Did Mark Fuhrman Plant Evidence In The O.J.

They noted that by the time Fuhrman had arrived, the crime scene at Brown's home had already been combed over by several officers for almost two hours, and none had noticed a second glove at the scene, including Lt. Frank Spangler. Spangler testified that only one glove was found at the crime scene, by him and the other two officers who were there first, and that he had been with Fuhrman for the duration of Fuhrman's time at the scene. Spangler stated that he would have seen Fuhrman purloin the glove if he had in fact done so. Detective Tom Lange testified on March 8, 1995 that 14 other officers were there when Fuhrman arrived as well and all said there was only one glove at the crime scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209202323/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/07.html|title=O.J.

The jury was absent but the exchange was televised. Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side and facing the possibility of being charged with [[Perjury]], was instructed by his attorney to invoke the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to avoid [[self-incrimination]] to two consecutive questions he was asked. Defense attorney Uelmen asked Fuhrman if it was his intention to plead the Fifth to all questions, and Fuhrman's attorney instructed him to reply \"yes\". Uelman then briefly spoke with the other members of the defense and said he had just one more question: \"Did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?\" Following his attorney's instruction, Fuhrman replied, \"I choose to assert my Fifth Amendment privilege.\"\n\nCochran responded to Fuhrman's pleading the Fifth by accusing the other officers of being involved in a \"cover-up\" to protect Fuhrman and asked Judge Ito to suppress all of the evidence that Fuhrman found. Ito denied the request, stating that pleading the fifth does not imply guilt and there was no evidence of fraud.

Instead they presented a witness who testified that Nicole Brown had purchased a pair of those gloves in the same size in 1990 at [[Bloomingdales]] for Simpson along with a receipt and a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of gloves.<ref name=\"Week 21\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209181334/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/21.html|title=O.J.

Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders.<ref name=\"tru tv\"/>\n\nThe prosecution told the jury in closing arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, but said that this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt.<ref name=\"tru tv\"/> In Cochran's summation to the jury, he emphasized that Fuhrman was proved to have repeatedly referred to black people as \"niggers\" and also to have boasted of beating young black men in his role as a police officer. Cochran compared Fuhrman to [[Adolf Hitler]] and referred to him as \"a genocidal racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare and the personification of evil\".<ref name=\"tru tv\"/> In response, Fred Goldman referred to Cochran himself as \"the worst kind of racist ever\" and a \"sick man\" for making such a comparison.\n\n===Verdict===\nFears grew that race riots, similar to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots in 1992]], would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson were convicted of the murders. As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd. President [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide.\n\nAt 10:07&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The only testimony reviewed was that of limo driver Alan Park. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00&nbsp;p.m. on October 2, after four hours of [[deliberation]], but Ito postponed the announcement.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}} After the verdict was read, juror number nine, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a [[raised fist|black power raised fist]] salute.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.garyyounge|title=Gary Younge: OJ Simpson and America, ten years after the trial|author=Gary Younge|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist [[Black Panther Party]] that prosecutors had \"inexplicably left on the panel\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/us/not-guilty-overview-jury-clears-simpson-double-murder-spellbound-nation-divides.html|title=Jury Clears Simpson in Double Murder; Spellbound Nation Divides on Verdict|date=October 4, 1995|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAn estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement.

An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites.

It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear handcuffs; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house. Simpson's defense team had switched out his photos of whites for blacks, including switching a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's girlfriend at the time, who was white) for a [[Norman Rockwell]] painting from Cochran's office.\n\nCritics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short relative to the length of the trial.

Three jurors together wrote and published a book called ''Madam Foreman,''{{sfn|Cooley|Bess|Rubin-Jackson|Byrnes|1996}} in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered Darden to be a [[Tokenism|token black]] assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office.<ref name=\"usa today52\" /> In [[Ezra Edelman]]'s 2016 documentary ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'', juror number six, Carrie Bess, voiced her own personal dislike for Nicole for apparently \"allowing\" herself to be abused,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Dean|first1=Michelle|title=OJ: Made in America is a damning brief against America itself|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/19/oj-simpson-made-in-america-espn-documentary|accessdate=24 December 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 June 2016}}</ref> and said she believed \"90% of the jury\" actually decided to acquit Simpson as payback for the Rodney King incident, not because they believed in his innocence, and when asked if she believed the decision was correct, Bess merely shrugged indifferently, but later admitted that she regretted her decision after Simpson's arrest in Las Vegas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewrap.com/oj-simpson-juror-not-guilty-verdict-was-payback-for-rodney-king/|title=OJ Simpson Juror: Verdict Was 'Payback' for Rodney King|first=Tim|last=Molloy|date=June 15, 2016|work=The Wrap}}</ref> Juror number nine, Lionel Cryer, a former member of the Black Panther Party and who notably gave Simpson a black fist salute after the verdict, said that in retrospect, however, he would render a guilty verdict.<ref>[https://ew.com/tv/2017/07/22/jury-speaks-oj-simpson-trial/]</ref>\n\n=====Books=====\nIn 1996, Cochran wrote and published a book about the trial. It was titled ''Journey to Justice,'' and described his involvement in the case.{{sfn|Cochran|1997}} That same year, Shapiro also published a book about the trial called ''The Search for Justice.'' He criticized Bailey as a \"loose cannon\" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial.{{sfn|Shapiro|Warren|1996}} In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD, but considered the verdict correct due to reasonable doubt.<ref name=\"usa today52\" /> In a subsequent interview with Barbara Walters, Shapiro vowed that he would never again work with either Bailey or Cochran.\n\nClark published a book about the case titled ''Without a Doubt'' (1998).{{sfn|Clark|1998}} Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.\n\nDarden published a book about the case called ''In Contempt'' (1998).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darden|first=Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTDECwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=in+contempt&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDlu_V3bzoAhUIRK0KHbjADlAQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=in%20contempt&f=false|title=In Contempt|date=2016-03-18|publisher=Graymalkin Media|isbn=978-1-63168-073-1|language=en}}</ref> In it he criticizes Ito as a \"starstruck\" judge who allowed the trial to turn into a media circus and the defense to control the court room while he collected hourglasses from fans and invited celebrities into his chambers. He also describes his frustration with a \"dysfunctional and uneducated jury\" that dismissed Simpson's history of domestic violence as irrelevant and inability to comprehend the DNA evidence in the case. Darden also describes his initial contact with Fuhrman and his suspicions that he is a racist and his feelings that the prosecution had been \"kidnapped by a racist cop\" whom they were unable to divorce themselves from. It also details the candid factors behind Darden's controversial decision for Simpson to try on the infamous glove and the impact it had on the trials outcome.\n\nIn 1996, former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote a book titled ''[[Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder]]''.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note \"reeked\" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing.<ref name=\"tru tv\" />{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} He also criticized them for not wanting the jury to see or hear Simpson denying guilt, when there would not be a trial had Simpson not entered a not guilty plea. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse and presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles, rather than Santa Monica, and described the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger M.|last=Grace|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives060710.htm|title=Bugliosi vs. Garcetti: Author Opens Fire on District Attorney|date=June 7, 2010|newspaper=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons.

He devotes the last two chapters to explaining the arguments of Scheck and Neufeld against the DNA evidence in the Simpson case. Lee notes that Scheck and Neufeld were skeptics of DNA evidence and only recently before the trial, in 1992, accepted its validity and founded the [[Innocence Project]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&pg=PA272#v=onepage&q=Barry+scheck&f=false|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|first1=Henry|last1=Lee|first2=Frank|last2=Tirnady|date=April 17, 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lee writes that neither of the defenses's forensic DNA experts, Dr. Henry Lee or Dr. Edward Blake, considered Scheck and Neufeld's reasonable doubt theory about the blood evidence plausible. In hindsight, Dr. Lee opines that Scheck and Neufeld's claim that \"the blood evidence is only as good as the people collecting it\" was an obfuscation tactic to conflate the validity of the evidence with the integrity of the LAPD and then attack the latter because both Scheck and Neufeld knew that the defense's forensic DNA experts reached the same conclusion as the prosecution: the mistakes made during evidence collection did ''not'' render the results unreliable.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=bad+blood+(part+1)&f=false|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|first1=Henry|last1=Lee|first2=Frank|last2=Tirnady|date=April 17, 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lee opines that the jury did not understand the significance and precision of the DNA evidence. He bases this on comments from jurors after the trial, some of which included claims that the blood at the crime scene that matched Simpson had \"degraded\" and could possibly have been from Simpson's children or from one of the officials who collected the evidence. He attributes this misinterpretation to Scheck and Neufeld's deliberate obfuscation and deception about the reliability of the results. After the trial, the jurors faced harsh criticism for doubting the DNA evidence while Scheck and Neufeld received praise. Lee believes that the scathing criticism the jurors faced for doubting the DNA evidence based on the arguments Scheck and Neufeld made might have been the reason why they were the only two DNA experts from the criminal trial to decline to return for the subsequent civil trial to make those claims again.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&pg=PA257#v=snippet&q=Barry+Scheck+national+reputation&f=false|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|first1=Henry|last1=Lee|first2=Frank|last2=Tirnady|date=April 17, 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{quote|When the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial.

The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years-long correspondence with [[criminal profiler]] Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: \"you may have to kill the bitch\".

Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. He noted the house was dark and nobody appeared to be home as he smoked a cigarette and made several calls to his boss to get Simpson's home phone number. He then testified he saw a \"shadowy figure resembling Simpson\" emerge from the area where the Bronco was later found to be parked and approached the front entrance before aborting and heading towards the southern walkway. The same person then appeared shortly afterwards from the southern walkway and entered the house through the front door and the lights then came on.\n\nAt the same time Park witnessed this \"shadowy figure\" head towards the south walkway where the bloody glove would later be found, [[Kato Kaelin]] had just previously been on the telephone with his friend, Rachel Ferrara. At approximately 10:50, something crashed into his wall, which he described as three \"thumps\" and which he feared was an earthquake. Kaelin hung up the phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises, but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property, where he saw Park's limo outside the Ashford gate. Kaelin let Park in the Ashford gate, and Simpson finally came out the front door a few minutes later claiming he had overslept.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997|pp=234\u2013235}} Both Park and Kaelin would later testify that Simpson seemed agitated that night.<ref>{{cite web|title=Limo driver for O.J.

Simpson.jpg|thumb|upright|Simpson's mugshot, June 17, 1994]]\n\nSoon after discovering the female victim was Nicole Simpson, LAPD commander Keith Bushey ordered detectives Lange, Vannatter, Philips and Fuhrman to notify Simpson of her death and to give him a ride to pick up his children, who had been in Nicole's condo at the time of the murders and were at the police station. They buzzed the intercom at the property for over 30 minutes but received no response. They noted the Bronco was parked on Rockingham at an awkward angle, with its back end out more than the front, and had blood on the door, which they feared meant someone inside might be hurt. Detective Vannatter then instructed Fuhrman to scale the wall and unlock the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter. The detectives would argue they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances \u2013 specifically out of fear that someone inside might be injured.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211050924/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/35.html|title=O.J.

In a walk around the premises to inspect what may have caused the thumps, Fuhrman discovered a bloody glove; it was later determined to be the matching right hand glove of the one found at the murder scene. This evidence was determined to be [[probable cause]] to issue an [[arrest warrant]] for Simpson.\n\nDetective Ron Phillips testified that when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, he sounded \"very upset\" but was oddly unconcerned about the circumstances of her death. Philips noted that Simpson only asked if the children had seen the murder or Brown's body but was not concerned with the assailant harming his children either.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211050714/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/05.html|title=O.J.

Detective Lange noticed that Simpson had a cut on a finger on his left hand that was consistent with where the killer was bleeding from and asked Simpson how he got it. At first, he claimed he cut his finger accidentally while in Chicago after learning of Nicole's death. Lange then informed Simpson that blood was found inside his Bronco at which point Simpson admitted that he did cut his finger the same day as the murders but did not remember how. He voluntarily gave some of his own blood for comparison with evidence collected at the crime scene and was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-02/news/mn-27325_1_nicole-simpson|title=Simpson Dreamed of Killing, Witness Says: Courts: Ex-officer says he is a longtime friend of the defendant.

On Wednesday, June 15, preliminary results from DNA testing came back with matches to Simpson but the District Attorneys office delayed filing charges until all the results had come back. On Thursday June 16, Simpson spent Thursday night at the [[San Fernando Valley]] home of friend [[Robert Kardashian]]; Shapiro asked several doctors to attend to him because of Simpson's fragile mental state. \n\nOn Friday, June 17 detectives recommended that Simpson be charged with two counts of [[first-degree murder]] with special circumstance of multiple killings after the final DNA results came back.{{r|lat19940618}} The LAPD notified Shapiro at 8:30&nbsp;am on Friday that Simpson would have to surrender that day.

Simpson told Shapiro he wanted to turn himself in{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=87}} and the police agreed because they believed that someone as famous as Simpson would not attempt to flee. The police even agreed to delay his surrender until 12pm so Simpson could be seen by a mental health specialist after showing signs of suicidal depression; he updated his will, called his mother and children, and wrote three sealed letters: one to his children, another to his mother, and one to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=187-199|title=Penal Code Sections 187\u2013199|publisher=Legislative Counsel of California|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512011845/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&group=00001-01000&file=187-199|archivedate=May 12, 2009|accessdate=June 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nMore than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson's [[perp walk]] at the police station, but he did not arrive as stipulated.

The officer who responded to that call, Detective John Edwards, testified next that when he arrived, a severely beaten Nicole Brown Simpson ran from the bushes where she was hiding and to the detective screaming \"He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me,\" referring to O.J. Simpson. Pictures of Nicole Brown's face from that night were then shown to the jury to confirm his testimony.

I really don't know about taking that thing.\" The prosecution then called Denise Brown, Nicole Brown's sister, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument.

Bodziak, testified that the bloody footprints found at the crime scene, leading away from the victims towards the back alleyway , and inside Simpson's Bronco were made from a rare and expensive pair of [[Bruno Magli]] Italian shoes. Bodziak determined the shoes were a size 12, the same size that Simpson wears. The prosecution discovered that the shoes are only sold at Bloomingdales, that only 29 pairs had been sold in the U.S and one of them was sold at the same store that Nicole Brown had purchased the gloves she gave Simpson and the prosecution believed he wore during the murders.

He had received both blood reference vials from the victims earlier that day from the coroner and booked them immediately into evidence. Vannatter then drove back to Rockingham later that evening to hand deliver the reference vial for Simpson to Fung, which the defense alleged gave him opportunity to plant the blood. Fung testified he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom<ref name=\"Week 12\"/> but the prosecution later demonstrated that those blood stains are only visible underneath a microscope.\n\nDetective Vannatter denied planting Nicole Brown's blood on the socks. The video from Willie Ford indicated that the socks had already been collected and stored in the evidence van before Vannatter arrived and footage from the media cameras present appeared to prove that he never went inside the evidence van when he arrived at Rockingham.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=evidence+van&hl=en|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|last=Lee|first=Henry|last2=Tirnady|first2=Frank|date=2003-04-17|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n====Glove====\n[[File:Mfuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark Fuhrman in 2008]]\nThe last exhibit allegedly planted was the bloody glove found at Simpson's property by Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]].{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997|pp=208, 228\u2013228}} Unlike the sock and the back gate, the defense provided no physical or eyewitness evidence to support their claim that the prosecution could then refute.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&q=furthermore+no+trace+evidence+on+the+glove&hl=en|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|last=Lee|first=Henry|last2=Tirnady|first2=Frank|date=2003-04-17|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/150655-did-mark-fuhrman-plant-evidence-in-the-oj-simpson-case-he-evoked-the-fifth-amendment-in|title=Did Mark Fuhrman Plant Evidence In The O.J.

Lee Bailey suggested that Fuhrman found the glove at the crime scene, picked it up with a stick and placed it in a plastic bag, and then concealed it in his sock when he drove to Simpson's home with Detectives Lange and Vannatter and his partner Detective Philips. Bailey suggested that Fuhrman had then planted the glove in order to frame Simpson, with the motive either being racism or a desire to become the hero in a high-profile case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/de764966432042c2910dc709fc382516|title=Lawyers Clash Over F.

They noted that by the time Fuhrman had arrived, the crime scene at Brown's home had already been combed over by several officers for almost two hours, and none had noticed a second glove at the scene, including Lt. Frank Spangler. Spangler testified that only one glove was found at the crime scene, by him and the other two officers who were there first, and that he had been with Fuhrman for the duration of Fuhrman's time at the scene. Spangler stated that he would have seen Fuhrman purloin the glove if he had in fact done so. Detective Tom Lange testified on March 8, 1995 that 14 other officers were there when Fuhrman arrived as well and all said there was only one glove at the crime scene.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209202323/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/07.html|title=O.J.

The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young [[North Carolina]] screenwriter named Laura Hart McKinny, who had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a Hollywood screenplay she was writing on women police officers. The [[Fuhrman tapes]] became one of the cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility. Clark called the tapes \"the biggest [[red herring]] there ever was.\"<ref name=\"Week 30\"/>\n\nAfter McKinny was forced to hand over the tapes to the defense, Fuhrman says he asked the prosecution for a redirect to explain the context of those tapes but the prosecution and his fellow police officers abandoned him after Ito played the audiotapes in open court for the public to hear.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/01/us/excerpts-from-the-ruling-on-the-fuhrman-tapes.html|title=Excerpts From the Ruling on the Fuhrman Tapes|author=Associated Press|date=1995-09-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref> The public reaction to the tapes was explosive and compared to the video of the Rodney King beating from a year prior.

The jury was absent but the exchange was televised. Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side and facing the possibility of being charged with [[Perjury]], was instructed by his attorney to invoke the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] to avoid [[self-incrimination]] to two consecutive questions he was asked. Defense attorney Uelmen asked Fuhrman if it was his intention to plead the Fifth to all questions, and Fuhrman's attorney instructed him to reply \"yes\". Uelman then briefly spoke with the other members of the defense and said he had just one more question: \"Did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?\" Following his attorney's instruction, Fuhrman replied, \"I choose to assert my Fifth Amendment privilege.\"\n\nCochran responded to Fuhrman's pleading the Fifth by accusing the other officers of being involved in a \"cover-up\" to protect Fuhrman and asked Judge Ito to suppress all of the evidence that Fuhrman found. Ito denied the request, stating that pleading the fifth does not imply guilt and there was no evidence of fraud. Cochran then asked that the jury be allowed to hear Fuhrman taking the fifth and again Ito denied his request.

As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd. President [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide.\n\nAt 10:07&nbsp;a.m. on Tuesday, October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder.

It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear handcuffs; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house. Simpson's defense team had switched out his photos of whites for blacks, including switching a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's girlfriend at the time, who was white) for a [[Norman Rockwell]] painting from Cochran's office.\n\nCritics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short relative to the length of the trial.

It was titled ''Journey to Justice,'' and described his involvement in the case.{{sfn|Cochran|1997}} That same year, Shapiro also published a book about the trial called ''The Search for Justice.'' He criticized Bailey as a \"loose cannon\" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial.{{sfn|Shapiro|Warren|1996}} In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD, but considered the verdict correct due to reasonable doubt.<ref name=\"usa today52\" /> In a subsequent interview with Barbara Walters, Shapiro vowed that he would never again work with either Bailey or Cochran.\n\nClark published a book about the case titled ''Without a Doubt'' (1998).{{sfn|Clark|1998}} Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.\n\nDarden published a book about the case called ''In Contempt'' (1998).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Darden|first=Christopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTDECwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=in+contempt&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDlu_V3bzoAhUIRK0KHbjADlAQ6AEwAHoECAUQAg#v=onepage&q=in%20contempt&f=false|title=In Contempt|date=2016-03-18|publisher=Graymalkin Media|isbn=978-1-63168-073-1|language=en}}</ref> In it he criticizes Ito as a \"starstruck\" judge who allowed the trial to turn into a media circus and the defense to control the court room while he collected hourglasses from fans and invited celebrities into his chambers. He also describes his frustration with a \"dysfunctional and uneducated jury\" that dismissed Simpson's history of domestic violence as irrelevant and inability to comprehend the DNA evidence in the case. Darden also describes his initial contact with Fuhrman and his suspicions that he is a racist and his feelings that the prosecution had been \"kidnapped by a racist cop\" whom they were unable to divorce themselves from. It also details the candid factors behind Darden's controversial decision for Simpson to try on the infamous glove and the impact it had on the trials outcome.\n\nIn 1996, former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote a book titled ''[[Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder]]''.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note \"reeked\" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing.<ref name=\"tru tv\" />{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} He also criticized them for not wanting the jury to see or hear Simpson denying guilt, when there would not be a trial had Simpson not entered a not guilty plea. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse and presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles, rather than Santa Monica, and described the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}}<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger M.|last=Grace|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives060710.htm|title=Bugliosi vs. Garcetti: Author Opens Fire on District Attorney|date=June 7, 2010|newspaper=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons.

He devotes the last two chapters to explaining the arguments of Scheck and Neufeld against the DNA evidence in the Simpson case.

In hindsight, Dr. Lee opines that Scheck and Neufeld's claim that \"the blood evidence is only as good as the people collecting it\" was an obfuscation tactic to conflate the validity of the evidence with the integrity of the LAPD and then attack the latter because both Scheck and Neufeld knew that the defense's forensic DNA experts reached the same conclusion as the prosecution: the mistakes made during evidence collection did ''not'' render the results unreliable.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q=bad+blood+(part+1)&f=false|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|first1=Henry|last1=Lee|first2=Frank|last2=Tirnady|date=April 17, 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref> Lee opines that the jury did not understand the significance and precision of the DNA evidence. He bases this on comments from jurors after the trial, some of which included claims that the blood at the crime scene that matched Simpson had \"degraded\" and could possibly have been from Simpson's children or from one of the officials who collected the evidence. He attributes this misinterpretation to Scheck and Neufeld's deliberate obfuscation and deception about the reliability of the results. After the trial, the jurors faced harsh criticism for doubting the DNA evidence while Scheck and Neufeld received praise. Lee believes that the scathing criticism the jurors faced for doubting the DNA evidence based on the arguments Scheck and Neufeld made might have been the reason why they were the only two DNA experts from the criminal trial to decline to return for the subsequent civil trial to make those claims again.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Tc0ctKABrZwC&pg=PA257#v=snippet&q=Barry+Scheck+national+reputation&f=false|title=Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes|first1=Henry|last1=Lee|first2=Frank|last2=Tirnady|date=April 17, 2003|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-5230-0|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\n==Media coverage==\n{{quote|When the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial.

When the murder case was under process, Van Nuys ADA Lea D'Argostino came to know about a written statement from Glen revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years-long correspondence with [[criminal profiler]] Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: \"you may have to kill the bitch\".

In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as [[hard disk]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, [[DVD-RW]]s and the older [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] and [[drum memory]], the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.\n\nRAM contains [[multiplexer|multiplexing]] and [[demultiplexing]] circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be \"8-bit\" or \"16-bit\", etc. devices.\n\nIn today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips with [[MOSFET|MOS]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor) [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cells]]. RAM is normally associated with [[Volatile memory|volatile]] types of memory (such as [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) [[DIMM|modules]]), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=Memory that never forgets: non-volatile DIMMs hit the market|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|publisher=Ars Technica|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708073138/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|archivedate=2017-07-08|date=2013-04-04}}</ref> Other types of [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile memories]] exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of [[read only memory|ROM]] and a type of [[flash memory]] called ''[[flash memory#NOR flash|NOR-Flash]]''.\n\nThe two main types of volatile random-access [[semiconductor memory]] are [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Commercial uses of semiconductor RAM date back to 1965, when IBM introduced the SP95 SRAM chip for their [[IBM System/360|System/360 Model 95]] computer, and [[Toshiba]] used DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 [[electronic calculator]], both based on [[bipolar transistor]]s. Commercial MOS memory, based on [[MOS transistor]]s, was developed in the late 1960s, and has since been the basis for all commercial semiconductor memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the [[Intel 1103]], was introduced in October 1970. [[Synchronous dynamic random-access memory]] (SDRAM) later debuted with the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Early SSA accounting operations.jpg|thumb|These IBM [[tabulating machine]]s from the mid-1930s used [[mechanical counter]]s to store information]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0406-022, VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, 1-Megabit-Chip.jpg|thumb|right|1 [[Mebibit|Megabit]] (MiBit) chip, one of the last models developed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|VEB Carl Zeiss Jena]] in 1989]]\n\nEarly computers used [[relay]]s, [[mechanical counter]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html|title=IBM Archives -- FAQ's for Products and Services|work=ibm.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184527/http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html|archivedate=2012-10-23}}</ref> or [[Delay line memory|delay line]]s for main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines were [[bit-serial architecture|serial device]]s which could only reproduce data in the order it was written. [[Drum memory]] could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of [[vacuum tube]] [[triode]]s, and later, out of discrete [[transistor]]s, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.\n\nThe first practical form of random-access memory was the [[Williams tube]] starting in 1947.  It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a [[cathode ray tube]]. Since the electron beam of the CRT could read and write the spots on the tube in any order, memory was random access. The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches. Developed at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in England, the Williams tube provided the medium on which the first electronically stored program was implemented in the [[Manchester Baby]] computer, which first successfully ran a program on 21 June 1948.<ref>{{Citation | last = Napper | first = Brian | title = Computer 50: The University of Manchester Celebrates the Birth of the Modern Computer | url = http://www.computer50.org/ | accessdate = 26 May 2012 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120504133240/http://www.computer50.org/ | archivedate = 4 May 2012 }}</ref>  In fact, rather than the Williams tube memory being designed for the Baby, the Baby was a [[testbed]] to demonstrate the reliability of the memory.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|title=Electronic Digital Computers|journal=Nature|volume=162|pages=487|date=Sep 1948|doi=10.1038/162487a0|issue=4117|postscript=.|bibcode=1948Natur.162..487W}} Reprinted in ''The Origins of Digital Computers''</ref><ref>{{Citation|last1=Williams|first1=F.C.|last2=Kilburn|first2=T.|last3=Tootill|first3=G.C.|title=Universal High-Speed Digital Computers: A Small-Scale Experimental Machine|url=http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/ssem.html|journal=Proc.

It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings.  By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible. Magnetic core memory was the standard form of [[computer memory]] system until displaced by [[solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[MOSFET|MOS]] ([[metal-oxide-silicon]]) [[semiconductor memory]] in [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) during the early 1970s.<ref name=\"computerhistory1970\"/>\n\nPrior to the development of integrated [[read-only memory]] (ROM) circuits, ''permanent'' (or ''read-only'') random-access memory was often constructed using [[Diode matrix|diode matrices]] driven by [[address decoder]]s, or specially wound [[core rope memory]] planes. {{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph needs a citation.|date=December 2016}}\n\n[[Semiconductor memory]] began in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which used [[bipolar transistors]].

In SRAM, a [[Bit|bit of data]] is stored using the state of a six-[[transistor]] [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]], typically using six [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors). This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as [[CPU cache|cache memory for the CPU]]. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and [[capacitor]] pair (typically a MOSFET and [[MOS capacitor]], respectively),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sze |first1=Simon M. |author1-link=Simon Sze |title=Semiconductor Devices: Physics and Technology |date=2002 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |isbn=0-471-33372-7 |page=214 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/453/Semiconductor.Devices_Physics.Technology_Sze.2ndEd_Wiley_2002.pdf}}</ref> which together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it.  As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.\n\nBoth static and dynamic RAM are considered ''volatile'', as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system.  By contrast, [[read-only memory]] (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered.  Writeable variants of ROM (such as [[EEPROM]] and [[flash memory]]) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to [[Persistence (computer science)|persist]] without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.  These persistent forms of semiconductor ROM include [[Universal serial bus|USB]] flash drives, memory cards for cameras and portable devices, and [[solid-state drives]]. \n[[ECC memory]] (which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using [[parity bit]]s or [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction codes]].\n\nIn general, the term ''RAM'' refers solely to solid-state memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main memory in most computers.  In optical storage, the term [[DVD-RAM]] is somewhat of a misnomer since, unlike [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-RW]] it does not need to be erased before reuse.  Nevertheless, a DVD-RAM behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower.\n\n==Memory cell==\n{{main|Memory cell (computing)}}\nThe memory cell is the fundamental building block of [[computer memory]]. The memory cell is an [[electronic circuit]] that stores one [[bit]] of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.\n\nIn SRAM, the memory cell is a type of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, usually implemented using [[field effect transistor|FET]]s. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is expensive and has low storage density.\n\nA second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a \"1\" or a \"0\" in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM.\n{| style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|[[File:SRAM Cell (6 Transistors).svg|thumb|SRAM Cell (6 Transistors)]]||[[File:DRAM Cell Structure (Model of Single Circuit Cell).PNG|thumb|DRAM Cell (1 Transistor and one capacitor)]]\n|}\n\n==Addressing==\nTo be useful, memory cells must be readable and writeable. Within the RAM device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A0... An, and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two.\n\nUsually several memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4 bit 'wide' RAM chip has 4 memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and that of the microprocessor are different, for a 32 bit microprocessor, eight 4 bit RAM chips would be needed.\n\nOften more addresses are needed than can be provided by a device. In that case, external multiplexors to the device are used to activate the correct device that is being accessed.\n\n==Memory hierarchy==\n{{main|Memory hierarchy}}\nOne can read and over-write data in RAM. Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting of [[processor register]]s, on-die [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] caches, external [[CPU cache|caches]], [[DRAM]], [[paging]] systems and [[virtual memory]] or [[swap space]] on a hard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as \"RAM\" by many developers, even though the various subsystems can have very different [[access time]]s, violating the original concept behind the ''random access'' term in RAM. Even within a hierarchy level such as DRAM, the specific row, column, bank, [[Memory rank|rank]], channel, or [[interleaved memory|interleave]] organization of the components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that access time to rotating [[storage media]] or a tape is variable. The overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system (generally, the memory hierarchy follows the access time with the fast CPU registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the bottom).\n\nIn many modern personal computers, the RAM comes in an easily upgraded form of modules called [[DIMM|memory module]]s or DRAM modules about the size of a few sticks of chewing gum. These can quickly be replaced should they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity. As suggested above, smaller amounts of RAM (mostly SRAM) are also integrated in the [[CPU]] and other [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] on the [[motherboard]], as well as in hard-drives, [[CD-ROM]]s, and several other parts of the computer system.\n\n==Other uses of RAM==\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SO-DIMM]] stick of laptop RAM, roughly half the size of [[DIMM|desktop RAM]].]]\nIn addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications, RAM is used in numerous other ways.\n\n===Virtual memory===\n{{main|Virtual memory}}\nMost modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity, known as \"virtual memory\".  A portion of the computer's [[hard drive]] is set aside for a ''paging file'' or a ''scratch partition'', and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system's total memory.  (For example, if a computer has 2 GiB (1024<sup>3</sup> B) of RAM and a 1 GiB page file, the operating system has 3 GiB total memory available to it.)  When the system runs low on physical memory, it can \"[[paging|swap]]\" portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data, as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM.  Excessive use of this mechanism results in [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] and generally hampers overall system performance, mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM.\n\n===RAM disk===\n{{main|RAM drive}}\nSoftware can \"partition\" a portion of a computer's RAM, allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a [[RAM disk]]. A RAM disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source.\n\n===Shadow RAM===\nSometimes, the contents of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often write-protected). This process, sometimes called ''shadowing'', is fairly common in both computers and [[embedded systems]].\n\nAs a common example, the [[BIOS]] in typical personal computers often has an option called \u201cuse shadow BIOS\u201d or similar. When enabled, functions that rely on data from the BIOS's ROM instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities.  For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the [[operating system]] if shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed ROMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|title=Shadow Ram|accessdate=2007-07-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029162135/http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|archivedate=2006-10-29}}</ref>'''\n\n==Recent developments==\nSeveral new types of [[NVRAM|''non-volatile'' RAM]], which preserve data while powered down, are under development.

An important reason for this disparity is the limited communication bandwidth beyond chip boundaries, which is also referred to as ''bandwidth wall''. From 1986 to 2000, [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed improved at an annual rate of 55% while memory speed only improved at 10%. Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelming [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] in computer performance.<ref>The term was coined in {{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111104/http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-06 }}.</ref>\n\nCPU speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because current CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense.  [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] summarized these causes in a 2005 document.<ref>{{Cite web |title= Platform 2015: Intel\u00ae Processor and Platform Evolution for the Next Decade |date= March 2, 2005 |url= http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110427072037/http://epic.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/pub/Home/TrendsAndConceptsII2010/HW_Trends_borkar_2015.pdf |archivedate= April 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>First of all, as chip geometries shrink and clock frequencies rise, the transistor [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] increases, leading to excess power consumption and heat... Secondly, the advantages of higher clock speeds are in part negated by memory latency, since memory access times have not been able to keep pace with increasing clock frequencies. Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-called [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottleneck]]), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy. In addition, partly due to limitations in the means of producing inductance within solid state devices, [[resistance-capacitance]] (RC) delays in signal transmission are growing as feature sizes shrink, imposing an additional bottleneck that frequency increases don't address.</blockquote>\n\nThe RC delays in signal transmission were also noted in \"Clock Rate versus IPC: The End of the Road for Conventional Microarchitectures\"<ref>{{Cite conference |first1=Vikas |last1=Agarwal |first2=M.

In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as [[hard disk]]s, [[CD-RW]]s, [[DVD-RW]]s and the older [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic tapes]] and [[drum memory]], the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.\n\nRAM contains [[multiplexer|multiplexing]] and [[demultiplexing]] circuitry, to connect the data lines to the addressed storage for reading or writing the entry. Usually more than one bit of storage is accessed by the same address, and RAM devices often have multiple data lines and are said to be \"8-bit\" or \"16-bit\", etc. devices.\n\nIn today's technology, random-access memory takes the form of [[integrated circuit]] (IC) chips with [[MOSFET|MOS]] (metal-oxide-semiconductor) [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cells]]. RAM is normally associated with [[Volatile memory|volatile]] types of memory (such as [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM) [[DIMM|modules]]), where stored information is lost if power is removed, although non-volatile RAM has also been developed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gallagher|first=Sean|title=Memory that never forgets: non-volatile DIMMs hit the market|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|publisher=Ars Technica|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708073138/https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/memory-that-never-forgets-non-volatile-dimms-hit-the-market/|archivedate=2017-07-08|date=2013-04-04}}</ref> Other types of [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile memories]] exist that allow random access for read operations, but either do not allow write operations or have other kinds of limitations on them. These include most types of [[read only memory|ROM]] and a type of [[flash memory]] called ''[[flash memory#NOR flash|NOR-Flash]]''.\n\nThe two main types of volatile random-access [[semiconductor memory]] are [[static random-access memory]] (SRAM) and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Commercial uses of semiconductor RAM date back to 1965, when IBM introduced the SP95 SRAM chip for their [[IBM System/360|System/360 Model 95]] computer, and [[Toshiba]] used DRAM memory cells for its Toscal BC-1411 [[electronic calculator]], both based on [[bipolar transistor]]s. Commercial MOS memory, based on [[MOS transistor]]s, was developed in the late 1960s, and has since been the basis for all commercial semiconductor memory. The first commercial DRAM IC chip, the [[Intel 1103]], was introduced in October 1970. [[Synchronous dynamic random-access memory]] (SDRAM) later debuted with the [[Samsung Electronics|Samsung]] KM48SL2000 chip in 1992.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Early SSA accounting operations.jpg|thumb|These IBM [[tabulating machine]]s from the mid-1930s used [[mechanical counter]]s to store information]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1989-0406-022, VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, 1-Megabit-Chip.jpg|thumb|right|1 [[Mebibit|Megabit]] (MiBit) chip, one of the last models developed by [[Carl Zeiss AG|VEB Carl Zeiss Jena]] in 1989]]\n\nEarly computers used [[relay]]s, [[mechanical counter]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html|title=IBM Archives -- FAQ's for Products and Services|work=ibm.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184527/http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/reference/faq_0000000011.html|archivedate=2012-10-23}}</ref> or [[Delay line memory|delay line]]s for main memory functions. Ultrasonic delay lines were [[bit-serial architecture|serial device]]s which could only reproduce data in the order it was written. [[Drum memory]] could be expanded at relatively low cost but efficient retrieval of memory items required knowledge of the physical layout of the drum to optimize speed. Latches built out of [[vacuum tube]] [[triode]]s, and later, out of discrete [[transistor]]s, were used for smaller and faster memories such as registers. Such registers were relatively large and too costly to use for large amounts of data; generally only a few dozen or few hundred bits of such memory could be provided.\n\nThe first practical form of random-access memory was the [[Williams tube]] starting in 1947.  It stored data as electrically charged spots on the face of a [[cathode ray tube]].

The capacity of the Williams tube was a few hundred to around a thousand bits, but it was much smaller, faster, and more power-efficient than using individual vacuum tube latches.

It became a widespread form of random-access memory, relying on an array of magnetized rings.  By changing the sense of each ring's magnetization, data could be stored with one bit stored per ring. Since every ring had a combination of address wires to select and read or write it, access to any memory location in any sequence was possible. Magnetic core memory was the standard form of [[computer memory]] system until displaced by [[solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[MOSFET|MOS]] ([[metal-oxide-silicon]]) [[semiconductor memory]] in [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) during the early 1970s.<ref name=\"computerhistory1970\"/>\n\nPrior to the development of integrated [[read-only memory]] (ROM) circuits, ''permanent'' (or ''read-only'') random-access memory was often constructed using [[Diode matrix|diode matrices]] driven by [[address decoder]]s, or specially wound [[core rope memory]] planes. {{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph needs a citation.|date=December 2016}}\n\n[[Semiconductor memory]] began in the 1960s with bipolar memory, which used [[bipolar transistors]].

In SRAM, a [[Bit|bit of data]] is stored using the state of a six-[[transistor]] [[Memory cell (computing)|memory cell]], typically using six [[MOSFET]]s (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors). This form of RAM is more expensive to produce, but is generally faster and requires less dynamic power than DRAM. In modern computers, SRAM is often used as [[CPU cache|cache memory for the CPU]]. DRAM stores a bit of data using a transistor and [[capacitor]] pair (typically a MOSFET and [[MOS capacitor]], respectively),<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sze |first1=Simon M. |author1-link=Simon Sze |title=Semiconductor Devices: Physics and Technology |date=2002 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]] |isbn=0-471-33372-7 |page=214 |edition=2nd |url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/453/Semiconductor.Devices_Physics.Technology_Sze.2ndEd_Wiley_2002.pdf}}</ref> which together comprise a DRAM cell. The capacitor holds a high or low charge (1 or 0, respectively), and the transistor acts as a switch that lets the control circuitry on the chip read the capacitor's state of charge or change it.  As this form of memory is less expensive to produce than static RAM, it is the predominant form of computer memory used in modern computers.\n\nBoth static and dynamic RAM are considered ''volatile'', as their state is lost or reset when power is removed from the system.  By contrast, [[read-only memory]] (ROM) stores data by permanently enabling or disabling selected transistors, such that the memory cannot be altered.  Writeable variants of ROM (such as [[EEPROM]] and [[flash memory]]) share properties of both ROM and RAM, enabling data to [[Persistence (computer science)|persist]] without power and to be updated without requiring special equipment.  These persistent forms of semiconductor ROM include [[Universal serial bus|USB]] flash drives, memory cards for cameras and portable devices, and [[solid-state drives]]. \n[[ECC memory]] (which can be either SRAM or DRAM) includes special circuitry to detect and/or correct random faults (memory errors) in the stored data, using [[parity bit]]s or [[Error detection and correction#Error-correcting code|error correction codes]].\n\nIn general, the term ''RAM'' refers solely to solid-state memory devices (either DRAM or SRAM), and more specifically the main memory in most computers.  In optical storage, the term [[DVD-RAM]] is somewhat of a misnomer since, unlike [[CD-RW]] or [[DVD-RW]] it does not need to be erased before reuse.  Nevertheless, a DVD-RAM behaves much like a hard disc drive if somewhat slower.\n\n==Memory cell==\n{{main|Memory cell (computing)}}\nThe memory cell is the fundamental building block of [[computer memory]]. The memory cell is an [[electronic circuit]] that stores one [[bit]] of binary information and it must be set to store a logic 1 (high voltage level) and reset to store a logic 0 (low voltage level). Its value is maintained/stored until it is changed by the set/reset process. The value in the memory cell can be accessed by reading it.\n\nIn SRAM, the memory cell is a type of [[flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] circuit, usually implemented using [[field effect transistor|FET]]s. This means that SRAM requires very low power when not being accessed, but it is expensive and has low storage density.\n\nA second type, DRAM, is based around a capacitor. Charging and discharging this capacitor can store a \"1\" or a \"0\" in the cell. However, the charge in this capacitor slowly leaks away, and must be refreshed periodically. Because of this refresh process, DRAM uses more power, but it can achieve greater storage densities and lower unit costs compared to SRAM.\n{| style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|[[File:SRAM Cell (6 Transistors).svg|thumb|SRAM Cell (6 Transistors)]]||[[File:DRAM Cell Structure (Model of Single Circuit Cell).PNG|thumb|DRAM Cell (1 Transistor and one capacitor)]]\n|}\n\n==Addressing==\nTo be useful, memory cells must be readable and writeable. Within the RAM device, multiplexing and demultiplexing circuitry is used to select memory cells. Typically, a RAM device has a set of address lines A0... An, and for each combination of bits that may be applied to these lines, a set of memory cells are activated. Due to this addressing, RAM devices virtually always have a memory capacity that is a power of two.\n\nUsually several memory cells share the same address. For example, a 4 bit 'wide' RAM chip has 4 memory cells for each address. Often the width of the memory and that of the microprocessor are different, for a 32 bit microprocessor, eight 4 bit RAM chips would be needed.\n\nOften more addresses are needed than can be provided by a device. In that case, external multiplexors to the device are used to activate the correct device that is being accessed.\n\n==Memory hierarchy==\n{{main|Memory hierarchy}}\nOne can read and over-write data in RAM. Many computer systems have a memory hierarchy consisting of [[processor register]]s, on-die [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] caches, external [[CPU cache|caches]], [[DRAM]], [[paging]] systems and [[virtual memory]] or [[swap space]] on a hard drive. This entire pool of memory may be referred to as \"RAM\" by many developers, even though the various subsystems can have very different [[access time]]s, violating the original concept behind the ''random access'' term in RAM. Even within a hierarchy level such as DRAM, the specific row, column, bank, [[Memory rank|rank]], channel, or [[interleaved memory|interleave]] organization of the components make the access time variable, although not to the extent that access time to rotating [[storage media]] or a tape is variable. The overall goal of using a memory hierarchy is to obtain the highest possible average access performance while minimizing the total cost of the entire memory system (generally, the memory hierarchy follows the access time with the fast CPU registers at the top and the slow hard drive at the bottom).\n\nIn many modern personal computers, the RAM comes in an easily upgraded form of modules called [[DIMM|memory module]]s or DRAM modules about the size of a few sticks of chewing gum. These can quickly be replaced should they become damaged or when changing needs demand more storage capacity. As suggested above, smaller amounts of RAM (mostly SRAM) are also integrated in the [[CPU]] and other [[Integrated circuit|ICs]] on the [[motherboard]], as well as in hard-drives, [[CD-ROM]]s, and several other parts of the computer system.\n\n==Other uses of RAM==\n[[File:Samsung-1GB-DDR2-Laptop-RAM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[SO-DIMM]] stick of laptop RAM, roughly half the size of [[DIMM|desktop RAM]].]]\nIn addition to serving as temporary storage and working space for the operating system and applications, RAM is used in numerous other ways.\n\n===Virtual memory===\n{{main|Virtual memory}}\nMost modern operating systems employ a method of extending RAM capacity, known as \"virtual memory\".  A portion of the computer's [[hard drive]] is set aside for a ''paging file'' or a ''scratch partition'', and the combination of physical RAM and the paging file form the system's total memory.  (For example, if a computer has 2 GiB (1024<sup>3</sup> B) of RAM and a 1 GiB page file, the operating system has 3 GiB total memory available to it.)  When the system runs low on physical memory, it can \"[[paging|swap]]\" portions of RAM to the paging file to make room for new data, as well as to read previously swapped information back into RAM.  Excessive use of this mechanism results in [[thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] and generally hampers overall system performance, mainly because hard drives are far slower than RAM.\n\n===RAM disk===\n{{main|RAM drive}}\nSoftware can \"partition\" a portion of a computer's RAM, allowing it to act as a much faster hard drive that is called a [[RAM disk]]. A RAM disk loses the stored data when the computer is shut down, unless memory is arranged to have a standby battery source.\n\n===Shadow RAM===\nSometimes, the contents of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often write-protected). This process, sometimes called ''shadowing'', is fairly common in both computers and [[embedded systems]].\n\nAs a common example, the [[BIOS]] in typical personal computers often has an option called \u201cuse shadow BIOS\u201d or similar. When enabled, functions that rely on data from the BIOS's ROM instead use DRAM locations (most can also toggle shadowing of video card ROM or other ROM sections). Depending on the system, this may not result in increased performance, and may cause incompatibilities.  For example, some hardware may be inaccessible to the [[operating system]] if shadow RAM is used. On some systems the benefit may be hypothetical because the BIOS is not used after booting in favor of direct hardware access. Free memory is reduced by the size of the shadowed ROMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|title=Shadow Ram|accessdate=2007-07-24|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029162135/http://hardwarehell.com/articles/shadowram.htm|archivedate=2006-10-29}}</ref>'''\n\n==Recent developments==\nSeveral new types of [[NVRAM|''non-volatile'' RAM]], which preserve data while powered down, are under development.

Given these trends, it was expected that memory latency would become an overwhelming [[bottleneck (engineering)|bottleneck]] in computer performance.<ref>The term was coined in {{cite web |url=http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406111104/http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/~lboloni/Teaching/EEL5708_2006/slides/wulf94.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-06 }}.</ref>\n\nCPU speed improvements slowed significantly partly due to major physical barriers and partly because current CPU designs have already hit the memory wall in some sense.

Third, for certain applications, traditional serial architectures are becoming less efficient as processors get faster (due to the so-called [[Von Neumann architecture#Von Neumann bottleneck|Von Neumann bottleneck]]), further undercutting any gains that frequency increases might otherwise buy.
