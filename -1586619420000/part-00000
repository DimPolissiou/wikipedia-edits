He meets with wealthy Asha ([[Asha Parekh]]) at this college, and after a few misunderstandings, both fall in love. Vikas' dad passes away during the exams. Because Vikas leaves to attend the funeral, he is unable to complete his studies. Asha feels sorry for him and arranges to get him employed with her dad, without telling Vikas about it. Asha's dad wants her to marry Ashwini ([[Pran (actor)|Pran]]), and he soon announces their engagement.\n\nAshwini finds out that Asha is in love with Vikas, and arranges an accident for Vikas. Vikas survives the accident, but loses his eyesight. After this incident, Vikas does not want to burden Asha, and strikes up a new friendship with Dr. Anjali ([[Simi Garewal]]). Meanwhile, Ashwini informs Asha that Vikas has died in the accident. Asha loses interest in life after listening to the news of Vikas's death. Ashwini then meets Vikas and requests him to convince Asha that he does not love her any more. Vikas agrees and convinces Asha that he is having an affair with Dr. Anjali. Asha marries Ashwini but refuses to live in the same room as he.\n\nVikas starts singing to earn money. Dr. Anjali asks him to get an eye operation, but Vikas refuses. One day, Dr. Anjali visits Asha and asks her to persuade Vikas to undergo the operation. While Asha is asking Vikas to undergo the operation, Ashwini takes her away and locks her in a room. She feels suicidal.\n\nOne day Asha's uncle goes to meet her and feels saddened by her condition. He takes her to her father's home. Within three days, Asha becomes sick and doctors are unable to do anything for her. Meanwhile, Vikas's eye operation is successful. Ashwini apologizes to Asha.

[[forebrain]] ([[telencephalon]]). The putamen and [[caudate nucleus]] together form the [[dorsal striatum]]. It is also one of the structures that comprise the [[basal nuclei]]. Through various pathways, the putamen is connected to the [[substantia nigra]], the [[globus pallidus]], the [[claustrum]], and the [[thalamus]], in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex. A primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages (e.g. preparation and execution) and influence various types of [[learning]]. It employs [[GABA]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[enkephalin]] to perform its functions. The putamen also plays a role in [[Degenerative disease|degenerative neurological disorders]], such as [[Parkinson's disease]].\n\n==History==\nThe word \"putamen\" is from [[Latin]], referring to that which \"falls off in pruning\", from \"putare\", meaning \"to prune, to think, or to consider\".<ref>http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/putare</ref>\n\nUntil recently, most MRI research focused broadly on the basal ganglia as a whole, for various reasons (e.g. image resolution, rarity of isolated infarct or hemorrhage within the putamen, etc.). However, many studies have been done on the basal ganglia and relevant brain-behavior relationships. In the 1970s, the first [[Single-unit recording|single unit recordings]] were done with [[monkey]]s monitoring [[pallidal]] [[neuron]] activity related to movement. Since then, more extensive neuronal tracing, stimulation, and imaging research methods (e.g. [[fMRI]], [[DWI]]) that allow for investigation of the putamen have been developed.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Globus pallidus and putamen - very low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Globus pallidus (lower left) and putamen (upper right). [[LFB stain|H&E-LFB stain]].]]\nThe putamen is a structure in the [[forebrain]]. Along with the [[caudate nucleus]] it forms the [[dorsal striatum]]. The caudate and putamen contain the same types of neurons and circuits \u2013 many neuroanatomists consider the dorsal striatum to be a single structure, divided into two parts by a large fiber tract, the [[internal capsule]], passing through the middle. The putamen, together with the [[globus pallidus]], makes up the [[lentiform nucleus]]. The putamen is the outermost portion of the [[basal ganglia]]. These are a group of nuclei in the brain that are interconnected with the [[cerebral cortex]], [[thalamus]], and [[brainstem]]. Basal ganglia include the [[dorsal striatum]], [[substantia nigra]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[subthalamic nucleus]].\n\nIn [[mammals]], the basal ganglia are associated with [[motor control]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]]s, [[learning]], and domain-general functions important for executive functioning as well as support for domain-specific languages. The basal ganglia are located bilaterally, and have [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] and [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] divisions. The putamen is located in the rostral division as part of the [[striatum]]. The basal ganglia receive input from the cerebral cortex, via the striatum.\n\nThe putamen is interconnected with the following structures:\n[[File:Striatum Structural MRI.png|thumb|alt=This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural MR image. The striatum includes the [[caudate nucleus]] (top) and putamen (right) and the [[globus pallidus]] (left).|This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural MR image. The striatum includes the caudate nucleus (top) and putamen (right) and the globus pallidus (left).]]\n\nThis description is rudimentary and does not nearly exhaust even the basic established circuitry of the putamen. The cortico-subcortico-cortical circuits with putaminal involvement are dense and complicated, consisting of a wide range of axonal, dendritic, chemical, afferent, and efferent substrates. The putamen's outputs are highly arborized across output structures, and cortical efferents arise from layers III-VI of the cortex, dependent on gyri and location within the putamen. Topographical organization of the putamen combines the following elements: anterior-to-posterior functional and somatotopic gradients, lateral-to-medial functional and somatotopic gradients, diffuse terminal output, patchy localized terminal output, segregated terminals from adjacent regions, finely interdigiated terminals from distal cortical regions in a seemingly overlapping fashion{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.\n\n===Caudate nucleus===\nThe caudate works with the putamen to receive the input from [[cerebral cortex]]. Collectively, they can be considered the \"entrance\" to the basal ganglia. Projections from the putamen reach the caudate directly via the caudolenticular grey bridges. The putamen and caudate are jointly connected with the [[substantia nigra]], however the caudate outputs more densely to the [[substantia nigra]] pars reticulata while the putamen sends more afferents to the internal [[globus pallidus]].\n\n===Substantia nigra===\nThe substantia nigra contains two parts: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). The SNpc obtains input from the putamen and caudate, and sends information back. The SNpr also obtains input from the putamen and caudate. However, it sends the input outside the basal ganglia to control head and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]s. The SNpc produces dopamine, which is crucial for movements. The SNpc is the part that degenerates during [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{cite journal | journal =  Trends in Neurosciences|date=July 1990 | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 266\u201371 | title = Functional architecture of basal ganglia circuits: neural substrates of parallel processing | author = Alexander GE |author2=Crutcher MD  | pmid = 1695401 | doi =10.1016/0166-2236(90)90107-L }}</ref>\n\n===Globus pallidus===\nThe globus pallidus contains two parts: the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi). Both regions acquire input from the putamen and caudate and communicate with the subthalamic nucleus. However, mostly the GPi sends GABAergic inhibitory output to the thalamus. The GPi also sends projections to parts of the midbrain, which have been assumed to affect posture control.<ref name=\"Alexander\" />\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Types of pathways===\nThe putamen (and striatum in general) has numerous, parallel circuits that allow for cortico-subcortico-cortico communication loops. These have been described, broadly, as the direct, indirect, and hyper direct pathways. GABAergic projections of the putamen have an inhibitory effect on the thalamus. Thalamic projections from the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei have an excitatory effect on the putamen. Unlike the thalamus, which has broad reciprocal connectivity, cortical projections with the putamen are afferent, thus sending information as opposed to receiving it. Cortical communication is accomplished via multi-fiber pathways as outlined previously (i.e. via other subcortical structures).\n\n===Dopamine===\nDopamine as a neurotransmitter has a dominant role in the putamen, most of it is supplied from the substantia nigra. When a [[cell body]] of a [[neuron]] (in the putamen or caudate nuclei) fires an [[action potential]], dopamine is released from the [[presynaptic terminal]]. Since projections from the putamen and caudate nuclei [[Neuromodulation|modulate]] the [[dendrites]] of the substantia nigra, the dopamine influences the substantia nigra, which affects [[motor planning]]. This same mechanism is involved in [[drug addiction]]. In order to control the amount of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]], and the amount of dopamine binding to [[post synaptic terminals]], presynaptic dopaminergic neurons function to [[reuptake]] the excess dopamine.\n\n===Other neurotransmitters===\nThe putamen also plays a role in [[Neuromodulation|modulation]] of other neurotransmitters. It releases GABA, enkephalin, [[substance P]], and [[acetylcholine]]. It receives [[serotonin]] and [[glutamate]].\n\n==Function: motor skills==\nThe putamen is interconnected with many other structures, and works in conjunction with them to influence many types of motor behaviors.

The goal of this study was to determine whether particular cell activity in the putamen of primates was related to the direction of limb movement or to the underlying pattern of muscular activity. Two monkeys were trained to perform tasks that involved the movement of loads. The tasks were created so that movement could be distinguished from muscle activity. Neurons in the putamen were selected for monitoring only if they were related both to the task and to arm movements outside the task. It was shown that 50% of the neurons that were monitored were related to the direction of movement, independent of the load.<ref name=\"Crutcher2\">{{cite journal | journal = Exp.

Movement tasks were performed with a [[joystick]]-controlled [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]]. Statistical tests were done to calculate the extent of movements and what regions of the brain the movements correlate to. It was found that \"increasing movement extent was associated with parallel increases of rCBF in bilateral basal ganglia (BG; putamen and globus pallidus) and ipsilateral cerebellum.\" This not only shows that the putamen affects movement but it also shows that the putamen integrates with other structures in order to perform tasks.<ref name=\"Turner\">{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Neurophysiology |date=December 2003 | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 3958\u201366 | title = Motor subcircuits mediating the control of movement extent and speed | author = Turner RS |author2=Desmurget M |author3=Grethe J |author4=Crutcher MD |author5=Grafton ST  | pmid = 12954606 | doi =10.1152/jn.00323.2003 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/436763f06d7039371b7150616da997c9a305b2ab }}</ref>\n\nOne study was done in order to specifically investigate how the basal ganglia influences the learning of sequential movements. Two monkeys were trained to press a series of buttons in sequence. The methods used were designed to be able to monitor the well-learned tasks versus the new tasks.

The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the [[prefrontal cortex]] are more likely to be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of this study was to determine whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.\n\nSeven participants with basal ganglia [[lesion]]s were used in the experiment, along with nine control participants. It is important to note that the caudate was not affected. The participants were tested for each type of learning during separate sessions, so the information processes would not interfere with each other. During each session, participants sat in front of a computer screen and various lines were displayed. These lines were created by using a randomization technique where random samples were taken from one of four categories. For ruled-based testing, these samples were used to construct lines of various length and orientation that fell into these four separate categories. After the stimulus was displayed, the subjects were asked to press 1 of 4 buttons to indicate which category the line fell into. The same process was repeated for information-integration tasks, and the same stimuli were used, except that the category boundaries were rotated 45\u00b0. This rotation causes the subject to integrate the quantitative information about the line before determining what category it is in.\n\nIt was found that subjects in the experimental group were impaired while performing rule-based tasks, but not information-integration ones. After statistical testing, it was also hypothesized that the brain began using information-integration techniques to solve the rule-based learning tasks. Since rule-based tasks use the hypothesis-testing system of the brain, it can be concluded that the hypothesis-testing system of the brain was damaged/weakened. It is known that the caudate and working memories are part of this system. Therefore, it was confirmed that the putamen is involved in category learning, competition between the systems, feed-back processing in rule-based tasks, and is involved in the processing of pre-frontal regions (which relate to working memory and executive functioning). Now it is known that not only the basal ganglia and caudate affect category learning.<ref name=\"Ell\">{{cite journal | journal = Neuropsychologia | year = 2006 | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 1737\u201351 | title = Focal putamen lesions impair learning in rule-based, but not information-integration categorization tasks | author = Ell SW |author2=Marchant NL |author3=Ivry RB  | pmid = 16635498 | doi =10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.018 | url = https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=psy_facpub }}</ref>\n\n==Role in \"hate circuit\"==\nTentative studies have suggested that the putamen may play a role in the so-called \"[[Hatred|hate]] circuit\" of the brain.

However, inter-species variation are indeed observed in mammals, and have been documented for white matter putaminal connectivity. Variation is primarily related to structural connectivity patterns, while somatotopic organization principles are retained. Primate research since the 1980s through to the present has established that cortical regions relation to higher-order cognition primarily send afferent neurons to the rostal-most portion of the putamen, while the remainder of this structure in primates primarily serves sensori-motor functions and is densely interconnected with primary and supplementary motor regions.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\n Image:Gray744.png|Coronal section of brain through [[anterior commissure]].\n Image:Telencephalon-Horiconatal.jpg|Horizontal section of right cerebral hemisphere.\n Image:Constudoverbrain_-_2.png|Brain\n Image:Human brain frontal (coronal) section description 2.JPG|Human brain frontal (coronal) section\n Image:Putamen.jpg|Horizontal slice of MRI-image showing the putamen.

The putamen and [[caudate nucleus]] together form the [[dorsal striatum]]. It is also one of the structures that comprise the [[basal nuclei]]. Through various pathways, the putamen is connected to the [[substantia nigra]], the [[globus pallidus]], the [[claustrum]], and the [[thalamus]], in addition to many regions of the cerebral cortex. A primary function of the putamen is to regulate movements at various stages (e.g. preparation and execution) and influence various types of [[learning]]. It employs [[GABA]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[enkephalin]] to perform its functions. The putamen also plays a role in [[Degenerative disease|degenerative neurological disorders]], such as [[Parkinson's disease]].\n\n==History==\nThe word \"putamen\" is from [[Latin]], referring to that which \"falls off in pruning\", from \"putare\", meaning \"to prune, to think, or to consider\".<ref>http://latin-dictionary.net/search/latin/putare</ref>\n\nUntil recently, most MRI research focused broadly on the basal ganglia as a whole, for various reasons (e.g. image resolution, rarity of isolated infarct or hemorrhage within the putamen, etc.). However, many studies have been done on the basal ganglia and relevant brain-behavior relationships. In the 1970s, the first [[Single-unit recording|single unit recordings]] were done with [[monkey]]s monitoring [[pallidal]] [[neuron]] activity related to movement. Since then, more extensive neuronal tracing, stimulation, and imaging research methods (e.g. [[fMRI]], [[DWI]]) that allow for investigation of the putamen have been developed.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:Globus pallidus and putamen - very low mag.jpg|thumb|right|Globus pallidus (lower left) and putamen (upper right). [[LFB stain|H&E-LFB stain]].]]\nThe putamen is a structure in the [[forebrain]]. Along with the [[caudate nucleus]] it forms the [[dorsal striatum]]. The caudate and putamen contain the same types of neurons and circuits \u2013 many neuroanatomists consider the dorsal striatum to be a single structure, divided into two parts by a large fiber tract, the [[internal capsule]], passing through the middle. The putamen, together with the [[globus pallidus]], makes up the [[lentiform nucleus]]. The putamen is the outermost portion of the [[basal ganglia]]. These are a group of nuclei in the brain that are interconnected with the [[cerebral cortex]], [[thalamus]], and [[brainstem]]. Basal ganglia include the [[dorsal striatum]], [[substantia nigra]], [[nucleus accumbens]], and the [[subthalamic nucleus]].\n\nIn [[mammals]], the basal ganglia are associated with [[motor control]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]]s, [[learning]], and domain-general functions important for executive functioning as well as support for domain-specific languages. The basal ganglia are located bilaterally, and have [[Anatomical terms of location#Directional terms|rostral]] and [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] divisions. The putamen is located in the rostral division as part of the [[striatum]]. The basal ganglia receive input from the cerebral cortex, via the striatum.\n\nThe putamen is interconnected with the following structures:\n[[File:Striatum Structural MRI.png|thumb|alt=This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural MR image. The striatum includes the [[caudate nucleus]] (top) and putamen (right) and the [[globus pallidus]] (left).|This is a transverse section of the striatum from a structural MR image. The striatum includes the caudate nucleus (top) and putamen (right) and the globus pallidus (left).]]\n\nThis description is rudimentary and does not nearly exhaust even the basic established circuitry of the putamen. The cortico-subcortico-cortical circuits with putaminal involvement are dense and complicated, consisting of a wide range of axonal, dendritic, chemical, afferent, and efferent substrates. The putamen's outputs are highly arborized across output structures, and cortical efferents arise from layers III-VI of the cortex, dependent on gyri and location within the putamen. Topographical organization of the putamen combines the following elements: anterior-to-posterior functional and somatotopic gradients, lateral-to-medial functional and somatotopic gradients, diffuse terminal output, patchy localized terminal output, segregated terminals from adjacent regions, finely interdigiated terminals from distal cortical regions in a seemingly overlapping fashion{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}.\n\n===Caudate nucleus===\nThe caudate works with the putamen to receive the input from [[cerebral cortex]]. Collectively, they can be considered the \"entrance\" to the basal ganglia. Projections from the putamen reach the caudate directly via the caudolenticular grey bridges. The putamen and caudate are jointly connected with the [[substantia nigra]], however the caudate outputs more densely to the [[substantia nigra]] pars reticulata while the putamen sends more afferents to the internal [[globus pallidus]].\n\n===Substantia nigra===\nThe substantia nigra contains two parts: the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr). The SNpc obtains input from the putamen and caudate, and sends information back. The SNpr also obtains input from the putamen and caudate. However, it sends the input outside the basal ganglia to control head and [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]s. The SNpc produces dopamine, which is crucial for movements. The SNpc is the part that degenerates during [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=\"Alexander\">{{cite journal | journal =  Trends in Neurosciences|date=July 1990 | volume = 13 | issue = 7 | pages = 266\u201371 | title = Functional architecture of basal ganglia circuits: neural substrates of parallel processing | author = Alexander GE |author2=Crutcher MD  | pmid = 1695401 | doi =10.1016/0166-2236(90)90107-L }}</ref>\n\n===Globus pallidus===\nThe globus pallidus contains two parts: the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe) and the globus pallidus pars interna (GPi). Both regions acquire input from the putamen and caudate and communicate with the subthalamic nucleus. However, mostly the GPi sends GABAergic inhibitory output to the thalamus. The GPi also sends projections to parts of the midbrain, which have been assumed to affect posture control.<ref name=\"Alexander\" />\n\n==Physiology==\n\n===Types of pathways===\nThe putamen (and striatum in general) has numerous, parallel circuits that allow for cortico-subcortico-cortico communication loops. These have been described, broadly, as the direct, indirect, and hyper direct pathways. GABAergic projections of the putamen have an inhibitory effect on the thalamus. Thalamic projections from the centromedian and parafascicular nuclei have an excitatory effect on the putamen. Unlike the thalamus, which has broad reciprocal connectivity, cortical projections with the putamen are afferent, thus sending information as opposed to receiving it. Cortical communication is accomplished via multi-fiber pathways as outlined previously (i.e. via other subcortical structures).\n\n===Dopamine===\nDopamine as a neurotransmitter has a dominant role in the putamen, most of it is supplied from the substantia nigra. When a [[cell body]] of a [[neuron]] (in the putamen or caudate nuclei) fires an [[action potential]], dopamine is released from the [[presynaptic terminal]]. Since projections from the putamen and caudate nuclei [[Neuromodulation|modulate]] the [[dendrites]] of the substantia nigra, the dopamine influences the substantia nigra, which affects [[motor planning]]. This same mechanism is involved in [[drug addiction]]. In order to control the amount of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]], and the amount of dopamine binding to [[post synaptic terminals]], presynaptic dopaminergic neurons function to [[reuptake]] the excess dopamine.\n\n===Other neurotransmitters===\nThe putamen also plays a role in [[Neuromodulation|modulation]] of other neurotransmitters. It releases GABA, enkephalin, [[substance P]], and [[acetylcholine]]. It receives [[serotonin]] and [[glutamate]].\n\n==Function: motor skills==\nThe putamen is interconnected with many other structures, and works in conjunction with them to influence many types of motor behaviors.

Tonically active neurons are [[cholinergic]] [[interneurons]] that fire during the entire duration of the stimulus and fire at about 0.5\u20133 impulses per second. Phasic neurons are the opposite and only fire an action potential when movement occurs.<ref name=\"Yamada\">{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | date = April 7, 2004 | volume = 24 | issue = 14 | pages = 3500\u201310 | title = Tonically active neurons in the primate caudate nucleus and putamen differentially encode instructed motivational outcomes of action | author = Yamada H |author2=Matsumoto N |author3=Kimura M  | pmid = 15071097 | doi =10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0068-04.2004 }}</ref>\n\n===Category learning===\nOne particular study used patients with focal lesions on the basal ganglia (specifically the putamen) due to [[stroke]] in order to study [[category learning]]. The advantage to using these types of patients is that dopaminergic projections to the [[prefrontal cortex]] are more likely to be intact. Also, in these patients, it is easier to relate specific brain structures to function because the lesion only occurs in a specific place. The goal of this study was to determine whether or not these lesions affect rule-based and information-integration task learning. Rule-based tasks are learned via hypothesis-testing dependent on working memory. Information-integration tasks are ones wherein the accuracy is maximized when information from two sources are integrated at a pre-decisional stage, which follows a procedural-based system.\n\nSeven participants with basal ganglia [[lesion]]s were used in the experiment, along with nine control participants. It is important to note that the caudate was not affected. The participants were tested for each type of learning during separate sessions, so the information processes would not interfere with each other. During each session, participants sat in front of a computer screen and various lines were displayed. These lines were created by using a randomization technique where random samples were taken from one of four categories. For ruled-based testing, these samples were used to construct lines of various length and orientation that fell into these four separate categories. After the stimulus was displayed, the subjects were asked to press 1 of 4 buttons to indicate which category the line fell into. The same process was repeated for information-integration tasks, and the same stimuli were used, except that the category boundaries were rotated 45\u00b0. This rotation causes the subject to integrate the quantitative information about the line before determining what category it is in.\n\nIt was found that subjects in the experimental group were impaired while performing rule-based tasks, but not information-integration ones. After statistical testing, it was also hypothesized that the brain began using information-integration techniques to solve the rule-based learning tasks. Since rule-based tasks use the hypothesis-testing system of the brain, it can be concluded that the hypothesis-testing system of the brain was damaged/weakened. It is known that the caudate and working memories are part of this system. Therefore, it was confirmed that the putamen is involved in category learning, competition between the systems, feed-back processing in rule-based tasks, and is involved in the processing of pre-frontal regions (which relate to working memory and executive functioning). Now it is known that not only the basal ganglia and caudate affect category learning.<ref name=\"Ell\">{{cite journal | journal = Neuropsychologia | year = 2006 | volume = 44 | issue = 10 | pages = 1737\u201351 | title = Focal putamen lesions impair learning in rule-based, but not information-integration categorization tasks | author = Ell SW |author2=Marchant NL |author3=Ivry RB  | pmid = 16635498 | doi =10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.018 | url = https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=psy_facpub }}</ref>\n\n==Role in \"hate circuit\"==\nTentative studies have suggested that the putamen may play a role in the so-called \"[[Hatred|hate]] circuit\" of the brain.

An [[fMRI]] was done on patients while they viewed a picture of people they hated and people who were \"neutral\". During the experiment, a \"hate score\" was recorded for each picture. The activity in sub-cortical areas of the brain implied that the \"hate circuit\" involves the putamen and the [[insular cortex|insula]].

However, inter-species variation are indeed observed in mammals, and have been documented for white matter putaminal connectivity. Variation is primarily related to structural connectivity patterns, while somatotopic organization principles are retained. Primate research since the 1980s through to the present has established that cortical regions relation to higher-order cognition primarily send afferent neurons to the rostal-most portion of the putamen, while the remainder of this structure in primates primarily serves sensori-motor functions and is densely interconnected with primary and supplementary motor regions.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\n Image:Gray744.png|Coronal section of brain through [[anterior commissure]].\n Image:Telencephalon-Horiconatal.jpg|Horizontal section of right cerebral hemisphere.\n Image:Constudoverbrain_-_2.png|Brain\n Image:Human brain frontal (coronal) section description 2.JPG|Human brain frontal (coronal) section\n Image:Putamen.jpg|Horizontal slice of MRI-image showing the putamen.

It is often very hard even for a searching human to recognize one of these spiders on a yellow flower. These spiders are sometimes called banana spiders because of their striking yellow color.\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe much smaller males scamper from flower to flower in search of females and are often seen missing one or more of their legs.

Throughout his career he has largely presented for London's regional radio and television.\n\nBaker was born in [[Deptford]] to a [[working-class]] family and raised in [[Bermondsey]]. From 1977, he wrote for the [[punk zine]] ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', and from there was hired by the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', where he worked as a writer, reviewer, and interviewer. Moving into television in 1980, he began presenting [[London Weekend Television]]'s ''Twentieth Century Box'' and reporting for ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]''. In 1989 he began radio presenting for [[BBC Radio London|BBC GLR]] and in 1990 joined the newly established [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]. In 1997 he was sacked from the latter, accused of inciting threatening behaviour toward a [[association football|football]] referee. That decade, he also began writing for television.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2012 Baker presented the daily morning radio show on [[BBC London 94.9]] and in 2007 also presented the channel's all-day [[podcast]], the ''[[All Day Breakfast Show]]''. Between 2012 and 2017 he published a three-volume [[autobiography]], which was used as the basis for the 2015 BBC [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. In 2019, the BBC [[dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] Baker after he posted a [[Twitter|Tweet]] regarded by many as racist.\n\n== Early life ==\nBaker was born in [[Deptford]] in south east London to Fred \"Spud\" Baker, a [[Stevedore|dockworker]], and Betty, a factory worker.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He grew up in [[Bermondsey]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} He attended [[Rotherhithe]] Primary School and then instead of taking up a [[grammar school]] place he went to the nearby West Greenwich Secondary Boys School, Deptford.<ref name=Autobiography>{{cite book|date=6 November 2012|first=Danny |last=Baker|isbn=978-0297863403|title= Going to Sea in a Sieve: The Autobiography |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref> He played truant from the age of 14 to the age of 16 when he could legally leave school.

Baker began working as the office receptionist, but was soon contributing regular articles and reviews before progressing to interviews. He often refers to these times during his [[Radio programming|radio shows]], regularly citing examples of the ridiculous behaviour exhibited by his rock star interviewees.\n\nIn the later 1990s, Baker wrote a weekly sports column for ''[[The Times]]'' and was briefly a columnist for early issues of film magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''.\n\n===Television===\n====Reporting for LWT (1980s)====\nBaker started his TV career in 1980 at [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT), as the presenter of ''Twentieth Century Box'' \u2013 a series of regional documentaries on elements of [[youth culture]] in London, produced by [[Janet Street Porter]]. One edition in the first series documented the burgeoning [[new wave of British heavy metal]] ([[NWOBHM]]) scene, including an early TV appearance of [[Iron Maiden]] performing at [[The Marquee Club]] and interviews with \"[[air guitar]]ists\". Other editions also featured early appearances from the likes of [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Depeche Mode]].\n\nBaker's first mainstream break was as [[wikt:itinerant|roving]] [[reporter]]-[[Television presenter|presenter]] on the [[Michael Aspel]] [[LWT]] regional magazine ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'' alongside former ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' winner and former London [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] driver [[Fred Housego]]. [[Paul Ross]] (brother of Jonathan Ross whom Baker had as his [[best man]]) was his researcher. During his stint on ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'', Baker was filmed having an altercation with a British Rail press officer. This clip is often resurrected for [[clip show]]s and can be seen on YouTube.\n\n====Writing and presenting (early\u2013late 1990s)====\nBaker appeared regularly on LWT's regional output during the 1980s and early 1990s - working on such programmes as ''Six O'Clock Live'', ''Danny Baker's Londoners'', and in 1991, ''The Game'' - a six-part series which featured coverage of teams involved in the fourth division of the East London [[Sunday league football|Sunday Football League]]. The series was later released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/danny-baker-the-game-football-tv |title=Danny Baker's 'The Game': the best football programme you've never watched |publisher=Shortlist.com |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBaker began writing for television programmes in 1992 after being asked to prepare a piece for one of the first archive clip shows: ''[[TV Hell]]'', which was a collection of the worst TV programmes ever. Since then he has presented television shows such as ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (UK game show)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'', ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'' and ''TV Heroes'', which was a series of 10-minute homages to some of Baker's entertainment idols including [[Fanny Cradock]], [[Peter Glaze]] (from ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]'') and the ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' audience. The episode on the ''Top of the Pops'' audience includes a clip of Baker leaping around to a performance of \"Ooh What A Life\" by the [[Gibson Brothers]] in 1979, captioned as \"Danny Baker's first TV appearance\". \n\nBaker also began a BBC Saturday night [[Talk show|chat show]], called ''Danny Baker After All'' which borrowed its style from ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', but his style and guests ([[Rick Wakeman]] of prog rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was a regular) did not attract the mainstream audience the slot demanded. Film critic [[Mark Kermode]]'s band The Railtown Bottlers were the show's house band.<ref name=\"railtown\">{{cite news |title=My 20-year love affair with the joy of skiffle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/01/popandrock2|accessdate=20 February 2011 | location=London |newspaper=The Guardian|first=Mark|last=Kermode|date=1 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nLater he fronted television adverts for [[Daz (detergent)|Daz washing powder]] and [[Mars bar]] confectionery. Baker parodied his Daz ads by appearing as himself on the sitcom ''[[Me, You and Him]]''.\n\nDuring this period, Baker began presenting on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]'s ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' football-related phone-in programme as well as the job of presenting ''Match of the Eighties'', a six-part BBC series of football during the [[1980-81 in English football|1980/81]] and [[1985-86 in English football|1985/86]] seasons.\n\nBaker was a writer on Chris Evans' ''[[TFI Friday]]'' show, as well as contributing material for presenters such as [[Angus Deayton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].\n\n====Guest appearances (late 1990s\u20132000s)====\nDuring the late 1990s he made guest appearances on comedy shows including ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' and ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]''. During this period he appeared in the press as a result of nights out with friends [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] and England footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]]. Gascoigne was under media scrutiny for drinking and socialising while preparing for tournaments. After Gascoigne was left out of the [[1998 World Cup]] squad, Baker went on ''Have I Got News For You'' to defend his friend and criticise the omission.\n\nHe also appeared on ''[[The Terry and Gaby Show]]'' from 2003 to 2004 (where he burnt his hand trying to perform a trick with a microwave and a piece of soap) and has appeared on [[BBC Two]] quiz show ''[[QI]]'', becoming the show's first ever winner. Baker worked again with Charles Shaar Murray on the [[Ramones]] documentary ''End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones'', providing an audio commentary.\n\nMore recent TV projects include ''[[The Sitcom Showdown]]'' which began on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UKTV Gold]] in April 2006, a 2014 show featuring archived television footage for BBC4 named ''Brushing Up On...'' and a music discussion show for BBC4 named ''Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades''. He also did ''[[Comic Relief Does The Apprentice]]'' in 2007 for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. He also performed in ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', as the narrator, at the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]] and the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]].\n\nBaker was announced as part of [[BT Sport]]'s football coverage in 2013, hosting a Friday evening show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].<ref name=\"BT Sport\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/03/bt-sport-danny-baker-danny-kelly-premier-league|title=BT Sport to reunite Danny Baker and Danny Kelly for football show|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref> In 2016, [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] hired Baker to work as a writer on the 2016 series of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/81033-chris-evans-hires-top-gear-comedy-writer/|title=Chris Evans hires Top Gear comedy writer|magazine=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=28 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> In November 2016, he entered as a latecomer in [[reality television]] show, ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here]]'', along with [[Martin Roberts (presenter)|Martin Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/imacelebrity/highlights/welcome-to-danny-martin |title=Danny & Martin arrive in Camp |work=ITV.com |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> Baker was the first person to be voted off in the series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Agius|first1=Nicola|title=First I'm A Celebrity elimination results revealed|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/danny-baker-eliminated-im-celebrity-9337687 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=25 November 2016|date=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Radio career===\n====BBC GLR/5 Live/Radio 1 (1989{{ndash}}1997)====\nBaker began his radio career on [[BBC GLR]] in 1989, presenting ''Weekend Breakfast'' from 6{{nbsp}} to 9{{nbsp}}am on Saturdays and Sundays. The show was produced by [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]], who became a good friend to Baker. With GLR eventually opting for a more orthodox breakfast show at weekends, Baker moved to the 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm slot on Sundays.\n\nIn 1990, Baker joined the newly launched [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]], presenting ''Sportscall'', a phone-in sports quiz broadcast every Saturday lunchtime.\n\nFrom October 1991 to October 1992 he presented ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' and, from February 1992 until October 1993, he presented ''Morning Edition'' from 6:30 to 9:30{{nbsp}}am every weekday morning. The show blended Baker's love of unusual trivia with 'grown-up' music. This was where Baker first teamed up with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] and Allis Moss. [[Mark Kermode]] added weekly film reviews, and would later appear with his band 'The Railtown Bottlers' every week on the first series of Baker's TV show.<ref name=\"railtown\" />\n\nBaker joined [[BBC Radio 1]] in October 1993, taking over the weekend mid-morning show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm from [[Dave Lee Travis]] who had resigned on air following the sackings instigated by [[Matthew Bannister]] and [[Trevor Dann]] during the early 1990s. However, due to poor ratings, from November 1994 he was heard on Saturdays only from 10{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon. [[Simon Mayo]] took over Sunday mornings.\n\nBaker's style led to a fall in listeners at Radio 1 but despite his tendering his resignation on at least two occasions, management added extensions to his contract. From October 1995, his Saturday show went out from 12:30 to 2:30{{nbsp}}pm. He left the station in September 1996. His co-hosts during this period included BBC continuity announcer included [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].\n\nWhile continuing with his Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 1]], in 1996 Baker joined [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] to present a Sunday lunchtime show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]], ''Baker & Kelly Upfront''.\n\nOn leaving [[BBC Radio 1]], Baker returned to [[BBC GLR]] to present a three-hour Sunday show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' also returned, now at Saturday lunchtime, while Baker also took on a new show, 'The Baker Line', a Wednesday evening version of the ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' phone-in show.\n\nWhile 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' was light-hearted, 'The Baker Line' was darker and emotionally charged. Baker was at his most outspoken, and in early 1997, he was sacked from [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] when station bosses alleged that he had incited threatening behaviour during an angry outburst about a referee.<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |title=Arts: Danny Baker - 'There's this idea that I talk too much' |newspaper=The Independent |date=13 April 2002 |accessdate=29 August 2011 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123065233/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |archivedate=23 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Talk Radio/Virgin Radio (1998{{ndash}}2000)====\nBaker joined [[TalkSPORT|Talk Radio]] to present a similar football phone-in with Kelly each Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm. A pre-match show was added from 11:30{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. After moving to the Saturday breakfast slot (8{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon), he engineered his own dismissal after a matter of weeks by refusing to centre the show on football, preferring to intersperse chat with his own music selections.\n\nAfter leaving [[talkSPORT|Talk Radio]], he joined [[Virgin Radio (UK)|Virgin Radio]] in early 1999, taking over from [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] on Sundays from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm.\n\nNot long after, Baker was approached by the [[BBC]] and was asked whether he wanted to present a Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Baker turned down the offer by saying \"the time wasn't right\", and the show was given to Ross. Baker also deputised on Virgin's Saturday lunchtime football show from 12 noon to 2{{nbsp}}pm for a handful of shows, alongside [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] until he left the station in 2000.\n\n====BBC London 94.9 (Sep 2001-May 2005 and Oct 2005-Nov 2012)====\nIn September 2001, Baker joined [[BBC London 94.9]] presenting a Saturday morning show from 8 to 11{{nbsp}}am. Just 6 months later, in March 2002, and with a new co-presenting team which included [[Amy Lam\u00e9]], Mark O'Donnell and [[David Kuo (financial adviser)|David Kuo]], he took over the breakfast show from 6 to 9{{nbsp}}am, with a new theme tune in the form of the [[Anthony Newley]] song ''[[The Candy Man]]''.\n\nAlthough not drawing a large listenership, Baker won \"[[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio DJ of the year]]\" for the show. However, the day after winning the award, he announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the month. The last show was on Friday 27 May 2005. On Monday 17 October 2005, after a sabbatical at home, Baker rejoined [[BBC London 94.9]] where he took over the weekday 3 to 5{{nbsp}}pm show from [[Jono Coleman]], who had moved to co-present the breakfast show with former actress [[JoAnne Good]].\n\nHis BBC London 94.9 shows tended to feature off-the-wall phone-ins and discussions with his on-air team, [[Amy Lam\u00e9]] and Baylen Leonard, often regarding music and entertainment nostalgia of the 1960s and 1970s. His interviews focused on off-beat trivia rather than the guests' latest or most famous work, and shows would be interspersed with relatively obscure rock tracks from bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].\n\nThe programme was axed in November 2012 as part of a programme of cuts at the station.

Throughout his career he has largely presented for London's regional radio and television.\n\nBaker was born in [[Deptford]] to a [[working-class]] family and raised in [[Bermondsey]]. From 1977, he wrote for the [[punk zine]] ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', and from there was hired by the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', where he worked as a writer, reviewer, and interviewer. Moving into television in 1980, he began presenting [[London Weekend Television]]'s ''Twentieth Century Box'' and reporting for ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]''. In 1989 he began radio presenting for [[BBC Radio London|BBC GLR]] and in 1990 joined the newly established [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]. In 1997 he was sacked from the latter, accused of inciting threatening behaviour toward a [[association football|football]] referee. That decade, he also began writing for television.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2012 Baker presented the daily morning radio show on [[BBC London 94.9]] and in 2007 also presented the channel's all-day [[podcast]], the ''[[All Day Breakfast Show]]''. Between 2012 and 2017 he published a three-volume [[autobiography]], which was used as the basis for the 2015 BBC [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[Cradle to Grave]]''. In 2019, the BBC [[dismissal (employment)|dismissed]] Baker after he posted a [[Twitter|Tweet]] regarded by many as racist.\n\n== Early life ==\nBaker was born in [[Deptford]] in south east London to Fred \"Spud\" Baker, a [[Stevedore|dockworker]], and Betty, a factory worker.{{cn|date=December 2019}} He grew up in [[Bermondsey]].{{cn|date=December 2019}} He attended [[Rotherhithe]] Primary School and then instead of taking up a [[grammar school]] place he went to the nearby West Greenwich Secondary Boys School, Deptford.<ref name=Autobiography>{{cite book|date=6 November 2012|first=Danny |last=Baker|isbn=978-0297863403|title= Going to Sea in a Sieve: The Autobiography |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson}}</ref> He played truant from the age of 14 to the age of 16 when he could legally leave school.

Baker began working as the office receptionist, but was soon contributing regular articles and reviews before progressing to interviews. He often refers to these times during his [[Radio programming|radio shows]], regularly citing examples of the ridiculous behaviour exhibited by his rock star interviewees.\n\nIn the later 1990s, Baker wrote a weekly sports column for ''[[The Times]]'' and was briefly a columnist for early issues of film magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''.\n\n===Television===\n====Reporting for LWT (1980s)====\nBaker started his TV career in 1980 at [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT), as the presenter of ''Twentieth Century Box'' \u2013 a series of regional documentaries on elements of [[youth culture]] in London, produced by [[Janet Street Porter]]. One edition in the first series documented the burgeoning [[new wave of British heavy metal]] ([[NWOBHM]]) scene, including an early TV appearance of [[Iron Maiden]] performing at [[The Marquee Club]] and interviews with \"[[air guitar]]ists\". Other editions also featured early appearances from the likes of [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Depeche Mode]].\n\nBaker's first mainstream break was as [[wikt:itinerant|roving]] [[reporter]]-[[Television presenter|presenter]] on the [[Michael Aspel]] [[LWT]] regional magazine ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'' alongside former ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' winner and former London [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] driver [[Fred Housego]]. [[Paul Ross]] (brother of Jonathan Ross whom Baker had as his [[best man]]) was his researcher. During his stint on ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'', Baker was filmed having an altercation with a British Rail press officer. This clip is often resurrected for [[clip show]]s and can be seen on YouTube.\n\n====Writing and presenting (early\u2013late 1990s)====\nBaker appeared regularly on LWT's regional output during the 1980s and early 1990s - working on such programmes as ''Six O'Clock Live'', ''Danny Baker's Londoners'', and in 1991, ''The Game'' - a six-part series which featured coverage of teams involved in the fourth division of the East London [[Sunday league football|Sunday Football League]]. The series was later released on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/danny-baker-the-game-football-tv |title=Danny Baker's 'The Game': the best football programme you've never watched |publisher=Shortlist.com |date=25 May 2017 |accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nBaker began writing for television programmes in 1992 after being asked to prepare a piece for one of the first archive clip shows: ''[[TV Hell]]'', which was a collection of the worst TV programmes ever. Since then he has presented television shows such as ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (UK game show)|Win, Lose or Draw]]'', ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'' and ''TV Heroes'', which was a series of 10-minute homages to some of Baker's entertainment idols including [[Fanny Cradock]], [[Peter Glaze]] (from ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]'') and the ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' audience. The episode on the ''Top of the Pops'' audience includes a clip of Baker leaping around to a performance of \"Ooh What A Life\" by the [[Gibson Brothers]] in 1979, captioned as \"Danny Baker's first TV appearance\". \n\nBaker also began a BBC Saturday night [[Talk show|chat show]], called ''Danny Baker After All'' which borrowed its style from ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', but his style and guests ([[Rick Wakeman]] of prog rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was a regular) did not attract the mainstream audience the slot demanded. Film critic [[Mark Kermode]]'s band The Railtown Bottlers were the show's house band.<ref name=\"railtown\">{{cite news |title=My 20-year love affair with the joy of skiffle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/01/popandrock2|accessdate=20 February 2011 | location=London |newspaper=The Guardian|first=Mark|last=Kermode|date=1 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nLater he fronted television adverts for [[Daz (detergent)|Daz washing powder]] and [[Mars bar]] confectionery. Baker parodied his Daz ads by appearing as himself on the sitcom ''[[Me, You and Him]]''.\n\nDuring this period, Baker began presenting on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]'s ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' football-related phone-in programme as well as the job of presenting ''Match of the Eighties'', a six-part BBC series of football during the [[1980-81 in English football|1980/81]] and [[1985-86 in English football|1985/86]] seasons.\n\nBaker was a writer on Chris Evans' ''[[TFI Friday]]'' show, as well as contributing material for presenters such as [[Angus Deayton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].\n\n====Guest appearances (late 1990s\u20132000s)====\nDuring the late 1990s he made guest appearances on comedy shows including ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' and ''[[Room 101 (British TV series)|Room 101]]''. During this period he appeared in the press as a result of nights out with friends [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] and England footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]]. Gascoigne was under media scrutiny for drinking and socialising while preparing for tournaments. After Gascoigne was left out of the [[1998 World Cup]] squad, Baker went on ''Have I Got News For You'' to defend his friend and criticise the omission.\n\nHe also appeared on ''[[The Terry and Gaby Show]]'' from 2003 to 2004 (where he burnt his hand trying to perform a trick with a microwave and a piece of soap) and has appeared on [[BBC Two]] quiz show ''[[QI]]'', becoming the show's first ever winner. Baker worked again with Charles Shaar Murray on the [[Ramones]] documentary ''End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones'', providing an audio commentary.\n\nMore recent TV projects include ''[[The Sitcom Showdown]]'' which began on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UKTV Gold]] in April 2006, a 2014 show featuring archived television footage for BBC4 named ''Brushing Up On...'' and a music discussion show for BBC4 named ''Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades''. He also did ''[[Comic Relief Does The Apprentice]]'' in 2007 for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. He also performed in ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', as the narrator, at the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]] and the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]].\n\nBaker was announced as part of [[BT Sport]]'s football coverage in 2013, hosting a Friday evening show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].<ref name=\"BT Sport\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/03/bt-sport-danny-baker-danny-kelly-premier-league|title=BT Sport to reunite Danny Baker and Danny Kelly for football show|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref> In 2016, [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] hired Baker to work as a writer on the 2016 series of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/81033-chris-evans-hires-top-gear-comedy-writer/|title=Chris Evans hires Top Gear comedy writer|magazine=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=28 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> In November 2016, he entered as a latecomer in [[reality television]] show, ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here]]'', along with [[Martin Roberts (presenter)|Martin Roberts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/imacelebrity/highlights/welcome-to-danny-martin |title=Danny & Martin arrive in Camp |work=ITV.com |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}</ref> Baker was the first person to be voted off in the series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Agius|first1=Nicola|title=First I'm A Celebrity elimination results revealed|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/danny-baker-eliminated-im-celebrity-9337687 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=25 November 2016|date=25 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Radio career===\n====BBC GLR/5 Live/Radio 1 (1989{{ndash}}1997)====\nBaker began his radio career on [[BBC GLR]] in 1989, presenting ''Weekend Breakfast'' from 6{{nbsp}} to 9{{nbsp}}am on Saturdays and Sundays. The show was produced by [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]], who became a good friend to Baker. With GLR eventually opting for a more orthodox breakfast show at weekends, Baker moved to the 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm slot on Sundays.\n\nIn 1990, Baker joined the newly launched [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]], presenting ''Sportscall'', a phone-in sports quiz broadcast every Saturday lunchtime.\n\nFrom October 1991 to October 1992 he presented ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' and, from February 1992 until October 1993, he presented ''Morning Edition'' from 6:30 to 9:30{{nbsp}}am every weekday morning. The show blended Baker's love of unusual trivia with 'grown-up' music. This was where Baker first teamed up with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] and Allis Moss. [[Mark Kermode]] added weekly film reviews, and would later appear with his band 'The Railtown Bottlers' every week on the first series of Baker's TV show.<ref name=\"railtown\" />\n\nBaker joined [[BBC Radio 1]] in October 1993, taking over the weekend mid-morning show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm from [[Dave Lee Travis]] who had resigned on air following the sackings instigated by [[Matthew Bannister]] and [[Trevor Dann]] during the early 1990s. However, due to poor ratings, from November 1994 he was heard on Saturdays only from 10{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon. [[Simon Mayo]] took over Sunday mornings.\n\nBaker's style led to a fall in listeners at Radio 1 but despite his tendering his resignation on at least two occasions, management added extensions to his contract. From October 1995, his Saturday show went out from 12:30 to 2:30{{nbsp}}pm. He left the station in September 1996. His co-hosts during this period included BBC continuity announcer included [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].\n\nWhile continuing with his Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 1]], in 1996 Baker joined [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] to present a Sunday lunchtime show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]], ''Baker & Kelly Upfront''.\n\nOn leaving [[BBC Radio 1]], Baker returned to [[BBC GLR]] to present a three-hour Sunday show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' also returned, now at Saturday lunchtime, while Baker also took on a new show, 'The Baker Line', a Wednesday evening version of the ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' phone-in show.\n\nWhile 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' was light-hearted, 'The Baker Line' was darker and emotionally charged. Baker was at his most outspoken, and in early 1997, he was sacked from [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] when station bosses alleged that he had incited threatening behaviour during an angry outburst about a referee.<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |title=Arts: Danny Baker - 'There's this idea that I talk too much' |newspaper=The Independent |date=13 April 2002 |accessdate=29 August 2011 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123065233/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |archivedate=23 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Talk Radio/Virgin Radio (1998{{ndash}}2000)====\nBaker joined [[TalkSPORT|Talk Radio]] to present a similar football phone-in with Kelly each Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm. A pre-match show was added from 11:30{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. After moving to the Saturday breakfast slot (8{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon), he engineered his own dismissal after a matter of weeks by refusing to centre the show on football, preferring to intersperse chat with his own music selections.\n\nAfter leaving [[talkSPORT|Talk Radio]], he joined [[Virgin Radio (UK)|Virgin Radio]] in early 1999, taking over from [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] on Sundays from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm.\n\nNot long after, Baker was approached by the [[BBC]] and was asked whether he wanted to present a Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Baker turned down the offer by saying \"the time wasn't right\", and the show was given to Ross. Baker also deputised on Virgin's Saturday lunchtime football show from 12 noon to 2{{nbsp}}pm for a handful of shows, alongside [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] until he left the station in 2000.\n\n====BBC London 94.9 (Sep 2001-May 2005 and Oct 2005-Nov 2012)====\nIn September 2001, Baker joined [[BBC London 94.9]] presenting a Saturday morning show from 8 to 11{{nbsp}}am. Just 6 months later, in March 2002, and with a new co-presenting team which included [[Amy Lam\u00e9]], Mark O'Donnell and [[David Kuo (financial adviser)|David Kuo]], he took over the breakfast show from 6 to 9{{nbsp}}am, with a new theme tune in the form of the [[Anthony Newley]] song ''[[The Candy Man]]''.\n\nAlthough not drawing a large listenership, Baker won \"[[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio DJ of the year]]\" for the show. However, the day after winning the award, he announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the month. The last show was on Friday 27 May 2005. On Monday 17 October 2005, after a sabbatical at home, Baker rejoined [[BBC London 94.9]] where he took over the weekday 3 to 5{{nbsp}}pm show from [[Jono Coleman]], who had moved to co-present the breakfast show with former actress [[JoAnne Good]].\n\nHis BBC London 94.9 shows tended to feature off-the-wall phone-ins and discussions with his on-air team, [[Amy Lam\u00e9]] and Baylen Leonard, often regarding music and entertainment nostalgia of the 1960s and 1970s. His interviews focused on off-beat trivia rather than the guests' latest or most famous work, and shows would be interspersed with relatively obscure rock tracks from bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].\n\nThe programme was axed in November 2012 as part of a programme of cuts at the station.

However, based on Ware's \u2018selective\u2019 quotations which we have highlighted earlier in this response we would urge caution and verification that these were indeed uttered by the Imam of the Ka\u2019bah.\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041544/http://www.mcb.org.uk/uploads/Panorama_response.doc\n|archivedate=September 27, 2007\n}}</ref>\nAfter a series of exchanges, the [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' editor, Mike Robinson, posted a response to each of the Muslim Council's allegations, accusing them of \"unwarranted and wildly inaccurate attacks\" and \"bad faith allegations.\"<ref name=BBCresponse>{{cite web\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/4297490.stm\n| title = Response to MCB complaints\n| accessdate = 2007-03-28\n| last = Robinson\n| first = Mike\n| date = September 30, 2005\n| publisher = BBC\n| quote = You have claimed that the programme maligned certain organisations affiliated to the MCB, even though the programme highlighted their sermons, documents and conduct which were sectarian or which demonised other faiths and races, and which were likely to foment division. Such views were either advocated by these affiliates or appeared to be tolerated by them. You have also publicly accused us of being engaged in a \"Witch-hunt against British Muslims.\" I simply cannot accept that highlighting sectarian and racist language amounts to persecution. You have expressed scepticism that Sheikh Al Sudais, who was an honoured guest at the East London Mosque where the MCB's Deputy General Secretary is Chairman, had previously said in Mecca that Jews were \"monkeys and pigs\", \"rats of the world\" and the \"offspring of apes and pigs\"; that Christians were \"cross worshippers\u2026those influenced by the rottenness of their ideas and the poison of their cultures the followers of secularism\", and that Hindus were \"idol worshippers.\" I can assure you that he did.
