In April 1920 the [[British Mandate for Mesopotamia (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] was created under the authority of the [[League of Nations]]. A British-backed monarchy joining these ''vilayets'' into [[Mandatory Iraq|one Kingdom]] was established in 1921 under [[Faisal I of Iraq]].

[[Sargon of Akkad]], originally a [[Rabshakeh]] to a Sumerian king, founded the empire, he conquered all of the city states of southern and central Iraq, and subjugated the kings of Assyria, thus uniting the Sumerians and Akkadians in one state. He then set about expanding his empire, conquering [[Gutium]], [[Elam]] and had victories that did not result into a full conquest against the [[Amorites]] and [[Ebla]]ites of [[Ancient Syria]].\n\nAfter the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the late 22nd century BC, the [[Gutians]] occupied the south for a few decades, while Assyria reasserted its independence in the north. This was followed by a Sumerian renaissance in the form of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The Sumerians under king [[Shulgi]] conquered almost all of Iraq except the northern reaches of Assyria, and asserted themselves over the [[Gutians]], [[Elamites]] and [[Amorites]], destroying the first and holding off the others.\n\nAn [[Elam]]ite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Sumerian revival to an end. By the mid 21st century BC, the Akkadian speaking kingdom of [[Assyria]] had risen to dominance in northern Iraq. Assyria expanded territorially into the north eastern Levant, central Iraq, and eastern Anatolia, forming the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (circa 2035\u20131750 BC) under kings such as [[Puzur-Ashur I]], [[Sargon I]], [[Ilushuma]] and [[Erishum I]], the latter of whom produced the most detailed set of law yet written.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The south broke up into a number of Akkadian speaking states, [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]] being the major ones.\n\nDuring the 20th century BC, the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] speaking [[Amorites]] began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia. Eventually, they began to set up small petty kingdoms in the south, as well as usurping the thrones of extant city states such as [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]].\n\n[[File:F0182 Louvre Code Hammourabi Bas-relief Sb8 rwk.jpg|thumb|[[Hammurabi]], depicted as receiving his royal insignia from [[Shamash]].

It remained insignificant for over a century, overshadowed by older and more powerful states, such as Assyria, Elam, Isin, Ehnunna and Larsa.\n\nIn 1792 BC, an [[Amorite]] ruler named [[Hammurabi]] came to power in this state, and immediately set about building Babylon from a minor town into a major city, declaring himself its king. Hammurabi conquered the whole of southern and central Iraq, as well as Elam to the east and Mari to the west, then engaged in a protracted war with the Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] for domination of the region, creating the short-lived [[Babylonian Empire]]. He eventually prevailed over the successor of Ishme-Dagan and subjected Assyria and its Anatolian colonies.

However, his empire was short-lived, and rapidly collapsed after his death, with both Assyria and southern Iraq, in the form of the [[Sealand Dynasty]], falling back into native Akkadian hands. The foreign Amorites clung on to power in a once more weak and small Babylonia until it was sacked by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Hittite Empire]] based in [[Anatolia]] in 1595 BC. After this, another foreign people, the [[Language Isolate]] speaking [[Kassites]], originating in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Ancient Iran]], seized control of Babylonia, where they were to rule for almost 600 years, by far the longest dynasty ever to rule in Babylon.\n\nIraq was from this point divided into three polities: [[Assyria]] in the north, [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]] in the south central region, and the [[Sealand Dynasty]] in the far south. The Sealand Dynasty was finally conquered by Kassite Babylonia circa 1380 BC.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC) saw Assyria rise to be the most powerful nation in the known world. Beginning with the campaigns of [[Ashur-uballit I]], Assyria destroyed the rival [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire, annexed huge swathes of the [[Hittite Empire]] for itself, annexed northern Babylonia from the Kassites, forced the [[Egyptian Empire]] from the region, and defeated the [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Gutians]], [[Dilmun]]ites and [[Arameans]]. At its height, the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] stretched from [[The Caucasus]] to [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and from the [[Mediterranean]] coasts of [[Phoenicia]] to the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Iran]]. In 1235 BC, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] of Assyria took the throne of [[Babylon]], thus becoming the very first ''native Mesopotamian'' to rule the state.\n\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], bows before Shalmaneser III of [[Assyria]], 825 BC.]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200\u2013900 BC), Babylonia was in a state of chaos, dominated for long periods by Assyria and [[Elam]]. The Kassites were driven from power by Assyria and Elam, allowing native south Mesopotamian kings to rule Babylonia for the first time, although often subject to Assyrian or Elamite rulers. However, these [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] Akkadian kings, were unable to prevent new waves of [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] migrants entering southern Iraq, and during the 11th century BC [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] entered Babylonia from [[The Levant]], and these were followed in the late 10th to early 9th century BC by the migrant [[Chaldea]]ns who were closely related to the earlier [[Arameans]].\n\n==== Iron Age ====\nAfter a period of comparative decline in Assyria, it once more began to expand with the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). This was to be the largest empire the region had yet seen, and under rulers such as [[Adad-Nirari II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Semiramis]], [[Tiglath-pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]] and [[Ashurbanipal]], Iraq became the centre of an empire stretching from [[Persia]], [[Parthia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, to [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west, and from [[The Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]] and [[Arabia]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Arab people|Arabs]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns are first mentioned in written history (circa 850 BC) in the annals of [[Shalmaneser III]].\n\nIt was during this period that an Akkadian influenced form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] was adopted by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of their vast empire, and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia. The descendant dialects of this tongue survive amongst the [[Mandaeans]] of southern Iraq and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of northern Iraq to this day.\n\n[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645\u2013635 BC.]]\nIn the late 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire tore itself apart with a series of brutal civil wars, weakening itself to such a degree that a coalition of its former subjects; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], were able to attack Assyria, finally bringing its empire down by 605 BC.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\n==== Babylonian and Persian periods ====\nThe short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (620\u2013539 BC) succeeded that of Assyria. It failed to attain the size, power or longevity of its predecessor; however, it came to dominate [[The Levant]], [[Canaan]], [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and to defeat [[Egypt]]. Initially, Babylon was ruled by yet another foreign dynasty, that of the [[Chaldea]]ns, who had migrated to the region in the late 10th or early 9th century BC. Its greatest king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], rivalled another non native ruler, the ethnically unrelated [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]], as the greatest king of Babylon. However, by 556 BC, the Chaldeans had been deposed from power by the Assyrian born [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]].\n\nIn the 6th century BC, [[Cyrus the Great]] of neighbouring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] defeated the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Opis]] and Iraq was subsumed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for nearly two centuries. The Achaemenids made [[Babylon]] their main capital. The Chaldeans and Chaldea disappeared at around this time, though both Assyria and Babylonia endured and thrived under Achaemenid rule (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Little changed under the Persians, having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, their kings saw themselves as successors to Ashurbanipal, and they retained Assyrian Imperial Aramaic as the language of empire, together with the Assyrian imperial infrastructure, and an Assyrian style of art and architecture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|left|The Greek-ruled [[Seleucid Empire]] (in yellow) with capital in [[Seleucia]] on the Tigris, north of Babylon.]]\nIn the late 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, putting it under [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule for over two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/research/past-field-projects/seleucia-tigris-iraq-1927-32-1936-37.html |title=Seleucia on the Tigris |publisher=Umich.edu |date=29 December 1927 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref> The Seleucids introduced the [[Indo-Anatolian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''Syria'' to the region.

From [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] invaded western parts of the region [[Roman-Parthian Wars|several times]], briefly founding ''Assyria Provincia'' in Assyria. [[Christianity]] began to take hold in Iraq (particularly in [[Assyria]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and Assyria became a centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], the [[Church of the East]] and [[Syriac literature]]. A number of independent states evolved in the north during the Parthian era, such as [[Adiabene]], [[Assur]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]].\n\nThe [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]] of Persia under [[Ardashir I]] destroyed the Parthian Empire and conquered the region in 224 AD. During the 240s and 250's AD, the Sassanids gradually conquered the independent states, culminating with Assur in 256 AD. The region was thus a province of the [[Sassanid Empire]] for over four centuries, and became the frontier and battle ground between the Sassanid Empire and [[Byzantine Empire]], with both empires weakening each other, paving the way for the [[Arab]]-[[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] at its greatest extent, c. 850.]]\nThe Arab Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century AD established [[Islam]] in Iraq and saw a large influx of [[Arabs]].

In 1466, the [[White Sheep Turkmen]] defeated the Black Sheep and took control. From the earliest 16th century, in 1508, as with all territories of the former White Sheep Turkmen, Iraq fell into the hands of the Iranian [[Safavids]]. Owing to the century long Turco-Iranian rivalry between the Safavids and the neighbouring [[Ottoman Turks]], Iraq would be contested between the two for more than a hundred years during the frequent [[Ottoman-Persian Wars]].\n\nWith the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639, most of the territory of present-day Iraq eventually came under the control of Ottoman Empire as the [[eyalet of Baghdad]] as a result of [[Ottoman-Persian Wars|wars]] with the neighbouring rival, [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Iran]]. Throughout most of the period of Ottoman rule (1533\u20131918), the territory of present-day Iraq was a battle zone between the rival regional empires and tribal alliances.\n\nBy the 17th century, the frequent conflicts with the Safavids had sapped the strength of the Ottoman Empire and had weakened its control over its provinces. The nomadic population swelled with the influx of [[bedouin]]s from [[Najd]], in the Arabian Peninsula.

These three provinces were joined into one Kingdom by the British after the region became a [[League of Nations mandate]], administered under British control, with the name \"[[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|State of Iraq]]\". A fourth province, [[Occupation of Zor|which Iraqi nationalists considered part of Upper Mesopotamia was ultimately added to Syria]].

In Iraq, one of the goals was for education to be universally available for both boys and girls at the primary level. UNICEF collected several pieces of data that indicate whether or not, Iraq has been accomplishing this goal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn general, the education of Iraq has been improving since the MDGs were implemented.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, enrollment numbers nearly doubled from 2000 to 2012.<ref name=\":1\" /> It went from 3.6 million to six million.<ref name=\":1\" /> The latest statistic from 2015\u20132016 showed that almost 9.2 million children were in school.<ref name=\":1\" /> Enrollment rates continue to be on a steady increase at about 4.1% each year.<ref name=\":1\" /> The sheer increase in numbers shows that there are clearly improvements of children in Iraq having access to education.\n\nHowever, the dramatic increase of the number of students in primary education has had some negative and straining effects for the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> The budget for education makes up about only 5.7% of government spending and continues to stay at or below this percentage.<ref name=\":1\" /> Investments for schools has also been on the decline.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, the country now ranks at the bottom of Middle East countries in terms of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> The little funding for education makes it more difficult to improve the quality and resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt the same time, UNICEF investigated portions of spending for education and found that some of the money has gone to waste.<ref name=\":1\" /> They found that dropout rates are increasing as well as repetition rates for children.<ref name=\":1\" /> In both Iraq Centre and KRI, the rates for dropouts are about 1.5% to 2.5%.<ref name=\":1\" /> Within these dropout rates, there is also an uneven number among boys and girls who dropout.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the rate for dropouts for boys was around 16.5%, girls were at 20.1% where it could be due to economic or family reasons.<ref name=\":1\" /> For repetition rates, percentages have almost reached 17% among all students.<ref name=\":1\" /> To put the money loss in perspective, about $1,100 is spent on each student.<ref name=\":1\" /> For each student who drops out or repeats a grade, $1,100 is lost.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, almost 20% of the funding for education was lost to dropouts and repetition for the year 2014\u20132015.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany of those people who dropout or have to repeat a grade do not see the economic cost for long term results.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF takes note of how staying in school can in fact, increase wealth for the person and their family.<ref name=\":1\" /> While it may put a strain on the education system, it will also hinder the chances of a person receiving higher earnings in whatever career they go into.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther statistics show that regional differences can attribute to lower or higher enrollment rates for children in primary education.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, UNICEF found that areas with conflict like Salah al-Din have \u201cmore than 90% of school-age children\u201d not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, some schools were converted into refugee shelters or military bases in 2014 as conflict began to increase.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite

/> Depending on where children live, they may or may not have the same access to education as other children.\n\nThere are also the differing enrollment rates between boys and girls.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF found that in 2013\u20132014, enrollment numbers for boys was at about five million while girls were at about 4.2 million.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the out-of-school rate for girls is at about 11%, boys are at less than half of that.<ref name=\":1\" /> There is still a gap between boys and girls in terms of educational opportunities.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the rate of enrollments for girls has been increasing at a higher rate than for boys.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2015\u20132016, the enrollment numbers for girls increased by 400,000 from the previous year where a large number of them were located in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> Not only that, UNICEF found that the increase of girls going to school was across all levels of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the unequal enrollment numbers between boys and girls could potentially change so that universal education can be achieved by all at equal rates.\n\nAlthough the numbers suggest a dramatic increase of enrollment rates for primary education in total, a large number of children still remain out of the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many of these children fall under the category of internally displaced children due to the conflict in Syria and the takeover by ISIL.<ref name=\":1\" /> This causes a disruption for children who are attempting to go to school and holds them back from completing their education, no matter what level they are at.<ref name=\":1\" /> Internally displaced children are specifically recorded to track children who have been forced to move within their country due to these types of conflicts. About 355,000 of internally displaced children are not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> 330,000 of those children live in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rates among internally displaced children continue to remain higher in Iraq Centre than other areas such as the KRI.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the overall increase of enrollment rates, there continues to be a large strain on the resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF notes that without an increase on expenditures for education, the quality of education will continue to decrease.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early in the 2000s, the UNESCO International Bureau of Education found that the education system in Iraq had issues with standard-built school buildings, having enough teachers, implementing a standardized curricula, textbooks and technologies that are needed to help reach its educational goals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Teachers are important resources that are starting to become more and more strained with the rising number of students.<ref name=\":1\" /> Iraq Centre has a faster enrollment growth rate than teacher growth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Teachers begin to have to take in more and more students which can produce a bigger strain on the teacher and quality of education the children receive.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another large resource for education is libraries that can increase literacy and create a

[[Sargon of Akkad]], originally a [[Rabshakeh]] to a Sumerian king, founded the empire, he conquered all of the city states of southern and central Iraq, and subjugated the kings of Assyria, thus uniting the Sumerians and Akkadians in one state. He then set about expanding his empire, conquering [[Gutium]], [[Elam]] and had victories that did not result into a full conquest against the [[Amorites]] and [[Ebla]]ites of [[Ancient Syria]].\n\nAfter the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the late 22nd century BC, the [[Gutians]] occupied the south for a few decades, while Assyria reasserted its independence in the north. This was followed by a Sumerian renaissance in the form of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The Sumerians under king [[Shulgi]] conquered almost all of Iraq except the northern reaches of Assyria, and asserted themselves over the [[Gutians]], [[Elamites]] and [[Amorites]], destroying the first and holding off the others.\n\nAn [[Elam]]ite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Sumerian revival to an end. By the mid 21st century BC, the Akkadian speaking kingdom of [[Assyria]] had risen to dominance in northern Iraq. Assyria expanded territorially into the north eastern Levant, central Iraq, and eastern Anatolia, forming the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (circa 2035\u20131750 BC) under kings such as [[Puzur-Ashur I]], [[Sargon I]], [[Ilushuma]] and [[Erishum I]], the latter of whom produced the most detailed set of law yet written.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The south broke up into a number of Akkadian speaking states, [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]] being the major ones.\n\nDuring the 20th century BC, the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] speaking [[Amorites]] began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia.

It remained insignificant for over a century, overshadowed by older and more powerful states, such as Assyria, Elam, Isin, Ehnunna and Larsa.\n\nIn 1792 BC, an [[Amorite]] ruler named [[Hammurabi]] came to power in this state, and immediately set about building Babylon from a minor town into a major city, declaring himself its king. Hammurabi conquered the whole of southern and central Iraq, as well as Elam to the east and Mari to the west, then engaged in a protracted war with the Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] for domination of the region, creating the short-lived [[Babylonian Empire]]. He eventually prevailed over the successor of Ishme-Dagan and subjected Assyria and its Anatolian colonies.

However, his empire was short-lived, and rapidly collapsed after his death, with both Assyria and southern Iraq, in the form of the [[Sealand Dynasty]], falling back into native Akkadian hands. The foreign Amorites clung on to power in a once more weak and small Babylonia until it was sacked by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Hittite Empire]] based in [[Anatolia]] in 1595 BC. After this, another foreign people, the [[Language Isolate]] speaking [[Kassites]], originating in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Ancient Iran]], seized control of Babylonia, where they were to rule for almost 600 years, by far the longest dynasty ever to rule in Babylon.\n\nIraq was from this point divided into three polities: [[Assyria]] in the north, [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]] in the south central region, and the [[Sealand Dynasty]] in the far south. The Sealand Dynasty was finally conquered by Kassite Babylonia circa 1380 BC.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC) saw Assyria rise to be the most powerful nation in the known world. Beginning with the campaigns of [[Ashur-uballit I]], Assyria destroyed the rival [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire, annexed huge swathes of the [[Hittite Empire]] for itself, annexed northern Babylonia from the Kassites, forced the [[Egyptian Empire]] from the region, and defeated the [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Gutians]], [[Dilmun]]ites and [[Arameans]]. At its height, the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] stretched from [[The Caucasus]] to [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and from the [[Mediterranean]] coasts of [[Phoenicia]] to the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Iran]]. In 1235 BC, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] of Assyria took the throne of [[Babylon]], thus becoming the very first ''native Mesopotamian'' to rule the state.\n\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], bows before Shalmaneser III of [[Assyria]], 825 BC.]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200\u2013900 BC), Babylonia was in a state of chaos, dominated for long periods by Assyria and [[Elam]]. The Kassites were driven from power by Assyria and Elam, allowing native south Mesopotamian kings to rule Babylonia for the first time, although often subject to Assyrian or Elamite rulers. However, these [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] Akkadian kings, were unable to prevent new waves of [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] migrants entering southern Iraq, and during the 11th century BC [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] entered Babylonia from [[The Levant]], and these were followed in the late 10th to early 9th century BC by the migrant [[Chaldea]]ns who were closely related to the earlier [[Arameans]].\n\n==== Iron Age ====\nAfter a period of comparative decline in Assyria, it once more began to expand with the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). This was to be the largest empire the region had yet seen, and under rulers such as [[Adad-Nirari II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Semiramis]], [[Tiglath-pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]] and [[Ashurbanipal]], Iraq became the centre of an empire stretching from [[Persia]], [[Parthia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, to [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west, and from [[The Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]] and [[Arabia]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Arab people|Arabs]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns are first mentioned in written history (circa 850 BC) in the annals of [[Shalmaneser III]].\n\nIt was during this period that an Akkadian influenced form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] was adopted by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of their vast empire, and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia. The descendant dialects of this tongue survive amongst the [[Mandaeans]] of southern Iraq and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of northern Iraq to this day.\n\n[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645\u2013635 BC.]]\nIn the late 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire tore itself apart with a series of brutal civil wars, weakening itself to such a degree that a coalition of its former subjects; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], were able to attack Assyria, finally bringing its empire down by 605 BC.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\n==== Babylonian and Persian periods ====\nThe short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (620\u2013539 BC) succeeded that of Assyria. It failed to attain the size, power or longevity of its predecessor; however, it came to dominate [[The Levant]], [[Canaan]], [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and to defeat [[Egypt]]. Initially, Babylon was ruled by yet another foreign dynasty, that of the [[Chaldea]]ns, who had migrated to the region in the late 10th or early 9th century BC. Its greatest king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], rivalled another non native ruler, the ethnically unrelated [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]], as the greatest king of Babylon. However, by 556 BC, the Chaldeans had been deposed from power by the Assyrian born [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]].\n\nIn the 6th century BC, [[Cyrus the Great]] of neighbouring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] defeated the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Opis]] and Iraq was subsumed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for nearly two centuries. The Achaemenids made [[Babylon]] their main capital. The Chaldeans and Chaldea disappeared at around this time, though both Assyria and Babylonia endured and thrived under Achaemenid rule (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Little changed under the Persians, having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, their kings saw themselves as successors to Ashurbanipal, and they retained Assyrian Imperial Aramaic as the language of empire, together with the Assyrian imperial infrastructure, and an Assyrian style of art and architecture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|left|The Greek-ruled [[Seleucid Empire]] (in yellow) with capital in [[Seleucia]] on the Tigris, north of Babylon.]]\nIn the late 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, putting it under [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule for over two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/research/past-field-projects/seleucia-tigris-iraq-1927-32-1936-37.html |title=Seleucia on the Tigris |publisher=Umich.edu |date=29 December 1927 |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref> The Seleucids introduced the [[Indo-Anatolian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''Syria'' to the region.

From [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] invaded western parts of the region [[Roman-Parthian Wars|several times]], briefly founding ''Assyria Provincia'' in Assyria. [[Christianity]] began to take hold in Iraq (particularly in [[Assyria]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and Assyria became a centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], the [[Church of the East]] and [[Syriac literature]]. A number of independent states evolved in the north during the Parthian era, such as [[Adiabene]], [[Assur]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]].\n\nThe [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]] of Persia under [[Ardashir I]] destroyed the Parthian Empire and conquered the region in 224 AD. During the 240s and 250's AD, the Sassanids gradually conquered the independent states, culminating with Assur in 256 AD. The region was thus a province of the [[Sassanid Empire]] for over four centuries, and became the frontier and battle ground between the Sassanid Empire and [[Byzantine Empire]], with both empires weakening each other, paving the way for the [[Arab]]-[[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|left|upright=1.35|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] at its greatest extent, c. 850.]]\nThe Arab Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century AD established [[Islam]] in Iraq and saw a large influx of [[Arabs]].

Unlike other poorer countries, which focused on mass health care using primary care practitioners, Iraq developed a Westernized system of sophisticated hospitals with advanced medical procedures, provided by specialist physicians.

In Iraq, one of the goals was for education to be universally available for both boys and girls at the primary level. UNICEF collected several pieces of data that indicate whether or not, Iraq has been accomplishing this goal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn general, the education of Iraq has been improving since the MDGs were implemented.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, enrollment numbers nearly doubled from 2000 to 2012.<ref name=\":1\" /> It went from 3.6 million to six million.<ref name=\":1\" /> The latest statistic from 2015\u20132016 showed that almost 9.2 million children were in school.<ref name=\":1\" /> Enrollment rates continue to be on a steady increase at about 4.1% each year.<ref name=\":1\" /> The sheer increase in numbers shows that there are clearly improvements of children in Iraq having access to education.\n\nHowever, the dramatic increase of the number of students in primary education has had some negative and straining effects for the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> The budget for education makes up about only 5.7% of government spending and continues to stay at or below this percentage.<ref name=\":1\" /> Investments for schools has also been on the decline.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, the country now ranks at the bottom of Middle East countries in terms of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> The little funding for education makes it more difficult to improve the quality and resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt the same time, UNICEF investigated portions of spending for education and found that some of the money has gone to waste.<ref name=\":1\" /> They found that dropout rates are increasing as well as repetition rates for children.<ref name=\":1\" /> In both Iraq Centre and KRI, the rates for dropouts are about 1.5% to 2.5%.<ref name=\":1\" /> Within these dropout rates, there is also an uneven number among boys and girls who dropout.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the rate for dropouts for boys was around 16.5%, girls were at 20.1% where it could be due to economic or family reasons.<ref name=\":1\" /> For repetition rates, percentages have almost reached 17% among all students.<ref name=\":1\" /> To put the money loss in perspective, about $1,100 is spent on each student.<ref name=\":1\" /> For each student who drops out or repeats a grade, $1,100 is lost.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, almost 20% of the funding for education was lost to dropouts and repetition for the year 2014\u20132015.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany of those people who dropout or have to repeat a grade do not see the economic cost for long term results.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF takes note of how staying in school can in fact, increase wealth for the person and their family.<ref name=\":1\" /> While it may put a strain on the education system, it will also hinder the chances of a person receiving higher earnings in whatever career they go into.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther statistics show that regional differences can attribute to lower or higher enrollment rates for children in primary education.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, UNICEF found that areas with conflict like Salah al-Din have \u201cmore than 90% of school-age children\u201d not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, some schools were converted into refugee shelters or military bases in 2014 as conflict began to increase.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite

/> Depending on where children live, they may or may not have the same access to education as other children.\n\nThere are also the differing enrollment rates between boys and girls.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF found that in 2013\u20132014, enrollment numbers for boys was at about five million while girls were at about 4.2 million.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the out-of-school rate for girls is at about 11%, boys are at less than half of that.<ref name=\":1\" /> There is still a gap between boys and girls in terms of educational opportunities.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the rate of enrollments for girls has been increasing at a higher rate than for boys.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2015\u20132016, the enrollment numbers for girls increased by 400,000 from the previous year where a large number of them were located in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> Not only that, UNICEF found that the increase of girls going to school was across all levels of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the unequal enrollment numbers between boys and girls could potentially change so that universal education can be achieved by all at equal rates.\n\nAlthough the numbers suggest a dramatic increase of enrollment rates for primary education in total, a large number of children still remain out of the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many of these children fall under the category of internally displaced children due to the conflict in Syria and the takeover by ISIL.<ref name=\":1\" /> This causes a disruption for children who are attempting to go to school and holds them back from completing their education, no matter what level they are at.<ref name=\":1\" /> Internally displaced children are specifically recorded to track children who have been forced to move within their country due to these types of conflicts. About 355,000 of internally displaced children are not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> 330,000 of those children live in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rates among internally displaced children continue to remain higher in Iraq Centre than other areas such as the KRI.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the overall increase of enrollment rates, there continues to be a large strain on the resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF notes that without an increase on expenditures for education, the quality of education will continue to decrease.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early in the 2000s, the UNESCO International Bureau of Education found that the education system in Iraq had issues with standard-built school buildings, having enough teachers, implementing a standardized curricula, textbooks and technologies that are needed to help reach its educational goals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Teachers are important resources that are starting to become more and more strained with the rising number of students.<ref name=\":1\" /> Iraq Centre has a faster enrollment growth rate than teacher growth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Teachers begin to have to take in more and more students which can produce a bigger strain on the teacher and quality of education the children receive.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another large resource for education is libraries that can increase literacy and create a

{"title_page": "History of the Kingdom of Dahomey", "text_new": "{{History of Benin}}\nThe '''History of the Kingdom of Dahomey''' spans 300 years from around 1600 until 1904 with the rise of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] as a major power on the Atlantic coast of modern-day [[Benin]] until French conquest.  The kingdom became a major regional power in the 1720s when it conquered the coastal kingdoms of [[Allada]] and [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]].  With control over these key coastal cities, Dahomey became a major center in the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] until 1852 when the British imposed a naval blockade to stop the trade.  War with the French began in 1892 and the French took over the Kingdom of Dahomey in 1894.  The throne was vacated by the French in 1900, but the royal families and key administrative positions of the administration continued to have a large impact in the politics of the French administration and the post-independence [[Republic of Dahomey]], renamed [[Benin]] in 1975.  [[Historiography]] of the kingdom has had a significant impact on work far beyond African history and the history of the kingdom forms the backdrop for a number of novels and plays.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Royaume du Danhom\u00e8 1894.svg|thumb|Kingdom of Dahomey around 1894]]\n\n===Before the Kingdom of Dahomey===\nPrior to the centralization of the kingdom of Dahomey, the evidence suggests that the Abomey plateau was settled by a number of small tribes, commonly known as the Gedevi. However, because of a lack of resources and access to the key trade routes in the region, the plateau was very poor compared to the surrounding areas.<ref name=Halcrow>{{cite book|last=Halcrow|first=Elizabeth M.|title=Canes and Chains: A Study of Sugar and Slavery|year=1982|publisher=Heinemann Educational Publishing|location=Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MMVF71JsLpEC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> To the east of the Abomey plateau, the [[Oyo Empire]] (in present-day [[Nigeria]]) was at the peak of its power and exercised some [[hegemony]] over the tribes in the area.

According to this story, there was a [[Fon people|Fon]] prince named Agassu in the city of [[Tado]] who tried to become king but lost the struggle and took over the city of Allada instead.  Around 1600, two (in some versions three) princes in Agassu's lineage fought over who would be the ruler of Allada.<ref name=Halcrow /> It was decided that both princes would leave the town and found new kingdoms with Teagbanlin going south and founding the city that would become [[Porto-Novo]] and [[Do-Aklin]] moving to the Abomey plateau to the north (Porto-Novo and the Kingdom of Dahomey remained rivals for much of history).<ref name=Monroe /> [[Do-Aklin|Do-Aklin's]] son [[Dakodonu]] was granted permission to settle in the area by the Gedevi chiefs in [[Abomey]].  However, when Dakodonu requested additional land from a prominent chief named Dan the relationship grew hostile. The chief responded to Dakodonu, with sarcasm, \"Should I open up my belly and build you a house in it?\"  Dakodonu killed Dan on the spot and ordered that his new palace be built on the site and derived the kingdom's name from the incident (this may be a [[false etymology]]<ref name=Bay-1998 />): Dan=chief, xo=Belly, me=Inside of.<ref name=Monroe />\n\n===Rise and expansion (1600-1740)===\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; width:300px; margin:0.5em 0 1em 1em; background:White; border:1px #aaa solid; border-collapse:collapse; font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"|<big><big>Kingdom of Dahomey Timeline</big></big>\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|c. 1600 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|According to oral tradition, [[Dakodonou]] establishes palace in Abomey.\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1724-1727 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|[[Agaja]] conquers [[Allada]] and [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]].\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1730 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|Dahomey loses war with the [[Oyo Empire]] becoming a tributary.\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1823 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|King [[Ghezo]] defeats Oyo in war and ends tributary status of Dahomey.\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1851-1852 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|British put naval blockade on Dahomey ports stopping the slave trade.\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1892-1894 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|[[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] leads to colonization of Kingdom of Dahomey.\n|-\n|style=\"font-size:80%; text-align:center;\"|1900 AD\n|style=\"font-size: 80%;\"|French exile [[Agoli-agbo]] formally ending the Kingdom of Dahomey.\n|}\n{{Further|Agaja}}\nThe empire was established in about 1600 by the [[Fon people]] who had recently settled in the area (or were possibly a result of intermarriage between the [[Aja people]] and the Gedevi).  The Palace in [[Abomey]] was established in the early 17th century.  The foundational king of the Kingdom of Dahomey is often considered [[Houegbadja]] (c.1645-1685) who built the [[Royal Palaces of Abomey]] and began raiding and taking over towns outside of the Abomey plateau.<ref name=Halcrow /><ref name=Bay-1998 />  At the same time, the slave trade began increasing in size in the coastal region through the Kingdom of Whydah and Allada and trade with the Portuguese, Dutch, and British.

By 1720, King Agaja repudiated the kingdom's allegiance to Allada and began increasing military activity throughout the region.  In 1724, Agaja offered his military to help with a succession struggle within Allada.<ref name=Law-1986 />  However, he turned his forces on the army of Allada and took over the city, relocating his capital from Abomey to Allada.<ref name=\"Monroe\"/>  In 1727, Agaja took over the city of Whydah and thus became the primary force on a major part of the coast.<ref name=Halcrow />  In 1729, Agaja began war against the Oyo Empire with a number of cross-border raids.<ref name=Alpern>{{cite journal|last=Alpern|first=Stanley B.|title=On the Origins of the Amazons of Dahomey|journal=History in Africa|year=1998|volume=25|pages=9\u201325|doi=10.2307/3172178}}</ref>  During the war, the royal family of Whydah returned to the throne forcing Agaja to fight to reclaim the city.  He moved much of his army with a significant portion in the back composed of women dressed like male warriors (this is possibly the beginning of the [[Dahomey Amazons]]).  The Whydah royal family had assumed that the Dahomey army had been weakened in the war with Oyo and, upon seeing such a large force, fled from the city.<ref name=Alpern />  In 1730 the war with Oyo ended and Dahomey retained domestic control but became a tributary of the Oyo empire.<ref name=Law-1986 />  By the end of Agaja's reign, the Kingdom of Dahomey occupied significant area, particularly the crucial coastal slave trade cities.  At the same time, Agaja created much of the administrative apparatus of the kingdom and instituted the key ceremony of the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]], or ''Xwetanu'' in Fon.\n\n===Regional power (1740-1852)===\n[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were a significant part of the military and royal bodyguard of the Kingdom of Dahomey]]\nFollowing the death of Agaja in 1740, the empire was defined by significant political struggle (although limited largely to within the palace walls) and deepening engagement with the slave trade.   There was a significant succession fight after Agaja's death when the recognized heir was passed over for [[Tegbessou]] (who ruled from 1740-1774).<ref name=Monroe />  Tegbessou moved the capital city back to Abomey but had to deal with a number of different factions in the powerful members of the kingdom and in keeping conquered territories loyal.<ref name=Monroe /> At the same time, the empire continued slave raids throughout the region and became a major supplier to the [[Atlantic slave trade]].

As a result, Ghezo named de Sousa the ''chacha'' or viceroy of trade in Whydah providing him with significantly more power and money (the title ''chacha'' remains an important honorary position in Whydah to this day).  In 1823, Ghezo led armies against Oyo and was this time able to end the tributary status of Dahomey and permanently weaken Oyo.<ref name=Law-1986 />\n\n===Suppression of the slave trade (1852-1880)===\nTwo major changes occurred in the 1840s and 1850s which significantly altered politics in Dahomey.  First, the British who had been a major purchaser of slaves began taking an active stance in [[Slavery in the British Isles|abolishing the slave trade]] in the 1830s.  They sent multiple diplomatic parties to Ghezo to try to convince him to end Dahomey's participation in the trade, all of these were rebuffed with Ghezo worried of the political consequences of ending such trade.<ref name=Law-1997 />  Second, the city of [[Abeokuta]] was founded in 1825 and rose to prominence as a safe haven for people to be safe from the slave raids by Dahomey.  In 1844, Dahomey and Abeokuta went to war and Abeokuta was victorious.  Other violence in the early 1850s further cemented Abeokuta's challenge to Dahomey's economic control in the region.<ref name=Yoder />\n\nInternally, the pressure resulted in a number of changes.  Ghezo rejected British requests for ending the slave trade, but at the same time began expanded significantly the palm oil trade as an economic alternative.<ref name=Law-1997/>  Politically, the debate became centered around two political factions: the Elephant and the Fly.  The Elephant, connected with Ghezo, high-profile political leaders, and the creole slave traders like the family of De Sousa, pushed for continued activity in the slave trade and resistance to British pressure.  The Fly faction, in contrast, was a loose collection of palm oil producers and some chieftains, which supported accommodation with Abeokuta and the British in order to expand palm oil trade.<ref name=Yoder />  At the policy and war debates held at the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]] these two factions held a number of tense discussions about the future of the Kingdom of Dahomey.<ref name=Yoder />\n\nIn 1851\u20131852, the British imposed a naval blockade on the ports of Dahomey in order to force them to end the slave trade.  In January 1852, Ghezo accepted a treaty with the British ending the export of slaves from Dahomey.<ref name=Law-1997 />  In the same year and the following one, Ghezo suspended large-scale military campaigns and human sacrifice in the kingdom. However political pressure contributed to the resumption of slave trading and large scale military action in 1857 and 1858.<ref name=Law-1997 />  Ghezo was assassinated by a sniper associated with Abeokuta and large scale warfare between the two states resumed in 1864.<ref name=Yoder />  This one ended again in the favor of Abeokuta and the result was that the slave trade could not be significantly reestablished to its 1850 level.

B\u00e9hanzin renounced the treaty with France providing them with the city of Cotonou and began raiding the possessions.  The hostility hit a high point when B\u00e9hanzin began conducting slave raids in French protectorates along the coast, namely [[Grand-Popo]], in 1891.  That year, the French military decided that a military takeover was the only solution and placed General [[Alfred-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Dodds]] in charge of the operation to commence in 1892.\n\nThe [[Second Franco-Dahomean War|Franco-Dahomean War]] lasted from 1892 until January 1894 when Dodds captured the city of Abomey (January 15) and King B\u00e9hanzin (January 25).  Notable during the war was the defeat of the [[Dahomey Amazons]] in November 1892. Dodds named [[Agoli-agbo]] the new king of Dahomey, largely because he was seen as the most malleable of the alternatives, and exiled B\u00e9hanzin to French possessions in the Caribbean.<ref name=Newbury />  The French began changing key aspects of administration and politics in the Kingdom of Dahomey.  In 1899, the French instituted a new poll tax which was highly unpopular and Agoli-Agbo opposed the tax causing serious political problems in the protectorate.  As a result, on February 17, 1900, the French deposed Agoli-Agbo and ended the Kingdom of Dahomey.<ref name=Newbury />  The French though brought together many key members of the kingdom as the chiefs of [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]].

Many of the early histories and descriptions were written by slave traders and the conclusions were that the slave trade was a process of freeing the population from the highly militarized, very brutal, and despotic Kingdom of Dahomey. [[William Snelgrave]] and [[Archibald Dalzel]] wrote key histories and memoirs of Dahomey presenting the case for the slave trade to save the population from human sacrifice. [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] historians, in contrast, argued that the brutality of the Dahomey state was the result of the slave trade itself.<ref name=Law-1986 />  Dahomey was thus portrayed with a host of very negative stereotypes, with significant exaggeration, by European historians in the 18th and 19th century.<ref name=Bay-1998>{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref>  With increasing debates about the morality or immorality of the slave trade, Dahomey became a key aspect of the debate with significant attention.<ref name=Law-1986 />\n\nThe key role of Dahomey with the slave trade had a significant impact on a range of other scholars.

''[[In Dahomey]]'' (1903) was a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century.   Novelist [[Paul Hazoum\u00e9|Paul Hazoum\u00e9's]] first novel ''Doguicimi'' (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during King [[Ghezo]]. American novelist [[Frank Yerby]] published a historical novel set partially in Dahomey titled ''[[The Man From Dahomey]]'' (1971).  British author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] published ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' (1971), the third novel in ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' series that was set in Dahomey during the slave trade. [[Bruce Chatwin|Bruce Chatwin's]] historical novel [[The Viceroy of Ouidah]] (1980) is largely based around Francisco Felix de Sousa, the slave trader who helped bring King Ghezo to power.  The book resulted in the film adaptation ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987) by [[Werner Herzog]].

The kingdom became a major regional power in the 1720s when it conquered the coastal kingdoms of [[Allada]] and [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]].  With control over these key coastal cities, Dahomey became a major center in the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]] until 1852 when the British imposed a naval blockade to stop the trade.  War with the French began in 1892 and the French took over the Kingdom of Dahomey in 1894.  The throne was vacated by the French in 1900, but the royal families and key administrative positions of the administration continued to have a large impact in the politics of the French administration and the post-independence [[Republic of Dahomey]], renamed [[Benin]] in 1975.

In January 1852, Ghezo accepted a treaty with the British ending the export of slaves from Dahomey.<ref name=Law-1997 />  In the same year and the following one, Ghezo suspended large-scale military campaigns and human sacrifice in the kingdom. However political pressure contributed to the resumption of slave trading and large scale military action in 1857 and 1858.<ref name=Law-1997 />  Ghezo was assassinated by a sniper associated with Abeokuta and large scale warfare between the two states resumed in 1864.<ref name=Yoder />  This one ended again in the favor of Abeokuta and the result was that the slave trade could not be significantly reestablished to its 1850 level.

B\u00e9hanzin renounced the treaty with France providing them with the city of Cotonou and began raiding the possessions.  The hostility hit a high point when B\u00e9hanzin began conducting slave raids in French protectorates along the coast, namely [[Grand-Popo]], in 1891.  That year, the French military decided that a military takeover was the only solution and placed General [[Alfred-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Dodds]] in charge of the operation to commence in 1892.\n\nThe [[Second Franco-Dahomean War|Franco-Dahomean War]] lasted from 1892 until January 1894 when Dodds captured the city of Abomey (January 15) and King B\u00e9hanzin (January 25).  Notable during the war was the defeat of the [[Dahomey Amazons]] in November 1892. Dodds named [[Agoli-agbo]] the new king of Dahomey, largely because he was seen as the most malleable of the alternatives, and exiled B\u00e9hanzin to French possessions in the Caribbean.<ref name=Newbury />  The French began changing key aspects of administration and politics in the Kingdom of Dahomey.  In 1899, the French instituted a new poll tax which was highly unpopular and Agoli-Agbo opposed the tax causing serious political problems in the protectorate.  As a result, on February 17, 1900, the French deposed Agoli-Agbo and ended the Kingdom of Dahomey.<ref name=Newbury />  The French though brought together many key members of the kingdom as the chiefs of [[Canton (country subdivision)|cantons]].

Many of the early histories and descriptions were written by slave traders and the conclusions were that the slave trade was a process of freeing the population from the highly militarized, very brutal, and despotic Kingdom of Dahomey. [[William Snelgrave]] and [[Archibald Dalzel]] wrote key histories and memoirs of Dahomey presenting the case for the slave trade to save the population from human sacrifice. [[Abolitionism|Abolitionist]] historians, in contrast, argued that the brutality of the Dahomey state was the result of the slave trade itself.<ref name=Law-1986 />  Dahomey was thus portrayed with a host of very negative stereotypes, with significant exaggeration, by European historians in the 18th and 19th century.<ref name=Bay-1998>{{cite book|last=Bay|first=Edna|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|year=1998|publisher=University of Virginia Press}}</ref>  With increasing debates about the morality or immorality of the slave trade, Dahomey became a key aspect of the debate with significant attention.<ref name=Law-1986 />\n\nThe key role of Dahomey with the slave trade had a significant impact on a range of other scholars.  Philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] used the funeral ceremonies after the death of the King of Dahomey in his [[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]] (1837).  [[Karl Polanyi|Karl Polanyi's]] last written book ''Dahomey and the Slave Trade'' (1966) explored the economic relationships in the kingdom.<ref name=Law-1986 />\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:PAUL DUNBAR IN DAHOMEY IN LONDON 1904.jpg|thumb|right|The poster announcing the London premiere of ''In Dahomey'' at the Shafesbury Theatre, 1903.]]\nThe Kingdom of Dahomey has been depicted in a number of different literary works of [[fiction]] or [[creative nonfiction]]. ''[[In Dahomey]]'' (1903) was a successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical, the first full-length Broadway musical written entirely by African Americans, in the early 20th century.   Novelist [[Paul Hazoum\u00e9|Paul Hazoum\u00e9's]] first novel ''Doguicimi'' (1938) was based on decades of research into the oral traditions of the Kingdom of Dahomey during King [[Ghezo]]. American novelist [[Frank Yerby]] published a historical novel set partially in Dahomey titled ''[[The Man From Dahomey]]'' (1971).  British author [[George MacDonald Fraser]] published ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' (1971), the third novel in ''[[The Flashman Papers]]'' series that was set in Dahomey during the slave trade. [[Bruce Chatwin|Bruce Chatwin's]] historical novel [[The Viceroy of Ouidah]] (1980) is largely based around Francisco Felix de Sousa, the slave trader who helped bring King Ghezo to power.  The book resulted in the film adaptation ''[[Cobra Verde]]'' (1987) by [[Werner Herzog]].  [[Ben Okri|Ben Okri's]] novel ''[[The Famished Road]]'' (1991), which won the [[Man Booker Prize]], tells the story of a person caught in the slave trade through Dahomey.\n\nBehanzin's resistance to the French has been central to a number of works.

The unification of Egypt brought [[Amun]] (the tribal god of the region) increased power and wealth, and he was [[syncretism|gradually merged]] with the sun god [[R\u00ea]], to become [[Amun#Sun God|Amun-Re]]. The [[White Chapel]] of [[Senusret I]] and the [[Precinct of Amun-Re#Middle Kingdom court|Middle Kingdom court]] are the earliest remains of buildings within the temple area.<ref>Blyth, 1996, p.10</ref> Close to the Sacred Lake, excavations have located a planned settlement.<ref>Kemp, 1989 , p.188</ref>\n\nThe major construction of this era was the laying out of the [[Precinct of Amun-Re#Middle Kingdom court|Middle Kingdom court]],\n\n==New Kingdom==\nThe [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] saw the relatively modest temple expanded into a huge state religious centre, as the wealth of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] increased.\n\n===Eighteenth Dynasty===\n[[Image:Maxime Du Camp - Pfeiler von Karnak, 1850.jpg|thumb|Stele of Karnak, taken by [[Maxime Du Camp]], around 1850]]\n\nMajor expansion of the temple complex took place during the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] dynasty.<ref name=\"strdwick51\">Strudwick & Strudwick (1999), p.51</ref> [[Amenhotep I]] constructed a barque shrine and a gateway.<ref name=\"strdwick51\"/> [[Thutmose I]] erected an enclosure wall around the Middle Kingdom temple, connecting the Fourth and Fifth pylons, which comprise the earliest part of the temple still standing ''in situ''. They contain fourteen papyrus columns and the two obelisks of [[Hatshepsut]], which were later hidden from view by walls set up by [[Thutmose III]]. Thutmose II laid out a Festival Courtyard at the front of the temple, removed by later construction, but block of which have been recovered from the fill in the Third Pylon.<ref name=\"strdwick51\"/>  Under Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, another enclosure wall fortified with towers was erected, and the nearby Sacred Lake was either constructed or enlarged.<ref>Simpson, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> During the reign of Thutmose III, the main temple itself was extended by 50% with the addition of a building called the ''Akh-menu''. This is normally translated as \"the most glorious of monuments\", but there is an alternative translation. According to Gardiner's Egyptian Grammar, the word akh can mean either ''glory'' or ''blessed/living spirit'' (For instance, [[Akhenaten]] is often translated as \"living spirit of Aten\"). So an alternative translation is \"monument to living spirit\". It is now known as the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]], which is seemingly decorated to echo a huge tent shrine, complete with awnings and tent poles.<ref>Kemp, 1989, p.202</ref> In this temple, the [[Karnak king list]], shows Thutmose III with some of the earlier kings that built parts of the temple complex. After a brief period of interruption during the [[Amarna Period]], when the Egyptian capital was moved to [[Akhetaten]], construction resumed at Karnak under [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Horemheb]]. The Ninth pylon was erected along the southern axis using material known as [[talatat]] from the now demolished Akhetaten.\n\n===Nineteenth Dynasty===\n[[Image:Chapelle reposoir Sethi II.jpg|125px|thumb|Seti II's barque shrine]]\nConstruction of the [[Great Hypostyle Hall, Karnak|Hypostyle Hall]] may have also begun during the eighteenth dynasty, though most building was undertaken under [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]]. [[Merenptah]] commemorated his victories over the [[Sea Peoples]] on the walls of the [[Precinct of Amun-Re#First Court (Cachette Court)|Cachette Court]], the start of the processional route to the [[Luxor Temple]]. This ''[[Great Karnak Inscription|Great Inscription]]'' (which has now lost about a third of its content) shows the king's campaigns and eventual return with booty and prisoners. Next to this inscription is the ''Victory Stela'', which is largely a copy of the more famous [[Israel Stela]], which was found on the West Bank funerary complex of Merenptah.<ref>Blyth, 2007, p.164</ref> Merenptah's son [[Seti II]] added 2 small obelisks in front of the Second Pylon, and a triple bark-shrine to the north of the processional avenue in the same area. This was constructed of sandstone, with a chapel to [[Amun]] flanked by those of [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]].\n\nThe last rulers of this dynasty added little to the temple complex.\n\n=== Twentieth Dynasty ===\nAs the power of the Egyptian Empire declined, construction declined in all of Thebes, and this is reflected in the building work carried out during this time. The [[Temple of Khonsu]] was also built and then expanded during this period under [[Ramesses III]] and [[Ramesses IV|IV]], and a large barque station was added in front of the Second pylon. This construction is large enough to be a major temple elsewhere, and is similar to the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]].<ref name=\"strdwick61\">Strudwick & Strudwick (1999), p.61</ref>\n\nAfter this, the later kings of the period added little to the overall complex, and concentrated on the Temple of Khonsu. The fading power of the dynasty is illustrated by the depiction of the [[Amenhotep, Priest of Amun|High Priest Amenhotep]] being shown in the same scale as [[Ramesses IX]].\n\n==Third Intermediate Period==\nThe fragmentation of Egypt with a pharaoh ruling in the north, and the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (21st and 22nd Dynasty)|High Priests of Amun]] ruling in Thebes. The northern kings seem to have constructed nothing and added little to the complex, but the High Priests continued to decorate the Temple of Khonsu, especially [[Herihor]] and [[Pinedjem I]].<ref name=\"strdwick63\">Strudwick & Strudwick (1999), p.63</ref>\n\n===Twenty second Dynasty===\nThe [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Libyan]] kings of the 22nd Dynasty seem to have planned to layout the area to the {{where|date=March 2017}} of the Second Pylon with a colonnade and a new gateway (which has since been replaced by the First Pylon).<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/> This new construction surrounded the barque shrines of Seti II and Ramesses III. Between this later temple and the Second Pylon [[Shoshenq I]] commemorated his conquests and military campaigns in Syria-Palestine by constructing the [[Bubastis Portal]].<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/>\n\n===Twenty-fifth Dynasty===\n[[Taharqa]] is the only king that made additions to the complex, building the Edifice of Tarhaqa to the forecourt between the First and Second Pylons. This meant that the [[Avenue of Sphinxes|avenue of sphinxes]] were moved to the sides of the court, where they are still located.<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/> He also added a colonnade to the [[Precinct of Montu]]\n\n==Late Period==\n\n===Thirtieth Dynasty===\nThe last major change to the temple's layout was the addition of the first pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the whole Karnak complex, both constructed by [[Nectanebo I]], completing the layout started by the kings of the 22nd Dynasty.<ref>Strudwick & Strudwick, 1999, p.64</ref>\n\n==Final developments==\n\n===Ptolemaic===\n[[Philip Arrhidaeus]] replaced the shrine of [[Thutmose III]] with a red-granite shrine. It comprises 2 rooms, aligned with the main axis of the temple.<ref>Blyth, 2006, p.226</ref> The Opet temple was the last important cult building to be constructed in the Karnak complex.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Christian era===\nIn 323 AD, [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] recognised the Christian religion, and in 356 ordered the closing of [[pagan]] temples throughout the empire. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were founded amongst the ruins, the most famous example of this is the reuse of the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]]'s central hall, where painted decorations of saints and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] inscriptions can still be seen.<ref>Blyth, 2006, p.234</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\n\n===Greek and Roman accounts===\nReferences to the complex are found in [[Herodotus]]\u2019, [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]] and presumably [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Manetho]], but we only retain fragments of their works, though none of these authors relates more than rudimentary information about the complex. Strabo states that Thebes at the time of his visit is nothing more than a collection of smaller villages, though its once grandness could still be imagined.\n\n===European rediscovery===\nThebes\u2019 exact placement was unknown in medieval Europe, though both Herodotus and Strabo gave the exact location of Thebes and how long up the [[Nile]] one must travel to reach it. In addition, maps of Egypt, based on the 2nd century [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]]' mammoth work ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', had been circulating in Europe since the late 14th century, all of them showing Thebes\u2019 (Diospolis) location. Despite this, several European authors of the 15th and 16th century, who visited only [[Lower Egypt]] and published their travel accounts, like [[Joos van Ghistele]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]], put Thebes in or close to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].\n\nThe Karnak temple complex is first described by an unknown Venetian in 1589, though his account relates no name for the complex. This account, housed in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]], is unique, in that it is the first known European mention, since the ancient Greek and Roman writers, of a whole range of monuments in [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Nubian people|Nubia]], including Karnak, Luxor temple, the [[Colossi of Memnon]], [[Esna]], [[Edfu]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Philae]] and others.\n\nKarnak (\"Carnac\") as a village name, and name of the complex, is first attested in 1668, when two [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionary brothers, Protais and Charles Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans, travelled though the area. Protais\u2019 writing about their travel was published by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] (''Relations de divers voyages curieux'', 1670s\u20131696 editions) and [[Johann Michael Vansleb]] (''The Present State of Egypt'', 1678).\n\nThe first drawing of Karnak, rather inaccurate and frequently confusing when viewed with modern eyes, is found in [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]]' travel account of 1704, ''Voyage du Sieur paul Lucas au Levant''. He had travelled in Egypt between 1699 and 1703. The drawing shows a mixture of the Precinct of Amun-Re and the Precinct of Montu, based on a complex confined by the three huge Ptolemaic gateways of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] / [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]], and the massive 113m long, 43m high and 15m thick, first Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Re.\n\nKarnak was visited and described in succession by [[Claude Sicard]] and his travel companion [[Pierre Laurent Pincia]] (1718 and 1720\u201321), [[Granger (Tourtechot)|Granger]] (1731), [[Frederick Louis Norden]] (1737\u201338), [[Richard Pococke]] (1738), [[James Bruce]] (1769), [[Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt]] (1777), [[William George Browne]] (1792\u201393), and finally by a number of scientists of the Napoleon expedition, including [[Vivant Denon]], during 1798\u20131799. [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Savary]] describes the complex in rather great detail in his work of 1785; especially in light of the fact that it is a fictional account of a pretend journey to Upper Egypt, composed out of information from other travellers. Savary did visit [[Lower Egypt]] in 1777\u201378, and published a work about that, too.\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*{{cite book |title=Karnak: Evolution of a Temple |first=Elizabeth |last=Blyth |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |isbn=0-415-40487-8}}\n*{{cite book |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization |first=Barry |last=Kemp |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |year=1989 |isbn=0-415-06346-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780415063463 }}\n*{{cite book |author=Smith, W.

They contain fourteen papyrus columns and the two obelisks of [[Hatshepsut]], which were later hidden from view by walls set up by [[Thutmose III]]. Thutmose II laid out a Festival Courtyard at the front of the temple, removed by later construction, but block of which have been recovered from the fill in the Third Pylon.<ref name=\"strdwick51\"/>  Under Hatshepsut and Thutmose III, another enclosure wall fortified with towers was erected, and the nearby Sacred Lake was either constructed or enlarged.<ref>Simpson, pp. 128\u2013131</ref> During the reign of Thutmose III, the main temple itself was extended by 50% with the addition of a building called the ''Akh-menu''. This is normally translated as \"the most glorious of monuments\", but there is an alternative translation. According to Gardiner\u2019s Egyptian Grammar, the word akh can mean either ''glory'' or ''blessed/living spirit'' (For instance, [[Akhenaten]] is often translated as \"living spirit of Aten\"). So an alternative translation is \"monument to living spirit\". It is now known as the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]], which is seemingly decorated to echo a huge tent shrine, complete with awnings and tent poles.<ref>Kemp, 1989, p.202</ref> In this temple, the [[Karnak king list]], shows Thutmose III with some of the earlier kings that built parts of the temple complex. After a brief period of interruption during the [[Amarna Period]], when the Egyptian capital was moved to [[Akhetaten]], construction resumed at Karnak under [[Tutankhamun]] and [[Horemheb]]. The Ninth pylon was erected along the southern axis using material known as [[talatat]] from the now demolished Akhetaten.\n\n===Nineteenth Dynasty===\n[[Image:Chapelle reposoir Sethi II.jpg|125px|thumb|Seti II's barque shrine]]\nConstruction of the [[Great Hypostyle Hall, Karnak|Hypostyle Hall]] may have also begun during the eighteenth dynasty, though most building was undertaken under [[Seti I]] and [[Ramesses II]]. [[Merenptah]] commemorated his victories over the [[Sea Peoples]] on the walls of the [[Precinct of Amun-Re#First Court (Cachette Court)|Cachette Court]], the start of the processional route to the [[Luxor Temple]]. This ''[[Great Karnak Inscription|Great Inscription]]'' (which has now lost about a third of its content) shows the king's campaigns and eventual return with booty and prisoners. Next to this inscription is the ''Victory Stela'', which is largely a copy of the more famous [[Israel Stela]], which was found on the West Bank funerary complex of Merenptah.<ref>Blyth, 2007, p.164</ref> Merenptah's son [[Seti II]] added 2 small obelisks in front of the Second Pylon, and a triple bark-shrine to the north of the processional avenue in the same area. This was constructed of sandstone, with a chapel to [[Amun]] flanked by those of [[Mut]] and [[Khonsu]].\n\nThe last rulers of this dynasty added little to the temple complex.\n\n=== Twentieth Dynasty ===\nAs the power of the Egyptian Empire declined, construction declined in all of Thebes, and this is reflected in the building work carried out during this time. The [[Temple of Khonsu]] was also built and then expanded during this period under [[Ramesses III]] and [[Ramesses IV|IV]], and a large barque station was added in front of the Second pylon. This construction is large enough to be a major temple elsewhere, and is similar to the mortuary temple of Ramesses III at [[Medinet Habu (temple)|Medinet Habu]].<ref name=\"strdwick61\">Strudwick & Strudwick (1999), p.61</ref>\n\nAfter this, the later kings of the period added little to the overall complex, and concentrated on the Temple of Khonsu. The fading power of the dynasty is illustrated by the depiction of the [[Amenhotep, Priest of Amun|High Priest Amenhotep]] being shown in the same scale as [[Ramesses IX]].\n\n==Third Intermediate Period==\nThe fragmentation of Egypt with a pharaoh ruling in the north, and the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (21st and 22nd Dynasty)|High Priests of Amun]] ruling in Thebes. The northern kings seem to have constructed nothing and added little to the complex, but the High Priests continued to decorate the Temple of Khonsu, especially [[Herihor]] and [[Pinedjem I]].<ref name=\"strdwick63\">Strudwick & Strudwick (1999), p.63</ref>\n\n===Twenty second Dynasty===\nThe [[Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt|Libyan]] kings of the 22nd Dynasty seem to have planned to layout the area to the {{where|date=March 2017}} of the Second Pylon with a colonnade and a new gateway (which has since been replaced by the First Pylon).<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/> This new construction surrounded the barque shrines of Seti II and Ramesses III. Between this later temple and the Second Pylon [[Shoshenq I]] commemorated his conquests and military campaigns in Syria-Palestine by constructing the [[Bubastis Portal]].<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/>\n\n===Twenty-fifth Dynasty===\n[[Taharqa]] is the only king that made additions to the complex, building the Edifice of Tarhaqa to the forecourt between the First and Second Pylons. This meant that the [[Avenue of Sphinxes|avenue of sphinxes]] were moved to the sides of the court, where they are still located.<ref name=\"strdwick63\"/> He also added a colonnade to the [[Precinct of Montu]]\n\n==Late Period==\n\n===Thirtieth Dynasty===\nThe last major change to the temple's layout was the addition of the first pylon and the massive enclosure walls that surround the whole Karnak complex, both constructed by [[Nectanebo I]], completing the layout started by the kings of the 22nd Dynasty.<ref>Strudwick & Strudwick, 1999, p.64</ref>\n\n==Final developments==\n\n===Ptolemaic===\n[[Philip Arrhidaeus]] replaced the shrine of [[Thutmose III]] with a red-granite shrine. It comprises 2 rooms, aligned with the main axis of the temple.<ref>Blyth, 2006, p.226</ref> The Opet temple was the last important cult building to be constructed in the Karnak complex.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n===Christian era===\nIn 323 AD, [[Constantine I|Constantine the Great]] recognised the Christian religion, and in 356 ordered the closing of [[pagan]] temples throughout the empire. Karnak was by this time mostly abandoned, and Christian churches were founded amongst the ruins, the most famous example of this is the reuse of the [[Festival Hall of Thutmose III]]'s central hall, where painted decorations of saints and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] inscriptions can still be seen.<ref>Blyth, 2006, p.234</ref>\n\n==Rediscovery==\n\n===Greek and Roman accounts===\nReferences to the complex are found in [[Herodotus]]\u2019, [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Strabo]] and presumably [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Manetho]], but we only retain fragments of their works, though none of these authors relates more than rudimentary information about the complex. Strabo states that Thebes at the time of his visit is nothing more than a collection of smaller villages, though its once grandness could still be imagined.\n\n===European rediscovery===\nThebes\u2019 exact placement was unknown in medieval Europe, though both Herodotus and Strabo gave the exact location of Thebes and how long up the [[Nile]] one must travel to reach it. In addition, maps of Egypt, based on the 2nd century [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]]' mammoth work ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', had been circulating in Europe since the late 14th century, all of them showing Thebes\u2019 (Diospolis) location. Despite this, several European authors of the 15th and 16th century, who visited only [[Lower Egypt]] and published their travel accounts, like [[Joos van Ghistele]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]], put Thebes in or close to [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]].\n\nThe Karnak temple complex is first described by an unknown Venetian in 1589, though his account relates no name for the complex. This account, housed in the [[Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale di Firenze]], is unique, in that it is the first known European mention, since the ancient Greek and Roman writers, of a whole range of monuments in [[Upper Egypt]] and [[Nubian people|Nubia]], including Karnak, Luxor temple, the [[Colossi of Memnon]], [[Esna]], [[Edfu]], [[Kom Ombo]], [[Philae]] and others.\n\nKarnak (\"Carnac\") as a village name, and name of the complex, is first attested in 1668, when two [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionary brothers, Protais and Charles Fran\u00e7ois d'Orl\u00e9ans, travelled though the area. Protais\u2019 writing about their travel was published by [[Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot]] (''Relations de divers voyages curieux'', 1670s\u20131696 editions) and [[Johann Michael Vansleb]] (''The Present State of Egypt'', 1678).\n\nThe first drawing of Karnak, rather inaccurate and frequently confusing when viewed with modern eyes, is found in [[Paul Lucas (traveller)|Paul Lucas]]' travel account of 1704, ''Voyage du Sieur paul Lucas au Levant''. He had travelled in Egypt between 1699 and 1703. The drawing shows a mixture of the Precinct of Amun-Re and the Precinct of Montu, based on a complex confined by the three huge Ptolemaic gateways of [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] / [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]], and the massive 113m long, 43m high and 15m thick, first Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Re.\n\nKarnak was visited and described in succession by [[Claude Sicard]] and his travel companion [[Pierre Laurent Pincia]] (1718 and 1720\u201321), [[Granger (Tourtechot)|Granger]] (1731), [[Frederick Louis Norden]] (1737\u201338), [[Richard Pococke]] (1738), [[James Bruce]] (1769), [[Charles-Nicolas-Sigisbert Sonnini de Manoncourt]] (1777), [[William George Browne]] (1792\u201393), and finally by a number of scientists of the Napoleon expedition, including [[Vivant Denon]], during 1798\u20131799. [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Savary]] describes the complex in rather great detail in his work of 1785; especially in light of the fact that it is a fictional account of a pretend journey to Upper Egypt, composed out of information from other travellers. Savary did visit [[Lower Egypt]] in 1777\u201378, and published a work about that, too.\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===References===\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n*{{cite book |title=Karnak: Evolution of a Temple |first=Elizabeth |last=Blyth |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |isbn=0-415-40487-8}}\n*{{cite book |title=Ancient Egypt: Anatomy of a Civilization |first=Barry |last=Kemp |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxford |year=1989 |isbn=0-415-06346-9 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780415063463 }}\n*{{cite book |author=Smith, W.

Clogs are used worldwide and although the form may vary by culture, within a culture the form often remained unchanged for centuries.\n\n[[Tradition]]al clogs remain in use as [[protective clothing|protective footwear]] in [[agriculture]] and in some [[factory|factories]] and [[Mining|mine]]s. Although clogs are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and folkloric footwear of [[farmer]]s and the [[working class]], some types of clogs are considered [[fashion]] wear today, such as Swedish [[tr\u00e4skor]] or Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]].\n\nClogs are also used in several different styles of [[clogging|dance]]. When worn for dancing, an important feature is the sound of the clog against the floor. This is one of the fundamental roots of [[tap dancing|tap]], but with the tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce a different sound from clogs.\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Clog#gallery}}\n[[File:Red Lancashire clogs (side view).jpg|thumb|Wooden soled type [[clog (British)|English clogs]]]]\n[[File:Fraum\u00fcnster Mittelalter Spectaculum 2011-05-20 14-37-32.JPG|thumb|Overshoes type of clogs ([[pattens]]) with leather [[turnshoes]] (German), reconstruction of the Middle Ages]]\nThe Oxford English Dictionary{{sfn|OED-clog}} defines a clog as a \"thick piece of wood\", and later as a \"wooden soled overshoe\" and a \"shoe with a thick wooden sole\".\n\nWelsh traditional clog maker Trefor Owen identified three main varieties of clogs: wooden upper, wooden soled and overshoes. {{sfn|Owen: CPRW|2012}}\n* Wooden upper clogs; are made by hollowing out a lump of solid wood to make a combined upper and lower. Two main variants can be seen:\n** whole foot clogs; where the wooden upper covers the whole of the foot to near the ankle, such as the familiar Dutch [[klomp]]. They are also known as \"wooden shoes\".  Whole foot clogs can give sufficient protection to be used as [[safety boot|safety footwear]] without additional reinforcements.\n** half open clogs; where the wooden upper extends over the toes or slightly further, such as the Italian \"zoccolo\" or Belgian sabots. The upper is similar in outline to a [[court shoe]]. Half open clogs may have additional covering or securing straps in some sort of fabric or leather.\n* Wooden soled clogs; use wood for the sole only. Wooden soled clogs come with a variety of uppers:\n** complete uppers made from leather or similar material, such as [[clog (British)|English clogs]]. For more protection, they may have steel toecaps and/or steel reinforcing inserts in the undersides of the soles\n** open sandal type fitting. For example, Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]]\n** toe peg styles. For example, Indian [[paduka]]\n* Overshoes; are wooden soles with straps designed to be worn over other footwear for protection, commonly known as [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]]. Patten style clogs are not used anymore. However the derivative [[galoshes]] are common worldwide.\nThese divisions are not fixed: some overshoes look more like whole foot clogs, like Spanish [[albarca]], whilst other wooden soled clogs raise and protect clothing in the way that overshoes do, such as Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]].\n\nThe type of upper determines how the clogs are worn. Whole foot clogs need to be close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In contrast wooden soled clogs are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open clogs may either be secured like whole foot clogs, or have an additional strap over the top of the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg styles, are worn more like \"[[flip-flops]]\" and rely on the grip between the big and next toe.\n\n==Flexing the foot==\nBeing wood, clogs cannot flex under the ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have the bottom of the toe curved up, known as the cast.<ref>Note that some thick-soled women's shoes (stilleto or wedge), which while not wooden soled, are as rigid as clogs. They likewise have to have a noticeable cast.</ref> Some styles of clogs have \"feet\", such as Spanish [[albarca]]. The clog rotates around the front edge of the front \"feet\". Some Japanese and Indian clogs have \"teeth\" or very high pegs attached to the soles. The clog can rotate around the front edge of the front \"tooth\" as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex.{{sfn|Grew|De_Neergaard|2004|loc=chapter on pattens}}  Klompen may have a carefully-placed [[Ease (sewing)|ease]] (space left around the foot), which allows the foot to bend, and the heel to lift within or out of the clog. Thick, springy wool socks provide flexibility in the fit.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nFile:Dupre large-258 (cropped) cowherd.jpg|This cowherd appears to be wearing thick white wool socks and black leather [[turnshoes]] under her wooden overshoes, which are eased.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0097-02, Holtwick, M\u00e4dchen auf dem Schulweg.jpg|Here the rearmost portion of the vamp is elastic leather, and the shoe rotates using the cast of the toe.\nFile:Albarcas-Cantabria.jpg|Albarcas have three feet\nFile:Cloggie Display.jpg|They rotate around the front clog-feet, located under the ball of the human foot.\nFile:Japan - Awa Bon Odori - Geta (footwear).jpg|Geta rotate around the front tooth, which must be placed under the ball of the foot.\nFile:\u4e00\u672c\u6b6f\u4e0b\u99c4 (17305606464).jpg|Tengu geta have only one tooth.\nFile:Walraversijde83.jpg|These wooden pattens are hinged at the ball of the foot.\n</gallery>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Benedetto Ghirlandaio Natividad (cropped) clogs.jpg|thumb|Clogs in a 1400s painting <!--can you find an earlier image?-->]]\n[[File:Fritz von Uhde Leierkastenmann.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|In this 1883 painting by [[Fritz von Uhde]], painted in the Dutch town of [[Zandvoort]], clogs are shown to be the townspeople's normal footwear.]]\nThe origin of wooden footwear in Europe is not precisely known. [[#{{harvid|De Boer-Olij|2002}}|De Boer-Olij]] makes reference to the high, thick-soled boots of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy actors in Antiquity (the [[buskin]]) and to the shoes worn by [[Roman empire|Roman]] soldiers (the [[caligae]]).{{sfn|De_Boer-Olij|2002|p=13}}  However, there is a possibility that the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples from Southern and Northern Europe were familiar with some sort of wooden foot covering. Archaeological finds of these are not known. Wooden footwear often ended up as firewood and, because of its nature, wood will rot away in the long run. The oldest surviving wooden footwear in Europe is found in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], and dates from 1230 and 1280.{{sfn|Wiedijk|2000|p=2}} These finds look very similar to the wooden shoes that are still worn in The Netherlands.\n\n==Manufacture==\n\nSince wooden footwear was a hand-made product, the shape of the footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After [[WW2]], in particular, wooden shoes disappeared from sight. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden bottom and leather top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as ladies\u2019 high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been replaced by uniform national models.\n\nMore information on the various methods of manufacture can be found from the gallery below.\n\n==Gallery==\nPresented below are typical clogs from the countries where they are found. Like many folk items, the boundaries of manufacture and use are regional and therefore do not always exactly follow those of modern states. So, in some countries two or more different types can be found. It is also possible that one type can be found in bordering countries. For example, Danish, German, Dutch, Belgian and clogs from Northwest France look quite similar.

They were usually worn without socks and were considered suitable [[attire]] for the ''[[avant-garde]]'' man.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even 8&nbsp;inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork, although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole, more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber. Some of the platforms of these clogs were encompassed about with a string-laced effect.\n\nIn 2007, Dutch designers [[Viktor & Rolf]] introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter collection of 2007/08.{{sfn|De_Greef|2007}}{{sfn|Cochran|2010}}  In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned again in [[Chanel|Chanel's]] and [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vuitton's]] Spring / Summer 2010 collection.{{sfn|Dykes}}\n\n== Museums ==\n* [[Bata Shoe Museum]], Canada\n* [[International Wooden Shoe Museum Eelde]], Netherlands\n* [[Bai Mi Wooden Clog Village]], Taiwan{{sfn|Trip Advisor|2020}}\n* [[Clitheroe Castle Museum]], Lancashire, UK\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n* {{citation\n  | last = De Boer-Olij\n  | first = T.\n  | title = European Wooden Shoes.

This is one of the fundamental roots of [[tap dancing|tap]], but with the tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce a different sound from clogs.\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Clog#gallery}}\n[[File:Red Lancashire clogs (side view).jpg|thumb|Wooden soled type [[clog (British)|English clogs]]]]\n[[File:Fraum\u00fcnster Mittelalter Spectaculum 2011-05-20 14-37-32.JPG|thumb|Overshoes type of clogs ([[pattens]]) with leather [[turnshoes]] (German), reconstruction of the Middle Ages]]\nThe Oxford English Dictionary{{sfn|OED-clog}} defines a clog as a \"thick piece of wood\", and later as a \"wooden soled overshoe\" and a \"shoe with a thick wooden sole\".\n\nWelsh traditional clog maker Trefor Owen identified three main varieties of clogs: wooden upper, wooden soled and overshoes. {{sfn|Owen: CPRW|2012}}\n* Wooden upper clogs; are made by hollowing out a lump of solid wood to make a combined upper and lower. Two main variants can be seen:\n** whole foot clogs; where the wooden upper covers the whole of the foot to near the ankle, such as the familiar Dutch [[klomp]]. They are also known as \"wooden shoes\".  Whole foot clogs can give sufficient protection to be used as [[safety boot|safety footwear]] without additional reinforcements.\n** half open clogs; where the wooden upper extends over the toes or slightly further, such as the Italian \"zoccolo\" or Belgian sabots. The upper is similar in outline to a [[court shoe]]. Half open clogs may have additional covering or securing straps in some sort of fabric or leather.\n* Wooden soled clogs; use wood for the sole only. Wooden soled clogs come with a variety of uppers:\n** complete uppers made from leather or similar material, such as [[clog (British)|English clogs]]. For more protection, they may have steel toecaps and/or steel reinforcing inserts in the undersides of the soles\n** open sandal type fitting. For example, Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]]\n** toe peg styles. For example, Indian [[paduka]]\n* Overshoes; are wooden soles with straps designed to be worn over other footwear for protection, commonly known as [[Patten (shoe)|pattens]]. Patten style clogs are not used anymore. However the derivative [[galoshes]] are common worldwide.\nThese divisions are not fixed: some overshoes look more like whole foot clogs, like Spanish [[albarca]], whilst other wooden soled clogs raise and protect clothing in the way that overshoes do, such as Japanese [[Geta (footwear)|geta]].\n\nThe type of upper determines how the clogs are worn. Whole foot clogs need to be close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In contrast wooden soled clogs are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open clogs may either be secured like whole foot clogs, or have an additional strap over the top of the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg styles, are worn more like \"[[flip-flops]]\" and rely on the grip between the big and next toe.\n\n==Flexing the foot==\nBeing wood, clogs cannot flex under the ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have the bottom of the toe curved up, known as the cast.<ref>Note that some thick-soled women's shoes (stilleto or wedge), which while not wooden soled, are as rigid as clogs. They likewise have to have a noticeable cast.</ref> Some styles of clogs have \"feet\", such as Spanish [[albarca]]. The clog rotates around the front edge of the front \"feet\". Some Japanese and Indian clogs have \"teeth\" or very high pegs attached to the soles. The clog can rotate around the front edge of the front \"tooth\" as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex.{{sfn|Grew|De_Neergaard|2004|loc=chapter on pattens}}  Klompen may have a carefully-placed [[Ease (sewing)|ease]] (space left around the foot), which allows the foot to bend, and the heel to lift within or out of the clog. Thick, springy wool socks provide flexibility in the fit.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=200>\nFile:Dupre large-258 (cropped) cowherd.jpg|This cowherd appears to be wearing thick white wool socks and black leather [[turnshoes]] under her wooden overshoes, which are eased.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 194-0097-02, Holtwick, M\u00e4dchen auf dem Schulweg.jpg|Here the rearmost portion of the vamp is elastic leather, and the shoe rotates using the cast of the toe.\nFile:Albarcas-Cantabria.jpg|Albarcas have three feet\nFile:Cloggie Display.jpg|They rotate around the front clog-feet, located under the ball of the human foot.\nFile:Japan - Awa Bon Odori - Geta (footwear).jpg|Geta rotate around the front tooth, which must be placed under the ball of the foot.\nFile:\u4e00\u672c\u6b6f\u4e0b\u99c4 (17305606464).jpg|Tengu geta have only one tooth.\nFile:Walraversijde83.jpg|These wooden pattens are hinged at the ball of the foot.\n</gallery>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Benedetto Ghirlandaio Natividad (cropped) clogs.jpg|thumb|Clogs in a 1400s painting <!--can you find an earlier image?-->]]\n[[File:Fritz von Uhde Leierkastenmann.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|In this 1883 painting by [[Fritz von Uhde]], painted in the Dutch town of [[Zandvoort]], clogs are shown to be the townspeople's normal footwear.]]\nThe origin of wooden footwear in Europe is not precisely known. [[#{{harvid|De Boer-Olij|2002}}|De Boer-Olij]] makes reference to the high, thick-soled boots of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy actors in Antiquity (the [[buskin]]) and to the shoes worn by [[Roman empire|Roman]] soldiers (the [[caligae]]).{{sfn|De_Boer-Olij|2002|p=13}}  However, there is a possibility that the [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] peoples from Southern- and Northern Europe were familiar with some sort of wooden foot covering. Archaeological finds of these are not known. Wooden footwear often ended up as firewood and, because of its nature, wood will rot away in the long run. The oldest surviving wooden footwear in Europe is found in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]], the [[Netherlands]], and dates from 1230 and 1280.{{sfn|Wiedijk|2000|p=2}} These finds look very similar to the wooden shoes that are still worn in The Netherlands.\n\n==Manufacture==\n\nSince wooden footwear was a hand-made product, the shape of the footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After [[WW2]], in particular, wooden shoes disappeared from sight. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden bottom and leather top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as ladies\u2019 high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been replaced by uniform national models.\n\nMore information on the various methods of manufacture can be found from the gallery below.\n\n==Gallery==\nPresented below are typical clogs from the countries where they are found. Like many folk items, the boundaries of manufacture and use are regional and therefore do not always exactly follow those of modern states. So, in some countries two or more different types can be found. It is also possible that one type can be found in bordering countries. For example, Danish, German, Dutch, Belgian and clogs from Northwest France look quite similar.

They were usually worn without socks and were considered suitable [[attire]] for the ''[[avant-garde]]'' man.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even 8&nbsp;inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork, although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole, more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber. Some of the platforms of these clogs were encompassed about with a string-laced effect.\n\nIn 2007, Dutch designers [[Viktor & Rolf]] introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter collection of 2007/08.{{sfn|De_Greef|2007}}{{sfn|Cochran|2010}}  In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned again in [[Chanel|Chanel's]] and [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vuitton's]] Spring / Summer 2010 collection.{{sfn|Dykes}}\n\n== Museums ==\n* [[Bata Shoe Museum]], Canada\n* [[International Wooden Shoe Museum Eelde]], Netherlands\n* [[Bai Mi Wooden Clog Village]], Taiwan{{sfn|Trip Advisor|2020}}\n* [[Clitheroe Castle Museum]], Lancashire, UK\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Citations ==\n* {{citation\n  | last = De Boer-Olij\n  | first = T.\n  | title = European Wooden Shoes.

{"title_page": "History of the Kansas City Royals", "text_new": "<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:ALC-KC-Logo.png|right|150px]] -->\nThe following is a detailed '''history of the [[Kansas City Royals]]''', a [[Major League Baseball]] team that began play in [[1969 in baseball|1969]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].  The team is currently in the [[American League]] [[American League Central Division|Central Division]]. The franchise has won one wild card berth, seven division titles, four league championships, and two [[1985 World Series|World Series titles]].\n\n==Baseball returns to Kansas City==\n[[File:Yankees vs. Athletics at Municipal Stadium.jpg|thumb|Municipal Stadium, home of the Royals from their inception until 1973.]]\nWhen the [[Kansas City Athletics]] moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] after the [[1967 in baseball|1967 season]], Kansas City was left without major league baseball or, for the first time since 1883, professional baseball at all. An enraged [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stuart Symington]] threatened to introduce legislation removing baseball's antitrust exemption unless Kansas City was granted a team in the next round of expansion.<ref>[http://www.wshs.org/wshs/columbia/articles/0200-a2.htm The Seattle Pilots\u2014Major League Baseball's First Venture in the Pacific Northwest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Major League Baseball complied with a hasty round of expansion at the 1967 winter meetings.  Kansas City was awarded one of four teams to begin play in 1971. However, Symington was not satisfied with having Kansas City wait three years for baseball to return, and pressured MLB to allow the new teams to start play in 1969. Symington's intervention may have contributed to the financial collapse of the Royals' companion expansion team, the [[Seattle Pilots]], who had to begin play in 1969 before they were ready (the league required new franchises to enter in pairs to preserve symmetry for scheduling purposes).\n\nPharmaceutical executive [[Ewing Kauffman]] won the bidding for the new Kansas City team. He conducted a contest to determine the best and most appropriate name for the new franchise. Sanford Porte from Overland Park, Kansas submitted the name Royals, in recognition of Missouri's billion-dollar livestock industry. His suggestion was that the American Royal best exemplified Kansas City through its pageantry and parade, so the new team should be named the Royals. The name was selected out of 17,000 submissions and the Royals Board voted 6\u20131 to adopt the name. The one dissenting vote was Mr Kauffman's. He eventually changed his mind after the name grew on him. (Some sources say it was in honor of the [[Kansas City Monarchs]], a [[Negro League]] team.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlb-teams.com/royals.php |title=Kansas City Royals : Royals news, history and pictures<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817225631/http://www.mlb-teams.com/royals.php |archive-date=2007-08-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The team's logo, a crown atop a shield with the letters \"KC\" inside the shield, was created by Shannon Manning, an artist at [[Hallmark Cards]], based in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Crowning Achievement\">Forr, James.

The first big trade was with fellow expansion team [[Seattle Pilots|Seattle]], which brought in 1969 [[MLB Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] [[Lou Piniella]].  In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, the Royals defeated the [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] 4\u20133 in 12 innings.  Two pitching stars from the [[Baltimore Orioles]] team that won the [[1966 World Series]] pitched for the Royals in the inaugural game: [[Wally Bunker]] threw the franchise's very first pitch, and [[Moe Drabowsky]] won the game in relief.  After finishing the season in  5th place, the Royals' next trade cemented a reputation as a speedy team.  Third baseman [[Joe Foy]] was traded to the [[New York Mets]] for speedy outfielder [[Amos Otis]], who would become the Royals' first star.  Further one-sided trades brought to the Royals second baseman [[Cookie Rojas]], bullpen ace [[Ted Abernathy]], shortstop [[Fred Patek]], first baseman [[John Mayberry]] and left fielder [[Hal McRae]]. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system and in the early years developed such future stars as pitchers [[Paul Splittorff]] and [[Steve Busby]], infielders [[George Brett]] and [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]], and outfielder [[Al Cowens]].\n\nIn [[1971 Major League Baseball season|1971]], the Royals had their first winning season, with manager [[Bob Lemon]] guiding them to a second-place finish. In [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], under [[Jack McKeon]], the Royals adopted their iconic \"powder blue\" road uniforms and moved from [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]] to the brand-new [[Royals Stadium]]. The stadium had deep outfield walls and artificial turf, and gave future young stars the opportunity to build a playing style involving aggressive baserunning and good defense.  The stadium, part of the [[Truman Sports Complex]], was built alongside [[Arrowhead Stadium]], the home of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  Unlike many of the new stadiums going up at the time, Kansas City chose dedicated stadiums for their sports teams over one [[multi-purpose stadium]].\n[[File:Royals Stadium 1976.jpg|thumb|A game against the White Sox at Royals Stadium on September 19, 1976.]]\nManager [[Whitey Herzog]] replaced McKeon in 1975, and the Royals began their ascension to the top of the American League West. They finished [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975]] with a 91\u201371 record, second to the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. That season, John Mayberry finished second to Boston's [[Fred Lynn]] in the MVP voting. The [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976 season]] brought secured dominance to the Royals. First, [[George Brett]] defeated his own teammate [[Hal McRae]] to win the batting title on the season's final day. Second, the Royals won the first of three straight Western Division championships. They lost to the [[New York Yankees]] in three straight [[American League Championship Series]] encounters, despite winning more regular season games in two of those years.  In two of those years, they lost the AL Championship Series in the ninth inning of the fifth and final game.  However, the three playoffs series helped George Brett become a superstar, as he homered three times in a losing effort in the final game of the [[1978 American League Championship Series|1978 playoff series]].  In addition to a nucleus of Brett, White, McRae, and Cowens, these Royals teams featured pitchers [[Dennis Leonard]] and [[Larry Gura]], closer [[Dan Quisenberry]], and position players [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], [[U.L. Washington]] and [[Darrell Porter]]. The 1977 season, however, ended on another sour note as Herzog demanded that John Mayberry be traded or he would threaten to leave the team. This resulted in Mayberry being traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\n==1980\u20131984: From pennant to pine tar==\nAfter the Royals finished in second place in 1979, Herzog was fired and replaced by [[Jim Frey]]. Most believe that the firing was due to Herzog's strained relationship with the Royals front office including General Manager [[Joe Burke (baseball executive)|Joe Burke]], owner [[Ewing Kauffman]], and Kauffman's wife, Muriel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Under Frey, the Royals rebounded in [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]] and advanced to the [[1980 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], where they again faced the [[1980 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].  The team was led by Brett, who flirted with a .400 batting average and won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP]], and Willie Wilson, who electrified crowds with stolen bases and inside-the-park home runs.\n\nIn the 1980 ALCS, the [[1980 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] finally vanquished the Yankees in a three-game sweep punctuated by a George Brett home run off Yankees' star closer [[Goose Gossage]]. Frank White was named the playoffs MVP for all-around steady play and heroics.  However, after reaching their first [[1980 World Series|World Series]], the Royals fell to the [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.  The Phillies featured future Hall of Famers [[Mike Schmidt]] and [[Steve Carlton]], as well as all-time hits leader [[Pete Rose]].  In the series, [[Willie Aikens]] became the first player in World Series history to homer twice in two separate Series games.\n\nThe Royals returned to the post-season in [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]], losing to the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in a unique divisional series resulting from the split-season caused by the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]].\n\nIn [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]], the [[1983 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] were headed for a second-place finish behind the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] when they were rocked by scandals.  The first event added another chapter to the team's heated rivalry with the Yankees.  In a July game between the two teams, third baseman George Brett hit a go-ahead home run in the top of the ninth inning.  After Brett crossed home plate and returned to the dugout, Yankees manager [[Billy Martin]] complained that Brett had more [[pine tar]] on his bat than baseball's rules allowed.  After inspecting the bat, the umpires disallowed the home run and called Brett out, ending the game.  The signature image from the event was Brett storming angrily out of the dugout to argue the call.\n[[Image:George brett pine tar bat rotated.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[baseball bat]] used by [[George Brett]] in the [[Pine Tar Incident]] on July 24, 1983.]]\nThe second scandal of the 1983 season was far more serious, involving a truly illegal substance and several Royals players. Leadoff hitter and center fielder Willie Wilson, power-hitting first baseman Willie Aikens, power-hitting outfielder [[Jerry Martin (baseball)|Jerry Martin]], and starting pitcher [[Vida Blue]], who had been released on August 5, were charged with attempting to purchase [[cocaine]]. The four were charged in October 1983, pleaded guilty, spent three months in prison, and were suspended by commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] for the entire 1984 season. The four appealed and were permitted to return on May 15. In response to the scandal, owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] founded the Ewing Marion Kauffman foundation to give back to the community, allowed Martin to depart via free agency, and traded Aikens, retaining only Wilson's services.\n\nThe 1983 season was also notable for some transitional changes in the Royals organization. First, owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] sold 49% of his interest to Memphis developer [[Avron Fogelman]]. Second, [[John Schuerholz]] was named general manager. Schuerholz soon bolstered the farm system with pitchers [[Bud Black]], [[Danny Jackson]], [[Mark Gubicza]], [[David Cone]], and [[Bret Saberhagen]], as well as hitters such as [[Kevin Seitzer]].\n\nUnder the leadership of manager [[Dick Howser]], the Royals \u2013 relying on Brett's bat and the young pitching of Saberhagen, Gubicza, Bud Black, Danny Jackson, and [[Charlie Leibrandt]] \u2013 won the franchise's fifth division championship in [[1984 Major League Baseball season|1984]], although they were swept by the eventual World Series champion [[1984 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1984 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]\n\n==1985: \"The I-70 Series\"==\n{{main article|1985 Kansas City Royals season}}\nIn the [[1985 in baseball|1985]] regular season the Royals topped the Western Division for the sixth time in ten years, led by Bret Saberhagan's [[Cy Young Award]]-winning performance.  In the last week of the season, Brett put on an amazing hitting streak that led the Royals climb from behind to overtake the California Angels in the standings.  Throughout the ensuing playoffs, the Royals repeatedly put themselves into difficult positions, but improbably managed to escape each time.  With the Royals down two games to zero in the [[1985 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] against the [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], George Brett put on a hitting show in game three, homering in his first two at bats and then doubling to the same right field location in his third at-bat.  After falling behind 3\u20131 in the series, the Royals eventually rallied to win the series 4-3 (notably, the LCS had been expanded to a best-of-seven format for the first time in 1985, which allowed the Royals to survive at all).  Brett was named ALCS MVP.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Royals 85.jpg|right|thumb|George Brett and Bret Saberhagen embrace as the Kansas City Royals win their only World Championship (1985).]] -->\n\n===1985 World Series===\n{{main article|1985 World Series}}\n\nIn the 1985 World Series against the cross-state [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] &ndash; the so-called \"I-70 Series\" because the two teams are both located in the state of [[Missouri]] and connected by [[Interstate 70]] &ndash; the Royals again fell behind 3\u20131.  The key game in the Royals' comeback was [[1985 World Series#Game six|Game Six]].  Facing elimination, the Royals trailed 1\u20130 in the bottom of the ninth inning, before rallying to score two runs and win.  The rally was helped by a controversial call at first base by umpire [[Don Denkinger]], which allowed Royals outfielder [[Jorge Orta]] to reach base safely as the first baserunner of the inning.\n\nFollowing Orta's single, the Cardinals seemingly lost their concentration, dropping an easy popout and suffering a passed ball, before the Royals won with a bloop base hit by seldom used [[pinch hitter]] [[Dane Iorg]], a former utility player for the Cardinals. Following the tension and frustration of Game Six, the Cardinals came undone in [[1985 World Series#Game seven|Game Seven]], and the Royals won 11\u20130 to clinch the franchise's first World Series title.\n\n==1986\u20131994: Staying in the picture==\nIn [[1986 in baseball|1986]], the Royals fell suddenly from contender status.  They also made one of the worst trades in franchise history, trading native Kansas Citian and future perennial All-Star [[David Cone]] for [[Ed Hearn (catcher)|Ed Hearn]].  Hearn played for less than a month in Kansas City.  The Royals were the trendy pre-season pick to return to the World Series in [[1987 in baseball|1987]], but the season proved bittersweet for the Royals.  The team won 83 out of 162 games (a seven win improvement from 1986), and wound up finishing two games behind the eventual World Champion [[Minnesota Twins]] in the Western Division.  Further, on June 17, 1987, Dick Howser died after a year-long battle with [[brain cancer]].  Howser's #10 soon became the first number that the Royals retired.  Also in 1987, the team released longtime star [[Hal McRae]] and selected [[John Wathan]] as its new manager in midseason after firing [[Billy Gardner]].\n[[File:George Brett 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Brett]] bats during a 1990 game at [[Royals Stadium]].]]\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Royals developed young stars such as [[Bo Jackson]], [[Tom Gordon]], and [[Kevin Seitzer]], made some successful free-agent acquisitions, and generally posted winning records, but always fell short of the post-season.  For example, in [[1989 in baseball|1989]], the Royals won 92 games and posted the third-best record in baseball, but did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing second in their division behind the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics.  They also traded their star pitchers for questionable talent:  Charlie Leibrandt for [[Gerald Perry]], Bud Black for [[Pat Tabler]], Danny Jackson for [[Kurt Stillwell]], and Bret Saberhagen for [[Kevin McReynolds]], [[Gregg Jefferies]] and [[Keith Miller]].\n\nAt the end of the 1989 season, the team boasted a powerhouse pitching rotation, including the AL [[Cy Young Award]]-winner Bret Saberhagen (who set franchise record 23 [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] that year), two-time All-Star Mark Gubicza (a 15-game winner in 1989) and 1989 AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] runner-up Tom Gordon (who won 17 games that year).<ref name=\"Royals lineup\">{{cite news | last = Horst | first = Craig | title = Royals' lineup for 1990 is virtually set | page = 15 | work = The Daily Union | date = March 25, 1990 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XahEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ErYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1247,6829820&dq=1990+royals&hl=en | accessdate = April 18, 2012 }}</ref> But the organization felt it was still missing a few necessary pieces to give its divisional rival Oakland Athletics a run for their money.<ref name=\"Cautionary\">{{cite web |url=http://kingsofkauffman.com/2011/12/17/the-cautionary-tale-of-the-1990-royals/ |title=The Cautionary Tale of the 1990 Royals |author=Engel, Michael |publisher=FanSided |date=December 17, 2011 |work= Kings of Kauffman |accessdate=April 17, 2012 }}</ref> For one thing, the Royals had been without a high-caliber closing pitcher since All-Star [[Dan Quisenberry]] was dropped in 1988.

To make matters worse Bo Jackson \u2013 the team's potential future franchise player \u2013 suffered a devastating hip injury while playing football in the off-season, so the Royals waived him during spring training in 1991.<ref>{{cite news | last = Horst | first = Craig| title = Bo no go, waive star | page = 2B | work =Kentucky New Era | agency=Associated Press | date = March 19, 1991 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1t0rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gWQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3785,1631264&dq=kansas+city+royals+1991+preview&hl=en | accessdate = October 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany of the team's highlights from this era instead centered on the end of Brett's career, such as his third and final batting title in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] \u2013 which made him the first player to win batting titles in three different decades &ndash; and his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th hit]].  Though the team dropped out of contention from 1990 to [[1992 in baseball|1992]], through the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened 1994 season]], the Royals still could generally be counted on to post winning records.  The 1994 season was the club's last flirtation with greatness for two decades.  Led by manager Hal McRae and Cy Young Award-winner David Cone (whom owner Ewing Kauffman had re-signed), the Royals had a fourteen-game winning streak just before the season ended prematurely due to the players' strike.\n\n==1995\u20132002: Decline in the post-Kauffman era==\nAt the start of the 1990s, the Royals had been hit with a double-whammy when [[General Manager]] [[John Schuerholz]] departed in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] and team owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] died in [[1993 in baseball|1993]].  Kauffman's death left the franchise without permanent ownership until [[Wal-Mart]] executive [[David Glass (businessman)|David Glass]] purchased the team for $96 million in 2000.\n\nPartly because of the resulting lack of leadership, after the [[1994 in baseball|1994 season]] the Royals decided to reduce payroll by trading pitcher [[David Cone]] (again) and outfielder [[Brian McRae]], then continued their salary dump in the [[1995 in baseball|1995]] season.  In fact, the team payroll, which was always among the league's highest, was sliced from $40.5 million in 1994 (fourth-highest in the major leagues) to $18.5 million in [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996]] (second-lowest in the major leagues).<ref name=salary>{{Cite news | last = Dutton | first = Bob | title = Royals to Open 2010 Season With $70.1 million Payroll | newspaper = Kansas City Star | date = April 4, 2010 | url = http://www.kansascity.com/2010/04/04/1856456/royals-to-open-2010-season-with.html | accessdate = 2010-04-05}}</ref><ref name=USAToday>{{Cite news | title = USA Today Salaries Database | newspaper = USA Today | url = http://content.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/salaries/totalpayroll.aspx?year=1996 | accessdate = 2010-04-05 | date=October 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1997 in baseball|1997]], the Royals franchise had the opportunity to switch to the [[National League]] and play in the [[National League Central|NL Central]] alongside its intrastate rival [[St. Louis Cardinals]].<ref name=\"NL\">Mellinger, Sam.

[[Bud Selig]], baseball's acting commissioner and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] owner, gave the Royals the first option to change to the National League.  That summer, the Royals were mired in the team's worst season since its second year of existence.  Further, following Ewing Kauffman death, the franchise was being run by a board of directors and was up for sale.  Ultimately, the board declined the move, and Milwaukee switched leagues instead.<ref name=\"NL\"/>\n\nSome commentators have argued that the Royals should have made the move.  According to their logic, if the Royals had changed leagues, the team would have played the Cardinals more often and would have been in the same division with the [[Chicago Cubs]]; these teams might have drawn bigger crowds to [[Kauffman Stadium]].<ref name=\"NL\"/>  Further, with no [[designated hitter]] in the National League, there would have been one less big salary to pay,<ref name=\"NL\"/> which would have been easier for the Royals' front office to manage.  Opinion at the time was fairly split. The Royals polled their fans, and reported that a slight majority of the 1,500 who returned surveys approved a move to the NL. Many fans, including former Royal [[Greg Pryor]], thought that switching leagues was the only way to keep the Royals in Kansas City.<ref name=\"NL\"/>  On the other hand, there was also a strong sentiment among some fans that Kansas City was, is, and always would be an American League market.  Back then, the glory years weren't that far removed, and the emotional tie to the rivalry with the Yankees, for instance, was still burning.<ref name=\"NL\"/>  There was nothing in Kauffman's will or known feelings about how he would have received a move to the National League.<ref name=\"NL\"/>\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, attendance at Royals games slid while the average MLB salary continued to rise, and the Royals found it difficult to retain their remaining stars.  The team decided to trade players such as [[Kevin Appier]], [[Johnny Damon]] and [[Jermaine Dye]] for prospects rather than pay higher salaries or lose them to free agency.  By 1999, the Royals' payroll had fallen again to $16.5 million.<ref name=salary/>  Making matters worse, most of the younger players that the Royals received in exchange for these All-Stars proved of little value, setting the stage for an extended downward spiral.\n\nIn [[1999 in baseball|1999]], the Royals set a franchise low with a .398 winning percentage (64-97 record), and lost 97 games again in [[2001 in baseball|2001]].  The records could have been even worse without the rapid development of center fielder [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] (Rookie of the Year in 1999) and first baseman [[Mike Sweeney]].\n\nIn [[2002 in baseball|2002]], the Royals set a new team record for futility, losing 100 games for the first time in franchise history.  The team also introduced new black and dark blue jerseys for alternate games, and also sleeveless home jerseys.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/royals/uniforms.html Kansas City Royals new uniforms (2002)] ''ESPN.com'' \u2013 ''Page 2''</ref>  The jerseys were met with mixed reactions in Kansas City, and eventually, by the 2006 season, the Royals again changed their uniforms back to their \"old\" style.<ref name=\"Royals unveil\">[http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060127&content_id=1302088&vkey=news_kc&fext=.jsp&c_id=kc Royals unveil new uniforms in 2006] ''MLB.com'', 27 January 2006.</ref>\n\n==2003: A winning season==\nThe [[2003 Kansas City Royals season|2003 season]] saw a temporary end to the losing, when manager Tony Pe\u00f1a, in his first full season with the club, guided the team to its first winning record (83\u201379) since 1994 and finished in third place in the AL Central. He was named the American League [[Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] for his efforts, and shortstop [[\u00c1ngel Berroa]] was named [[AL Rookie of the Year]].\n\n==2004\u20132012: Rock bottom==\nFrom the [[2004 Kansas City Royals season|2004 season]] through the [[2012 Kansas City Royals season|2012 season]], the Royals posted nine consecutive losing records \u2013 the longest streak in team history.  In six of those seasons the team finished in last place in the American League Central, and in eight of those nine seasons the team also lost at least 90 games.  The worst seasons came in 2004\u20132006, when the Royals lost at least 100 games each year and set the franchise's all-time record for losses (56\u2013106 in [[2005 Kansas City Royals season|2005]]).\n\nPicked by many to win their division in [[2004 in baseball|2004]] after faring surprisingly well in the free agent market, the Royals got off to a disappointing start and by late June again were in rebuilding mode, releasing veteran reliever [[Curtis Leskanic]] before financial incentives kicked in and trading veteran reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] and superstar center fielder [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] for prospects, all within a week of each other.  The team subsequently fell apart completely, establishing a new low by losing 104 games.  Worse yet, the younger players received in these trades again did little to immediately restock the team or its farm system, although [[Mark Teahen]], acquired in the Beltr\u00e1n trade, would blossom in [[2006 in baseball|2006]] (following a brief demotion to the minor leagues).\n\nIn [[2005 in baseball|2005]], the Royals continued their youth movement, with the second-lowest payroll in the Major Leagues.<ref name=USAToday/>  Six of the team's starting position players, three of the five starting pitchers, and the setup man and closer were all under the age of 30.  After posting a miserable 8\u201325 record to start the season, Tony Pe\u00f1a resigned as manager on May 10; [[Buddy Bell]] was hired to replace him three weeks later.  During that season, the Royals suffered a franchise record 19-game losing streak highlighted by a three-game stretch of blowout losses at home from August 6 through August 9; in that stretch the Royals lost 16\u20131 to the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the first game, were shut out 11-0 by Oakland in the second game, and then in the third game, against the [[Cleveland Indians]], built a 7\u20132 lead in the ninth inning before allowing 11 runs to lose 13\u20137.  The Royals finally ended their losing streak at 19 on August 20, two losses short of the American League record, with a 2\u20131 win over the Oakland Athletics.  The Royals ended the 2005 season with a 56\u2013106 record (.346), a full 43 games out of first place.  It was the third time in four seasons that the team reestablished the mark for worst record in the history of the franchise.  The team finished the season 10th in the American League in hitting (.263 AVG), 12th in runs scored (702) and last in pitching (5.49 ERA).\n\nLooking for a quick turnaround, General Manager [[Allard Baird]] signed several veteran players prior to the 2006 season. He secured starting pitchers [[Mark Redman]], [[Joe Mays]] and [[Scott Elarton]].  Baird also signed free agent second baseman [[Mark Grudzielanek]], first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] and inked veteran [[Reggie Sanders]] to a two-year, $10 million deal.  Although the new players seemed promising, they did not result in many additional wins.  The Royals struggled through another 100-loss season in [[2006 in baseball|2006]], becoming just the 11th team in major league history to lose 100 games in three straight seasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Following a major-league worst 13\u201337 start, the Royals fired Baird on May 31 and announced that [[Atlanta Braves]] assistant general manager [[Dayton Moore]] would be the team's new GM.  [[Muzzy Jackson]] served as interim GM for the Royals, handling the [[Major League Baseball Draft|first-year player draft]], before Moore took over on June 8.\n\nOne problem often cited by commentators for the losing of those seasons was a lack of financial support from the team's owner, David Glass.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120907190926/http://www.pitch.com/2006-03-30/news/is-david-glass-smoking-grass/ \"Is David Glass Smoking Grass?\"]</ref>  For the first six years Glass owned the Royals (prior to the 2000 season) the team payroll was never higher than 21st in the major leagues, and it was in the league's bottom six payrolls on five occasions.<ref name=USAToday/>  Glass and the Royals also faced a minor controversy off the field in 2006, when the team revoked the credentials of two radio journalists present at the press conference introducing Moore.  The two personalities \u2013 Bob Fescoe of [[WHB]] at the time and Rhonda Moss of [[KCSP (AM)|KCSP]] \u2013 primarily asked pointed questions toward Glass over the firing of Baird.  The aftermath included less than positive commentary from other media outlets in the metro and a statement from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] [http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=591 calling for the reinstatement of their credentials].  In response, the Royals started a [[weblog]]; the first entry defended the organization's decision.\n\nKansas City entered the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] looking to rebound from four out of five seasons ending with at least 100 losses, and appeared to be opening up its wallet a bit, with a payroll exceeding $60 million for the first time (rising to 22nd-highest in the major leagues).<ref name=salary/><ref name=USAToday/>  The Royals outbid the Cubs and Blue Jays for free agent righty [[Gil Meche]], signing him to five-year, $55 million contract.  Reliever [[Octavio Dotel]] also inked a one-year, $5 million contract.  The team also added several new prospects, including [[Alex Gordon]] and [[Billy Butler (baseball)|Billy Butler]]. Among [[Dayton Moore]]'s first acts as General Manager was instating a new motto for the team: \"True. Blue. Tradition.\"<ref>Flanagan, Jeffrey.

In June 2007, the Royals had their first winning month since July 2003, following up in July with their second-consecutive winning month of the season.  On August 1, manager [[Buddy Bell]] announced his intentions to resign following the 2007 season.<ref name=\"Bell stepping down\">[http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070801&content_id=2122768&vkey=news_kc&fext=.jsp&c_id=kc Bell stepping down as Royals skipper]</ref>  On September 12, the Royals defeated the [[Minnesota Twins]] 6\u20133 to win their 63rd game, guaranteeing that they would not lose 100 games in 2007.

Through 13 games, the Royals were 8-5 and in first place, a vast improvement over their 3\u201310 start from the previous season.  However, by the All-Star break, the Royals were again in losing territory, with their record buoyed only by a 13\u20135 record in inter-league play, the best in the American League.  During the season many players from the minors came up and made their presence felt including [[Ryan Shealy]], [[Mitch Maier]] and [[Mike Avil\u00e9s]].  The team finished the season in fourth place with a 75\u201387 record.  It was the first time in five years the Royals did not finish last in their division and did not lose 93 or more games. \n\nPrior to the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]], the Royals renovated Kauffman Stadium.  After the season began, the Royals ended April at the top of the AL Central, all of which raised excitement levels among fans.  However, the team faded as the season progressed and finished the year with a final record of 65\u201397, in a last-place tie in its division (tied with the Cleveland Indians).\n\nThe 2009 season was highlighted by starter [[Zack Greinke]], who didn't allow an earned run in the first 24 innings of the season, went on to finish the year with a major league-leading 2.16 [[earned run average]], and won the American League [[Cy Young Award]].  Greinke joined Bret Saberhagen (in 1985 and 1989) and David Cone (in 1994) as the only three players in Royals history to receive the award.  He also set a club record 15 strikeouts in a single game against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nThe following year, in 2010, the Royals began with a rocky start, and after the team's record fell to 12\u201323, general manager Dayton Moore fired manager Trey Hillman.  After Hillman's departure, former [[Milwaukee Brewers]] manager [[Ned Yost]] took over as manager.  Despite the change, the Royals finished with a 67\u201395 record, in last place in the division for the sixth time in seven years.\n[[File:NewKauffman.jpg|right|thumb|Kauffman Stadium underwent renovations in 2009, including the addition of a [[high-definition television|high-definition]] scoreboard.]]\nIn contrast to 2010, the Royals began the 2011 season with a hot start, tying for the best record in the American League with a 10\u20134 record after fourteen games. The quick start followed a successful [[spring training]] season for the Royals.  Success faded as the season progressed, however.  The Royals last had a .500 record at 22-22, and then lost five games in a row.  By the All-Star break, the Royals had a record of 37\u201354, the worst in the American League.  On a more positive note, the season also saw the emergence of rookies such as [[Eric Hosmer]] and [[Aaron Crow]], the team's representative in the [[2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2011 All-Star game]], as well as Alex Gordon's breakout year in left field, which resulted in him receiving a Gold Glove for his excellent display of defense and league leading 20 assists. The team ended with a fourth-place finish.\n\n==2013\u20132014: Return to contention==\nOn December 10, 2012, in an attempt to strengthen the pitching staff (which was among the worst in baseball in 2012), the Royals traded for Rays pitchers [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]] and [[Wade Davis (baseball)|Wade Davis]] for Royals top prospect [[Wil Myers]] and three others.  This trade helped catalyze a return to winning records.\n\nThe [[2013 Kansas City Royals season|2013 season]] got off to a very good start, as the Royals remained over .500 nearly most of April during regular season play. The team also didn't commit an error in its first seven games (for 64 2/3 innings) for the first time in team history. On September 22, the Royals won their 82nd game of the season, to clinch their first winning season since 2003. The Royals finished the season 86\u201376, in third place in the AL Central, securing the team's best winning percentage since 1994.\n\nThe [[2014 Kansas City Royals season|2014 season]] was even more successful, featuring a return to the post-season for the first time in 29 years. On July 21, the Royals had a losing record (48\u201350) and were 8 games behind the [[2014 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in the AL Central standings.  But spurred by a 22\u20135 record from July 22 to August 19, the Royals surged into first place in the AL Central.  The Royals reached the top of the division standings on August 11, after winning their eighth game in a row.<ref name=KCS2014>{{cite news  | last = McCullough | first = Andy |url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article1199725.html |title=Royals reclaim first place in Central with 3-2 victory over Oakland | newspaper = [[Kansas City Star]] | date=August 11, 2014 | accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref>  This marked the latest date the Royals had led their division since August 29, 2003.<ref name=KCS2014/>  After taking over first place on August 11, the Royals retained the division lead for a month, falling out of first place permanently on September 12. The Royals finished the regular season one game behind Detroit in the AL Central, but secured the franchise's first ever [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card berth]] and first playoff appearance in 29 years.\n\nThe team's final regular season record of 89\u201373 in 2014 represented the most wins for the Royals since [[1989 Kansas City Royals season|1989]]. Coupled with a ten-game winning streak in June 2014, the Royals' eight-game winning streak in August 2014 was the second streak of at least that long during the same season, something the franchise had accomplished only three times previously \u2013 in 1977, 1978, and 1980.\n\nThe Royals made the most of that playoff run in 2014, going a record 8\u20130 for the first three rounds. They defeated the [[2014 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[2014 American League Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], then swept both the [[2014 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[2014 American League Division Series|ALDS]] and [[2014 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], respectively. However, the Royals fell a win short in the [[2014 World Series|World Series]], losing to the [[2014 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in seven games.\n\n==2015: Second World Series Championship==\n{{main article|2015 Kansas City Royals season}}\n\nEnergized by the previous season's playoff run, the 2015 Royals won the [[American League Central]], earning their first division title since 1985. In the [[2015 American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the [[2015 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], the Royals trailed in the series 2\u20131, and were on the verge of elimination after trailing by four runs heading into the eighth inning of Game 4. However, Kansas City scored seven runs in the final two innings to force a deciding game, before eliminating the Astros to advance to the [[2015 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. In a rematch of the 1985 ALCS against the [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], the Royals shut down Toronto's high-powered offense, winning the series in six games and advancing to their second straight World Series.\n\n===2015 World Series===\n{{main article|2015 World Series}}\nIn the 2015 World Series against the [[2015 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], the Royals continued to live up to their reputation as clutch performers. In Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game in the bottom of the ninth inning with a home run, before [[Eric Hosmer]] drove in a game-winning sacrifice fly in the 14th inning. In Game 4, with the Mets on the verge of tying the series, the Royals scored three runs (one unearned) in the eighth inning to send them to within a game of the championship. Then in Game 5, with the Mets three outs away from forcing Game 6, the Royals scored two runs to tie the game, before  seldom-used infielder [[Christian Col\u00f3n]] drove in the go-ahead run in the 12th inning, helping Kansas City win 7\u20132 and clinch their second World Series championship. All Star catcher Salvador P\u00e9rez was named Series MVP for his clutch hitting and excellent pitch calling.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy]]\n* [[List of Kansas City Royals seasons]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.Royals.com Official Website of the Kansas City Royals]\n\n{{MLBHistory}}\n{{Kansas City Royals}}\n\n[[Category:Kansas City Royals]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team|Kansas City Royals]]\n", "text_old": "<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:ALC-KC-Logo.png|right|150px]] -->\nThe following is a detailed '''history of the [[Kansas City Royals]]''', a [[Major League Baseball]] team that began play in [[1969 in baseball|1969]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]].

The franchise has won one wild card berth, seven division titles, four league championships, and two [[1985 World Series|World Series titles]].\n\n==Baseball returns to Kansas City==\n[[File:Yankees vs. Athletics at Municipal Stadium.jpg|thumb|Municipal Stadium, home of the Royals from their inception until 1973.]]\nWhen the [[Kansas City Athletics]] moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] after the [[1967 in baseball|1967 season]], Kansas City was left without major league baseball or, for the first time since 1883, professional baseball at all. An enraged [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Stuart Symington]] threatened to introduce legislation removing baseball's antitrust exemption unless Kansas City was granted a team in the next round of expansion.<ref>[http://www.wshs.org/wshs/columbia/articles/0200-a2.htm The Seattle Pilots\u2014Major League Baseball's First Venture in the Pacific Northwest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Major League Baseball complied with a hasty round of expansion at the 1967 winter meetings.  Kansas City was awarded one of four teams to begin play in 1971. However, Symington was not satisfied with having Kansas City wait three years for baseball to return, and pressured MLB to allow the new teams to start play in 1969. Symington's intervention may have contributed to the financial collapse of the Royals' companion expansion team, the [[Seattle Pilots]], who had to begin play in 1969 before they were ready (the league required new franchises to enter in pairs to preserve symmetry for scheduling purposes).\n\nPharmaceutical executive [[Ewing Kauffman]] won the bidding for the new Kansas City team. He conducted a contest to determine the best and most appropriate name for the new franchise. Sanford Porte from Overland Park, Kansas submitted the name Royals, in recognition of Missouri's billion-dollar livestock industry. His suggestion was that the American Royal best exemplified Kansas City through its pageantry and parade, so the new team should be named the Royals. The name was selected out of 17,000 submissions and the Royals Board voted 6-1 to adopt the name. The one dissenting vote was Mr Kauffman's. He eventually changed his mind after the name grew on him. (Some sources say it was in honor of the [[Kansas City Monarchs]], a [[Negro League]] team.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mlb-teams.com/royals.php |title=Kansas City Royals : Royals news, history and pictures<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817225631/http://www.mlb-teams.com/royals.php |archive-date=2007-08-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The team's logo, a crown atop a shield with the letters \"KC\" inside the shield, was created by Shannon Manning, an artist at [[Hallmark Cards]], based in Kansas City.<ref name=\"Crowning Achievement\">Forr, James.

The first big trade was with fellow expansion team [[Seattle Pilots|Seattle]], which brought in 1969 [[MLB Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] [[Lou Piniella]].  In their inaugural game, on April 8, 1969, the Royals defeated the [[1969 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] 4-3 in 12 innings.  Two pitching stars from the [[Baltimore Orioles]] team that won the [[1966 World Series]] pitched for the Royals in the inaugural game: [[Wally Bunker]] threw the franchise's very first pitch, and [[Moe Drabowsky]] won the game in relief.  After finishing the season in  5th place, the Royals' next trade cemented a reputation as a speedy team.  Third baseman [[Joe Foy]] was traded to the [[New York Mets]] for speedy outfielder [[Amos Otis]], who would become the Royals' first star.  Further one-sided trades brought to the Royals second baseman [[Cookie Rojas]], bullpen ace [[Ted Abernathy]], shortstop [[Fred Patek]], first baseman [[John Mayberry]] and left fielder [[Hal McRae]]. The Royals also invested in a strong farm system and in the early years developed such future stars as pitchers [[Paul Splittorff]] and [[Steve Busby]], infielders [[George Brett]] and [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]], and outfielder [[Al Cowens]].\n\nIn [[1971 Major League Baseball season|1971]], the Royals had their first winning season, with manager [[Bob Lemon]] guiding them to a second-place finish. In [[1973 Major League Baseball season|1973]], under [[Jack McKeon]], the Royals adopted their iconic \"powder blue\" road uniforms and moved from [[Municipal Stadium (Kansas City)|Municipal Stadium]] to the brand-new [[Royals Stadium]]. The stadium had deep outfield walls and artificial turf, and gave future young stars the opportunity to build a playing style involving aggressive baserunning and good defense.  The stadium, part of the [[Truman Sports Complex]], was built alongside [[Arrowhead Stadium]], the home of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  Unlike many of the new stadiums going up at the time, Kansas City chose dedicated stadiums for their sports teams over one [[multi-purpose stadium]].\n[[File:Royals Stadium 1976.jpg|thumb|A game against the White Sox at Royals Stadium on September 19, 1976.]]\nManager [[Whitey Herzog]] replaced McKeon in 1975, and the Royals began their ascension to the top of the American League West. They finished [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975]] with a 91-71 record, second to the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. That season, John Mayberry finished second to Boston's [[Fred Lynn]] in the MVP voting. The [[1976 Major League Baseball season|1976 season]] brought secured dominance to the Royals. First, [[George Brett]] defeated his own teammate [[Hal McRae]] to win the batting title on the season's final day. Second, the Royals won the first of three straight Western Division championships. They lost to the [[New York Yankees]] in three straight [[American League Championship Series]] encounters, despite winning more regular season games in two of those years.  In two of those years, they lost the AL Championship Series in the ninth inning of the fifth and final game.  However, the three playoffs series helped George Brett become a superstar, as he homered three times in a losing effort in the final game of the [[1978 American League Championship Series|1978 playoff series]].  In addition to a nucleus of Brett, White, McRae, and Cowens, these Royals teams featured pitchers [[Dennis Leonard]] and [[Larry Gura]], closer [[Dan Quisenberry]], and position players [[Willie Wilson (baseball)|Willie Wilson]], [[U.L. Washington]] and [[Darrell Porter]]. The 1977 season, however, ended on another sour note as Herzog demanded that John Mayberry be traded or he would threaten to leave the team. This resulted in Mayberry being traded to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].\n\n==1980\u20131984: From pennant to pine tar==\nAfter the Royals finished in second place in 1979, Herzog was fired and replaced by [[Jim Frey]]. Most believe that the firing was due to Herzog's strained relationship with the Royals front office including General Manager [[Joe Burke (baseball executive)|Joe Burke]], owner [[Ewing Kauffman]], and Kauffman's wife, Muriel.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Under Frey, the Royals rebounded in [[1980 Major League Baseball season|1980]] and advanced to the [[1980 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], where they again faced the [[1980 New York Yankees season|Yankees]].  The team was led by Brett, who flirted with a .400 batting average and won the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP]], and Willie Wilson, who electrified crowds with stolen bases and inside-the-park home runs.\n\nIn the 1980 ALCS, the [[1980 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] finally vanquished the Yankees in a three-game sweep punctuated by a George Brett home run off Yankees' star closer [[Goose Gossage]]. Frank White was named the playoffs MVP for all-around steady play and heroics.  However, after reaching their first [[1980 World Series|World Series]], the Royals fell to the [[1980 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.  The Phillies featured future Hall of Famers [[Mike Schmidt]] and [[Steve Carlton]], as well as all-time hits leader [[Pete Rose]].  In the series, [[Willie Aikens]] became the first player in World Series history to homer twice in two separate Series games.\n\nThe Royals returned to the post-season in [[1981 Major League Baseball season|1981]], losing to the [[1981 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in a unique divisional series resulting from the split-season caused by the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike]].\n\nIn [[1983 Major League Baseball season|1983]], the [[1983 Kansas City Royals season|Royals]] were headed for a second-place finish behind the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] when they were rocked by scandals.  The first event added another chapter to the team's heated rivalry with the Yankees.  In a July game between the two teams, third baseman George Brett hit a go-ahead home run in the top of the ninth inning.  After Brett crossed home plate and returned to the dugout, Yankees manager [[Billy Martin]] complained that Brett had more [[pine tar]] on his bat than baseball's rules allowed.  After inspecting the bat, the umpires disallowed the home run and called Brett out, ending the game.  The signature image from the event was Brett storming angrily out of the dugout to argue the call.\n[[Image:George brett pine tar bat rotated.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The [[baseball bat]] used by [[George Brett]] in the [[Pine Tar Incident]] on July 24, 1983.]]\nThe second scandal of the 1983 season was far more serious, involving a truly illegal substance and several Royals players. Leadoff hitter and center fielder Willie Wilson, power-hitting first baseman Willie Aikens, power-hitting outfielder [[Jerry Martin (baseball)|Jerry Martin]], and starting pitcher [[Vida Blue]], who had been released on August 5, were charged with attempting to purchase [[cocaine]]. The four were charged in October 1983, pleaded guilty, spent three months in prison, and were suspended by commissioner [[Bowie Kuhn]] for the entire 1984 season. The four appealed and were permitted to return on May 15. In response to the scandal, owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] founded the Ewing Marion Kauffman foundation to give back to the community, allowed Martin to depart via free agency, and traded Aikens, retaining only Wilson's services.\n\nThe 1983 season was also notable for some transitional changes in the Royals organization. First, owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] sold 49% of his interest to Memphis developer [[Avron Fogelman]]. Second, [[John Schuerholz]] was named general manager. Schuerholz soon bolstered the farm system with pitchers [[Bud Black]], [[Danny Jackson]], [[Mark Gubicza]], [[David Cone]], and [[Bret Saberhagen]], as well as hitters such as [[Kevin Seitzer]].\n\nUnder the leadership of manager [[Dick Howser]], the Royals \u2013 relying on Brett's bat and the young pitching of Saberhagen, Gubicza, Bud Black, Danny Jackson, and [[Charlie Leibrandt]] \u2013 won the franchise's fifth division championship in [[1984 Major League Baseball season|1984]], although they were swept by the eventual World Series champion [[1984 Detroit Lions season|Detroit Tigers]] in the [[1984 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]\n\n==1985: \"The I-70 Series\"==\n{{main article|1985 Kansas City Royals season}}\nIn the [[1985 in baseball|1985]] regular season the Royals topped the Western Division for the sixth time in ten years, led by Bret Saberhagan's [[Cy Young Award]]-winning performance.  In the last week of the season, Brett put on an amazing hitting streak that led the Royals climb from behind to overtake the California Angels in the standings.  Throughout the ensuing playoffs, the Royals repeatedly put themselves into difficult positions, but improbably managed to escape each time.  With the Royals down two games to zero in the [[1985 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] against the [[1985 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], George Brett put on a hitting show in game three, homering in his first two at bats and then doubling to the same right field location in his third at-bat.  After falling behind 3-1 in the series, the Royals eventually rallied to win the series 4-3 (notably, the LCS had been expanded to a best-of-seven format for the first time in 1985, which allowed the Royals to survive at all).  Brett was named ALCS MVP.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Royals 85.jpg|right|thumb|George Brett and Bret Saberhagen embrace as the Kansas City Royals win their only World Championship (1985).]] -->\n\n===1985 World Series===\n{{main article|1985 World Series}}\n\nIn the 1985 World Series against the cross-state [[1985 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] &ndash; the so-called \"I-70 Series\" because the two teams are both located in the state of [[Missouri]] and connected by [[Interstate 70]] &ndash; the Royals again fell behind 3-1.  The key game in the Royals' comeback was [[1985 World Series#Game six|Game Six]].  Facing elimination, the Royals trailed 1-0 in the bottom of the ninth inning, before rallying to score two runs and win.  The rally was helped by a controversial call at first base by umpire [[Don Denkinger]], which allowed Royals outfielder [[Jorge Orta]] to reach base safely as the first baserunner of the inning.\n\nFollowing Orta's single, the Cardinals seemingly lost their concentration, dropping an easy popout and suffering a passed ball, before the Royals won with a bloop base hit by seldom used [[pinch hitter]] [[Dane Iorg]], a former utility player for the Cardinals. Following the tension and frustration of Game Six, the Cardinals came undone in [[1985 World Series#Game seven|Game Seven]], and the Royals won 11-0 to clinch the franchise's first World Series title.\n\n==1986\u20131994: Staying in the picture==\nIn [[1986 in baseball|1986]], the Royals fell suddenly from contender status.  They also made one of the worst trades in franchise history, trading native Kansas Citian and future perennial All-Star [[David Cone]] for [[Ed Hearn (catcher)|Ed Hearn]].  Hearn played for less than a month in Kansas City.  The Royals were the trendy pre-season pick to return to the World Series in [[1987 in baseball|1987]], but the season proved bittersweet for the Royals.  The team won 83 out of 162 games (a seven win improvement from 1986), and wound up finishing two games behind the eventual World Champion [[Minnesota Twins]] in the Western Division.  Further, on June 17, 1987, Dick Howser died after a year-long battle with [[brain cancer]].  Howser's #10 soon became the first number that the Royals retired.  Also in 1987, the team released longtime star [[Hal McRae]] and selected [[John Wathan]] as its new manager in midseason after firing [[Billy Gardner]].\n[[File:George Brett 1990 CROP.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Brett]] bats during a 1990 game at [[Royals Stadium]].]]\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Royals developed young stars such as [[Bo Jackson]], [[Tom Gordon]], and [[Kevin Seitzer]], made some successful free-agent acquisitions, and generally posted winning records, but always fell short of the post-season.  For example, in [[1989 in baseball|1989]], the Royals won 92 games and posted the third-best record in baseball, but did not qualify for the playoffs, finishing second in their division behind the eventual World Series champion Oakland Athletics.  They also traded their star pitchers for questionable talent:  Charlie Leibrandt for [[Gerald Perry]], Bud Black for [[Pat Tabler]], Danny Jackson for [[Kurt Stillwell]], and Bret Saberhagen for [[Kevin McReynolds]], [[Gregg Jefferies]] and [[Keith Miller]].\n\nAt the end of the 1989 season, the team boasted a powerhouse pitching rotation, including the AL [[Cy Young Award]]-winner Bret Saberhagen (who set franchise record 23 [[Win\u2013loss record (pitching)|wins]] that year), two-time All-Star Mark Gubicza (a 15-game winner in 1989) and 1989 AL [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] runner-up Tom Gordon (who won 17 games that year).<ref name=\"Royals lineup\">{{cite news | last = Horst | first = Craig | title = Royals' lineup for 1990 is virtually set | page = 15 | work = The Daily Union | date = March 25, 1990 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XahEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ErYMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1247,6829820&dq=1990+royals&hl=en | accessdate = April 18, 2012 }}</ref> But the organization felt it was still missing a few necessary pieces to give its divisional rival Oakland Athletics a run for their money.<ref name=\"Cautionary\">{{cite web |url=http://kingsofkauffman.com/2011/12/17/the-cautionary-tale-of-the-1990-royals/ |title=The Cautionary Tale of the 1990 Royals |author=Engel, Michael |publisher=FanSided |date=December 17, 2011 |work= Kings of Kauffman |accessdate=April 17, 2012 }}</ref> For one thing, the Royals had been without a high-caliber closing pitcher since All-Star [[Dan Quisenberry]] was dropped in 1988.

To make matters worse Bo Jackson \u2013 the team's potential future franchise player \u2013 suffered a devastating hip injury while playing football in the off-season, so the Royals waived him during spring training in 1991.<ref>{{cite news | last = Horst | first = Craig| title = Bo no go, waive star | page = 2B | work =Kentucky New Era | agency=Associated Press | date = March 19, 1991 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1t0rAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gWQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3785,1631264&dq=kansas+city+royals+1991+preview&hl=en | accessdate = October 3, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany of the team's highlights from this era instead centered on the end of Brett's career, such as his third and final batting title in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] \u2013 which made him the first player to win batting titles in three different decades &ndash; and his [[3,000 hit club|3,000th hit]].  Though the team dropped out of contention from 1990 to [[1992 in baseball|1992]], through the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened 1994 season]], the Royals still could generally be counted on to post winning records.  The 1994 season was the club's last flirtation with greatness for two decades.  Led by manager Hal McRae and Cy Young Award-winner David Cone (whom owner Ewing Kauffman had re-signed), the Royals had a fourteen-game winning streak just before the season ended prematurely due to the players' strike.\n\n==1995\u20132002: Decline in the post-Kauffman era==\nAt the start of the 1990s, the Royals had been hit with a double-whammy when [[General Manager]] [[John Schuerholz]] departed in [[1990 in baseball|1990]] and team owner [[Ewing Kauffman]] died in [[1993 in baseball|1993]].  Kauffman's death left the franchise without permanent ownership until [[Wal-Mart]] executive [[David Glass (businessman)|David Glass]] purchased the team for $96 million in 2000.\n\nPartly because of the resulting lack of leadership, after the [[1994 in baseball|1994 season]] the Royals decided to reduce payroll by trading pitcher [[David Cone]] (again) and outfielder [[Brian McRae]], then continued their salary dump in the [[1995 in baseball|1995]] season.  In fact, the team payroll, which was always among the league's highest, was sliced from $40.5 million in 1994 (fourth-highest in the major leagues) to $18.5 million in [[1996 Major League Baseball season|1996]] (second-lowest in the major leagues).<ref name=salary>{{Cite news | last = Dutton | first = Bob | title = Royals to Open 2010 Season With $70.1 million Payroll | newspaper = Kansas City Star | date = April 4, 2010 | url = http://www.kansascity.com/2010/04/04/1856456/royals-to-open-2010-season-with.html | accessdate = 2010-04-05}}</ref><ref name=USAToday>{{Cite news | title = USA Today Salaries Database | newspaper = USA Today | url = http://content.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/salaries/totalpayroll.aspx?year=1996 | accessdate = 2010-04-05 | date=October 24, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1997 in baseball|1997]], the Royals franchise had the opportunity to switch to the [[National League]] and play in the [[National League Central|NL Central]] alongside its intrastate rival [[St. Louis Cardinals]].<ref name=\"NL\">Mellinger, Sam. [http://origin.miami.com/mld/kansascity/sports/17348279.htm?source=rss&channel=kansascity_sports NL grass looks greener now] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121954/http://origin.miami.com/mld/kansascity/sports/17348279.htm?source=rss&channel=kansascity_sports |date=2007-09-29 }} ''Kansas City Star'', 10 June 2007.</ref>  The opportunity arose because [[Major League Baseball]] was planning to realign the divisions in preparation for expansion with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]].  [[Bud Selig]], baseball's acting commissioner and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] owner, gave the Royals the first option to change to the National League.  That summer, the Royals were mired in the team's worst season since its second year of existence.  Further, following Ewing Kauffman death, the franchise was being run by a board of directors and was up for sale.  Ultimately, the board declined the move, and Milwaukee switched leagues instead.<ref name=\"NL\"/>\n\nSome commentators have argued that the Royals should have made the move.  According to their logic, if the Royals had changed leagues, the team would have played the Cardinals more often and would have been in the same division with the [[Chicago Cubs]]; these teams might have drawn bigger crowds to [[Kauffman Stadium]].<ref name=\"NL\"/>  Further, with no [[designated hitter]] in the National League, there would have been one less big salary to pay,<ref name=\"NL\"/> which would have been easier for the Royals' front office to manage.  Opinion at the time was fairly split. The Royals polled their fans, and reported that a slight majority of the 1,500 who returned surveys approved a move to the NL. Many fans, including former Royal [[Greg Pryor]], thought that switching leagues was the only way to keep the Royals in Kansas City.<ref name=\"NL\"/>  On the other hand, there was also a strong sentiment among some fans that Kansas City was, is, and always would be an American League market.  Back then, the glory years weren\u2019t that far removed, and the emotional tie to the rivalry with the Yankees, for instance, was still burning.<ref name=\"NL\"/>  There was nothing in Kauffman's will or known feelings about how he would have received a move to the National League.<ref name=\"NL\"/>\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, attendance at Royals games slid while the average MLB salary continued to rise, and the Royals found it difficult to retain their remaining stars.  The team decided to trade players such as [[Kevin Appier]], [[Johnny Damon]] and [[Jermaine Dye]] for prospects rather than pay higher salaries or lose them to free agency.  By 1999, the Royals' payroll had fallen again to $16.5 million.<ref name=salary/>  Making matters worse, most of the younger players that the Royals received in exchange for these All-Stars proved of little value, setting the stage for an extended downward spiral.\n\nIn [[1999 in baseball|1999]], the Royals set a franchise low with a .398 winning percentage (64-97 record), and lost 97 games again in [[2001 in baseball|2001]].  The records could have been even worse without the rapid development of center fielder [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] (Rookie of the Year in 1999) and first baseman [[Mike Sweeney]].\n\nIn [[2002 in baseball|2002]], the Royals set a new team record for futility, losing 100 games for the first time in franchise history.  The team also introduced new black and dark blue jerseys for alternate games, and also sleeveless home jerseys.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/page2/s/newlook/royals/uniforms.html Kansas City Royals new uniforms (2002)] ''ESPN.com'' \u2013 ''Page 2''</ref>  The jerseys were met with mixed reactions in Kansas City, and eventually, by the 2006 season, the Royals again changed their uniforms back to their \"old\" style.<ref name=\"Royals unveil\">[http://kansascity.royals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060127&content_id=1302088&vkey=news_kc&fext=.jsp&c_id=kc Royals unveil new uniforms in 2006] ''MLB.com'', 27 January 2006.</ref>\n\n==2003: A winning season==\nThe [[2003 Kansas City Royals season|2003 season]] saw a temporary end to the losing, when manager Tony Pe\u00f1a, in his first full season with the club, guided the team to its first winning record (83\u201379) since 1994 and finished in third place in the AL Central. He was named the American League [[Manager of the Year Award|Manager of the Year]] for his efforts, and shortstop [[\u00c1ngel Berroa]] was named [[AL Rookie of the Year]].\n\n==2004\u20132012: Rock bottom==\nFrom the [[2004 Kansas City Royals season|2004 season]] through the [[2012 Kansas City Royals season|2012 season]], the Royals posted nine consecutive losing records \u2013 the longest streak in team history.  In six of those seasons the team finished in last place in the American League Central, and in eight of those nine seasons the team also lost at least 90 games.  The worst seasons came in 2004\u20132006, when the Royals lost at least 100 games each year and set the franchise's all-time record for losses (56\u2013106 in [[2005 Kansas City Royals season|2005]]).\n\nPicked by many to win their division in [[2004 in baseball|2004]] after faring surprisingly well in the free agent market, the Royals got off to a disappointing start and by late June again were in rebuilding mode, releasing veteran reliever [[Curtis Leskanic]] before financial incentives kicked in and trading veteran reliever [[Jason Grimsley]] and superstar center fielder [[Carlos Beltr\u00e1n]] for prospects, all within a week of each other.  The team subsequently fell apart completely, establishing a new low by losing 104 games.  Worse yet, the younger players received in these trades again did little to immediately restock the team or its farm system, although [[Mark Teahen]], acquired in the Beltr\u00e1n trade, would blossom in [[2006 in baseball|2006]] (following a brief demotion to the minor leagues).\n\nIn [[2005 in baseball|2005]], the Royals continued their youth movement, with the second-lowest payroll in the Major Leagues.<ref name=USAToday/>  Six of the team's starting position players, three of the five starting pitchers, and the setup man and closer were all under the age of 30.  After posting a miserable 8-25 record to start the season, Tony Pe\u00f1a resigned as manager on May 10; [[Buddy Bell]] was hired to replace him three weeks later.  During that season, the Royals suffered a franchise record 19-game losing streak highlighted by a three-game stretch of blowout losses at home from August 6 through August 9; in that stretch the Royals lost 16-1 to the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the first game, were shut out 11-0 by Oakland in the second game, and then in the third game, against the [[Cleveland Indians]], built a 7-2 lead in the ninth inning before allowing 11 runs to lose 13-7.  The Royals finally ended their losing streak at 19 on August 20, two losses short of the American League record, with a 2-1 win over the Oakland Athletics.  The Royals ended the 2005 season with a 56-106 record (.346), a full 43 games out of first place.  It was the third time in four seasons that the team reestablished the mark for worst record in the history of the franchise.  The team finished the season 10th in the American League in hitting (.263 AVG), 12th in runs scored (702) and last in pitching (5.49 ERA).\n\nLooking for a quick turnaround, General Manager [[Allard Baird]] signed several veteran players prior to the 2006 season. He secured starting pitchers [[Mark Redman]], [[Joe Mays]] and [[Scott Elarton]].  Baird also signed free agent second baseman [[Mark Grudzielanek]], first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] and inked veteran [[Reggie Sanders]] to a two-year, $10 million deal.  Although the new players seemed promising, they did not result in many additional wins.  The Royals struggled through another 100-loss season in [[2006 in baseball|2006]], becoming just the 11th team in major league history to lose 100 games in three straight seasons.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Following a major-league worst 13-37 start, the Royals fired Baird on May 31 and announced that [[Atlanta Braves]] assistant general manager [[Dayton Moore]] would be the team's new GM.  [[Muzzy Jackson]] served as interim GM for the Royals, handling the [[Major League Baseball Draft|first-year player draft]], before Moore took over on June 8.\n\nOne problem often cited by commentators for the losing of those seasons was a lack of financial support from the team's owner, David Glass.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120907190926/http://www.pitch.com/2006-03-30/news/is-david-glass-smoking-grass/ \"Is David Glass Smoking Grass?\"]</ref>  For the first six years Glass owned the Royals (prior to the 2000 season) the team payroll was never higher than 21st in the major leagues, and it was in the league's bottom six payrolls on five occasions.<ref name=USAToday/>  Glass and the Royals also faced a minor controversy off the field in 2006, when the team revoked the credentials of two radio journalists present at the press conference introducing Moore.  The two personalities \u2013 Bob Fescoe of [[WHB]] at the time and Rhonda Moss of [[KCSP (AM)|KCSP]] \u2013 primarily asked pointed questions toward Glass over the firing of Baird.  The aftermath included less than positive commentary from other media outlets in the metro and a statement from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] [http://www.spj.org/news.asp?ref=591 calling for the reinstatement of their credentials].  In response, the Royals started a [[weblog]]; the first entry defended the organization's decision.\n\nKansas City entered the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] looking to rebound from four out of five seasons ending with at least 100 losses, and appeared to be opening up its wallet a bit, with a payroll exceeding $60 million for the first time (rising to 22nd-highest in the major leagues).<ref name=salary/><ref name=USAToday/>  The Royals outbid the Cubs and Blue Jays for free agent righty [[Gil Meche]], signing him to five-year, $55 million contract.  Reliever [[Octavio Dotel]] also inked a one-year, $5 million contract.  The team also added several new prospects, including [[Alex Gordon]] and [[Billy Butler (baseball)|Billy Butler]]. Among [[Dayton Moore]]'s first acts as General Manager was instating a new motto for the team: \"True. Blue. Tradition.\"<ref>Flanagan, Jeffrey.

The uniforms were introduced on December 6, 2007, at a special event for season ticket holders and were modeled by current players such as [[Alex Gordon]] and former players such as [[Frank White (baseball)|Frank White]].<ref name=\"powder blues\"/>\n[[Image:Zack Greinke on July 29, 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Zack Greinke]] didn't allow an earned run in the first 24 innings of the 2009 season.]]\nThe Royals began the 2008 season 3-0 with a sweep over the [[Detroit Tigers]], a team that many thought might win the AL pennant.  Through 13 games, the Royals were 8-5 and in first place, a vast improvement over their 3-10 start from the previous season.  However, by the All-Star break, the Royals were again in losing territory, with their record buoyed only by a 13-5 record in inter-league play, the best in the American League.  During the season many players from the minors came up and made their presence felt including [[Ryan Shealy]], [[Mitch Maier]] and [[Mike Avil\u00e9s]].  The team finished the season in fourth place with a 75-87 record.  It was the first time in five years the Royals did not finish last in their division and did not lose 93 or more games. \n\nPrior to the [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009 season]], the Royals renovated Kauffman Stadium.  After the season began, the Royals ended April at the top of the AL Central, all of which raised excitement levels among fans.  However, the team faded as the season progressed and finished the year with a final record of 65-97, in a last-place tie in its division (tied with the Cleveland Indians).\n\nThe 2009 season was highlighted by starter [[Zack Greinke]], who didn't allow an earned run in the first 24 innings of the season, went on to finish the year with a major league-leading 2.16 [[earned run average]], and won the American League [[Cy Young Award]].  Greinke joined Bret Saberhagen (in 1985 and 1989) and David Cone (in 1994) as the only three players in Royals history to receive the award.  He also set a club record 15 strikeouts in a single game against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nThe following year, in 2010, the Royals began with a rocky start, and after the team's record fell to 12-23, general manager Dayton Moore fired manager Trey Hillman.  After Hillman's departure, former [[Milwaukee Brewers]] manager [[Ned Yost]] took over as manager.  Despite the change, the Royals finished with a 67-95 record, in last place in the division for the sixth time in seven years.\n[[File:NewKauffman.jpg|right|thumb|Kauffman Stadium underwent renovations in 2009, including the addition of a [[high-definition television|high-definition]] scoreboard.]]\nIn contrast to 2010, the Royals began the 2011 season with a hot start, tying for the best record in the American League with a 10\u20134 record after fourteen games. The quick start followed a successful [[spring training]] season for the Royals.  Success faded as the season progressed, however.  The Royals last had a .500 record at 22-22, and then lost five games in a row.  By the All-Star break, the Royals had a record of 37-54, the worst in the American League.  On a more positive note, the season also saw the emergence of rookies such as [[Eric Hosmer]] and [[Aaron Crow]], the team's representative in the [[2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2011 All-Star game]], as well as Alex Gordon's breakout year in left field, which resulted in him receiving a Gold Glove for his excellent display of defense and league leading 20 assists. The team ended with a fourth-place finish.\n\n==2013\u20132014: Return to contention==\nOn December 10, 2012, in an attempt to strengthen the pitching staff (which was among the worst in baseball in 2012), the Royals traded for Rays pitchers [[James Shields (baseball)|James Shields]] and [[Wade Davis (baseball)|Wade Davis]] for Royals top prospect [[Wil Myers]] and three others.  This trade helped catalyze a return to winning records.\n\nThe [[2013 Kansas City Royals season|2013 season]] got off to a very good start, as the Royals remained over .500 nearly most of April during regular season play. The team also didn't commit an error in its first seven games (for 64 2/3 innings) for the first time in team history. On September 22, the Royals won their 82nd game of the season, to clinch their first winning season since 2003. The Royals finished the season 86-76, in third place in the AL Central, securing the team's best winning percentage since 1994.\n\nThe [[2014 Kansas City Royals season|2014 season]] was even more successful, featuring a return to the post-season for the first time in 29 years. On July 21, the Royals had a losing record (48\u201350) and were 8 games behind the [[2014 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] in the AL Central standings.  But spurred by a 22\u20135 record from July 22 to August 19, the Royals surged into first place in the AL Central.  The Royals reached the top of the division standings on August 11, after winning their eighth game in a row.<ref name=KCS2014>{{cite news  | last = McCullough | first = Andy |url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/mlb/kansas-city-royals/article1199725.html |title=Royals reclaim first place in Central with 3-2 victory over Oakland | newspaper = [[Kansas City Star]] | date=August 11, 2014 | accessdate=August 18, 2014}}</ref>  This marked the latest date the Royals had led their division since August 29, 2003.<ref name=KCS2014/>  After taking over first place on August 11, the Royals retained the division lead for a month, falling out of first place permanently on September 12. The Royals finished the regular season one game behind Detroit in the AL Central, but secured the franchise's first ever [[Major League Baseball wild card|wild card berth]] and first playoff appearance in 29 years.\n\nThe team's final regular season record of 89\u201373 in 2014 represented the most wins for the Royals since [[1989 Kansas City Royals season|1989]]. Coupled with a ten-game winning streak in June 2014, the Royals' eight-game winning streak in August 2014 was the second streak of at least that long during the same season, something the franchise had accomplished only three times previously \u2013 in 1977, 1978, and 1980.\n\nThe Royals made the most of that playoff run in 2014, going a record 8\u20130 for the first three rounds. They defeated the [[2014 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[2014 American League Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], then swept both the [[2014 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] and the [[2014 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[2014 American League Division Series|ALDS]] and [[2014 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], respectively. However, the Royals fell a win short in the [[2014 World Series|World Series]], losing to the [[2014 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in seven games.\n\n==2015: Second World Series Championship==\n{{main article|2015 Kansas City Royals season}}\n\nEnergized by the previous season's playoff run, the 2015 Royals won the [[American League Central]], earning their first division title since 1985. In the [[2015 American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the [[2015 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], the Royals trailed in the series 2\u20131, and were on the verge of elimination after trailing by four runs heading into the eighth inning of Game 4. However, Kansas City scored seven runs in the final two innings to force a deciding game, before eliminating the Astros to advance to the [[2015 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. In a rematch of the 1985 ALCS against the [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], the Royals shut down Toronto's high-powered offense, winning the series in six games and advancing to their second straight World Series.\n\n===2015 World Series===\n{{main article|2015 World Series}}\nIn the 2015 World Series against the [[2015 New York Mets season|New York Mets]], the Royals continued to live up to their reputation as clutch performers. In Game 1, Alex Gordon tied the game in the bottom of the ninth inning with a home run, before [[Eric Hosmer]] drove in a game-winning sacrifice fly in the 14th inning. In Game 4, with the Mets on the verge of tying the series, the Royals scored three runs (one unearned) in the eighth inning to send them to within a game of the championship. Then in Game 5, with the Mets three outs away from forcing Game 6, the Royals scored two runs to tie the game, before  seldom-used infielder [[Christian Col\u00f3n]] drove in the go-ahead run in the 12th inning, helping Kansas City win 7\u20132 and clinch their second World Series championship. All Star catcher Salvador P\u00e9rez was named Series MVP for his clutch hitting and excellent pitch calling.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kansas City Royals Baseball Academy]]\n* [[List of Kansas City Royals seasons]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.Royals.com Official Website of the Kansas City Royals]\n\n{{MLBHistory}}\n{{Kansas City Royals}}\n\n[[Category:Kansas City Royals]]\n[[Category:History of Major League Baseball by team|Kansas City Royals]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: weren\u2019t \u2192 weren't, 6-1 \u2192 6\u20131 (18), 3-1 \u2192 3\u20131 (7)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Kansas_City_Royals"}

Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single.{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}} It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, Ziggy Stardust is ''not'' the Starman but merely his earthly messenger \u2013 contrary to received opinion which often paints Ziggy as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}} The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). The chorus is loosely based on [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on the word \"Starman\" is identical to that on the word \"Somewhere\" in \"Over the Rainbow\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Trynka|first=Paul|title=Starman: David Bowie \u2013 The Definitive Biography|year=2011|publisher=Sphere|location=London|isbn=978-0751542936}}</ref> Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland]]'s \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie\u2019s career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nAccording to [[Acclaimed Music]], it is the 360th most celebrated song in popular music history, and the 11th most from 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|title=Starman ranked 360th most celebrated song|work=Acclaimed Music|access-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304055031/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|archive-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews, [[John Peel]] for example calling it \"a classic, a gem\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Harvey |url=http://www.5years.com/release.htm |title=The Ziggy Stardust Companion \u2013 The Release |publisher=5years.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811085542/http://5years.com/release.htm |archive-date=11 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Its turning point came when Bowie scored a place on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in July 1972 and sang \"Starman\".

Although this performance, recorded on 5 July 1972 and broadcast on 6 July, is often cited as being the first UK TV performance of the song, it had in fact been performed on ITV's ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'' three weeks earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.5years.com/loa.htm |title=The Ziggy Stardust Companion: Lift off with Ayshea \u2013 15 June 1972 |publisher=5years.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225015158/http://5years.com/loa.htm |archive-date=25 December 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe \"Starman\" single remained in the UK charts for 11 weeks.

Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single.{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}} It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n==Music and lyrics==\nThe lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973, Ziggy Stardust is ''not'' the Starman but merely his earthly messenger \u2013 contrary to received opinion which often paints Ziggy as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]].{{sfn|Pegg|2000|pp=276\u2013277}} The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). The chorus is loosely based on [[Harold Arlen]]'s \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on the word \"Starman\" is identical to that on the word \"Somewhere\" in \"Over the Rainbow\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Trynka|first=Paul|title=Starman: David Bowie \u2013 The Definitive Biography|year=2011|publisher=Sphere|location=London|isbn=978-0751542936}}</ref> Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[Holland\u2013Dozier\u2013Holland]]'s \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Pegg|2000|p=203}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie\u2019s career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nAccording to [[Acclaimed Music]], it is the 360th most celebrated song in popular music history, and the 11th most from 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|title=Starman ranked 360th most celebrated song|work=Acclaimed Music|access-date=15 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304055031/http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/song/S800.htm|archive-date=4 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews, [[John Peel]] for example calling it \"a classic, a gem\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Michael Harvey |url=http://www.5years.com/release.htm |title=The Ziggy Stardust Companion \u2013 The Release |publisher=5years.com |date= |accessdate=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811085542/http://5years.com/release.htm |archive-date=11 August 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Its turning point came when Bowie scored a place on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in July 1972 and sang \"Starman\".

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively. The [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]] and [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]] elections were other two [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|presidential elections in which Democrats won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College]] (the Democrats candidates were [[Samuel J. Tilden]] and Grover Cleveland). Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V.

After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256.

However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]].<ref>Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n== The presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853\u201357) and James Buchanan (1857\u201361) ==\n[[file:Augustbelmont.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|August Belmont: DNC Chair for 12 years during and after the Civil war]]\n\nThe eight years during which Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan held the presidency were disasters; historians agree that they rank as among the worst presidents.

Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]. They sought independence from European standards of [[high culture]] and wanted to demonstrate the excellence and [[exceptionalism]] of [[American literature|America's own literary tradition]].<ref>Yonatan Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861'', (2007)</ref>\n\nIn economic policy, Young America saw the necessity of a modern infrastructure with railroads, canals, telegraphs, turnpikes and harbors. They endorsed the \"[[market revolution]]\" and promoted [[capitalism]]. They called for Congressional land grants to the states, which allowed Democrats to claim that [[internal improvements]] were locally rather than federally sponsored. Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue. They supported the [[Independent Treasury]] (the Jacksonian alternative to the Second Bank of the United States) not as a scheme to quash the special privilege of the Whiggish monied elite, but as a device to spread prosperity to all [[Americans]].<ref>Eyal, ''The Young America Movement and the Transformation of the Democratic Party, 1828\u20131861,'' p. 79</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of the Second Party System (1854\u20131859) ===\nSectional confrontations escalated during the 1850s, the Democratic Party split between [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]] grew deeper. The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis. ''Northern Men with Southern Loyalties: The Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis'' (2014).</ref>\n\nWhen the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]] from 1848) joined it.

They were later joined by those who, once again led by the Fire-Eaters, left the [[1860 Democratic National Convention#Baltimore convention|Baltimore Convention]] the following June when the convention rejected a resolution supporting extending slavery into territories whose voters did not want it.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime. Consequently, the Democratic Party halted all operations during the life of the Confederacy (1861\u20131865).<ref name=\"Jennifer L. Weber 2006\">Jennifer L. Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref>\n\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].<ref name=\"Jennifer L.

Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade, as national prohibition was finally passed in 1918 (repealed in 1932), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry Republicans.<ref name=\"Kleppner 1979\"/>\n\n=== 1908: \"Yet another farewell tour\"  ===\nWith the wildly popular President Roosevelt sticking to his promise to step down after seven and a half years, and his chosen successor, War Secretary [[William Howard Taft]] somewhat popular as well, the Democratic Party gave Bryan the nomination for a third time. He was again defeated. The Democrats held together while the Republican Party bitterly split between the Roosevelt-oriented progressives and the Taft-oriented conservatives. Taft defeated Roosevelt for the 1912 nomination, but he ran as a third-party candidate.

Furthermore, bipartisan [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendments for prohibition]] and [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|women's suffrage]] were passed in his second term. In effect, Wilson laid to rest the issues of tariffs, money and antitrust that had dominated politics for 40 years.<ref name=\"John Milton Cooper 2009\"/>\n\nWilson oversaw the U.S. role in [[World War I]] and helped write the [[Versailles Treaty]], which included the [[League of Nations]]. However, in 1919 Wilson's political skills faltered and suddenly everything turned sour.

In addition, there was growing support among the more recent immigrants, who had become more Americanized. Many ethnic families now had a veteran in their midst, and paid closer attention to national issues, such as the question of [[World War Adjusted Compensation Act|a bonus for veterans]].

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B.

In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F.

His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J.

Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The act was passed in both House and Senate by a Republican majority and support from Democrats in Northern and Western states. Many Democrats and Republicans from the South opposed the act. The year 1968 marked a major crisis for the party. In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night. Even as Kennedy won California, Humphrey had already amassed 1,000 of the 1,312 delegate votes needed for the nomination, while Kennedy had about 700.<ref>Palermo, ''In His Own Right'' (2001)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]], while the [[Chicago Police Department]] and the [[Illinois Army National Guard]] violently confronted anti-war protesters on the streets and parks of Chicago, the Democrats nominated Humphrey. Meanwhile, Alabama's Democratic governor [[George C. Wallace]] launched a third-party campaign and at one point was running second to the Republican candidate Richard Nixon. Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress.

McGovern's forces at the national convention ousted Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]] and the entire Chicago delegation, replacing them with insurgents led by [[Jesse Jackson]]. After it became known that McGovern's running mate [[Thomas Eagleton]] had received electric shock therapy, McGovern said he supported Eagleton \"1000%\", but he was soon forced to drop him and find a new running mate.<ref>Theodore H.

His only experience with federal politics was when he chaired the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial elections in 1974. Some of Carter's major accomplishments consisted of the creation of a national energy policy and the consolidation of governmental agencies, resulting in two new cabinet departments, the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education]]. Carter also successfully deregulated the trucking, airline, rail, finance, communications and oil industries (thus backtracking on the New Deal approach to regulation of the economy), bolstered the [[social security]] system and appointed record numbers of women and minorities to significant government and judicial posts. He also enacted strong legislation on environmental protection through the expansion of the [[National Park Service]] in [[Alaska]], creating 103 million acres (417,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of park land.<ref>Gary M. Fink, and Hugh Davis Graham, eds. ''The Carter presidency: Policy choices in the post-New Deal era'' (University Press of Kansas, 1998).</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, Carter's accomplishments consisted of the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the establishment of [[China\u2013United States relations|full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China]] and the negotiation of the [[SALT II]] Treaty. In addition, he championed [[human rights]] throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\">John Dumbrell, ''The Carter presidency: A re-evaluation'' (Manchester University Press, 1995)</ref>\n\nEven with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\"/> After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.<ref>David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989) ==\n=== 1980s: Battling Reaganism ===\n[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977\u20131987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. The \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B.

The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated).

During the [[Second Party System]] (from 1832 to the mid-1850s) under [[President of the United States|Presidents]] [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]] and [[James K. Polk]], the Democrats usually bested the opposition [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] by narrow margins.\n\nFrom 1860 to 1932 in the era of the [[American Civil War]] to the [[Great Depression]], the opposing [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], organized in the mid-1850s from the ruins of the Whig Party and some other smaller splinter groups, was dominant in [[United States presidential election|presidential politics]]. The Democrats elected [[List of United States Presidents|only two Presidents]] during this period: [[Grover Cleveland]] (in 1884 and 1892) and [[Woodrow Wilson]] (in 1912 and 1916). Over the same period, the Democrats proved more competitive with the Republicans in [[United States midterm election|Congressional politics]], enjoying [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] majorities (as in the [[65th United States Congress|65th Congress]]) in 15 of the 36 [[United States Congress|Congresses]] elected, although only in five of these did they form the majority in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was split between the [[Bourbon Democrat]]s, representing Eastern business interests; and the agrarian elements comprising poor farmers in the South and West. The agrarian element, marching behind the slogan of [[free silver]] (i.e. in favor of inflation), captured the party in 1896 and nominated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the 1896, 1900 and 1908 presidential elections, although he lost every time. Both Bryan and Wilson were leaders of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement in the United States]] (1890s\u20131920s).\n\n[[File:Andrew jackson head.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Andrew Jackson]], founder of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the first [[President of the United States|President]] to be elected from the Democratic Party (1829\u20131837)]]\nStarting with 32nd President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1932 during the Great Depression, the party dominated the [[Fifth Party System]], with its [[Social liberalism|progressive liberal]] policies and programs with the [[New Deal coalition]] to combat the emergency bank closings and the continuing financial depression since the famous [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and later going into the crises leading up to [[World War II]]. The Democrats and the Democratic Party finally lost the [[White House]] and control of the executive branch of government only after Roosevelt's death in April 1945 near the end of the war and after the continuing post-war administration of Roosevelt's third [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], former [[United States Senator|Senator]] from Missouri (for 1945 to 1953, elections of [[1944 United States presidential election|1944]] and the \"stunner\" of [[1948 United States presidential election|1948]]). A new [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] President was only elected later in the following decade of the early 1950s with the losses by two-time nominee, the [[Governor of Illinois]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] (grandson of the [[Adlai Stevenson I|former Vice President with the same name]] of the [[1892 United States presidential election|1890s]]) to the very popular war hero and commanding general in World War II, [[General of the Army (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]]).\n\nWith two brief interruptions since the Great Depression and World War II eras, the Democrats with unusually large majorities for over four decades, controlled the lower house of the Congress in the House of Representatives from 1930 until 1994 and the Senate for most of that same period, electing the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and the Representatives' majority leaders/committee chairs along with the upper house of the Senate's majority leaders and committee chairmen. Important Democratic progressive/liberal leaders included 33rd and 36th Presidents Harry S. Truman of [[Missouri]] (1945\u20131953) and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] of [[Texas]] (1963\u20131969), respectively; and the earlier [[Kennedy family|Kennedy brothers]] of 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] of [[Massachusetts]] (1961\u20131963), Senators [[Robert F. Kennedy]] of [[New York State|New York]] and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] of Massachusetts who carried the flag for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]]. Since the [[1976 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1976]], Democrats have won five out of the last eleven presidential elections, winning in the presidential elections of [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] (with 39th President [[Jimmy Carter]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1977\u20131981), [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]] (with 42nd President [[Bill Clinton]] of [[Arkansas]], 1993\u20132001) and [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] (with 44th President [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]], 2009\u20132017). Democrats have also won the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], but lost the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] with [[Al Gore]] and [[Hillary Clinton]], respectively.

Social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue that \"the Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s\".<ref>{{cite book|first1=Theodore|last1=Caplow|first2=Howard M.|last2=Bahr|first3=Bruce A.|last3=Chadwick|first4=John|last4=Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960\u20131990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337|isbn=9780773512122}} They add: \"The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s.</ref>\n\n== Foundation: 1820-28 ==\nThe modern Democratic Party emerged in the late 1820s from former factions of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which had largely collapsed by 1824. It was built by [[Martin Van Buren]], who assembled a cadre of politicians in every state behind war hero [[Andrew Jackson]] of Tennessee.<ref>Robert V.

After the disappearance of the [[Federalist party|Federalists]] after 1815 and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] (1816\u20131824), there was a hiatus of weakly organized personal factions until about 1828\u20131832, when the modern Democratic Party emerged along with its rival, the Whigs. The new Democratic Party became a coalition of farmers, city-dwelling laborers and Irish Catholics.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005)</ref> Both parties worked hard to build [[grassroots]] organizations and maximize the turnout of voters, which often reached 80 percent or 90 percent of eligible voters. Both parties used [[Patronage#Politics|patronage]] extensively to finance their operations, which included emerging big city [[political machine]]s as well as national networks of newspapers.<ref>Michael Kazin, ed., ''The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (2011) pp 59-65, 159-62, 600-603.</ref>\n\nBehind the party platforms, acceptance speeches of candidates, editorials, pamphlets and stump speeches, there was a widespread consensus of political values among Democrats. As Mary Beth Norton explains: <blockquote>The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] concept of an [[agrarian society]]. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \"[[Corrupt Bargain|corrupt bargain]]\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. [...] Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual \u2013 the artisan and the ordinary farmer \u2013 by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of [[Banknote|paper currency]], which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like [[Education reform|educational reform]] and the establishment of a public education system....Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], initiating the removal of the [[Cherokee]]s along the [[Trail of Tears]].<ref>Mary Beth Norton et al., ''A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877'' (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p. 287</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe party was weakest in [[New England]], but strong everywhere else and won most national elections thanks to strength in [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] (by far the most populous states at the time) and the [[American frontier]]. Democrats opposed elites and aristocrats, the [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] and the whiggish modernizing programs that would build up industry at the expense of the [[yeoman]] or independent small farmer.<ref>John Ashworth, ''\"Agrarians\" & \"Aristocrats\": Party Political Ideology in the United States, 1837\u20131846'' (1983).</ref>\n\nThe party was known for its populism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://utpress.org/title/andrew-jackson-and-the-rise-of-the-democratic-party/|title=Andrew Jackson and the Rise of the Democratic Party - University of Tennessee Press|publisher=}}</ref> Historian Frank Towers has specified an important ideological divide: <blockquote>Democrats stood for the 'sovereignty of the people' as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown's Impact on the Study of Urban Politics in the Early Republic.\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 107 (Winter 2012) pp. 469\u201375, p. 472, citing Robert E, Shalhope, ''The Baltimore Bank Riot: Political Upheaval in Antebellum Maryland'' (2009) p. 147.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt its inception, the Democratic Party was the party of the \"common man\".<ref name=\"auto1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blognetwork/edgeofthewest/2013/04/10/wait-whose-plantation-now/|title=Wait, Whose Plantation Now? - The Edge of the American West|first=David|last=Silbey|website=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}</ref> It opposed the abolition of slavery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/12/8/7328755/maps-democratic-party|title=23 maps that explain how Democrats went from the party of racism to the party of Obama|first=Andrew|last=Prokop|date=8 December 2014|website=Vox}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nFrom 1828 to 1848, banking and tariffs were the central domestic policy issues. Democrats strongly favored\u2014and Whigs opposed\u2014expansion to new farm lands, as typified by their expulsion of eastern [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and acquisition of vast amounts of new land in the West after 1846. The party favored the [[Mexican\u2013American War|war with Mexico]] and opposed anti-immigrant [[nativism (politics)|nativism]]. In the 1830s, the [[Locofocos]] in New York City were radically democratic, anti-monopoly and were proponents of [[Hard money (policy)|hard money]] and [[free trade]].<ref>Earle (2004), p. 19</ref><ref>Taylor (2006), p. 54</ref> Their chief spokesman was [[William Leggett (USA)|William Leggett]]. At this time, [[labor union]]s were few and some were loosely affiliated with the party.<ref>Sean Wilentz, ''Chants Democratic: New York City and the Rise of the American Working Class, 1788\u20131850'' (1984)</ref>\n\n=== Presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837\u20131841) ===\n[[Martin Van Buren]] was key in the development of the Democratic Party, although his presidency featured many setbacks. Many of the policies of Jackson had repercussions while Van Buren held office, such as the [[Trail of Tears]]. The policies enacted during Jackson came into full swing during Van Buren, who oversaw the displacement of thousands of Native Americans. In addition to this, Van Buren was anti-slavery and represented a divide in both parties. Despite this, he did almost nothing to help the abolitionist movement and his presidency saw a continuation of pro-slavery legislation. Jackson's decision to abolish the [[Second Bank of the United States]] led to the [[Panic of 1837]] during Van Buren's presidency, leading to disapproval by the public and loss of power for his party.\n\nThe 1840 Democratic convention was the first at which the party adopted a platform. Delegates reaffirmed their belief that the Constitution was the primary guide for each state's political affairs. To them, this meant that all roles of the federal government not specifically defined fell to each respective state government, including such responsibilities as debt created by local projects. Decentralized power and states' rights pervaded each and every resolution adopted at the convention, including those on slavery, taxes, and the possibility of a central bank.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/polcon/democraticindex.html |title= 1840 Democratic Convention |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030799376 |title=Proceedings of the National democratic convention, held in ...

The Whigs nominated [[William Henry Harrison]] as their candidate for the 1840 presidential race. Harrison won as the first President of the Whigs. However, he died in office a month later and was succeeded by his Vice President [[John Tyler]]. Tyler had recently left the Democrats for the Whigs and thus his beliefs did not align much with the Whig Party. During his presidency, he vetoed many of his own party's bills, leading to his own party disowning him. This allowed for the Democrats to retake power in 1845.\n\n== Presidency of James K. Polk (1845\u20131849) ==\nForeign policy was a major issue in the 1840s as war threatened with Mexico over Texas and with Britain over Oregon. Democrats strongly supported [[Manifest Destiny]] and most Whigs strongly opposed it. The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 election]] was a showdown, with the Democrat [[James K. Polk]] narrowly defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]] on the Texas issue.<ref>Daniel Walker Howe, ''What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America 1815\u20131848'' (2007) pp. 705\u2013706.</ref>\n\n[[John Mack Faragher]]'s analysis of the political polarization between the parties is: <blockquote>Most Democrats were wholehearted supporters of expansion, whereas many Whigs (especially in the [[Northern United States|North]]) were opposed. Whigs welcomed most of the changes wrought by [[Technological and industrial history of the United States|industrialization]] but advocated strong government policies that would guide growth and development within the country's existing boundaries; they feared (correctly) that expansion raised a contentious issue the extension of slavery to the [[Organized incorporated territories of the United States|territories]]. On the other hand, many Democrats feared industrialization the Whigs welcomed. [...] For many Democrats, the answer to the nation's social ills was to continue to follow [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s vision of establishing agriculture in the new territories in order to counterbalance industrialization.<ref>John Mack Faragher et al. ''Out of Many: A History of the American People'' (2nd ed. 1997) p. 413</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Free Soil split===\nIn [[1848 United States presidential election|1848]] a major innovation was the creation of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) to coordinate state activities in the presidential contest. Senator [[Lewis Cass]], who held many offices over the years, lost to General [[Zachary Taylor]] of the Whigs. A major cause of the defeat was that the new [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed slavery expansion, split the Democratic vote, particularly in New York, where the electoral votes went to Taylor.<ref>Frederick J. Blue, ''The Free Soilers: Third Party Politics, 1848-54'' (1973).</ref> The Free Soil Party attracted Democrats, and some Whigs, and had considerable support in the Northeast. The primary doctrine was a warning that rich slave owners would move into new territories such as Nebraska and buy up the best lands, and work them with slaves. To protect the white farmer it was essential therefore to keep the soil \"free\"\u2014that is without slavery. The fate of the slaves was not of concern. In 1852, the free soil movement was much smaller, and consisted primarily of former members of the Liberty Party and some abolitionists, it hedged on the question of full equality. The majority wanted some form of racial separation to allow space for black activism, without alienating the overwhelming northern opposition to equal rights for black men.<ref>Eric  Foner,  \"Politics and Prejudice: The Free Soil Party and the Negro, 1849-1852.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 50.4 (1965): 239-256. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716247 online]</ref>\n\n== Presidencies of Zachary Taylor (1849\u20131850) and Millard Fillmore (1850\u20131853) ==\nFollowing the death of President Taylor, Democrats in Congress passed the [[Compromise of 1850]] designed to avoid civil war by putting the slavery issue to rest while resolves issued involving territories gained following the War with Mexico. However, in state after state the Democrats gained small but permanent advantages over the Whig Party, which finally collapsed in 1852, fatally weakened by division on slavery and [[Nativism (politics)|nativism]]. The fragmented opposition could not stop the election of Democrats [[Franklin Pierce]] in [[1852 United States presidential election|1852]] and [[James Buchanan]] in [[1856 United States presidential election|1856]].<ref>Wilentz, ''The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln'' (2005) ch. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\n== The presidencies of Franklin Pierce (1853\u201357) and James Buchanan (1857\u201361) ==\n[[file:Augustbelmont.jpg|thumb|upright=.90|August Belmont: DNC Chair for 12 years during and after the Civil war]]\n\nThe eight years during which Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan held the presidency were disasters; historians agree that they rank as among the worst presidents. The Party increasingly split along regional lines. In 1860 two Democrats ran for president and the United States was moving rapidly toward civil war.<ref>David M. Potter, ''The Impending Crisis, 1848\u20131861'' (1976) pp 225-67.</ref>\n\n=== Young America ===\nYonatan Eyal (2007) argues that the 1840s and 1850s were the heyday of a new faction of young Democrats called \"[[Young America movement|Young America]]\". Led by [[Stephen A. Douglas]], James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and New York financier [[August Belmont]], this faction explains, broke with the agrarian and [[Strict constructionism|strict constructionist]] orthodoxies of the past and embraced commerce, technology, regulation, reform and internationalism. The movement attracted a circle of outstanding writers, including [[William Cullen Bryant]], [[George Bancroft]], [[Herman Melville]] and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]].

Young America claimed that modernization would perpetuate the agrarian vision of [[Jeffersonian democracy]] by allowing yeomen farmers to sell their products and therefore to prosper. They tied internal improvements to [[free trade]], while accepted moderate tariffs as a necessary source of government revenue.

The conflict was papered over at the [[1852 Democratic National Convention|1852]] and [[1856 Democratic National Convention|1856 conventions]] by selecting men who had little involvement in sectionalism, but they made matters worse. Historian [[Roy F. Nichols]] explains why [[Franklin Pierce]] was not up to the challenges a Democratic president had to face:\n:As a national political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, as he made up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had the [[Letter and spirit of the law|letter of the law]] on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. At no time did he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.<ref>Roy F.

The demands were to support slavery outside the South. Southerners insisted that full equality for their region required the government to acknowledge the legitimacy of slavery outside the South. The Southern demands included a fugitive slave law to recapture runaway slaves; opening Kansas to slavery; forcing a pro-slavery constitution on Kansas; acquire Cuba (where slavery already existed); accepting the Dred Scott decision of the Supreme Court; and adopting a federal slave code to protect slavery in the territories. President Buchanan went along with these demands, but Douglas refused and proved a much better politician than Buchanan, though the bitter battle lasted for years and permanently alienated the Northern and Southern wings.<ref>Michael Todd Landis. ''Northern Men with Southern Loyalties: The Democratic Party and the Sectional Crisis'' (2014).</ref>\n\nWhen the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] formed in 1854 on the basis of refusing to tolerate the expansion of slavery into the territories, many northern Democrats (especially [[Free Soil Party|Free Soilers]] from 1848) joined it.

No party politics were allowed in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], whose political leadership, mindful of the welter prevalent in antebellum American politics and with a pressing need for unity, largely viewed political parties as inimical to good governance and as being especially unwise in wartime.

Weber, ''Copperheads: The Rise and Fall of Lincoln's Opponents in the North'' (2006)</ref>\n\nPartisanship flourished in the North and strengthened the Lincoln Administration as Republicans automatically rallied behind it. After the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attack on Fort Sumter]], Douglas rallied Northern Democrats behind the Union, but when Douglas died the party lacked an outstanding figure in the North and by 1862 an anti-war peace element was gaining strength. The most intense anti-war elements were the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]].<ref name=\"Jennifer L.

There was also an expression of annoyance with the federal prohibition of beer and wine, and the closing of most saloons.<ref>David Berner, ''The Politics of Provincialism: The Democratic party in transition, 1918-1932'' (1968)</ref><ref>Ciment, ''Encyclopedia of the Jazz Age''  (2008) 1:195-96, 263-64, 2:298-305,  2:519-23</ref>\n\n=== Culture conflict and Al Smith (1924\u201328) ===\nAt the [[1924 Democratic National Convention]], a resolution denouncing the [[Ku Klux Klan]] was introduced by Catholic and liberal forces allied with [[Al Smith]] and [[Oscar W. Underwood]] in order to embarrass the front-runner, [[William Gibbs McAdoo]]. After much debate, the resolution failed by a single vote. The KKK faded away soon after, but the deep split in the party over cultural issues, especially prohibition, facilitated Republican landslides in [[1924 United States presidential election|1924]] and [[1928 United States presidential election|1928]].<ref>Robert K. Murray, ''The 103rd Ballot: Democrats and Disaster in Madison Square Garden'' (1976)</ref> However, Al Smith did build a strong Catholic base in the big cities in 1928 and [[Franklin D.

To a considerable extent, the challenge of restoring morale was the province of historian [[Claude Bowers]]. His histories of the Democratic Party in its formative years from the 1790s to the 1830s helped shape the party's self-image as a powerful force against monopoly and privilege. In his enormously popular books ''Party Battles of the Jackson Period'' (1922) and ''Jefferson and Hamilton: The Struggle for Democracy in America'' (1925) he argued for the political and moral superiority of the Democratic Party since the days of Jefferson versus the almost un-American faults of the [[Federalist Party]], the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], as bastions of aristocracy. ''Jefferson and Hamilton'' especially impressed his friend [[Franklin D Roosevelt]]. It inspired Roosevelt when he became president to build a great monument to the party's founder in the national capital, the [[Jefferson Memorial]]. According to Historian [[Merrill D. Peterson]], the book conveyed:\n<blockquote>the myth of the Democratic Party masterfully re-created, a fresh awareness of the elemental differences between the parties, and ideology with which they might make sense of the two often senseless conflicts of the present, and a feeling for the importance of dynamic leadership. The book was a mirror for Democrats.<ref>{{cite book|first=Merrill D.|last=Peterson|title=The Jefferson Image in the American Mind|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QNrZoAgGAsC&pg=PA351|year=1960|page=351|isbn=9780813918518}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== The Great Depression and a Second World War: Democratic hegemony (1930\u201353) ==\nThe Great Depression marred Hoover's term as the Democratic Party made large gains in the 1930 congressional elections and garnered a landslide win in 1932.\n\n=== Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933\u20131945) ===\n[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the longest-serving President of the United States (1933\u20131945)]]\nThe [[Wall Street Crash 1929|stock market crash of 1929]] and the ensuing [[Great Depression]] set the stage for a more progressive government and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] won a [[landslide victory]] in the [[1932 United States presidential election|election of 1932]], campaigning on a platform of \"Relief, Recovery, and Reform\", that is relief of unemployment and rural distress, recovery of the economy back to normal and long-term structural reforms to prevent a repetition of the Depression. This came to be termed \"[[New Deal|The New Deal]]\" after a phrase in Roosevelt's acceptance speech.<ref>Robert T. Oliver, \"The speech that established Roosevelt's reputation.\" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech '' 31#3   (1945): 274-282.</ref>\n\nThe Democrats also swept to large majorities in both houses of Congress and among state governors. Roosevelt altered the nature of the party, away from ''laissez-faire'' capitalism and towards an ideology of economic regulation and insurance against hardship. Two old words took on new meanings: \"liberal\" now meant a supporter of the New Deal while \"conservative\" meant an opponent.<ref>[[Pamela Johnston Conover]], and Stanley Feldman, \"The origins and meaning of liberal/conservative self-identifications.\" ''American Journal of Political Science'' 25#4 (1981), pp. 617-645 617-645.</ref>\n\n[[Conservative Democrat]]s were outraged and led by [[Al Smith]] they formed the [[American Liberty League]] in 1934 and counterattacked. They failed and either retired from politics or joined the Republican Party. A few of them, such as [[Dean Acheson]], found their way back to the Democratic Party.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 227-46.</ref>\n\nThe 1933 programs, called \"the First New Deal\" by historians, represented a broad consensus. Roosevelt tried to reach out to business and labor, farmers and consumers, cities and countryside. However, by 1934 he was moving toward a more confrontational policy. After making gains in state governorships and in Congress, in 1934 Roosevelt embarked on an ambitious legislative program that came to be called \"The [[Second New Deal]]\". It was characterized by building up labor unions, nationalizing welfare by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], setting up [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], imposing more regulations on business (especially transportation and communications) and raising taxes on business profits.<ref>James MacGregor Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox: Vol. 1, 1882-1940'' (1958) pp 171-208.</ref>\n\nRoosevelt's New Deal programs focused on job creation through [[public works]] projects as well as on social welfare programs such as Social Security. It also included sweeping reforms to the banking system, work regulation, transportation, communications and stock markets, as well as attempts to regulate prices. His policies soon paid off by uniting a diverse coalition of Democratic voters called the [[New Deal coalition]], which included labor unions, Southerners, minorities (most significantly, Catholics and Jews) and [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]]. This united voter base allowed Democrats to be elected to Congress and the presidency for much of the next 30 years.<ref>Burns, ''Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox'' (1958) pp 264-90.</ref>\n\n===The Second term===\nAfter a triumphant re-election in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]], he announced plans to [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937|enlarge the Supreme Court]], which tended to oppose his New Deal, by five new members. A firestorm of opposition erupted, led by his own Vice President [[John Nance Garner]]. Roosevelt was defeated by an alliance of Republicans and conservative Democrats, who formed a [[conservative coalition]] that managed to block nearly all liberal legislation (only a [[Minimum wage in the United States|minimum wage law]] got through). Annoyed by the conservative wing of his own party, Roosevelt made an attempt to rid himself of it and in 1938 he actively campaigned against five incumbent conservative Democratic senators, though all five senators won re-election.<ref>Milton Plesur,  \"The Republican congressional comeback of 1938.\" ''Review of Politics'' 24.4 (1962): 525-562.</ref>\n\n===The Party===\nUnder Roosevelt, the Democratic Party became identified more closely with modern liberalism, which included the promotion of [[social welfare]], [[labor unions]], [[civil rights]] and the regulation of business, as well as support for farmers and promotion of ethnic leaders. The opponents, who stressed long-term growth and support for entrepreneurship and low taxes, now started calling themselves \"conservatives\".<ref>Sean J. Savage, ''Roosevelt: The Party Leader, 1932-1945'' (2015).</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nWith a near disaster in 1937 with the so-called \"recession\" and the near defeat in Congress in 1938, things looked bleak for the Democrats, but FDR decided that he with the upcoming crisis that would become World War II, he was irreplaceable, and he broke tradition and ran for a third, and later 4th term, taking a Democratic congress with him.\n\n=== Presidency of Harry S. Truman (1945\u20131953) ===\n[[Harry S. Truman]] took over after Roosevelt's death in 1945 and the rifts inside the party that Roosevelt had papered over began to emerge. Major components included the big city machines, the Southern state and local parties, the far-left and the \"Liberal coalition\" or \"Liberal-Labor coalition\" comprising the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] and ideological groups such as the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] (representing [[African American|Blacks]]), the [[American Jewish Congress]] (AJC) and the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) (representing liberal intellectuals).<ref>\nDaniel Disalvo. \"The Politics of a Party Faction: The Liberal-Labor Alliance in the Democratic Party, 1948\u20131972,\" ''Journal of Policy History'' (2010) vol.  22#3 pp. 269\u201399 in [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_policy_history/v022/22.3.disalvo.html Project MUSE]</ref> By 1948, the unions had expelled nearly all the far-left and communist elements.<ref>Max M.

However, all of Truman's [[Fair Deal]] proposals, such as [[universal health care]], were defeated by the Southern Democrats in Congress.

Wallace]] denounced Truman as a war-monger for his anti-Soviet programs, the [[Truman Doctrine]], [[Marshall Plan]] and [[NATO]]. Wallace quit the party and ran for [[1948 United States presidential election|President as an independent in 1948]]. He called for [[d\u00e9tente]] with the [[Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Soviet Union]], but much of his campaign was controlled by communists who had been expelled from the main unions.

Wallace supporters and other Democrats who were farther left were pushed out of the party and the CIO in 1946\u20131948 by young anti-communists like [[Hubert Humphrey]], [[Walter Reuther]] and [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr.]] [[Hollywood]] emerged in the 1940s as an important new base in the party and was led by movie-star politicians such as [[Ronald Reagan]], who strongly supported Roosevelt and Truman at this time.<ref>{{cite book|first=Edward M.|last=Yager|title=Ronald Reagan's Journey: Democrat to Republican|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U2cs7IHERBwC&pg=PA43|year=2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=43|isbn=9780742544215}}</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, Europe was safe, but troubles mounted in Asia as China fell to the communists in 1949. Truman entered the [[Korean War]] without formal Congressional approval. When the war turned to a stalemate and he fired General [[Douglas MacArthur]] in 1951, Republicans blasted his policies in Asia. A series of petty scandals among friends and buddies of Truman further tarnished his image, allowing the Republicans in 1952 to crusade against \"Korea, Communism and Corruption\". Truman dropped out of the Presidential race early in 1952, leaving no obvious successor. The convention nominated [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] and [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]], only to see him overwhelmed by two Eisenhower landslides.<ref>{{cite book|first=Kenneth F.|last=Warren|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. Campaigns, Elections, and Electoral Behavior|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lCh1AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA634|year=2008|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=634|isbn=9781452265872}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Dwight D.

It also brought brief Republican control to both houses of Congress for one term. In Congress, the powerful team of Texans House Speaker [[Sam Rayburn]] and Senate Majority leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] held the party together, often by compromising with Eisenhower. In 1958, the party made dramatic gains in the midterms and seemed to have a permanent lock on Congress, thanks largely to organized labor. Indeed, Democrats had majorities in the House every election from 1930 to 1992 (except 1946 and 1952).<ref>{{cite book|first1=Earl|last1=Black|first2=Merle|last2=Black|title=Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tm8eHHDR_osC&pg=PT23|year=2007|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=23 |isbn=9781416539056}}</ref>\n\nMost Southern Congressmen were [[conservative Democrats]] and they usually worked with conservative Republicans.<ref>James T.

He challenged America in the [[Space Race]] to land an American man on the moon by 1969. After the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] he moved to de-escalate tensions with the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>James N. Giglio, ''Presidency of John F.

His election did mark the coming of age of the Catholic component of the New Deal Coalition. After 1964, middle class Catholics started voting Republican in the same proportion as their Protestant neighbors. Except for the Chicago of [[Richard J.

In January, even though it was a military defeat for the [[Viet Cong]], the [[Tet Offensive]] began to turn American public opinion against the Vietnam War. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] rallied intellectuals and [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] students on college campuses and came within a few percentage points of defeating Johnson in the [[New Hampshire primary]]:Johnson was permanently weakened.

Kennedy won the critical California primary on June 4, but [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|he was assassinated]] that night.

Nixon barely won, with the Democrats retaining control of Congress.

In addition, he championed [[human rights]] throughout the world and used human rights as the center of his administration's foreign policy.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\">John Dumbrell, ''The Carter presidency: A re-evaluation'' (Manchester University Press, 1995)</ref>\n\nEven with all of these successes, Carter failed to implement a national health plan or to reform the tax system as he had promised in his campaign and inflation was also on the rise. Abroad, the [[Iranian hostage crisis|Iranians held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days]] and Carter's diplomatic and military rescue attempts failed. The [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] later that year further disenchanted some Americans with Carter. In [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]], Carter defeated Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] to gain renomination, but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in November. The Democrats lost 12 Senate seats and for the first time since 1954 the Republicans controlled the Senate, though the House remained in Democratic hands.<ref name=\"John Dumbrell 1995\"/> After his defeat, Carter negotiated the release of every American hostage held in Iran and they were lifted out of Iran minutes after Reagan was inaugurated, ending a 444-day crisis.<ref>David Farber, ''Taken Hostage: The Iran Hostage Crisis and America's First Encounter with Radical Islam'' (2005)</ref>\n\n== Presidency of Ronald Reagan (1981\u20131989) ==\n=== 1980s: Battling Reaganism ===\n[[File:SpeakerO'Neill.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Representative [[Tip O'Neill|Thomas \"Tip\" O'Neill]] was Speaker of the House (1977\u20131987) and was the highest ranking Democrat in Washington, D.C. during most of Reagan's term]]\nDemocrats who supported many conservative policies were instrumental in the election of Republican [[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] in [[1980 United States presidential election|1980]]. The \"[[Reagan Democrat]]s\" were Democrats before the Reagan years and afterward, but they voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]] and for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], producing their landslide victories. Reagan Democrats were mostly white ethnics in the Northeast and Midwest who were attracted to Reagan's [[social conservatism]] on issues such as abortion and to his strong foreign policy. They did not continue to vote Republican in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] or [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], so the term fell into disuse except as a reference to the 1980s. The term is not used to describe [[White Southerners]] who became permanent Republicans in presidential elections.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\">Stanley B. Greenberg, ''Middle Class Dreams: Politics and Power of the New American Majority'' (1996).</ref>\n\n[[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, analyzed white ethnic voters \u2013 largely unionized auto workers \u2013 in suburban [[Macomb County, Michigan]], just north of Detroit. The county voted 63 percent for Kennedy in 1960 and 66 percent for Reagan in 1984. He concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially African Americans, [[advocacy group]]s of the [[political left]] and the very poor.<ref name=\"Stanley B. Greenberg 1996\"/>\n\nThe failure to hold the Reagan Democrats and the white South led to the final collapse of the New Deal coalition. In [[1984 United States presidential election|1984]], Reagan carried 49 states against former Vice President and Minnesota Senator [[Walter Mondale]], a New Deal stalwart.<ref>Steven M. Gillon, ''The Democrats' Dilemma: Walter F. Mondale and the Liberal Legacy'' (1992) pp. 365\u201390</ref>\n\nIn response to these landslide defeats, the [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) was created in 1985. It worked to move the party rightwards to the ideological center in order to recover some of the fundraising that had been lost to the Republicans due to corporate donors supporting Reagan. The goal was to retain left-of-center voters as well as moderates and conservatives on social issues to become a [[Big tent|catch all party]] with widespread appeal to most opponents of the Republicans. Despite this, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], running not as a New Dealer but as an efficiency expert in public administration, lost by a landslide in [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] to Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>Jack W. Germond and Jules Witcover. ''Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars?'' (1989)</ref>\n\n=== South becomes Republican ===\nFor nearly a century after [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democrats' lock on power was so strong the region was called the [[Solid South]], although the Republicans controlled parts of the [[Appalachian mountains]] and they competed for statewide office in the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]]. Before 1948, [[Southern Democrats]] believed that their party, with its respect for [[states' rights]] and appreciation of traditional southern values, was the defender of the Southern way of life. Southern Democrats warned against aggressive designs on the part of Northern liberals and Republicans and civil rights activists whom they denounced as \"outside agitators\".<ref>Joseph A. Aistrup, ''The southern strategy revisited: Republican top-down advancement in the South'' (2015).</ref>\n\nThe adoption of the strong civil rights plank by the 1948 convention and the integration of the armed forces by President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s [[Executive Order 9981]], which provided for equal treatment and opportunity for African-American servicemen, drove a wedge between the Northern and Southern branches of the party. The party was sharply divided in the [[1948 United States presidential election|following election]], as [[Southern Democrats]] [[Strom Thurmond]] ran as \"States' Rights Democratic Party\".\n\nWith the presidency of John F. Kennedy the Democratic Party began to embrace the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and its lock on the South was irretrievably broken. Upon signing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], President Lyndon B. Johnson prophesied: \"We have lost the South for a generation\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Risen|first=Clay|title=How the South was won|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=March 5, 2006|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/03/05/how_the_south_was_won/|accessdate=November 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nModernization had brought factories, national businesses and larger, more cosmopolitan cities such as [[Atlanta]], [[Dallas]], [[Charlotte]] and [[Houston]] to the South, as well as millions of migrants from the North and more opportunities for higher education. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco economy of the traditional rural South faded away, as former farmers commuted to factory jobs. As the South became more like the rest of the nation, it could not stand apart in terms of racial segregation. Integration and the Civil Rights Movement caused enormous controversy in the white South, with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1965, a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of Arkansas, [[Lester Maddox]] of Georgia and especially [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. These populist governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and opposed desegregation. After 1965, most Southerners accepted integration (with the exception of public schools).<ref>Jon P, Alston, and Ben M. Crouch. \"White acceptance of three degrees of school desegregation, 1974.\" ''Phylon'' 39.3 (1978): 216-224.</ref>\n\nBelieving themselves betrayed by the Democratic Party, traditional [[White Southerners]] joined the new middle-class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Meanwhile, newly enfranchised black voters began supporting Democratic candidates at the 80\u201390 percent levels, producing Democratic leaders such as [[Julian Bond]] and [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]] of Georgia and [[Barbara Jordan]] of Texas. Just as [[Martin Luther King]] had promised, integration had brought about a new day in Southern politics.<ref>Katherine Tate, ''Black faces in the mirror: African Americans and their representatives in the US Congress'' (2018).</ref>\n \nIn addition to its white middle-class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities among [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], who prior to the 1980s were largely apolitical. Exit polls in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] by 70\u201330% among White Southerners, who were 71% of the voters. Kerry had a 90\u20139 lead among the 18% of Southern voters who were black. One-third of the Southern voters said they were white Evangelicals and they voted for Bush by 80\u201320.<ref>{{cite news|title=Exit Polls|publisher=CNN|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George H.

Berman, ''America's Right Turn: From Nixon to Clinton'' (1998).</ref> In [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]], for the first time in 12 years the United States had a Democrat in the White House. During President [[Bill Clinton]]'s term, the Congress balanced the federal [[budget]] for the first time since the Kennedy Presidency and presided over a robust American economy that saw incomes grow across the board. In 1994, the economy had the lowest combination of unemployment and inflation in 25 years. President Clinton also signed into law several [[gun control]] bills, including the [[Brady Bill]], which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases; and he also signed into legislation a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|ban]] on many types of [[semi-automatic firearm]]s (which expired in 2004). His [[Family and Medical Leave Act]], covering some 40 million Americans, offered workers up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for childbirth or a personal or family illness. He deployed the U.S. military to [[Haiti]] to reinstate deposed president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]], took a strong hand in [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process|Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations]], brokered a historic cease-fire in [[Northern Ireland]] and negotiated the [[Dayton accords]]. In [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], Clinton became the first Democratic President to be re-elected since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].\n\nHowever, the Democrats lost their majority in both Houses of Congress in 1994. Clinton vetoed two Republican-backed [[welfare reform]] bills before signing the third, the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act]] of 1996. The [[tort reform]] [[Private Securities Litigation Reform Act]] passed over his veto. Labor unions, which had been steadily losing membership since the 1960s, found they had also lost political clout inside the Democratic Party and Clinton enacted the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] with [[Canada]] and [[Mexico]] over unions' strong objections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kilborn|first=Peter T.|title=The Free Trade Accord: Labor, Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers|work=The New York Times|date=November 19, 1993|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/19/us/the-free-trade-accord-labor-unions-vow-to-punish-pact-s-backers.html|accessdate=November 17, 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the Republican-led House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] Clinton on two charges, though he was subsequently acquitted by the [[United States Senate]] in 1999.

Bill Clinton presided over the growth of the loosely supervised shadow financial system and the repeal of Depression-era restrictions on commercial banks.<ref>Sebastian Mallaby.

Even though analysis of roll call votes show that since the 1970s, Republicans have drifted farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, the latter were instrumental in implementing financial deregulation in the 1990s and focused increasingly on cultural issues such as gender, race, and sexual identity rather than traditional social welfare policies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scheidel|first=Walter|author-link=Walter Scheidel|title=The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality from the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=|year=2017|isbn=978-0691165028|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NgZpDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA416#v=onepage&q&f=false 416]|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10921.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth Carter and Clinton quietly abandoned the New Deal style of aggressive support for welfare for the poor and support for the working-class and labor unions. They downplayed traditional Democratic hostility toward business, and aggressive regulation of the economy. Carter and Clinton agreed on a greater reliance on the market economy\u2014As conservatives have long demanded. They gave control of inflation priority over reduction in unemployment. They both sought balanced budgets\u2014and Clinton actually succeeded in generating a federal budget surplus. They both used monetary policy more than fiscal/spending policy to micromanage the economy, and they accepted the conservative emphasis on supply-side programs to encourage private investment, and the expectation it would produce long-term economic growth.<ref>Iwan Morgan, \"Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and the new democratic economics.\" ''Historical Journal'' 47.4 (2004): 1015-1039.</ref>\n\n=== Election of 2000 ===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 2000}}\nDuring the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the Democrats chose Vice President [[Al Gore]] to be the party's candidate for the presidency. Gore ran against [[George W. Bush]], the Republican candidate and son of former President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The issues Gore championed include [[national debt|debt reduction]], tax cuts, foreign policy, public education, [[global warming]], judicial appointments and [[Affirmative action in the United States|affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, Gore's affiliation with Clinton and the DLC caused critics to assert that Bush and Gore were too similar, especially on free trade, reductions in social welfare and the death penalty. [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in particular was very vocal in his criticisms.\n\nGore won a popular plurality of over 540,000 votes over Bush, but lost in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] by four votes. Many Democrats blamed Nader's third-party [[spoiler effect|spoiler role]] for Gore's defeat. They pointed to the states of New Hampshire (4 electoral votes) and Florida (25 electoral votes), where Nader's total votes exceeded Bush's margin of victory. In Florida, Nader received 97,000 votes and Bush defeated Gore by a mere 537. Controversy plagued the election and Gore largely dropped from elective politics.\n\nDespite Gore's close defeat, the Democrats gained five seats in the Senate (including the election of [[Hillary Clinton]] in New York) to turn a 55\u201345 Republican edge into a 50\u201350 split (with a Republican Vice President breaking a tie). However, when Republican Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of Vermont decided in 2001 to become an independent and vote with the Democratic caucus, the majority status shifted along with the seat, including control of the floor (by the Majority Leader) and control of all committee chairmanships. However, the Republicans regained their Senate majority with gains in 2002 and 2004, leaving the Democrats with only 44 seats, the fewest since the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|author=CQ Press|title=Guide to Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iqN2AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA156|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=156}}</ref>\n\n== Presidency of George W.

All but one Democrat (Representative [[Barbara Lee]]) voted with their Republican counterparts to authorize President Bush's [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]]. House leader [[Richard Gephardt]] and Senate leader [[Thomas Daschle]] pushed Democrats to vote for the [[Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].

This led to the bipartisan [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] in 2002. With job losses and bankruptcies across regions and industries increasing in 2001 and 2002, the Democrats generally campaigned on the issue of economic recovery. That did not work for them in 2002, as the Democrats lost a few seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. They lost three seats in the Senate ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] as [[Max Cleland]] was unseated, [[Minnesota]] as Paul Wellstone died and [[Walter Mondale|his succeeding Democratic candidate]] lost the election and [[Missouri]] as [[Jean Carnahan]] was unseated). While Democrats gained governorships in [[New Mexico]] (where [[Bill Richardson]] was elected), [[Arizona]] ([[Janet Napolitano]]), [[Michigan]] ([[Jennifer Granholm]]) and [[Wyoming]] ([[Dave Freudenthal]]). Other Democrats lost governorships in [[South Carolina]] ([[Jim Hodges]]), [[Alabama]] ([[Don Siegelman]]) and\u2014for the first time in more than a century\u2014Georgia ([[Roy Barnes]]). The election led to another round of soul searching about the party's narrowing base.

An unusual gaffe known as the \"Dean Scream\" and subsequent negative media coverage doomed his candidacy.
