The single debuted at [[List of UK Singles Chart number ones of the 1990s|number one]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in January 1991, the band's first number one hit since \"[[Under Pressure]]\" in 1981, and additionally reached the top ten in ten other countries.\n\nAt six and a half minutes, it is one of Queen's epic songs and their longest ever released as a single, exceeding \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" by 35 seconds.

The recurring theme (with the [[Bol\u00e9ro]]-esque beat) started off as a jam session between May, Deacon and Taylor. Mercury then added the melody and some of the lyrics, which were then completed by Taylor.\n\nThe middle section was primarily Mercury's work, according to an interview with May in October 1994's ''Guitar Magazine''. It features a [[flamenco]] guitar solo, followed by a classically influenced bridge, and then the solo again but performed with electric guitars. This section is especially complex, featuring a pattern of three bars in 5/4 time (reasonably uncommon in popular music) followed by five bars in the more often used 3/4 time. The end of the flamenco-guitar style is based on the 5/4 bar, but is in 6/4 time.\n\nThe bridge section (\"You can be anything you want to be\") features sophisticated orchestration, created by Mercury and producer David Richards using the popular [[Korg M1]] keyboard/synth/workstation. Mercury had arranged and co-arranged orchestras in his solo career, and closed [[The Miracle (album)|the previous Queen album]] with the track \"Was It All Worth It\", which included a [[Gershwin]]-esque interlude also coming from an [[Korg M1|M1]] synth. The Bridge section in \"Innuendo\" is in [[Triple metre|3/4]], showing once again Mercury's affection for triple metres: \"Bicycle Race\" is another one with main sections in 4/4 and middle-eight in 3/4, and some of his best-known pieces (namely \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" and \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\") were in 12/8, as would be his last ever composition, \"[[A Winter's Tale (Queen song)|A Winter's Tale]]\".\n\n==Steve Howe's involvement==\nSteve Howe has said he was \"so proud\" to have played on the song and he became the only non-Queen member to have played guitar on a studio recording of a Queen song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/mick-burgess-chats-steve-howe-7032017 |title=Yes!

Yes had recorded ''[[Going for the One]]'' at Mountain Studios in 1976\u201377 shortly before Queen bought the Swiss studio, and [[Asia (band)|Asia]]'s [[Asia (Asia album)|debut album]] was produced by Queen's engineer, [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]].\n\nOn a break from a recording session in Geneva, Howe drove to Montreux and stopped to have lunch. There he ran into Martin Groves who had worked for Yes before and by this time was Queen's equipment supervisor. Groves told him that Queen were in the studio at the moment.\n\nAs soon as Steve Howe went into the studios, Mercury asked him to play some guitar (according to producer David Richards, who had worked with Yes in the past as well). Another version is that Brian May was the one who asked him to play the flamenco bit.<ref name=\"stevehowe1\"/> When the members of Queen asked if Howe wanted to play on the title track, Howe politely suggested they\u2019d lost their minds. It took the combined weight of Mercury, May and Taylor to persuade him.\n\nAccording to Steve Howe:\n\n{{quote|Inside, there\u2019s Freddie, Brian and Roger all sitting together. They go: \u2018Let\u2019s play you the album\u2019. Of course, I\u2019m hearing it for the first time [\u2026] And they saved \"Innuendo\" itself until last. They played it and I was fucking blown away. They all chimed in: \u2018We want some crazy Spanish guitar flying around over the top. Improvise!\u2019 I started noodling around on the guitar, and it was pretty tough. After a couple of hours, I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve bitten off more than I can chew here\u2019. I had to learn a bit of the structure, work out what the chordal roots were, where you had to fall if you did a mad run in the distance; you have to know where you\u2019re going. But it got towards evening, and we\u2019d doodled and I\u2019d noodled, and it turned out to be really good fun. We have this beautiful dinner, we go back to the studio and have a listen. And they go: \u2018That\u2019s great. That\u2019s what we wanted\u2019.<ref>Dave Everley, Sheer Art Attack, ''[[Prog magazine]]'', March 2012, pp. 68-71</ref>}}\n\n==Music video==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}\nA very elaborate music video was created to accompany the single and released on 23 November 1990, combining [[stop motion]] animation with [[rotoscoping]] and featuring plasticine figures reminiscent of the album artwork in a detailed miniature cinema set.

However, the song was left off the DVD release at Plant's request, as he forgot part of the lyrics and his vocal was, by his own admission, not in the best shape. As in \"Kashmir\", the title of the song appears in the lyrics only once.\n\nThe 12\" ''Explosive Version'' of \"Innuendo\" features a noise similar to an atomic bomb after Mercury sings the line \"until the end of time\".\n\nThere was a \"promo version\" released of the song, accompanied by an edited video.

The Bridge section in \"Innuendo\" is in [[Triple metre|3/4]], showing once again Mercury's affection for triple metres: \"Bicycle Race\" is another one with main sections in 4/4 and middle-eight in 3/4, and some of his best-known pieces (namely \"[[We Are the Champions]]\" and \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\") were in 12/8, as would be his last ever composition, \"[[A Winter's Tale (Queen song)|A Winter's Tale]]\".\n\n==Steve Howe's involvement==\nSteve Howe has said he was \"so proud\" to have played on the song and he became the only non-Queen member to have played guitar on a studio recording of a Queen song.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/mick-burgess-chats-steve-howe-7032017 |title=Yes!

Yes had recorded ''[[Going for the One]]'' at Mountain Studios in 1976\u201377 shortly before Queen bought the Swiss studio, and [[Asia (band)|Asia]]'s [[Asia (Asia album)|debut album]] was produced by Queen's engineer, [[Mike Stone (record producer)|Mike Stone]].\n\nOn a break from a recording session in Geneva, Howe drove to Montreux and stopped to have lunch. There he ran into Martin Groves who had worked for Yes before and by this time was Queen's equipment supervisor. Groves told him that Queen were in the studio at the moment.\n\nAs soon as Steve Howe went into the studios, Mercury asked him to play some guitar (according to producer David Richards, who had worked with Yes in the past as well). Another version is that Brian May was the one who asked him to play the flamenco bit.<ref name=\"stevehowe1\"/> When the members of Queen asked if Howe wanted to play on the title track, Howe politely suggested they\u2019d lost their minds. It took the combined weight of Mercury, May and Taylor to persuade him.\n\nAccording to Steve Howe:\n\n{{quote|Inside, there\u2019s Freddie, Brian and Roger all sitting together. They go: \u2018Let\u2019s play you the album\u2019. Of course, I\u2019m hearing it for the first time [\u2026] And they saved \"Innuendo\" itself until last. They played it and I was fucking blown away. They all chimed in: \u2018We want some crazy Spanish guitar flying around over the top. Improvise!\u2019 I started noodling around on the guitar, and it was pretty tough. After a couple of hours, I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve bitten off more than I can chew here\u2019. I had to learn a bit of the structure, work out what the chordal roots were, where you had to fall if you did a mad run in the distance; you have to know where you\u2019re going. But it got towards evening, and we\u2019d doodled and I\u2019d noodled, and it turned out to be really good fun. We have this beautiful dinner, we go back to the studio and have a listen.

The Convention extends beyond the protection of cultivated plants to the protection of natural flora and plant products. It also takes into consideration both direct and indirect damage by pests, so it includes weeds.\n\nThe Convention created a governing body consisting of each party, known as the '''Commission on Phytosanitary Measures''', which oversees the implementation of the Convention. As of August 2017, the Convention has 183 parties, which includes 180 [[United Nations member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[European Union]]<ref>https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/</ref>. The Convention is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (the SPS Agreement) as the only international standard setting body for plant health.\n\nWhile the IPPC's primary focus is on plants and plant products moving in international trade, the Convention also covers research materials, biological control organisms, germplasm banks, containment facilities, food aid, emergency aid and anything else that can act as a vector for the spread of plant pests \u2013 for example, containers, packaging materials, soil, vehicles, vessels and machinery.\n\nThe IPPC was created by member countries of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations. The IPPC places emphasis on three core areas: international standard setting, information exchange and capacity development for the implementation of the IPPC and associated international phytosanitary standards.  The Secretariat of the IPPC is housed at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, and is responsible for the coordination of core activities under the IPPC work program.\n\nIn recent years the Commission of Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC has developed a strategic framework with the objectives of:\n* protecting sustainable agriculture and enhancing global food security through the prevention of pest spread;\n* protecting the environment, forests and biodiversity from plant pests;\n* facilitating economic and trade development through the promotion of harmonized scientifically based phytosanitary measures, and:\n* developing phytosanitary capacity for members to accomplish the preceding three objectives.\n\nBy focusing the Convention's efforts on these objectives, the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC intends to:\n* protect farmers from economically devastating pest and disease outbreaks.\n* protect the environment from the loss of species diversity.\n* protect ecosystems from the loss of viability and function as a result of pest invasions.\n* protect industries and consumers from the costs of pest control or eradication.\n* facilitate trade through International Standards that regulate the safe movements of plants and plant products.\n* protect livelihoods and food security by preventing the entry and spread of new pests of plants into a country.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Conservation (ethic)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ippc.int International Plant Protection

secure coordinated, effective action to prevent and to control the introduction and spread of [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s of plants and plant products. The Convention extends beyond the protection of cultivated plants to the protection of natural flora and plant products. It also takes into consideration both direct and indirect damage by pests, so it includes weeds.\n\nThe Convention created a governing body consisting of each party, known as the '''Commission on Phytosanitary Measures''', which oversees the implementation of the Convention. As of August 2017, the Convention has 183 parties, which includes 180 [[United Nations member states]], the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[European Union]]<ref>https://www.ippc.int/en/countries/all/list-countries/</ref>. The Convention is recognized by the [[World Trade Organization]]'s (WTO) [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] (the SPS Agreement) as the only international standard setting body for plant health.\n\nWhile the IPPC's primary focus is on plants and plant products moving in international trade, the Convention also covers research materials, biological control organisms, germplasm banks, containment facilities, food aid, emergency aid and anything else that can act as a vector for the spread of plant pests \u2013 for example, containers, packaging materials, soil, vehicles, vessels and machinery.\n\nThe IPPC was created by member countries of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations. The IPPC places emphasis on three core areas: international standard setting, information exchange and capacity development for the implementation of the IPPC and associated international phytosanitary standards.  The Secretariat of the IPPC is housed at FAO headquarters in Rome, Italy, and is responsible for the coordination of core activities under the IPPC work program.\n\nIn recent years the Commission of Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC has developed a strategic framework with the objectives of:\n* protecting sustainable agriculture and enhancing global food security through the prevention of pest spread;\n* protecting the environment, forests and biodiversity from plant pests;\n* facilitating economic and trade development through the promotion of harmonized scientifically based phytosanitary measures, and:\n* developing phytosanitary capacity for members to accomplish the preceding three objectives.\n\nBy focusing the Convention's efforts on these objectives, the Commission on Phytosanitary Measures of the IPPC intends to:\n*Protect farmers from economically devastating pest and disease outbreaks.\n*Protect the environment from the loss of species diversity.\n*Protect ecosystems from the loss of viability and function as a result of pest invasions.\n*Protect industries and consumers from the costs of pest control or eradication.\n*Facilitate trade through International Standards that regulate the safe movements of plants and plant products.\n*Protect livelihoods and food security by preventing the entry and spread of new pests of plants into a country.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Conservation (ethic)]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ippc.int International Plant Protection

He last appears alive in 1187 when he is still named as an archdeacon. He may be the Nicholas who gave a still extant first volume of the Bible to [[Lincoln Cathedral]].\n\n==Early career==\nNicholas derived his name from his office, as he was ''clericus de sigillo'', the next highest office in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|royal chancery]] after the [[chancellor]].

Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi, CSC, DD is head of the Diocese of Mymensingh. Most of the people in this Diocese are from Garo tribal community. Bishop is also a Garo tribal. A total of 76,047  Catholics and 6665 Protestant Christians live here.  People live on farming, day laborer in rural area and many people live in cities as migrant workers. Female Garo are very skill in beauty parlor profession.\n\n==History==\nMymensingh Diocese was part of Dhaka Archdiocese before in 1987.  It was created by Pope John Paul II. Rev. Bishop  Francis A Gomes was the first bishop in the Diocese of Mymensingh. \n \nIn 1909, five Garo leaders made a long trip down to Dhaka to ask the Catholic Bishops to send them a priest. A year later, Arch Bishop sent Fr. Fleury CSC and Brother Eugene CSC to study the situation.\n\nIn late 1910 and early 1911, Rev. Fr. Adolphe Francis CSC began the work in Tausalpara near Ranikhong. On 19 March 1911, Father Francis reaped the first fruits with 21 Catholic baptisms at Tausalpara. The first church among the Garos was built at Tausalpara in 1912, and in 1913 Rev. Fr. Francis began living there. In 1915, he moved to the Ranikhong hill where Ranikhong Parish is now.\n\nUntil 1918, Father Francis was practically always alone, tramping the Garo country from east to west, covering the 90 miles strip of territory, where in the following twenty-five years a total of six parishes were established.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2003, Rev. Fr. Ponen Paul Kubi CSC (at the time Director of the Pobitra Krush Sadhana Griha, Rampura, Dhaka) was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Mymensingh and consecrated in Mymensingh on 13 February 2004. On 15 July 2006, Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi CSC, was appointed Second Bishop of Mymensingh by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi, CSC, DD is head of the Diocese of Mymensingh. Most of the people in this Diocese are from Garo tribal community. Bishop is also a Garo tribal. A total of 76,047  Catholics and 6665 Protestant Christians live here.  People live on farming, day laborer in rural area and many people live in cities as migrant workers. Female Garo are very skill in beauty parlor profession.\n\n==History==\nMymensingh Diocese was part of Dhaka Archdiocese before in 1987.  It was created by Pope John Paul II. Rev. Bishop  Francis A Gomes was the first bishop in the Diocese of Mymensingh. \n \nIn 1909, five Garo leaders made a long trip down to Dhaka to ask the Catholic Bishops to send them a priest. A year later, Arch Bishop sent Fr. Fleury CSC and Brother Eugene CSC to study the situation.\n\nIn late 1910 and early 1911, Rev. Fr. Adolphe Francis CSC began the work in Tausalpara near Ranikhong. On 19 March 1911, Father Francis reaped the first fruits with 21 Catholic baptisms at Tausalpara. The first church among the Garos was built at Tausalpara in 1912, and in 1913 Rev. Fr. Francis began living there. In 1915, he moved to the Ranikhong hill where Ranikhong Parish is now.\n\nUntil 1918, Father Francis was practically always alone, tramping the Garo country from east to west, covering the 90 miles strip of territory, where in the following twenty-five years a total of six parishes were established.\n\nOn Christmas Day 2003, Rev. Fr. Ponen Paul Kubi CSC (at the time Director of the Pobitra Krush Sadhana Griha, Rampura, Dhaka) was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Mymensingh and consecrated in Mymensingh on 13 February 2004. On 15 July 2006, Bishop Ponen Paul Kubi CSC, was appointed Second Bishop of Mymensingh by [[Pope Benedict XVI]].

It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Three's Company]]'' and loosely based on the [[British sitcom]] ''[[George and Mildred]]'', which was itself a spin-off of ''[[Man About the House]]'', on which ''Three's Company'' was based.\n\nIt was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] of [[Los Angeles]], where its parent series, ''Three's Company'', was taping at the time, from February to April 1979 (Season 1) and from July 1979 to February 1980 (Season 2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|title=Shows - CBS Television City|work=cbstelevisioncity.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focused on middle-aged couple [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] ([[Norman Fell]]) and [[Helen Roper]] ([[Audra Lindley]]), who were landlords to [[Jack Tripper|Jack]], [[Janet Wood|Janet]] and [[Chrissy Snow|Chrissy]] on ''Three's Company''.\n\nIn this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the ''Three's Company'' episode \"An Anniversary Surprise\" (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California|Cheviot Hills]], where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness. Despite her attempts to fit in, she often proves herself to be as bumbling as her husband.\n* '''Jeffrey P. Brookes III''' ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The snobbish [[Real estate broker|realtor]] who is also the Ropers' next-door neighbor.\n* '''Anne Brookes''' ([[Patty McCormack|Patricia McCormack]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Brookes' long-suffering, down-to-earth homemaker wife, who looks after the house and their young son David. She and Helen become friendly, despite their husbands' frequently adversarial relationship with one another.\n* '''David Brookes''' (Evan Cohen) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Jeffrey and Anne Brookes' 7-year-old son who is always tempted to bother Mr. Roper, which his parents don't approve.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Jenny Ballinger''' ([[Stevie Vallance|Louise Vallance]]) (season 2)\u2014A young woman who had been living in the Ropers' storeroom\n* '''Ethel Ambrewster''' ([[Dena Dietrich]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Helen's snobby elder sister; gives her an air kiss every time she sees Helen.\n* '''Hubert Ambrewster''' ([[Rod Colbin]])\u2014Ethel's husband and Helen's brother-in-law\n* '''Debbie Hopper''' ([[Lois Hamilton|Lois Areno]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014The girl Stanley sees at the hot tub in the neighborhood\n* '''Joey''' ([[Richard B. Shull]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Stanley's best friend and one of Helen's enemies\n* '''Hilda''' ([[Lucy Lee Flippin]]/Darcy Pulliam) (season 2)\u2014Helen's sister who has 5 children and 1 on the way with her husband, \"Fertile\" Freddy\n* '''Mother''' ([[Lucille Benson]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014Helen, Hilda, and Ethel's mother.\n\n==Creation==\nAfter the enormous success of ''Three's Company'' in its short first season in 1977, ABC head [[Fred Silverman]] was anxious to capitalize on the show's success. In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good. For audiences, it was a chance to see all of the three landlord characters &ndash; played by Fell, Lindley, and Knotts &ndash; on the same stage.\n\nTambor appeared on ''Three's Company'' that same season playing a different character, a wealthy but unwelcome suitor of Chrissy's cousin Cindy (Season 5, Episode #13). Tambor also made other guest appearances on ''Three's Company,'' portraying different characters.\n\nThe show was ranked number two on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's \"Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1845866_1846026_1845969,00.html|title=The Ropers, 1979\u201380 \u2013 Top 10 Worst TV Spin-Offs|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=2010-12-30|date=October 1, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' named ''The Ropers'' the 49th worst TV series of all time.<ref>{{cite book|title=TV Guide Book of Lists|url=https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse|url-access=registration|year=2007|publisher=Running Press|isbn=0-7624-3007-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/tvguidebookoflis0000unse/page/181 181]}}</ref>\n\n== Proposed spin-off ==\nIn 1986, distributor D. L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spin-off of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spin-off would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]] and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jim J. Bullock|Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''.

Two episodes of the series, however, play in the syndication package of ''Three's Company''. When initially offered in syndication, the series ran under the title '''''Three's Company's Friends, The Ropers'''''. That version used an instrumental version of the original series' theme song. Six episodes of the series were aired on [[TV Land]] in September 2006, and four episodes were aired on [[WGN America]] in October 2008.\n\nBeginning in January 2011 [[Antenna TV]], a television network designed for digital television subchannels and owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], aired the sitcom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2010/12/our-exclusive-interview-with-antenna.html|title=Our Exclusive Interview with Antenna TV's Sean Compton; KTLA Preview of Antenna TV; 2011 SAG Nominations - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> The series started on Tuesday, February 15, 2011, and went through one entire rotation of all episodes before being removed from the lineup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sitcomsonline.com/2011/01/antenna-tv-premieres-ropers-on-feb-15.html|title=Antenna TV Premieres The Ropers on Feb. 15, 2011; Remembering Character Actor Peter Hobbs - SitcomsOnline.com News Blog|work=sitcomsonline.com}}</ref> On August 29, 2011, the show returned to the lineup as the ''Three's Company'' cycle again came to the point of the series where the Ropers left.\n\nAntenna TV usually shows back-to-back episodes of ''Three's Company''.

It is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of ''[[Three's Company]]'' and loosely based on the [[British sitcom]] ''[[George and Mildred]]'', which was itself a spin-off of ''[[Man About the House]]'', on which ''Three's Company'' was based.\n\nIt was taped at [[CBS Television City]] in the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles|Fairfax District]] of [[Los Angeles]], where its parent series, ''Three's Company'', was taping at the time, from February to April 1979 (Season 1) and from July 1979 to February 1980 (Season 2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbstelevisioncity.com/shows|title=Shows - CBS Television City|work=cbstelevisioncity.com}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe series focused on middle-aged couple [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] ([[Norman Fell]]) and [[Helen Roper]] ([[Audra Lindley]]), who were landlords to [[Jack Tripper|Jack]], [[Janet Wood|Janet]] and [[Chrissy Snow|Chrissy]] on ''Three's Company''.\n\nIn this spin-off, the Ropers have sold their apartment building in the ''Three's Company'' episode \"An Anniversary Surprise\" (season 3, episode 20) to live in the upmarket community of [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles, California|Cheviot Hills]], where the social-climbing Helen struggled to fit in with her neighbors. Stanley made little attempt to fit in with the standards of the community, thereby causing Helen much embarrassment.\n\nAs was the case during their time on ''Three's Company'', opening credits for ''The Ropers'' alternate between Audra Lindley and Norman Fell credited first.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''[[Stanley Roper]]''' ([[Norman Fell]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A lower-middle-class, frugal, and often embarrassing retiree, who moved to [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles|Cheviot Hills]] after he is duped into buying a townhouse\n* '''[[Helen Roper]]''' ([[Audra Lindley]]) (seasons 1\u20132)\u2014A sexually frustrated, social-climbing middle-aged woman who tries to fit into the community despite her husband Stanley's constant boorishness.

In early 1977, Silverman approached Fell and Lindley with the subject of doing a spin-off from the show after its first full season wrapped in the spring of 1978. Both actors as well as the ''Three's Company'' producers begged off as the show had yet to prove itself for an entire season. With the show's continued success in its second season, however, the idea was brought up again in 1978, this time by ''Three's Company's'' own producers as well as new ABC head Tony Thomopolous (Silverman had gone to [[NBC]]). The idea intrigued Lindley, but Fell was extremely reluctant, as he was satisfied with his role on a show that was already a proven hit. Fell feared that a spin-off would be unsuccessful and thus put him out of a good role and job. To alleviate his fears, ''Three's Company'' producers contractually promised Fell that they would give the new series a year to prove itself. If the show were to be canceled prior to that time, then he and Lindley would return to ''Three's Company''. A reluctant Fell agreed to the new terms.\n\nLike ''Three's Company'', ''The Ropers'' was introduced as a late season replacement series in the spring of 1979 premiering the same night as ''Three's Company'' on ABC's successful Tuesday night lineup, airing at 10{{nbsp}}pm. In its first season, the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] for the show were very high (the show finished at #8 for the 1978\u201379 season), and had the second-highest series premiere rating at the time.<ref name=ourdoor>{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Chris |title=Come and Knock on Our Door: A Hers and Hers and His Guide to Three's Company|publisher=Macmillan|year=1998|isbn=0-312-16803-9|page=113}}</ref> After the season premiere, ''Three's Company'' went on hiatus, but ''The Ropers'' still did well. ABC reran the episodes over the summer of 1979 (in August on Sundays) where they continued to achieve high ratings leading many to believe that the series would enjoy a long run.\n\n== Cancellation ==\nAt the beginning of the 1979\u201380 season, ABC moved the show to Saturdays at 8{{nbsp}}pm, resulting in an audience drop that put it near the bottom of the ratings. Being placed on Saturday nights, rather than on the ABC Tuesday night lineup, caused an immediate fall into the bottom ten (#52 out of 61 shows for the week of September 17\u201323, its second week of the season) as the show was in direct competition with the NBC show ''[[CHiPs]]''. The show later moved to 8:30{{nbsp}}pm on Saturdays by January 1980. The move upset Fell to the point that he actually went to ABC headquarters in New York to plead with the network to move the show to a better time slot. His effort was in vain, however, and the show continued to pull in low ratings. The drop in ratings and the fact that the show wasn't pulling in the key young demographic audience led to announcement of the show's cancellation by ABC in May 1980. The last three episodes aired Thursdays at 9:30{{nbsp}}pm after ''[[Barney Miller]]'' in May 1980. Audra Lindley stated in Chris Mann's 1997 book about ''Three's Company'' that she was surprised that ''The Ropers'' had been canceled after a late-season surge in the series ratings had allowed it to finish the 1979\u201380 season at number 25<ref name=ourdoor/>; the Nielsen ratings for that year, however, list the series ''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'' at number 25.{{or|date=September 2019}}\n\nWith the series canceled, Fell approached ''Three's Company'' producers about the Ropers returning to the show. However, during the time ''The Ropers'' was on the air, the landlord characters had been replaced on ''Three's Company'' by Ralph Furley ([[Don Knotts]]). The addition had worked well and ''Three's Company'' had retained its popularity. The idea of returning Fell and Lindley to their original ''Three's Company'' roles was undesirable to producers and ABC, mainly because they had one character playing the landlord role now as opposed to two, which would require more money to be paid out per episode; the cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just as Suzanne Somers began to renegotiate her contract, which would lead to her very public contract dispute during the 1980\u201381 television season that led to her departure from the series. The cancellation of ''The Ropers'' came just one month after the one-year contractual deadline had passed. Fell would later state that he always believed the decision to pull the plug on the show had been made much earlier, but that the network deliberately postponed making the cancellation official until after the one-year mark specifically to be relieved of the obligation to allow Fell and Lindley to return to ''Three's Company''. There was an attempt by producers to sell the show to Silverman over at NBC; Silverman, however, passed on it too.\n\nDespite the hard feelings, in March 1981 both Fell and Lindley made one final guest appearance on ''Three's Company'' (in Season 5, Episode #18 \"Night of The Ropers\") nearly a year after the end of their own series before the characters were retired for good.

L. Taffner revealed its plans for a spin-off of ''The Ropers'' called ''Three Apartments''. The spin-off would again star Fell and Lindley, this time as landlords of a three-unit apartment building. The show was offered as either a two-year, 44-episode package in syndication starting April 1987, or as a 52-episode package on NBC-owned station checkerboards beginning in September 1987. Guest stars would include [[John Ritter]], [[Joyce DeWitt]], [[Richard Kline]], and [[Don Knotts]] from ''Three's Company''; [[Robert Mandan]] from ''[[Three's a Crowd]]''; and [[Jim J. Bullock|Jm J. Bullock]] and [[Nancy Dussault]] from ''[[Too Close for Comfort]]''/''The Ted Knight Show''.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" paper strip is called a plume and together with silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]] All KISSES wrappers have the paper strip called a plume as an identification tag sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.<ref>https://www.hersheys.com/en_us/promotions/kisses/about-hersheys-kisses.html</ref>  When the paper plume was added to the KISSES wrapper in 1921, originally it was a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, distinguishing Hershey's KISSES from its competitors. \n<ref>https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/01/priority-hersheys-kisses-got-name-machine-makes-makes-kissing-sounds-appears-kiss-conveyor-belt-onto-chocolate-dispensed/</ref> A few years later in 1924, Hershey received a registered US trademark for its wrapper design, consisting of the conical foil wrapper plus the paper plume.\n\nLater \"KISSES\" was printed on the paper plume, as well as other KISSES flavors.

This idea was the suggestion of John Figi, owner of Figi's \u201cGifts in Good Taste\u201d - a mail order food gifts company based in Marshfield, Wisconsin. The green and red colored wrapped chocolates were featured for the first time in the Figi's Christmas catalog.  \nIn 1968, pastel blue, pink, and green wrappers were introduced for [[Easter]], and in 1986, [[Valentine's Day]]-themed wrappers of red and silver were introduced. Xs and Os have also appeared on pink and red wrappers as well as little red hearts on silver wrappers for Valentine's Day. \"Fall Harvest\" colors were introduced in 1991. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] has silver with red stripes and blue-starred wrappers. Pink wrappers with \"ribbons\" on them to support breast cancer research have also appeared. Camouflage wrappers are also available, primarily on military bases. Kisses Dark Chocolates come in a deep purple wrapper.  The [[Halloween]] themed Kisses Candy Corn candies come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color of a [[candy corn]] with yellow, white and orange stripes swirling around the candy. In 2016 four limited Holiday wrapper varieties were released: Santa hats, Kissmas sweaters that resemble knit Christmas sweaters, Kissmas Trees with plumes that read Fa La La, and Kissmas Presents with plumes that read from me to you. The Christmas themed Kisses Candy Cane candies also come in a wrapper whose colors imitate the color pattern (red stripes and white chocolate). The original silver (for regular) and gold (for almonds) wrappers are available year-round.\n\nHershey is introducing new pastel-colored wrappers with white polka dots for the upcoming Easter season. This created controversy within the organization because many workers and environmentalists have requested a more environmentally-friendly packaging, which would have eliminated the aluminum wrapping and replaced it with biodegradable materials. This was supposed to be rolled out on April 1, 2009.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Paper plume==\n[[File:Hershey's-Kiss-Wrapped-in-Foil-with-Plume-Sticking-Out.jpg|thumb|The \"KISSES\" paper strip is called a plume and together with silver aluminum foil are the traditional packaging for the Hershey's Milk Chocolate Kiss]].<ref>https://www.hersheys.com/en_us/promotions/kisses/about-hersheys-kisses.html</ref>  All Hershey's KISSES wrappers have the paper strip plume as an identification tag sticking from the top of the foil wrapper.  When the paper plume was added to the KISSES wrapper in 1921, originally it was a flag for the \"Hershey's\" brand, distinguishing Hershey's KISSES from its competitors. \n<ref>https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/01/priority-hersheys-kisses-got-name-machine-makes-makes-kissing-sounds-appears-kiss-conveyor-belt-onto-chocolate-dispensed/</ref> A few years later in 1924, Hershey received a registered US trademark for its wrapper design, consisting of the conical foil wrapper plus the paper plume.\n\nLater \"KISSES\" was printed on the paper plume, as well as other KISSES flavors.  The Company has also added special variety plumes (such as \"cheesecake\")and special messages have been available for various occasions, including:\n\n=== Seasonal ===\n<!-- Please respect alphabetical order -->\n*Friends all the time\n*Happy Halloween\n*Embrace the Memories\n*Peace train\n*Happy Holidays\n*Double Dip It\n*Hugs forever\n*Love is in the air\n*Rise and Grind\n*Love you to the moon and back\n*Cherish the Memories\n*Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n*We're all in this together\n*Hippity Hoppity\n\n==Packaging varieties==\n\n* Chinese New Year Gift Box - contains gold and red wrapped Kisses\n\n==Advertising==\n\"[[Christmas Bells (advertisement)|Christmas Bells]]\" is a commercial in which Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], perform the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] \"[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]\".
