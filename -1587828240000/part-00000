Along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins and [[Russell Sturgis]], he was part owner of the ''Hope'', a 70-ton [[brigantine]] built at [[Kittery, Maine]] in 1789.

Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and Eleazar Johnson, of the ''Hazard'', which was built at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1796. The ''Hazard'' made several voyages to the Northwest Coast and China under captain [[Benjamin Swift (sea captain)|Benjamin Swift]]. The first was from 1797\u20131799, the second was from 1799\u20131802, the third from 1802\u20131805. The fourth, under captain William Smith, was from 1805\u20131808. After James Magee's death his widow Margaret Magee inherited his share and she was one of the owners of the ''Hazard'' from July 1802 to April 1809. Margaret Magee was the only Boston woman known to have owned a share in a maritime fur trade vessel.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 109</ref>\n\nJames Magee was captain of the ''[[Margaret (ship)|Margaret]]'', which was on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1792. He was part owner of the ''Margaret'', along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and James & Thomas Lamb. The ''Margaret'' was a Boston\u2013built ship of 161 tons, 8 [[swivel gun]]s, and a crew of 25, and was launched in the fall of 1791.<ref name=lee1969/> The crew included the \"historian\" Jonathan Howell who, with Magee, collected many artifacts from the Pacific Northwest Coast and Hawaii for the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref name=malloy30130/>\n\nThe ''Margaret'' reached [[Haida Gwaii]], via [[Cape Horn]], in April 1792. James Magee had fallen ill and the first mate, David Lamb, was in command. In May, still at Haida Gwaii, the ''Margaret'' encountered the ''Columbia Rediviva'', under captain Robert Gray. Like other traders at the time, Magee found the trade goods he had brought were no longer much desired by the indigenous people of the Northwest Coast. In May 1792 he wrote in the ship's log: ''\"The Articles of Trade we mostly made up of in this place were Muskets, Copper, some Cloathing, a new Iron Necklaces, but any of Iron mecanical Tools they were not fond of except files, which they were very fond of but to our disadvantage we had none.\"''<ref name=malloy30130/>\n\nThe ''Margaret'' was able to quickly acquire about 1,200 [[sea otter]] pelts and sailed to China via the [[Hawaiian Islands]], arriving at Canton in December 1792. From Canton the ''Margaret'' sailed back to the Northwest Coast, arriving at [[Nootka Sound]] in April 1793. A party of men had been left there to build a small [[Ship's tender|tender]], which was ready by the time the ''Margaret'' returned. Between the two vessels over 3,000 sea otter pelts were collected, which the ''Margaret'' took to China via Hawaii, arriving at Canton in December 1793. From Canton the ''Margaret'' returned to Boston, arriving on 17 August 1794.<ref name=lee1969/> Upon return, James Magee presented the Massachusetts Historical Society with an \"extract of the log-books and journals\" and a large collection of \"curiosities\", most of which are now in the collection of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=malloy30130/> The voyage of the ''Margaret'' was very profitable and inspired many other New Englanders to enter the maritime fur trade, which was booming by 1800.<ref name=lee1969/>\n\nWhile captain of the ''Margaret'' James Magee encountered [[George Vancouver]] on the Northwest Coast. Magee sent Vancouver a complaint, saying that the British captains [[William Brown (sea captain)|William Brown]] of the ''[[Butterworth (1785 ship)|Butterworth]]'' and James Baker of the ''Jenny'' had fired upon the natives in [[Clayoquot Sound]] in August 1792, and should be charged with piracy.

He was now wealthy and successful, and settled down in Roxbury. He continued to join commercial ventures but did not again captain ships himself. In 1798 he bought the former mansion of Governor [[William Shirley]]. Later, in 1819, his widow Margaret Magee sold the property to Governor [[William Eustis]]. Thus today the mansion is known as the [[Shirley\u2013Eustis House]]. During his voyages James Magee had collected a number of artifacts, which he presented at various times to [[Harvard University]], the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]], and the [[Boston Marine Society]]. He was a member of the Boston Marine Society and the [[Charitable Irish Society of Boston]].<ref name=lee1969/>\n\nIn 1795 James Magee, along with James Lamb, Russell Sturgis, and Stephen Hills (sometimes called \"Hill\"), bought the British brig ''Fairy'', which they renamed ''Sea Otter''. The ''Sea Otter'' sailed to the Northwest Coast and China in 1795\u20131798. The captain was Stephen Hills and the supercargo Mr. Elliot. Sometime in 1796, at [[Cumshewa, British Columbia|Cumshewa]], [[Cumshewa Inlet]], in [[Haida Gwaii]], the captain, supercargo, and two others, were killed by [[Haida people|Haida]] when they went ashore in a small boat. According to [[William F. Sturgis]], the attack was led by the Haida Chief [[Scotsi]], his brother, and a few others, and was in retaliation for a \"vile outrage\" that had shortly before \"been committed by the crew of an English vessel\". The ''Sea Otter'' continued under the command of William Bowles, who had been first mate. Among the officers was James Rowan, who later took revenge upon Scotsi and others while captain of the ''Eliza''.<ref name=malloy30130/> The ''Sea Otter'' arrived in Canton in November 1797 with a cargo of 2,520 sea otter skins and 2,755 sea otter tails, valued at over $47,000. The vessel returned to Boston in July 1798 with almost 50,000 pounds of tea, 7,000 pieces of [[nankeen]]s, 100 sets of [[Chinese export porcelain|chinaware]], 300 [[tea set]]s, and a quantity of silk fabric and thread. The owners made a profit ten times the value of their original investment.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 157</ref>\n\nIn 1800\u20131801 James Magee's brother, Bernard, captained the ''Globe'' on another voyage to the Northwest Coast and China. The ''Globe'' was a 245-ton ship built in 1800 at [[Newbury, Massachusetts]]. It was owned by J. and T.H. Perkins, and Bernard and James Magee.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 104</ref> Bernard Magee was killed in 1801 at [[Skidegate]], [[Haida Gwaii]], when the ''Globe'', was attacked by Haida. According to [[William F. Sturgis]], the attack was retribution for the execution of five Kaigani Haida chiefs by [[James D. Ingersoll]], captain of the ''Charlotte''. Ingersoll's act was itself retribution for an earlier attack upon the ''[[Belle Savage]]''.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nBy 1800 James Magee's health was failing. In the fall of 1800 Magee and his wife joined Thomas Handasyd Perkins on a trip to [[Ballston Spa, New York|Ballston Spa]] and [[Saratoga Springs, New York]], partly for Magee's health.

Perkins also created a criminal opium syndicate known as The Boston Concern.<ref name=\"Chaitkin1999\"/>\n\nJames Magee was part owner of several ships involved in the maritime fur trade. Along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins and [[Russell Sturgis]], he was part owner of the ''Hope'', a 70-ton [[brigantine]] built at [[Kittery, Maine]] in 1789.

Sturgis]] aboard.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\nMagee was also part owner, along with J. & T.H. Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and Eleazar Johnson, of the ''Hazard'', which was built at [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] in 1796. The ''Hazard'' made several voyages to the Northwest Coast and China under captain [[Benjamin Swift (sea captain)|Benjamin Swift]]. The first was from 1797\u20131799, the second was from 1799\u20131802, the third from 1802\u20131805. The fourth, under captain William Smith, was from 1805\u20131808. After James Magee's death his widow Margaret Magee inherited his share and she was one of the owners of the ''Hazard'' from July 1802 to April 1809. Margaret Magee was the only Boston woman known to have owned a share in a maritime fur trade vessel.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 109</ref>\n\nJames Magee was captain of the ''[[Margaret (ship)|Margaret]]'', which was on the Pacific Northwest Coast in 1792. He was part owner of the ''Margaret'', along with Thomas Handasyd Perkins, Russell Sturgis, and James & Thomas Lamb. The ''Margaret'' was a Boston\u2013built ship of 161 tons, 8 [[swivel gun]]s, and a crew of 25, and was launched in the fall of 1791.<ref name=lee1969/> The crew included the \"historian\" Jonathan Howell who, with Magee, collected many artifacts from the Pacific Northwest Coast and Hawaii for the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]].<ref name=malloy30130/>\n\nThe ''Margaret'' reached [[Haida Gwaii]], via [[Cape Horn]], in April 1792. James Magee had fallen ill and the first mate, David Lamb, was in command. In May, still at Haida Gwaii, the ''Margaret'' encountered the ''Columbia Rediviva'', under captain Robert Gray. Like other traders at the time, Magee found the trade goods he had brought were no longer much desired by the indigenous people of the Northwest Coast. In May 1792 he wrote in the ship's log: ''\"The Articles of Trade we mostly made up of in in this place were Muskets, Copper, some Cloathing, a new Iron Necklaces, but any of Iron mecanical Tools they were not fond of except files, which they were very fond of but to our disadvantage we had none.\"''<ref name=malloy30130/>\n\nThe ''Margaret'' was able to quickly acquire about 1,200 [[sea otter]] pelts and sailed to China via the [[Hawaiian Islands]], arriving at Canton in December 1792. From Canton the ''Margaret'' sailed back to the Northwest Coast, arriving at [[Nootka Sound]] in April 1793. A party of men had been left there to build a small [[Ship's tender|tender]], which was ready by the time the ''Margaret'' returned. Between the two vessels over 3,000 sea otter pelts were collected, which the ''Margaret'' took to China via Hawaii, arriving at Canton in December 1793. From Canton the ''Margaret'' returned to Boston, arriving on 17 August 1794.<ref name=lee1969/> Upon return, James Magee presented the Massachusetts Historical Society with an \"extract of the log-books and journals\" and a large collection of \"curiosities\", most of which are now in the collection of the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] at [[Harvard University]].<ref name=malloy30130/> The voyage of the ''Margaret'' was very profitable and inspired many other New Englanders to enter the maritime fur trade, which was booming by 1800.<ref name=lee1969/>\n\nWhile captain of the ''Margaret'' James Magee encountered [[George Vancouver]] on the Northwest Coast. Magee sent Vancouver a complaint, saying that the British captains [[William Brown (sea captain)|William Brown]] of the ''[[Butterworth (1785 ship)|Butterworth]]'' and James Baker of the ''Jenny'' had fired upon the natives in [[Clayoquot Sound]] in August 1792, and should be charged with piracy.

He was now wealthy and successful, and settled down in Roxbury. He continued to join commercial ventures but did not again captain ships himself. In 1798 he bought the former mansion of Governor [[William Shirley]]. Later, in 1819, his widow Margaret Magee sold the property to Governor [[William Eustis]]. Thus today the mansion is known as the [[Shirley\u2013Eustis House]]. During his voyages James Magee had collected a number of artifacts, which he presented at various times to [[Harvard University]], the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]], and the [[Boston Marine Society]]. He was a member of the Boston Marine Society and the [[Charitable Irish Society of Boston]].<ref name=lee1969/>\n\nIn 1795 James Magee, along with James Lamb, Russell Sturgis, and Stephen Hills (sometimes called \"Hill\"), bought the British brig ''Fairy'', which they renamed ''Sea Otter''. The ''Sea Otter'' sailed to the Northwest Coast and China in 1795\u20131798. The captain was Stephen Hills and the supercargo Mr. Elliot. Sometime in 1796, at [[Cumshewa, British Columbia|Cumshewa]], [[Cumshewa Inlet]], in [[Haida Gwaii]], the captain, supercargo, and two others, were killed by [[Haida people|Haida]] when they went ashore in a small boat.

The owners made a profit ten times the value of their original investment.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 157</ref>\n\nIn 1800\u20131801 James Magee's brother, Bernard, captained the ''Globe'' on another voyage to the Northwest Coast and China. The ''Globe'' was a 245-ton ship built in 1800 at [[Newbury, Massachusetts]]. It was owned by J. and T.H. Perkins, and Bernard and James Magee.<ref>Malloy, Mary (1998), p. 104</ref> Bernard Magee was killed in 1801 at [[Skidegate]], [[Haida Gwaii]], when the ''Globe'', was attacked by Haida.

The Lower Lake was constructed in the 1820s to feed the [[Bude Canal]]; it is now a nature reserve. The Upper Lake was constructed in the 1970s and supplies fresh water to the [[Bude]] area, as well as having some recreational use.\n\n=== Border ===\nThe east [[Bank (geography)|bank]] of the Tamar was fixed as the border of Cornwall by [[\u00c6thelstan|King Athelstan]] in the year 936.<ref>Stenton, F. M. (1947) ''Anglo-Saxon England''. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 337</ref> Several villages north of [[Launceston, Cornwall|Launceston]], to the west of the Tamar, were transferred to Devon somewhen in the eleventh century; the border was changed to follow the [[River Ottery]] westward, rather than the Tamar. The county boundary was restored to the Tamar in 1966, when the civil parishes of [[North Petherwin]] and [[Werrington, Cornwall|Werrington]] were transferred from Devon to Cornwall.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=Ordnance Survey|title=174 Bude|year=1961|scale=1:63,360|series=Seventh}}</ref> The [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844]] ensured parishes were entirely within one county. It transferred a part of the [[Rame Peninsula]] (on the west side of the [[Hamoaze]]) from Devon to Cornwall (namely, parts of the parishes of [[Maker, Cornwall|Maker]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Robin|title=Cornwall|year=1978|publisher=Batsford|location=London|isbn=0-7134-0588-0|page=31}}</ref> and [[St John, Cornwall|St John]]).

Only three 'exceptions' to the rule that the border follows the river (from source to sea) currently exist, all of which are upstream of the confluence of the [[River Deer]], in the upper course of the Tamar.<ref>The three present-day 'exceptions' can be clearly seen on the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:River_Tamar_map.png Tamar catchment map] (on WikiCommons).</ref> Part of the Cornish [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of North Tamerton extends east across the river, whilst parts of the Devon civil parishes of Bridgerule and [[Pancrasweek]] extend west across the Tamar. Where the border does follow the Tamar, it is defined as being along a line running at the [[Thalweg|centre of the river]] \u2014 where the river is tidal, it is the centre of the low water channel.  This \"centre of river\" arrangement ends just upstream of the Tamar Bridge at [[Saltash]], downstream of which the counties officially extend only to their respective (tidal) bank's [[tide|low water]] mark. The river is dammed at two points of its upper course, forming two reservoirs in place of the natural river: at [[Upper Tamar Lake]] the border follows the line of the river as it was prior to the construction of the reservoir (therefore now within the lake), whilst at the older [[Lower Tamar Lake]] the border was re-aligned along a (now disused) re-routing of the river to the reservoir's west side, placing the lake in Devon.<ref name=ordnance>[[Ordnance Survey]] mapping</ref>\n\n=== Crossings ===\n[[File:St Stephens by Launceston, Higher New Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 37541.jpg|thumb|Higher New Bridge, near St Stephen by Launceston]]\nThe river has 22 road crossings, including some medieval stone bridges. The oldest bridge still extant is at Horsebridge (1437), and the next oldest is Greystone Bridge near Lawhitton \u2014 this arched stone bridge was built in 1439. Gunnislake New Bridge was built in 1520 by Sir Piers Edgcumbe, the owner of Cotehele and Mount Edgcumbe. The [[Gunnislake]] bridge was a main route into south east Cornwall and the lowest bridge over the Tamar until the [[Tamar Bridge]] at Saltash was opened in 1962.\n\nThe lower Tamar is spanned also by the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] (built 1859), a rail bridge now adjacent to the newer Tamar Bridge. Both of these bridges are between [[Saltash]] (known as the 'Gateway to Cornwall') and Plymouth. Further downstream, crossing the [[Hamoaze]], is the [[Torpoint Ferry]] \u2014 a [[chain ferry]] connecting Torpoint to Devonport \u2014 and at the most downstream part of the Hamoaze there is also the [[Cremyll Ferry]].\n\nThe [[Calstock Viaduct]] is another notable structure on the Tamar, being 120 feet (37&nbsp;m) high with twelve 60-foot (18&nbsp;m) wide arches, of which three of the piers stand in the river, and was built between 1904 and 1907.\n\n==== Table of crossings ====\nListed below are all crossings of the River Tamar, in order heading downstream.

In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], four miles by [[trail|track]] from the river port of Morwellham, was significant.<ref name=booker28>Booker (1971: 28\u201329)</ref> Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous [[Lime kiln|limekilns]] on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not [[Slaking (geology)|slaked]] before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning.  Later, street sweepings and other refuse from [[Plymouth]] and [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]], together with bones for the newly discovered [[Bone meal|bone fertiliser]], were carried inland to manure the fields.

Tamara wanted to wander freely in the mortal world, against the advice of her parents. One day, wandering in [[Dartmoor]], she happened to meet two giants called Tavy and Torridge (or Tawradge). Both giants became smitten with Tamara and vied for her affections. Tamara led the giants on a dance, but never let them touch her, instead darting out of reach whenever they came too close. Tamara's father, who had been out looking for her, located her just as the giants finally caught up with her near [[Morwenstow]]. He flew into a rage and used a spell to put Tavy and Tawradge into a deep sleep. This infuriated Tamara, who subsequently refused to return to the underworld with her father. He became even more enraged and cast a spell on Tamara, turning her into a bubbling spring, which produced the Tamar river and flowed all the way to the sea. Tawradge awoke to find his beloved had become a river; in despair, he sought the advice of a magician, who turned him into a river (the [[River Torridge]] and the [[River Taw]]) so that he could hope to reunite with Tamara. Tawradge was never able to find and merge with his beloved Tamara, instead turning north toward [[Bideford]] and the [[Bristol Channel]] and is still said to mourn his love, the Tamar. This legend explains why the River Torridge, which rises only 500 meters from the Tamar, veers away from the Tamar and forms a huge arc, eventually flowing to the North Devon coast. The other giant, Tavy, also awoke in despair and sought the aid of his own father, also a powerful magician. His father turned Tavy into a river as well, and the [[River Tavy|Tavy]] set off in search of the Tamar, eventually finding her and merging with her into a wide and beautiful estuary.<ref name=\"Furneaux\" /><ref name=\"Foot\" /><ref name=\"Neale\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n* [[List of rivers of England]]\n* [[HMS Tamar]], a vessel named after the river\n* [[Tamar Site]], an area in Hong Kong named after the ship, which was named after the river\n* [[RM Tamar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Booker|first=Frank|title=Industrial Archaeology of The Tamar Valley|edition=2|year=1971|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, England|isbn=0-7153-5172-9}}\n* Carrington, N.

The river is dammed at two points of its upper course, forming two reservoirs in place of the natural river: at [[Upper Tamar Lake]] the border follows the line of the river as it was prior to the construction of the reservoir (therefore now within the lake), whilst at the older [[Lower Tamar Lake]] the border was re-aligned along a (now disused) re-routing of the river to the reservoir's west side, placing the lake in Devon.<ref name=ordnance>[[Ordnance Survey]] mapping</ref>\n\n=== Crossings ===\n[[File:St Stephens by Launceston, Higher New Bridge - geograph.org.uk - 37541.jpg|thumb|Higher New Bridge, near St Stephen by Launceston]]\nThe river has 22 road crossings, including some medieval stone bridges.

Gunnislake New Bridge was built in 1520 by Sir Piers Edgcumbe, the owner of Cotehele and Mount Edgcumbe. The [[Gunnislake]] bridge was a main route into south east Cornwall and the lowest bridge over the Tamar until the [[Tamar Bridge]] at Saltash was opened in 1962.\n\nThe lower Tamar is spanned also by the [[Royal Albert Bridge]] (built 1859), a rail bridge now adjacent to the newer Tamar Bridge. Both of these bridges are between [[Saltash]] (known as the 'Gateway to Cornwall') and Plymouth. Further downstream, crossing the [[Hamoaze]], is the [[Torpoint Ferry]] \u2014 a [[chain ferry]] connecting Torpoint to Devonport \u2014 and at the most downstream part of the Hamoaze there is also the [[Cremyll Ferry]].\n\nThe [[Calstock Viaduct]] is another notable structure on the Tamar, being 120 feet (37&nbsp;m) high with twelve 60-foot (18&nbsp;m) wide arches, of which three of the piers stand in the river, and was built between 1904 and 1907.\n\n==== Table of crossings ====\nListed below are all crossings of the River Tamar, in order heading downstream.

In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at [[Tavistock Abbey|Tavistock]], four miles by [[trail|track]] from the river port of Morwellham, was significant.<ref name=booker28>Booker (1971: 28\u201329)</ref> Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous [[Lime kiln|limekilns]] on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not [[Slaking (geology)|slaked]] before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning.  Later, street sweepings and other refuse from [[Plymouth]] and [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]], together with bones for the newly discovered [[Bone meal|bone fertiliser]], were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from [[British Columbia]] and the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], in large [[Beam (structure)|baulks]] for use as [[pit prop|supports]] in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.<ref>Barton (1964: 65; 76)</ref>\n[[File:Horsebridge - geograph.org.uk - 22243.jpg|thumb|right|The Horsebridge, built in 1437, is still used by motor traffic.]]\n[[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]] was one of the three [[Stannary|stannary towns]] of Devon and large quantities of [[Black tin|refined tin ore]] were exported through Morwellham from  twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed.<ref name=\"booker28\" /> The opening of the [[Tavistock Canal]], between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic.

Tamara wanted to wander freely in the mortal world, against the advice of her parents. One day, wandering in [[Dartmoor]], she happened to meet two giants called Tavy and Torridge (or Tawradge). Both giants became smitten with Tamara and vied for her affections. Tamara led the giants on a dance, but never let them touch her, instead darting out of reach whenever they came too close. Tamara's father, who had been out looking for her, located her just as the giants finally caught up with her near [[Morwenstow]]. He flew into a rage and used a spell to put Tavy and Tawradge into a deep sleep. This infuriated Tamara, who subsequently refused to return to the underworld with her father. He became even more enraged and cast a spell on Tamara, turning her into a bubbling spring, which produced the Tamar river and flowed all the way to the sea. Tawradge awoke to find his beloved had become a river; in despair, he sought the advice of a magician, who turned him into a river (the [[River Torridge]] and the [[River Taw]]) so that he could hope to reunite with Tamara. Tawradge was never able to find and merge with his beloved Tamara, instead turning north toward [[Bideford]] and the [[Bristol Channel]] and is still said to mourn his love, the Tamar. This legend explains why the River Torridge, which rises only 500 meters from the Tamar, veers away from the Tamar and forms a huge arc, eventually flowing to the North Devon coast. The other giant, Tavy, also awoke in despair and sought the aid of his own father, also a powerful magician. His father turned Tavy into a river as well, and the [[River Tavy|Tavy]] set off in search of the Tamar, eventually finding her and merging with her into a wide and beautiful estuary.<ref name=\"Furneaux\" /><ref name=\"Foot\" /><ref name=\"Neale\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n* [[List of rivers of England]]\n* [[HMS Tamar]], a vessel named after the river\n* [[Tamar Site]], an area in Hong Kong named after the ship, which was named after the river\n* [[RM Tamar]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Booker|first=Frank|title=Industrial Archaeology of The Tamar Valley|edition=2|year=1971|publisher=David and Charles|location=Newton Abbot, England|isbn=0-7153-5172-9}}\n* Carrington, N.

Indeed, the [[maximum a posteriori estimate]] is the parameter {{mvar|\u03b8}} that maximizes the probability of {{mvar|\u03b8}} given the data, given by Bayes' theorem:\n\n: <math>\n    \\operatorname{P}(\\theta\\mid x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n) = \\frac{f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\mid\\theta)\\operatorname{P}(\\theta)}{\\operatorname{P}(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)}\n  </math>\n\nwhere <math>P(\\theta)</math> is the prior distribution for the parameter {{mvar|\u03b8}} and where <math>\\operatorname{P}(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)</math> is the probability of the data averaged over all parameters. Since the denominator is independent of {{mvar|\u03b8}}, the Bayesian estimator is obtained by maximizing <math>f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\mid\\theta)\\operatorname{P}(\\theta)</math> with respect to {{mvar|\u03b8}}. If we further assume that the prior <math>P(\\theta)</math> is a uniform distribution, the Bayesian estimator is obtained by maximizing the likelihood function <math>f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\mid\\theta)</math>. Thus the Bayesian estimator coincides with the maximum likelihood estimator for a uniform prior distribution <math>\\operatorname{P}(\\theta)</math>.\n\n==== Application of maximum-likelihood estimation in Bayes decision theory ====\nIn many practical applications in machine learning, maximum-likelihood estimation is used as the model for parameter estimation.\n\nThe [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~hic/CS7616/pdf/lecture2.pdf Bayesian Decision theory] is about designing a classifier that minimizes total expected risk, especially, when the costs ( i.e., loss function) associated with different decisions are equal, the classifier is minimizing the error over the whole distribution. \n\nThus, the Bayes Decision Rule is stated as \"decide <math>w_1</math>if <math>P(w_1|x)>P(w_2|x)</math>; otherwise <math>w_2\n</math>\", where <math>w_1</math>, <math>w_2\n</math> are predictions of different classes.

If ''n'' is unknown, then the maximum likelihood estimator <math>\\widehat{n}</math> of ''n'' is the number ''m'' on the drawn ticket. (The likelihood is 0 for ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m'', {{frac|1|''n''}} for ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''m'', and this is greatest when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate of ''n'' occurs at the lower extreme of possible values {''m'',&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...}, rather than somewhere in the \"middle\" of the range of possible values, which would result in less bias.) The [[expected value]] of the number ''m'' on the drawn ticket, and therefore the expected value of <math>\\widehat{n}</math>, is (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2. As a result, with a sample size of 1, the maximum likelihood estimator for ''n'' will systematically underestimate ''n'' by (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)/2.\n\n=== Discrete distribution, finite parameter space ===\nSuppose one wishes to determine just how biased an [[unfair coin]] is.  Call the probability of tossing a \u2018[[Obverse and reverse|head]]\u2019 ''p''. The goal then becomes to determine ''p''.\n\nSuppose the coin is tossed 80 times: i.e. the sample might be something like ''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;H, ''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T, ..., ''x''<sub>80</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T, and the count of the number of [[Obverse and reverse|heads]] \"H\" is observed.\n\nThe probability of tossing [[Obverse and reverse|tails]] is 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'' (so here ''p'' is ''\u03b8'' above). Suppose the outcome is 49&nbsp;heads and 31&nbsp;[[Obverse and reverse|tails]], and suppose the coin was taken from a box containing three coins: one which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}, one which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} and another which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|2|3}}. The coins have lost their labels, so which one it was is unknown. Using maximum likelihood estimation, the coin that has the largest likelihood can be found, given the data that were observed. By using the [[probability mass function]] of the [[binomial distribution]] with sample size equal to 80, number successes equal to 49 but for different values of ''p'' (the \"probability of success\"), the likelihood function (defined below) takes one of three values:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{1}{3}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{1}{3})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{1}{3})^{31} \\approx 0.000, \\\\[6pt]\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{1}{2})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{31} \\approx 0.012, \\\\[6pt]\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{2}{3}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{2}{3})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{2}{3})^{31} \\approx 0.054.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe likelihood is maximized when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|2|3}}, and so this is the ''maximum likelihood estimate'' for&nbsp;''p''.\n\n=== Discrete distribution, continuous parameter space ===\nNow suppose that there was only one coin but its ''p'' could have been any value 0 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 1. The likelihood function to be maximised is\n:<math>\nL(p) = f_D(\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p) = \\binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1 - p)^{31},\n</math>\n\nand the maximisation is over all possible values 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1.\n\n[[File:MLfunctionbinomial-en.svg|thumb|200px|likelihood function for proportion value of a binomial process (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10)]]\n\nOne way to maximize this function is by [[derivative|differentiating]] with respect to ''p'' and setting to zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1-p)^{31} \\right), \\\\[8pt]\n0 & = 49 p^{48}(1-p)^{31} - 31 p^{49}(1-p)^{30} \\\\[8pt]\n  & = p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\\left[ 49 (1-p) - 31 p \\right]  \\\\[8pt]\n  & = p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\\left[ 49 - 80 p \\right].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis is a product of three terms.  The first term is 0 when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.  The second is 0 when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  The third is zero when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|49|80}}. The solution that maximizes the likelihood is clearly ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|49|80}} (since ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 result in a likelihood of 0). Thus the ''maximum likelihood estimator'' for ''p'' is {{frac|49|80}}.\n\nThis result is easily generalized by substituting a letter such as ''s'' in the place of 49 to represent the observed number of 'successes' of our [[Bernoulli trial]]s, and a letter such as ''n'' in the place of 80 to represent the number of Bernoulli trials. Exactly the same calculation yields {{frac|''s''|''n''}} which is the maximum likelihood estimator for any sequence of ''n'' Bernoulli trials resulting in ''s'' 'successes'.\n\n=== Continuous distribution, continuous parameter space ===\nFor the [[normal distribution]] <math>\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)</math> which has [[probability density function]]\n\n:<math>f(x\\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\ }\n                               \\exp\\left(-\\frac {(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right), </math>\n\nthe corresponding [[probability density function]] for a sample of {{mvar|n}} [[independent identically distributed]] normal random variables (the likelihood) is\n\n:<math>f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f( x_i\\mid  \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\right)^{n/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).</math>\n\nThis family of distributions has two parameters: {{math|''\u03b8''&nbsp;{{=}} (''\u03bc'',&nbsp;''\u03c3'')}}; so we maximize the likelihood, <math>\\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma) = f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)</math>, over both parameters simultaneously, or if possible, individually.\n\nSince the [[natural logarithm|logarithm]] function itself is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[strictly increasing]] function over the [[range (statistics)|range]] of the likelihood, the values which maximize the likelihood will also maximize its logarithm (the log-likelihood itself is not necessarily strictly increasing). The log-likelihood can be written as follows:\n\n:<math>\n   \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) = -\\frac{\\,n\\,}{2} \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\n   - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\,x_i-\\mu\\,)^2\n</math>\n\n(Note: the log-likelihood is closely related to [[information entropy]] and [[Fisher information]].)\n\nWe now compute the derivatives of this log-likelihood as follows.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) =\n 0 - \\frac{\\;-2\\!n(\\bar{x}-\\mu)\\;}{2\\sigma^2}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\bar{x} </math> is the [[sample mean]]. This is solved by\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\mu = \\bar{x} = \\sum^n_{i=1} \\frac{\\,x_i\\,}{n}. </math>\n\nThis is indeed the maximum of the function, since it is the only turning point in {{mvar|\u03bc}} and the second derivative is strictly less than zero. Its [[expected value]] is equal to the parameter {{mvar|\u03bc}} of the given distribution,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\widehat\\mu\\;\\big] = \\mu, \\, </math>\n\nwhich means that the maximum likelihood estimator <math>\\widehat\\mu</math> is unbiased.\n\nSimilarly we differentiate the log-likelihood with respect to {{mvar|\u03c3}} and equate to zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\sigma} \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) = -\\frac{\\,n\\,}{\\sigma} \n   + \\frac{1}{\\sigma^3} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\,x_i-\\mu\\,)^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich is solved by\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2.</math>\n\nInserting the estimate <math>\\mu = \\widehat\\mu</math> we obtain\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 -\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n x_i x_j.</math>\n\nTo calculate its expected value, it is convenient to rewrite the expression in terms of zero-mean random variables ([[statistical error]])  <math>\\delta_i \\equiv \\mu - x_i</math>. Expressing the estimate in these variables yields\n\n: <math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\mu - \\delta_i)^2 -\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n (\\mu - \\delta_i)(\\mu - \\delta_j).</math>\n\nSimplifying the expression above, utilizing the facts that <math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\delta_i\\;\\big] = 0 </math> and <math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\delta_i^2\\;\\big] = \\sigma^2 </math>, allows us to obtain\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\widehat\\sigma^2\\;\\big]= \\frac{\\,n-1\\,}{n}\\sigma^2.</math>\n\nThis means that the estimator <math>\\widehat\\sigma</math> is biased. However, <math>\\widehat\\sigma</math> is consistent.\n\nFormally we say that the ''maximum likelihood estimator'' for <math>\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)</math> is\n\n:<math>\\widehat{\\theta\\,} = \\left(\\widehat{\\mu},\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\right).</math>\n\nIn this case the MLEs could be obtained individually.  In general this may not be the case, and the MLEs would have to be obtained simultaneously.\n\nThe normal log-likelihood at its maximum takes a particularly simple form:\n\n:<math>\n   \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L}(\\widehat\\mu,\\widehat\\sigma)\\Big) = \\frac{\\,-n\\;\\;}{2} \\big(\\,\\log(2\\pi\\widehat\\sigma^2) +1\\,\\big)\n</math>\n\nThis maximum log-likelihood can be shown to be the same for more general [[least squares]], even for [[non-linear least squares]].  This is often used in determining likelihood-based approximate [[confidence interval]]s and [[confidence region]]s, which are generally more accurate than those using the asymptotic normality discussed above.\n\n== Non-independent variables ==\nIt may be the case that variables are correlated, that is, not independent. Two random variables <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> are independent only if their joint probability density function is the product of the individual probability density functions, i.e.\n\n:<math>f(y_1,y_2)=f(y_1)f(y_2)\\,</math>\n\nSuppose one constructs an order-''n'' Gaussian vector out of random variables <math>(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</math>, where each variable has means given by <math>(\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_n)</math>. Furthermore, let the [[covariance matrix]] be denoted by <math>\\mathit\\Sigma</math>.

From a perspective of minimizing error, it can also be stated as  <math>w=\\arg\\min_{w}\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty P(\\text{error}\\mid x)P(x)\\,dx</math>, where <math>P(\\text{error}\\mid x)=P(w_1\\mid x)</math> if we decide <math>w_2</math> and <math>P(\\text{error}\\mid x)=P(w_2|x)</math> if we decide <math>w_1</math>.\n\nBy applying [[Bayes' theorem]] : <math>P(w_i\\mid x) = \\frac{P(x\\mid w_i) P(w_i)}{P(x)}</math>, and if we further assume the zero/one loss function, which is a same loss for all errors, the Bayes Decision rule can be reformulated as:\n\n<math>h_\\text{Bayes} = \\arg\\max_w P(x\\mid w)P(w) </math>, where <math>h_\\text{Bayes}</math> is the prediction and <math>P(w)</math> is the [[Prior probability|priori probability]].\n\n===Relation to minimizing Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence and cross entropy===\n\nFinding <math>\\hat \\theta</math> that maximizes the likelihood is asymptotically equivalent to finding the <math>\\hat \\theta</math> that defines a probability distribution (<math>Q_{\\hat \\theta}</math>) that has a minimal distance, in terms of  [[Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence]], to the real probability distribution from which our data was generated (i.e., generated by <math>P_{\\theta_0}</math>) <ref>cmplx96 (https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/177679/cmplx96), Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence, URL (version: 2017-11-18): https://stats.stackexchange.com/q/314472 (at the youtube video, look at minutes 13 to 25)</ref>.

If ''n'' is unknown, then the maximum likelihood estimator <math>\\widehat{n}</math> of ''n'' is the number ''m'' on the drawn ticket. (The likelihood is 0 for ''n''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m'', {{frac|1|''n''}} for ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;''m'', and this is greatest when ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''m''. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate of ''n'' occurs at the lower extreme of possible values {''m'',&nbsp;''m''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1,&nbsp;...}, rather than somewhere in the \"middle\" of the range of possible values, which would result in less bias.) The [[expected value]] of the number ''m'' on the drawn ticket, and therefore the expected value of <math>\\widehat{n}</math>, is (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)/2. As a result, with a sample size of 1, the maximum likelihood estimator for ''n'' will systematically underestimate ''n'' by (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)/2.\n\n=== Discrete distribution, finite parameter space ===\nSuppose one wishes to determine just how biased an [[unfair coin]] is.  Call the probability of tossing a \u2018[[Obverse and reverse|head]]\u2019 ''p''. The goal then becomes to determine ''p''.\n\nSuppose the coin is tossed 80 times: i.e. the sample might be something like ''x''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;H, ''x''<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T, ..., ''x''<sub>80</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;T, and the count of the number of [[Obverse and reverse|heads]] \"H\" is observed.\n\nThe probability of tossing [[Obverse and reverse|tails]] is 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'' (so here ''p'' is ''\u03b8'' above). Suppose the outcome is 49&nbsp;heads and 31&nbsp;[[Obverse and reverse|tails]], and suppose the coin was taken from a box containing three coins: one which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|1|3}}, one which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|1|2}} and another which gives heads with probability ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|2|3}}. The coins have lost their labels, so which one it was is unknown. Using maximum likelihood estimation, the coin that has the largest likelihood can be found, given the data that were observed. By using the [[probability mass function]] of the [[binomial distribution]] with sample size equal to 80, number successes equal to 49 but for different values of ''p'' (the \"probability of success\"), the likelihood function (defined below) takes one of three values:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{1}{3}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{1}{3})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{1}{3})^{31} \\approx 0.000, \\\\[6pt]\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{1}{2}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{1}{2})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{1}{2})^{31} \\approx 0.012, \\\\[6pt]\n\\operatorname{P}\\big[\\;\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p=\\tfrac{2}{3}\\;\\big] & = \\binom{80}{49}(\\tfrac{2}{3})^{49}(1-\\tfrac{2}{3})^{31} \\approx 0.054.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe likelihood is maximized when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|2|3}}, and so this is the ''maximum likelihood estimate'' for&nbsp;''p''.\n\n=== Discrete distribution, continuous parameter space ===\nNow suppose that there was only one coin but its ''p'' could have been any value 0 \u2264 ''p'' \u2264 1. The likelihood function to be maximised is\n:<math>\nL(p) = f_D(\\mathrm{H} = 49 \\mid p) = \\binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1 - p)^{31},\n</math>\n\nand the maximisation is over all possible values 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''p''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1.\n\n[[File:MLfunctionbinomial-en.svg|thumb|200px|likelihood function for proportion value of a binomial process (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10)]]\n\nOne way to maximize this function is by [[derivative|differentiating]] with respect to ''p'' and setting to zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p} \\left( \\binom{80}{49} p^{49}(1-p)^{31} \\right), \\\\[8pt]\n0 & = 49 p^{48}(1-p)^{31} - 31 p^{49}(1-p)^{30} \\\\[8pt]\n  & = p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\\left[ 49 (1-p) - 31 p \\right]  \\\\[8pt]\n  & = p^{48}(1-p)^{30}\\left[ 49 - 80 p \\right].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThis is a product of three terms.  The first term is 0 when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.  The second is 0 when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.  The third is zero when ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|49|80}}. The solution that maximizes the likelihood is clearly ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{frac|49|80}} (since ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 result in a likelihood of 0). Thus the ''maximum likelihood estimator'' for ''p'' is {{frac|49|80}}.\n\nThis result is easily generalized by substituting a letter such as ''s'' in the place of 49 to represent the observed number of 'successes' of our [[Bernoulli trial]]s, and a letter such as ''n'' in the place of 80 to represent the number of Bernoulli trials. Exactly the same calculation yields {{frac|''s''|''n''}} which is the maximum likelihood estimator for any sequence of ''n'' Bernoulli trials resulting in ''s'' 'successes'.\n\n=== Continuous distribution, continuous parameter space ===\nFor the [[normal distribution]] <math>\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)</math> which has [[probability density function]]\n\n:<math>f(x\\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\ }\n                               \\exp\\left(-\\frac {(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right), </math>\n\nthe corresponding [[probability density function]] for a sample of {{mvar|n}} [[independent identically distributed]] normal random variables (the likelihood) is\n\n:<math>f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\mid \\mu,\\sigma^2) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f( x_i\\mid  \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\right)^{n/2} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right).</math>\n\nThis family of distributions has two parameters: {{math|''\u03b8''&nbsp;{{=}} (''\u03bc'',&nbsp;''\u03c3'')}}; so we maximize the likelihood, <math>\\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma) = f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\mid \\mu, \\sigma)</math>, over both parameters simultaneously, or if possible, individually.\n\nSince the [[natural logarithm|logarithm]] function itself is a [[continuous function|continuous]] [[strictly increasing]] function over the [[range (mathematics)|range]] of the likelihood, the values which maximize the likelihood will also maximize its logarithm (the log-likelihood itself is not necessarily strictly increasing). The log-likelihood can be written as follows:\n\n:<math>\n   \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) = -\\frac{\\,n\\,}{2} \\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2)\n   - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\,x_i-\\mu\\,)^2\n</math>\n\n(Note: the log-likelihood is closely related to [[information entropy]] and [[Fisher information]].)\n\nWe now compute the derivatives of this log-likelihood as follows.\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mu} \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) =\n 0 - \\frac{\\;-2\\!n(\\bar{x}-\\mu)\\;}{2\\sigma^2}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nwhere <math> \\bar{x} </math> is the [[sample mean]]. This is solved by\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\mu = \\bar{x} = \\sum^n_{i=1} \\frac{\\,x_i\\,}{n}. </math>\n\nThis is indeed the maximum of the function, since it is the only turning point in {{mvar|\u03bc}} and the second derivative is strictly less than zero. Its [[expected value]] is equal to the parameter {{mvar|\u03bc}} of the given distribution,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\widehat\\mu\\;\\big] = \\mu, \\, </math>\n\nwhich means that the maximum likelihood estimator <math>\\widehat\\mu</math> is unbiased.\n\nSimilarly we differentiate the log-likelihood with respect to {{mvar|\u03c3}} and equate to zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n0 & = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\sigma} \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L} (\\mu,\\sigma)\\Big) = -\\frac{\\,n\\,}{\\sigma} \n   + \\frac{1}{\\sigma^3} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\,x_i-\\mu\\,)^2.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhich is solved by\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\\mu)^2.</math>\n\nInserting the estimate <math>\\mu = \\widehat\\mu</math> we obtain\n\n:<math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 -\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n x_i x_j.</math>\n\nTo calculate its expected value, it is convenient to rewrite the expression in terms of zero-mean random variables ([[statistical error]])  <math>\\delta_i \\equiv \\mu - x_i</math>. Expressing the estimate in these variables yields\n\n: <math>\\widehat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (\\mu - \\delta_i)^2 -\\frac{1}{n^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n (\\mu - \\delta_i)(\\mu - \\delta_j).</math>\n\nSimplifying the expression above, utilizing the facts that <math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\delta_i\\;\\big] = 0 </math> and <math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\delta_i^2\\;\\big] = \\sigma^2 </math>, allows us to obtain\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}\\big[\\;\\widehat\\sigma^2\\;\\big]= \\frac{\\,n-1\\,}{n}\\sigma^2.</math>\n\nThis means that the estimator <math>\\widehat\\sigma</math> is biased. However, <math>\\widehat\\sigma</math> is consistent.\n\nFormally we say that the ''maximum likelihood estimator'' for <math>\\theta=(\\mu,\\sigma^2)</math> is\n\n:<math>\\widehat{\\theta\\,} = \\left(\\widehat{\\mu},\\widehat{\\sigma}^2\\right).</math>\n\nIn this case the MLEs could be obtained individually.  In general this may not be the case, and the MLEs would have to be obtained simultaneously.\n\nThe normal log-likelihood at its maximum takes a particularly simple form:\n\n:<math>\n   \\log\\Big( \\mathcal{L}(\\widehat\\mu,\\widehat\\sigma)\\Big) = \\frac{\\,-n\\;\\;}{2} \\big(\\,\\log(2\\pi\\widehat\\sigma^2) +1\\,\\big)\n</math>\n\nThis maximum log-likelihood can be shown to be the same for more general [[least squares]], even for [[non-linear least squares]].  This is often used in determining likelihood-based approximate [[confidence interval]]s and [[confidence region]]s, which are generally more accurate than those using the asymptotic normality discussed above.\n\n== Non-independent variables ==\nIt may be the case that variables are correlated, that is, not independent. Two random variables <math>y_1</math> and <math>y_2</math> are independent only if their joint probability density function is the product of the individual probability density functions, i.e.\n\n:<math>f(y_1,y_2)=f(y_1)f(y_2)\\,</math>\n\nSuppose one constructs an order-''n'' Gaussian vector out of random variables <math>(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)</math>, where each variable has means given by <math>(\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_n)</math>. Furthermore, let the [[covariance matrix]] be denoted by <math>\\mathit\\Sigma</math>. The joint probability density function of these ''n'' random variables is then follows a [[multivariate normal distribution]] given by:\n\n:<math>f(y_1,\\ldots,y_n)=\\frac{1}{(2\\pi)^{n/2}\\sqrt{\\det(\\mathit\\Sigma)}} \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[y_1-\\mu_1,\\ldots,y_n-\\mu_n\\right]\\mathit\\Sigma^{-1}     \\left[y_1-\\mu_1,\\ldots,y_n-\\mu_n\\right]^\\mathrm{T} \\right)</math>\n\nIn the [[Bivariate analysis|bivariate]] case, the joint probability density function is given by:\n\n:<math> f(y_1,y_2) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma_{1} \\sigma_2 \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}} \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{1}{2(1-\\rho^2)} \\left(\\frac{(y_1-\\mu_1)^2}{\\sigma_1^2} - \\frac{2\\rho(y_1-\\mu_1)(y_2-\\mu_2)}{\\sigma_1\\sigma_2} + \\frac{(y_2-\\mu_2)^2}{\\sigma_2^2}\\right) \\right] </math>\n\nIn this and other cases where a joint density function exists, the likelihood function is defined as above, in the section \"[[Maximum likelihood#Principles|principles]],\" using this density.\n\n=== Example ===\n<math>X_1,\\ X_2,\\ldots,\\ X_m</math> are counts in cells / boxes 1 up to m; each box has a different probability (think of the boxes being bigger or smaller) and we fix the number of balls that fall to be <math>n</math>:<math>x_1+x_2+\\cdots+x_m=n</math>. The probability of each box is <math>p_i</math>, with a constraint: <math>p_1+p_2+\\cdots+p_m=1</math>. This is a case in which the <math>X_i</math> ''s'' are not independent, the joint probability of a vector <math>x_1,\\ x_2,\\ldots,x_m</math> is called the multinomial and has the form:\n\n: <math>f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m\\mid p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m)=\\frac{n!}{\\Pi x_i!}\\Pi p_i^{x_i}= \\binom{n}{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_m} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2} \\cdots p_m^{x_m}</math>\n\nEach box taken separately against all the other boxes is a binomial and this is an extension thereof.\n\nThe log-likelihood of this is: \n\n: <math>\\ell(p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m)=\\log n!-\\sum_{i=1}^m \\log x_i!+\\sum_{i=1}^m x_i\\log p_i</math>\n\nThe constraint has to be taken into account and use the Lagrange multipliers:\n\n: <math>L(p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m,\\lambda)=\\ell(p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_m)+\\lambda\\left(1-\\sum_{i=1}^m p_i\\right)</math>\n\nBy posing all the derivatives to be 0, the most natural estimate is derived\n\n: <math>\\hat{p}_i=\\frac{x_i}{n}</math>\n\nMaximizing log likelihood, with and without constraints, can be an unsolvable problem in closed form, then we have to use iterative procedures.\n\n== Iterative procedures ==\nExcept for special cases, the likelihood equations\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\ell(\\theta;\\mathbf{y})}{\\partial \\theta} = 0</math>\ncannot be solved explicitly for an estimator <math>\\widehat{\\theta} = \\widehat{\\theta}(\\mathbf{y})</math>.

A traditional scuttle resembles a [[teapot]] with a wide spout where hot water is poured in; this is where it differs from a shaving mug, which has no spout. Both shaving scuttles and mugs usually have a handle, but some have none. Shaving mugs often look like a standard mug, however, some also have a built in brush rest, so the brush does not sit in lather.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

Carving had been traditionally applied to mugs in the ancient times. Deforming a mug into an unusual shape is sometimes used. However, the most popular decoration technique nowadays is printing on mugs, which is usually performed as follows: Ceramic powder is mixed with dyes of chosen color and a plasticizer. Then it is printed on a gelatin-coated paper using a traditional [[screen-printing]] technique, which applies the mixture through a fine woven mesh, which is stretched on a frame and has a mask of desired shape. This technique produces a thin homogeneous coating; however, if smoothness is not required, the ceramic mixture is painted directly with a brush. Another, more complex alternative is to coat the paper with a photographic emulsion, photoprint the image and then cure the emulsion with ultraviolet light.<ref name=print>{{cite web|title=Printing Ceramics|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|publisher=Ceramics Today|access-date=2009-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601072522/http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/090798.htm|archive-date=2009-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAfter drying, the printed paper, called a [[transfer-print|litho]], can be stored indefinitely. When a litho is applied to the mug, it is first softened in warm water. This detaches the gelatin cover, with the printed image, from the paper; this cover is then transferred to the mug. The mug is then fired around 700\u2013750&nbsp;\u00b0C, which softens the top surface of the glaze, thereby embedding the image into it.<ref name=print/>\n\n==Storage==\n[[File:Mugs hanging in a ship's mess 01A.jpg|thumb|Mug rack on a ship]]\n[[File:Mugtree1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mug tree]]\nA popular way to store mugs is on a 'mug tree', a wooden or metal pole mounted on a round base and fitted with pegs to hang mugs by their handles.<ref>Jane Ancona, Bruce Ancona \"Mug tree\" {{US patent|D312556}} Issue date: December 4, 1990</ref> There are also racks designed for hanging mugs so that they are ready to hand.

Two objects are homeomorphic if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or gluing. Thus in topology, a mug is equivalent (homeomorphic) to a doughnut ([[torus]]) as it can be reshaped into a doughnut by a continuous deformation, without cutting, breaking, punching holes or gluing.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S3biKR21i-QC&pg=PA51|page=51|title=Principles of robot motion: theory, algorithms, and implementation|author=Howie M.
