Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate no. 714, Bernard Coy Inmate no. 415, Sam Shockley Inmate no. 462, Miran Thompson Inmate no. 729, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate no. 548 and Marvin Hubbard Inmate no. 645. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic, she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. On June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce on June 1939. Sam Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Sam Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz on September 23, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Sam Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night, he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz,  Sam Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Sam Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941, there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Sam Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Lloyd Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that  Shockley was not involved in the plot. Sam Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nBernie Coy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Rufus Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Sam Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate #561, testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Sam Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Sam Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Rufus Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Joseph Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also, a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also, a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr. Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity. Dr. Alden had only an hour to examine Sam Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Sam Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men. Both had been confined for lengthy periods of time in isolation and had long records of minor misbehaviors for which they suffered harsh punishments. Both men had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which they were on trial. [[Frank J. Hennessy|Frank Hennessy]], the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a second Henri Young trial, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the Administration investigated by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal authorities]].\n\nSam Shockley, along with [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Clarence Carnes]], was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial December 21st 1946, before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco.

Two prison guards died. Bill Miller was shot by Joe Cretzer, and Harold Stites was mistakenly shot by the officers on the hill outside who were firing into the D block.  Three inmates, Bernie Coy, Joe Cretzer and Marv Hubbard, were all killed  by countless rounds of rifle fire, grenades, tear gas and deck gun shells of the Coast Guard, US Marine Corps,  Prison and  Police Department. It was assumed that the inmates had obtain automatic rifles and the uprising was organized by six inmates :  Clarence Carnes Inmate no. 714, Bernard Coy Inmate no. 415, Sam Shockley Inmate no. 462, Miran Thompson Inmate no. 729, Joseph Paul Cretzer Inmate no. 548 and Marvin Hubbard Inmate no. 645. Mainly by the bias of the sensation-loving press and media, they were already labeled killers.\n\n==Background==\nSam Shockley was the son of Richard \"Dick\" Shockley, and Annyer Eugenia Bearden, who died when Samuel was 7 years old.  He was born in Cerrogordo Caney Township, Little River County, Arkansas. His father was a sharecropper with eight children. By his first wife Norma Louise Bearden: Bryant Lunsford in 1889, and by Annyer Eugenia Bearden, his second wife: Myrtle Lee in 1900, Frank in 1901, Anna Belle in 1904, Patrick in 1907, Samuel Richard in 1909, and Ruth in 1913, Richard Samuel born in 1918 by his third wife, Sally Barton, who died of malaria fever in 1920. As a newborn baby, Sam survived an accident when his 9-year-old sister, Myrtle, looked after the children during the day, while their parents worked the land. The girl had Sam on her arm when she came too close to the fireplace and her dress caught fire. In panic, she ran out of the house, still holding Sam. There she threw Sam away and collapsed. Both children were lying outside for six hours, covered in burns.  Baby Sam had taken a hard blow from the fall.  Samuel Shockley was taken out of school by his father when he was twelve years old and strong enough to work  the fields. His formal education ended at the third grade, and by the age of thirteen he exhibited signs of serious instability. Sam started running away from home after the death of his stepmother. His father died in 1932. Sam left the family in 1927 and became a transient. Soon after he hit the road he was arrested for stealing chickens, automobile tires and accessories in [[Garvin County, Oklahoma|Garvin County]] and was sent for one year to the [[Oklahoma State Reformatory]] at [[Granite, Oklahoma]]. \n\nWhile in prison Sam Shockley was beaten by a fellow inmate, suffering brain damage and numerous scars on his head and neck. He was released in July 1929, but he sustained a second beating by a police officer, which inflicted further head trauma. On June, 1936, Shockley married Betty Moore (born 1923 in Shoshone Idaho), but the marriage only lasted 1.5 years. They divorce on June 1939. Sam Shockley and Edward Johnson were arrested in March 1938 for robbing a man of his car, bank robbery and kidnapping Mr and Mrs D.F. Pendley, both employees of the bank of [[Paoli, Oklahoma]], and sentenced to life imprisonment at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]] on May 16, 1938. Examined by prison psychiatrists at Leavenworth, it was determined that Sam Shockley had a low [[IQ]] of 68 and the mental age of a 10-year 10-month-old child.  He suffered episodes of hallucinations and demonstrated serious emotional instability. He was incapable of coping with the normal prison environment, presenting a risk to himself and others. Rather than confine the obviously mentally deranged prisoner in the [[United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners|Medical Center for Federal Prisoners]] at [[Springfield, Missouri]], the administration of Leavenworth sent him to Alcatraz on September 23, 1938.\n\nWhen he was transferred to Alcatraz from Leavenworth, it was felt the strict routine there would better manage him. Throughout the early 1940s at Alcatraz, Sam Shockley's condition continued to deteriorate because he was placed for 3 years in the D block isolation section, and for most of the time in the Hole or Dungeon, the darkened stripped cells on the ground level. Here he spent most of his time in darkness.  At night, he was only allowed a blanket and a mattress, during the rest of the day he was sitting and lying on the cold concrete. He displayed classic schizophrenic symptoms: delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorientation. At Alcatraz,  Sam Shockley's mental condition worsened. His IQ dropped to 54, indicating a mental age of an eight-year-old child.  In 1942 the Alcatraz prison physician described Sam Shockley as emotionally very unstable with episodes of hallucinations. On 21 May 1941, there was an attempted escape from one of the island's workshops involving [[Joseph Paul Cretzer|Joe Cretzer]], Arnold \"Shorty\" Kyle, Lloyd Barkdoll (an Oregon bankrobber), and Sam Shockley. During the escape attempt from the mat shop, the men held a number of guards hostage. The convicts began sawing through the bars from the inside. After an hour, the convicts were unable to cut through the steel bars. The convicts surrendered after Captain [[Paul J. Madigan|Paul Madigan]], captain of the guard, arrived in the mat shop and the hostages were released unharmed. Lloyd Barkdoll managed to speak with Warden [[James A. Johnston|James Johnston]] and convinced him that  Shockley was not involved in the plot. Sam Shockley was released and sent back to his cell.\n\nOn May 2, 1946, during the escape the inmates [[Bernard Coy]], [[Joseph Cretzer]], and Marvin Hubbard took custodial guard Cecil Corwin by surprise. They opened the D isolation cell block door to free Rufus Whitey Franklin, who was still confined to the isolation cell and for all Coy knew, still in the darkened solitary cell behind two sets of doors; the outer door was made of solid steel and the inner door was electronically operated and barred.\n\nBernie Coy had planned to take control of the cell house and D block so that Rufus Franklin could be released once the escape was underway. Although it appeared to the inmates that they had all the cell house keys, none of them fit the lock in the rear door of the cell house which led to the recreation yard. It was through this door that the convicts intended to leave the cell house. The key 107 opened the rear door to the recreation yard but custodial guard Joseph Burdett hid this key under the wall seat of cell 404. The escape attempt failed due to the jamming of the recreation yard door lock, because if the wrong key was used and tried several times the system would block completely. All this turned into an armed confrontation which lasted 48 hours. Two custodial guards, Bill Miller and Harold Stites, and three inmates, Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard, were killed. Three guards were critically injured and 10 more guards sustained lesser injuries.\n\nLawyer William A. Sullivan, who was appointed by Judge [[Louis Earl Goodman|Louis Goodman]] to defend Sam Shockley in the Alcatraz Trial, elicited from Carl W. Sundstrom, custodial guard, that at no time did he ever see a weapon in Shockley's hands. Shockley did attack Sundstrom, but Sundstrom never was injured by him. Sundstrom also stated that Sam Shockley was running around and acting like a crazy man. Other inmates such as Jack Pepper, James Quillen, Howard Butler, Edwin Sharp and Louis Fleish made statements that Sam Shockley was running up and down the corridors carrying a wrench and wearing an officer's jacket several sizes too large for him. He looked like a clown, which amused the onlookers. He repeatedly swore at the hostages. Also the men all established that Shockley was in the D block when the shooting began that injured the guards taken hostage, and later killed guard W.H. Miller.\n\nJoseph Moyle, inmate #561, testified that Sam Shockley did not say anything; he was just standing at the hostage cells, and he did not think Sam Shockley knew what was going on. He, and other inmates who testified in court, denied that they ever heard Sam Shockley urge Joseph Cretzer to shoot the guards.  Sam Shockley was not a part of the plan at all and merely tagged along because no one told him he could not. If Sam Shockley was to have been a key figure in helping Bernie Coy enter the gun gallery, he would not have risked being placed in a solitary cell by smashing and setting fire to his cell in the riot of March 1946. If there had been enough solitary cells available, Sam Shockley was, like Rufus Franklin, locked up in one of these solitary cells. The failure to release Rufus Franklin was a good indication that no one in D Block had been aware of the break prior to its occurrence.  Joseph Moyle agreed to testify as an important defense witness but Sullivan got a letter, handed to him by Warden Johnston, in which Moyle declared that he no longer wished to be summoned as a witness in the court case because it would not be in his interest. With this, Sullivan lost one of his best witnesses in the case.\n\nA motion for a separate trial for each of the defendants, on the ground that they could not get a fair trial if they were tried together because the acts of each defendant would be considered by the jury to be acts of all, was denied by the judge. Also, a transfer of the trial, on the ground that the widespread adverse publicity and press coverage would prevent the defendants from obtaining a fair trial, Judge Goodman denied. A request for two lawyers to assist Sam Shockley was rejected, though in a weighty court case, where the death penalty can be demanded, it is very common that the defendant may take two lawyers for defense. Also, a request for an independent psychiatrist doctor to testify that Shockley was mentally ill  or insane was refused. Dr. Alden, the court-appointed psychiatrist, was the only medical witness to testify regarding the issue of Shockley's sanity. Dr. Alden had only an hour to examine Sam Shockley.\n\nThe [[Henri Young]] trial in 1941 has a lot of parallels with Sam Shockley's trial. Both were non-aggressive and mentally handicapped men. Both had been confined for lengthy periods of time in isolation and had long records of minor misbehaviors for which they suffered harsh punishments. Both men had almost complete lack of recall of the events for which they were on trial. [[Frank J. Hennessy|Frank Hennessy]], the U.S. Attorney, and Judge Goodman feared a second Henri Young trial, in which the jury publicly attacked Warden Johnston's administration as cruel and inhumane, and demanded that Alcatraz be closed and the Administration investigated by [[United States Marshals Service|Federal authorities]].\n\nSam Shockley, along with [[Miran Edgar Thompson|Miran Thompson]] and [[Clarence Carnes]], was found guilty of murder in the first degree at their trial December 21st 1946, before the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Nineteen-year-old Clarence  \"Joe\" Carnes was spared the death penalty after some custodial officers who had been taken hostage testified that he had refrained from following instructions from Cretzer to kill them, but also due to the strong defense of his lawyer, Archer Zamloch. Although Sam Shockley's lawyer, W.A. Sullivan, pleaded insanity, Sam Shockley and Miran Thompson both received death sentences, to the great disbelief of their lawyers and even the prosecuting U.S. attorney, Hennessy. [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], a good friend of Warden Johnston, denied the bid for clemency. Sam Shockley accepted his fate and rejected any further efforts to stay the execution. They were executed simultaneously in the [[San Quentin]] [[gas chamber]] on December 3 th 1948. Sam Shockley is buried at Pollard cemetery, [[Haworth, Oklahoma|Haworth]], [[McCurtain County, Oklahoma]].\n\n==General references==\n.   Inside Alcatraz, my time on the rock - by Jim Quillen.

In 1920, Burabay has been nationalized and declared [[spa town]] of national importance. In 1935, the \u00ab National Nature Reserve of Burabay\u00bb has been organized. In 1951, the nature reserve was dissolved, and in place of it, the Burabay Forest has been established. The governmental motion N\u00b0 787 of May 6 of 1997 transformed the Forest of Burabay into the \u00ab Natural and Well-being Complex of the Forest of Burabay \u00bb, managed by the State. In 2000, the motion N\u00b01246 of August 12 created the \u00ab National nature park of Burabay \u00bb, which includes a superficy of 83 511 ha, of which 47 600 ha of forests. In 2010, the superficy of the park has been expanded to 129 935 ha. In 2012, 370 ha have been converted in spare lands.<ref>[http://parkburabay.kz/o_gnpp_byrabaj History of Burabay's status] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119082713/http://parkburabay.kz/o_gnpp_byrabaj |date=2015-11-19 }} on the official website.

There species from steppes, forests and mountains mix. Some Europe-wide species are found as well as Siberian, Southern and Northern ones.\n\nCurrently, Burabay's forests host a variety of [[deer]] including [[Siberian roe deer|roe deer]], [[moose]], [[wild boar]], [[Sciurus|squirrels]], [[stoat]]s, [[Least weasel|weasel]] and [[European pine marten|marten]]. Amongst the predators, [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] might be encountered. In the steppes and wooded areas, [[fox]] species, [[weasel]]s and [[European hare|European]] and [[mountain hare]]s might be met with, as well as [[European badger|badgers]] in the forests.\n\nThere are a variety of birds, particularly ducks and waders which include [[common goldeneye]], [[mallard]], [[gadwall]], [[northern pintail]], [[ruddy shelduck]]s, [[plovers]], [[northern lapwing]]s, [[common sandpiper]]s, [[green sandpiper]]s. Ducks numbers rise massively during Autumn and during migration periods.\n\nIn the dry stony pine forests, and along the forests, the birch wooden steppes, the [[grey partridge]] and the [[Western capercaillie|capercailie]] can be found.\n\n== Legend ==\nMany legends evoke Burabay.

In 1920, Burabay has been nationalized and declared [[spa town]] of national importance. In 1935, the \u00ab National Nature Reserve of Burabay\u00bb has been organized. In 1951, the nature reserve was dissolved, and in place of it, the Burabay Forest has been established. The governmental motion N\u00b0 787 of May 6 of 1997 transformed the Forest of Burabay into the \u00ab Natural and Well-being Complex of the Forest of Burabay \u00bb, managed by the State. In 2000, the motion N\u00b01246 of August 12 created the \u00ab National nature park of Burabay \u00bb, which includes a superficy of 83 511 ha, of which 47 600 ha of forests. In 2010, the superficy of the park has been expanded to 129 935 ha. In 2012, 370 ha have been converted in spare lands.<ref>[http://parkburabay.kz/o_gnpp_byrabaj History of Burabay's status] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119082713/http://parkburabay.kz/o_gnpp_byrabaj |date=2015-11-19 }} on the official website.

There species from steppes, forests and mountains mix. Some Europe-wide species are found as well as Siberian, Southern and Northern ones.\n\nCurrently, Burabay's forests host a variety of [[deer]] including [[Siberian roe deer|roe deer]], [[moose]], [[wild boar]], [[Sciurus|squirrels]], [[stoat]]s, [[Least weasel|weasel]] and [[European pine marten|marten]]. Amongst the predators, [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] might be encountered. In the steppes and wooded areas, [[fox]] species, [[weasel]]s and [[European hare|European]] and [[mountain hare]]s might be met with, as well as [[European badger|badgers]] in the forests.\n\nThere are a variety of birds, particularly ducks and waders which include [[common goldeneye]], [[mallard]], [[gadwall]], [[northern pintail]], [[ruddy shelduck]]s, [[plovers]], [[northern lapwing]]s, [[common sandpiper]]s, [[green sandpiper]]s. Ducks numbers rise massively during Autumn and during migration periods.\n\nIn the dry stony pine forests, and along the forests, the birch wooden steppes, the [[grey partridge]] and the [[Western capercaillie|capercailie]] can be found.\n\n== Legend ==\nMany legends evoke Burabay.

Bungonia National Park is also notable for its position in a chain of national parks that extend down the central NSW section of the [[Great Dividing Range]], including Morton National Park, [[Budawang National Park]], and [[Bimberamala National Park]].\n\n== History ==\nBungonia National Park sits across the traditional lands of the indigenous [[Ngunnawal|Njunawal]] tribal group, the northwest corner of the Wandandian tribal region, and the southern boundary of the [[Gandangara]] tribal group.<ref name=\":0\" /> The prominent ridge tops are considered historically significant travel routes for tribes who moved with the seasonal harvest. Archaeological evidence of campsites has been found on the main plateau, along with [[limestone]] [[Sinkhole|dolines]] that contain the remnants of edible plants consumed by Aboriginal peoples.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe first white visitors passed through the area in 1798, led by H. Hacking, the quartermaster of the ship ''Sirius.'' The establishment of European settlement in this region began around the 1820s, with Goulburn settled in the 1840s and the town of Bungonia set to be created in 1832. Governor of NSW George Gipps visited the park in 1838, walking to the lookout now known as Bungonia Lookdown.\n\nThe area now known as Bungonia National Park was initially established as a water reserve in 1872, to protect the water supply extracted from the Shoalhaven River. Also in 1872, a visit was reported to the Drum Cave and the Sky-Light Cave, named after the sound made when a stalactite was struck and the large hole in the roof, respectively. Multiple minor explorations of the park were made by Europeans throughout the late 1800s, to explore the many cave systems which were prominent features of the area.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Bungonia caves|date=1972|publisher=Sydney Speleological Society|others=Ellis, Ross A.,, Sydney Speleological Society.|isbn=978-0959960808|location=Sydney|oclc=1257627}}</ref>\n\nVisitor records for the park began in 1892 when 85 visitors were recorded. By 1899, this number had increased to 559, with exploration of the caves costing 15 pounds per party \"candlesticks provided\".<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nA larger portion of this region was later reserved in 1902 for the preservation of fragile limestone rock formations in the park, primarily caves. The original caretaker of the park, Louis Guymer who worked between 1889{{ndash}}1909, discovered and recorded the extensive caves throughout the park.<ref name=\":1\" /> Guymer built many of the gates and ladders which continue to allow access to cave networks and climbing routes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1970s, the area was involved in a series of disputes between the NSW state government, conservation groups, and several mining companies. Mining lease applications for large amounts of limestone quarrying in Bungonia Gorge were made by Southern Portland Cement and the [[Blue Circle Industries|Associated Portland Cement Manufacturers]], from 1972 until 1974. Pressure on the state government from the Bungonia Committee through a series of geological and environmental reports eventually led to the declaration of the [[Bungonia State Recreation Area|Bungonia State Conservation Area]] in July 1974.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Battle for the bush : the Blue Mountains, the Australian Alps and the origins of the wilderness movement|author=Mosley, J.

The caves and fissures of the park are common of the geologic action of [[karst]]ification, seen in limestone features.\n\nLimestone and sandstone are the two most prominent surface rock types in the park and make up most of the open formations. Part of the Bungonia Gorge and Bungonia slot canyon run through this park and such formations are characteristic of this type of sedimentary and volcanic activity which formed the original geology of the park. Soil in Bungonia is mostly shallow structured organic [[loam]]s which lie atop of the limestone and [[basalt]] plates which form the main plateau.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Black She-oak leaves (7157942476).jpg|thumb|Black She-oak is a prominent part of the vegetation in the park]]\nThe vegetation of Bungonia National Park is extensive and with most species occurring throughout the Southern Tablelands region. Bungonia is known to contain broad-leaved peppermint ([[Eucalyptus dives]]), white gum ([[Eucalyptus wandoo]]), grass trees ([[xanthorrhoea]]), red stringybark ([[Eucalyptus macrorhyncha]]), and large amounts of black ash ([[Eucalyptus sieberi]]) forest. Eucalyptus dominate the landscape, especially on the main plateau. In colder sections of the park, snow gum ([[Eucalyptus pauciflora]]), and snow grass ([[Poa sieberiana]]), thrive, particularly in winter.<ref name=\":2\" /> Like much of the southern portion of the Great Dividing Range, black she-oak ([[allocasuarina littoralis]]) is common to lower canopy and regeneration areas. There is also some restricted growth of the argyle apple ([[Eucalyptus cinerea]]), known for its soft blue foliage.\n\n=== Fauna ===\n[[File:Dasyurus maculatus.jpg|thumb|A small population of spotted-tail quolls inhabit the park]]\nFauna common in the park are found throughout the [[South Eastern Highlands]] with eighty-eight species inhabiting the area. Sixty-three of these species are vulnerable whilst twenty-five are endangered. Dozens of bird species are found in the park and many of the lookouts are bird-watching locations. Birds that frequent Bungonia National Park include the [[gang-gang cockatoo]], [[Butcherbird|butcher bird]], [[noisy miner]], [[glossy black cockatoo]], the [[swift parrot]], common [[cockatoo]], [[hooded robin]], [[Square-tailed kite|square tailed kite]], and the [[kookaburra]]. A general decline in the population of smaller woodland bird species has been recorded in the late 20th century along with an increase in the butcher-bird, noisy miner, and [[Common myna|common-myna]] population.  Other fauna in the park include the vulnerable large bent-wing bat which breeds in many of the caves in the cooler parts of the year. [[Monitor lizard]]s, [[echidna]]s, [[wombat]]s, [[Wallaby|wallabies]], and small populations of [[koala]]s and [[Tiger quoll|spotted-tail quolls]] also inhabit the park.\n\n== Climate and environmental issues ==\n[[File:Hooded Robin (27928733140).jpg|thumb|Hooded robins are a threatened species in the park due to habitat destruction]]\nThe average summer temperature in Bungonia National Park is between 12 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius with the highest recorded temperature being 40 degrees Celsius. Due to its increased altitude and inland southerly position, the park receives very cool winter temperatures. On average the temperature sits between 1 degree Celsius and 14 degrees Celsius with the lowest ever recorded temperature being -9 degrees Celsius.<ref name=\":0\" /> Average rainfall in the region is around 665{{nbsp}}mm with most [[precipitation]] occurring in March and the least in September.

Site remediation was due to follow the closure of the quarry in 2011, however in 2015 Boral Limited requested a 30-year extension on their lease. Their current activities involve filling in the southern end of the pit and re-vegetating their emplacements with native species whilst they continue to quarry the northern section.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boral.com.au/sites/default/files/media/field_document/Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=Boral in Marulan South|access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Park highlights ==\nCaving is a popular activity in the park with hundreds of caves open to explore throughout the year. Access to many of these caves is via ladders or by anchored ropes which allows their use by experienced and inexperienced cavers alike. Several of the larger caves include the Drum Cave and Grill Cave.  Other caves include the Blowfly Cave, Argyle Cave, Chalk Cave, College Cave, Canberra Hole, Fossil Cave, Spider and dozens of other unnamed caves.  Dangerous levels of CO2 are often present in these systems, especially in summer.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMarked hiking trails are maintained throughout the park with five main tracks. These five tracks are called the Yellow Track, Green Track, Red Track, White Track, and Orange Track.  An access road links many of these tracks to the main office and visitor centre. Adams Lookout, Jerrara Lookout and Bungonia Lookdown are all well positioned locations for viewing the gorges and valleys that surround the plateau.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sydney and beyond : a bushwalking guide to eighty-six walks across New South Wales|author=Mevissen, Andrew|date=1998|publisher=Macstyle media|isbn=978-1875293230|location=Sandringham, Vic.|oclc=221862482}}</ref> There are three picnic areas in the park and one camping area, all of which are managed by NPWS and are open for public access.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBungonia Slot Canyon provides many opportunities for [[bouldering]] and harnessed line [[climbing]] and offers some of the only limestone climbing available in Australia.\n\n== Incidents ==\nNumerous accidents have occurred in Bungonia National Park, partly due to its popularity with cavers and climbers, as well as its lack of marked tracks and dense bushland. Several fatalities and injuries have been recorded since 1991.\n\nThe death by falling of an outdoor education student in 1991 was investigated by homicide detectives who suspected that the victim had been threatened and later pushed by one of the other students.

Adams Lookout, Jerrara Lookout and Bungonia Lookdown are all well positioned locations for viewing the gorges and valleys that surround the plateau.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sydney and beyond : a bushwalking guide to eighty-six walks across New South Wales|author=Mevissen, Andrew|date=1998|publisher=Macstyle media|isbn=978-1875293230|location=Sandringham, Vic.|oclc=221862482}}</ref> There are three picnic areas in the park and one camping area, all of which are managed by NPWS and are open for public access.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBungonia Slot Canyon provides many opportunities for [[bouldering]] and harnessed line [[climbing]] and offers some of the only limestone climbing available in Australia.\n\n== Incidents ==\nNumerous accidents have occurred in Bungonia National Park, partly due to its popularity with cavers and climbers, as well as its lack of marked tracks and dense bushland. Several fatalities and injuries have been recorded since 1991.\n\nThe death by falling of an outdoor education student in 1991 was investigated by homicide detectives who suspected that the victim had been threatened and later pushed by one of the other students. No charges were ever laid however as the coroner could not identify what caused the fall.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brookes|first=Andrew|date=2011|title=Research update 2010: Outdoor education fatalities in Australia|journal=Australian Journal of Outdoor Education|volume=15|pages=35\u201355}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, emergency services were called on to rescue a man who had become trapped between rocks in Bungonia National Park.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Trapped for six hours|date=5 March 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nA 2005 incident involved the injury of a woman from [[Gladesville, New South Wales|Gladesville]] who became lost after an orienteering activity in the park.
