The main subject of the saga is a [[great white shark]], and its attacks on people in specific areas of the United States. The Brody family is featured in all of the films as the primary antithesis to the shark. The original film was based on a novel written by [[Peter Benchley]], which itself was inspired by the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]]. Benchley adapted his novel, along with help from Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, into the 1975 film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', which was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. Although Gottlieb went on to pen two of the three sequels, neither Benchley nor Spielberg returned to the film series in any capacity.\n\nThe first film was regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history; it became the father of the summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster movies]] and one of the first \"[[high-concept]]\" films.<ref>{{cite news | work=BBC News Online|title=Rise of the blockbuster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1653733.stm| accessdate=2006-08-20|date=2001-11-16}}</ref><ref name=\"wyatt76\">{{harvnb|Wyatt|1994|p=76}}</ref> The film is also known for the introduction of [[John Williams]]' famous theme music, which was a simple alternating pattern of the E and F notes of a piano. Williams' musical score won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The film won two other Academy Awards, and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nThe success of ''Jaws'' led to three sequels, and the four films together have earned nearly $800 million worldwide in box office gross. The franchise has also seen the release of various soundtrack albums, additional novelizations based on the sequels, [[trading card]]s, inspired [[Jaws (ride)|theme park rides]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Japan]], multiple video games, and a musical that premiered in 2004. Although the first film was popular with critics when it was originally released, critical reception went downhill with each sequel. This reception has spread to the merchandise, with video games seen as poor imitations of the original concept. Nevertheless, the original 1975 film has generally been regarded as [[Films considered the greatest ever|one of the greatest films ever]], and frequently appears in the top 100 of various [[American Film Institute]] rankings.\n\nHowever, Benchley later regretted he ever wrote the original book considering it encouraged a widespread public fear of sharks, which led to massive culls resulting in the various shark species around the world becoming endangered. As such, he spent most of his life promoting the cause of [[ocean conservation]].\n\n==Background==\nPeter Benchley had been thinking for years \"about a story about a shark that attacks people and what would happen if it came in and wouldn't go away.\"<ref name=\"laurent\">Benchley, Peter, \"A Look Inside ''Jaws''\", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] editor [[Tom Congdon]] was interested in Benchley's idea of a novel about a great white shark terrorizing a beach resort.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |last=Hawtree |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Peter Benchley: He was fascinated by the sea, but his bestselling novel tapped into a primeval fear of the deep |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2008-08-18 | location=London}}</ref> After various revisions and rewrites, Benchley delivered his final draft in January 1973.<ref name=\"carl\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|1975|pp=11\u201313}}</ref> The title was not decided until shortly before the book went to print. Benchley says that he had spent months thinking of titles, many of which he calls \"pretentious\" such as ''The Stillness in the Water'' and ''Leviathan Rising''. Benchley regarded other ideas, such as ''The Jaws of Death'' and ''The Jaws of Leviathan'', as \"melodramatic, weird, or pretentious.\"<ref name=\"laurent\"/> According to Benchley, the novel still did not have a title until twenty minutes before production of the book.<ref name=\"laurent\"/>\n\n[[The Literary Guild|The Book of the Month Club]] made the novel an \"A book,\" qualifying it for its main selection, then the ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' also selected it. The publication date was moved back to allow a carefully orchestrated release. It was released first in hardcover in February 1974,<ref name=\"baxter\">{{harvnb|Baxter|1997|p=120}}</ref> then in the book clubs, followed by a national campaign for the paperback release.<ref name=\"carl\"/> [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] bought the paperback rights for $575,000.<ref name=\"baxter\"/>\n\n[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], film producers at [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], heard about the book at identical times at different locations. Brown heard about it in the fiction department of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', a lifestyle magazine then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card gave a detailed description of the plot concluding with the comment \"might make a good movie.\"<ref name=\"brown\">Brown, David, \"A Look Inside ''Jaws''\", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> The producers each read it overnight and agreed that it was \"the most exciting thing that they had ever read\" and that, although they were unsure how they would accomplish it, they had to produce the film.<ref name=\"zanuck\">Zanuck, Richard D., \"A Look Inside ''Jaws''\", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> Brown says that had they read the book twice they would have never have made the film because of the difficulties in executing some of the sequences.

It tells the story of Police Chief Martin Brody (portrayed by [[Roy Scheider]]) of Amity Island (a fictional summer resort town), in his quest to protect beachgoers from a [[great white shark]] by closing the beach. This is overruled by the town council, headed by the mayor Larry Vaughan ([[Murray Hamilton]]) that wants the beach to remain open in order to sustain the local tourist economy. After several attacks, the police chief enlists the help of [[marine biology|marine biologist]] Matt Hooper ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter Quint ([[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]]). The three voyage out onto the ocean in Quint's boat \u2013 the ''Orca''. The shark kills Quint, but Brody manages to destroy it by shooting at the highly pressurized air tank that he has wedged in its mouth. In the end, Brody and Hooper are seen swimming away from the sinking ''Orca'', having both of them managed to survive the shark attack on the boat uninjured.\n\n===''Jaws 2'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Jaws 2}}\nThe first sequel, ''[[Jaws 2]]'', depicts the same town three years after the events of the original film when another great white shark arrives on the shores of the fictional seaside resort of Amity Island. Directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]] and starring [[Roy Scheider]] again as Police Chief Martin Brody, who, after a series of deaths and disappearances, suspects that the culprit is another shark. However, he has trouble convincing the town's selectmen. Once fired, he has to act alone to save a group of teenagers, including his two sons, who encounter the shark whilst out sailing. Brody then manages to fry the shark at Cable Junction upon pulling up one of the underwater cables.\n\n===''Jaws 3-D'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Jaws 3-D}}\nThe plot of ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'' moves away from Amity Island to [[SeaWorld]] in [[Florida]], a water themed-park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares to open, it is infiltrated by a baby great white shark which attacks and kills water-skiers and park employees. Once the baby shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a much larger shark, the mother, is present. The characters of Martin's sons from the first two films are developed further in this film: Michael Brody ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is the chief engineer of the park and his younger brother, Sean (John Putch), arrives at the resort to visit him. The events of the earlier films are implied through Sean's dislike of the water because of \"something that happened when he was a kid.\" The events and character development from ''Jaws 3-D'' are independent from the rest of the series.<ref name=\"young\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=Karen Young \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref>\n\n===''Jaws: The Revenge'' (1987)===\n{{Main|Jaws: The Revenge}}\nThe fourth and final film, ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'', sees the storyline returning to Amity Island, but ignores all plot elements introduced in ''Jaws 3-D''. No mention is made to Michael's girlfriend from the previous film, Kathryn Morgan ([[Bess Armstrong]]), or his career change from an engineer at SeaWorld to a marine biologist. In fact, one of the [[Universal Studios]] press releases for ''Jaws: The Revenge'' omits ''Jaws 3-D'' entirely by referring to ''Jaws: The Revenge'' as the \"''third'' film of the remarkable ''Jaws'' trilogy.\"<ref name=\"young\"/> By the start of the film, Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his wife, Ellen Brody ([[Lorraine Gary]]), claims that he died through fear of the shark. Her youngest son, Sean ([[Mitchell Anderson]]), now working as a police deputy in Amity, is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Ellen becomes convinced that a shark is deliberately victimizing her family for the deaths of the first two sharks. Michael ([[Lance Guest]]) convinces her to spend some time with his family in [[The Bahamas]]. However, as his job involves a lot of time on and in the sea, Ellen fears that he will be the shark's next victim. When her granddaughter, Thea ([[Judith Barsi]]), narrowly avoids being attacked by a shark, Ellen takes a boat in order to kill her family's alleged stalker. Hoagie ([[Michael Caine]]), Michael, and his friend Jake ([[Mario Van Peebles]]) find Ellen and then proceed to electrocute the shark, driving it out of the water and impaling it on the prow of Ellen's boat.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n===Principal cast===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Films\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws 2]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws 3-D]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws: The Revenge|Jaws:<br>The Revenge]]\n|-\n! 1975\n! 1978\n! 1983\n! 1987\n|-\n!

Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft. The authorship of Quint's monologue about the fate of the cruiser {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} has caused substantial controversy as to who deserves the most credit for the speech. Spielberg described it as a collaboration among John Milius, Howard Sackler, and actor Robert Shaw.<ref name=\"Friedman167\">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=167}}</ref> Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius' contribution.<ref name=\"Gottlieb208\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=208}}</ref>\n\nThree mechanical sharks were made for the production: a full version for underwater shots, one that moved from the camera left to right (with its hidden side completely exposing the internal machinery), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered.<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Their construction was supervised by production designer [[Joe Alves]] and special effects artist [[Robert A. Mattey]]. After the sharks were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but had not been tested in water and when placed in the ocean the full model sank to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> Location shooting occurred on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], chosen because the ocean had a sandy bottom while {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} out at sea.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> This helped the mechanical sharks to operate smoothly and still provide a realistic location. The film nonetheless had a notoriously troubled shoot and went considerably over budget. David Brown said that the budget \"was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras were soaked, and the ''Orca'' once began to sink with the actors on board. The mechanical shark frequently malfunctioned, due to the hydraulic innards being corroded by salt water.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> The three mechanical sharks were collectively nicknamed \"Bruce\" by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer.<ref name=\"McBride241\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=241}}</ref> To some degree, the delays in the production proved serendipitous. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes with the shark only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is represented by the floating yellow barrels. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin due to its ease of filming. This forced restraint is widely thought to have increased the suspense of these scenes, giving it a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] tone.<ref name=\"Sinyard36\">{{harvnb|Sinyard|1989|p=36}}</ref>\n\nThe studio ordered a sequel early into the success of ''Jaws''.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The success of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and other sequels meant that the producers were under pressure to deliver a bigger and better shark. They realized that someone else would produce the film if they didn't, and they preferred to be in charge of the project themselves.<ref name=\"kach74\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=74}}</ref> Spielberg declined to be involved in the sequel.<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\"/><ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\n====''Jaws 2'' (1978)====\nLike the first film, the production of ''Jaws 2'' was troubled.

Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref>Loynd, p 60-2</ref> The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida]], because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Like the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref> The corrosive effect of the saltwater damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/> As with the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nThe producers of the first two films originally pitched the second ''Jaws'' sequel as a [[Parody|spoof]] named ''Jaws 3, People 0''.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> ''[[National Lampoon magazine|National Lampoon]]'' writers [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and Todd Carroll were commissioned to write a script.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Patrizio |title=An Interview with Matty Simmons |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/457/457486p1.html |work=IGN.com |date=  October 31, 2003}}</ref> The project was abandoned due to conflicts with Universal Studios.<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n\n====''Jaws 3-D'' (1983)====\n[[Alan Landsburg]] and [[Rupert Hitzig]] produced the third film.<ref name=\"Zone\">{{harvnb|Zone|2005|p=49}}</ref> The second sequel capitalized upon the revived interest of [[3-D film]] in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' that also made dual use of the number three.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{harvnb|McGee|2001|pp=97\u20138}}</ref> As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, having been the [[production designer]] for the first two films, he thought that 3-D would \"give him an edge\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/> Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard [[polarized glasses]] to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen.<ref name=\"Ankeney\">{{cite web|first=Jay|last=Ankeney|title=Underwater with Hydroflex's Pete Romano|work=HydroFlex Inc|url=http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|date=March 13, 2000|accessdate=2007-01-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208200630/http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|archivedate=February 8, 2007}}</ref> [[Richard Matheson]] worked on the story and script, although many of his contributions were unused: the writer is unhappy with the finished film.<ref name=\"matheson\">{{harvnb|Weaver|2006|p=318}}</ref> [[Carl Gottlieb]], who had also revised the screenplays for the first two ''Jaws'' films, was credited for the script alongside Matheson.<ref name=\"Scheib\">{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Scheib |title=JAWS 3-D aka JAWS III Rating: \u00bd |work=The SF, Horror and Fantasy Film Review |url=http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/jaws3.htm |year=1990 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025003/http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/jaws3.htm |archivedate=2006-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====''Jaws: The Revenge'' (1987)====\n[[Joseph Sargent]] produced and directed the fourth film in the series.

The Blob''),\n''[[Grizzly (film)|Grizzly]]'', ''[[Mako: The Jaws of Death]]'', ''[[Death Bed: The Bed That Eats]]'',  ''[[Day of the Animals]]'', ''[[Claws (1977 film)]]'' \n''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'' (also known as ''Orca: The Killer Whale''), ''[[Eaten Alive]]'', ''[[The Pack (1977 film)|The Pack]]'', ''[[Snowbeast]]'', ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'', ''[[Barracuda (1978 film)|Barracuda]]'', ''[[Nightwing (film)|Nightwing]]'', ''[[Up from the Depths]]'', ''[[Humanoids from the Deep]]'' (also known as ''Monster''), ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]'', ''[[Blood Beach]]'', ''[[Creature (miniseries)|Creature]]'', the Italian-American ''[[Tentacles (film)|Tentacles]]'', the Mexican ''[[Tintorera]]'' (also known as ''Tintorera: Killer Shark''), the French-Italian ''[[Killer Fish]]'', the Italian ''[[Monster Shark]]'' (also known as ''Devil Fish''), and the Japanese ''[[Jaws in Japan]]'' (also known as ''Psycho Shark'').

It features interviews with a range of cast and crew from the film. It was narrated by the late [[Roy Scheider]] and dedicated to the late [[Peter Benchley]].\n\nThe documentary was produced by ''Jaws'' fans over a seven-year period, building on [[Laurent Bouzereau]]'s 1995 documentary, ''The Making of Jaws'', that has been included on some laserdisc and DVD releases. Throughout other documentaries over the years, such as [[Laurent Bouzereau|Bouzereau's]] and the [[BBC]]'s 1997 documentary ''In the Teeth of Jaws'', actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] has recounted tales about the troubled production of ''Jaws'' and the quote \u201cThe shark is NOT working\u201d which Dreyfuss would hear constantly from members of the crew. Eventually, upon successful attempts to fix the malfunctioning sea monster, Dreyfuss would regularly hear the quote \u201cThe shark is working.\"\n\n''The Shark Is Still Working'' won Best Documentary Feature at the 2010 DocMiami Film Festival.  The documentary was released on home video as a special feature on the 2012 Blu-ray edition of ''Jaws''.\n\nSome of the interviews were filmed in 4:3 [[Academy ratio]], typical of TV documentaries of the time. As the production went on, [[16:9]] became the TV shape standard and so the documentary crops the top and bottom of the image to reshape it to 16:9. There is no anamorphic enhancement of the documentary on the Jaws Blu-Ray.\n\n=== Toys and merchandise ===\n[[File:Jaws2 merchandise.jpg|thumb|A small selection of merchandise from ''Jaws 2''.]]\nUniversal \"devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan\" for the first film's distribution and exhibition.<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> The studio and publisher Bantam designed a logo which would appear on both the paperback and on all film advertising. \"Both publisher and distributor recognized the mutual benefits that a joint promotion strategy would bring.\"<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> Producers Zanuck and Brown toured six cities to promote the paperback and the film.<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> Once the film was released, more merchandising was created, including shark-illustrated swimming towels and T-shirts, plastic shark fins for swimmers to wear, and shark-shaped inflatables for them to float on.

The main subject of the saga is a [[great white shark]], and its attacks on people in specific areas of the United States. The Brody family is featured in all of the films as the primary antithesis to the shark. The original film was based on a novel written by [[Peter Benchley]], which itself was inspired by the [[Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916]]. Benchley adapted his novel, along with help from Carl Gottlieb and Howard Sackler, into the 1975 film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', which was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]]. Although Gottlieb went on to pen two of the three sequels, neither Benchley nor Spielberg returned to the film series in any capacity.\n\nThe first film was regarded as a watershed film in motion picture history; it became the father of the summer [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster movies]] and one of the first \"[[high-concept]]\" films.<ref>{{cite news | work=BBC News Online|title=Rise of the blockbuster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1653733.stm| accessdate=2006-08-20|date=2001-11-16}}</ref><ref name=\"wyatt76\">{{harvnb|Wyatt|1994|p=76}}</ref> The film is also known for the introduction of [[John Williams]]' famous theme music, which was a simple alternating pattern of the E and F notes of a piano. Williams' musical score won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. The film won two other Academy Awards, and was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].\n\nThe success of ''Jaws'' led to three sequels, and the four films together have earned nearly $800 million worldwide in box office gross. The franchise has also seen the release of various soundtrack albums, additional novelizations based on the sequels, [[trading card]]s, inspired [[Jaws (ride)|theme park rides]] at [[Universal Studios Florida]] and [[Universal Studios Japan]], multiple video games, and a musical that premiered in 2004. Although the first film was popular with critics when it was originally released, critical reception went downhill with each sequel. This reception has spread to the merchandise, with video games seen as poor imitations of the original concept. Nevertheless, the original 1975 film has generally been regarded as [[Films considered the greatest ever|one of the greatest films ever]], and frequently appears in the top 100 of various [[American Film Institute]] rankings.\n\nHowever, Benchley later regretted he ever wrote the original book considering it encouraged a widespread public fear of sharks, which led to massive culls resulting in the various shark species around the world becoming endangered. As such, he spent most of his life promoting the cause of [[ocean conservation]].\n\n==Background==\nPeter Benchley had been thinking for years \"about a story about a shark that attacks people and what would happen if it came in and wouldn't go away.\"<ref name=\"laurent\">Benchley, Peter, \"A Look Inside ''Jaws''\", produced by Laurent Bouzereau, available as a bonus feature on some laserdisc and DVD releases of ''Jaws''</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] editor [[Tom Congdon]] was interested in Benchley's idea of a novel about a great white shark terrorizing a beach resort.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news |last=Hawtree |first=Christopher |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/14/guardianobituaries.obituaries |title=Peter Benchley: He was fascinated by the sea, but his bestselling novel tapped into a primeval fear of the deep |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2006-02-14 |accessdate=2008-08-18 | location=London}}</ref> After various revisions and rewrites, Benchley delivered his final draft in January 1973.<ref name=\"carl\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|1975|pp=11\u201313}}</ref> The title was not decided until shortly before the book went to print. Benchley says that he had spent months thinking of titles, many of which he calls \"pretentious\" such as ''The Stillness in the Water'' and ''Leviathan Rising''. Benchley regarded other ideas, such as ''The Jaws of Death'' and ''The Jaws of Leviathan'', as \"melodramatic, weird, or pretentious.\"<ref name=\"laurent\"/> According to Benchley, the novel still did not have a title until twenty minutes before production of the book.<ref name=\"laurent\"/>\n\n[[The Literary Guild|The Book of the Month Club]] made the novel an \"A book,\" qualifying it for its main selection, then the ''[[Reader's Digest]]'' also selected it. The publication date was moved back to allow a carefully orchestrated release.

Brown heard about it in the fiction department of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'', a lifestyle magazine then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]].

It tells the story of Police Chief Martin Brody (portrayed by [[Roy Scheider]]) of Amity Island (a fictional summer resort town), in his quest to protect beachgoers from a [[great white shark]] by closing the beach. This is overruled by the town council, headed by the mayor Larry Vaughan ([[Murray Hamilton]]) that wants the beach to remain open in order to sustain the local tourist economy. After several attacks, the police chief enlists the help of [[marine biology|marine biologist]] Matt Hooper ([[Richard Dreyfuss]]) and a professional shark hunter Quint ([[Robert Shaw (British actor)|Robert Shaw]]). The three voyage out onto the ocean in Quint's boat \u2013 the ''Orca''. The shark kills Quint, but Brody manages to destroy it by shooting at the highly pressurized air tank that he has wedged in its mouth. In the end, Brody and Hooper are seen swimming away from the sinking ''Orca'', having both of them managed to survive the shark attack on the boat uninjured.\n\n===''Jaws 2'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Jaws 2}}\nThe first sequel, ''[[Jaws 2]]'', depicts the same town three years after the events of the original film when another great white shark arrives on the shores of the fictional seaside resort of Amity Island. Directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]] and starring [[Roy Scheider]] again as Police Chief Martin Brody, who, after a series of deaths and disappearances, suspects that the culprit is another shark. However, he has trouble convincing the town's selectmen. Once fired, he has to act alone to save a group of teenagers, including his two sons, who encounter the shark whilst out sailing. Brody then manages to fry the shark at Cable Junction upon pulling up one of the underwater cables.\n\n===''Jaws 3-D'' (1983)===\n{{Main|Jaws 3-D}}\nThe plot of ''[[Jaws 3-D]]'' moves away from Amity Island to [[SeaWorld]] in [[Florida]], a water themed-park with underwater tunnels and lagoons. As the park prepares to open, it is infiltrated by a baby great white shark which attacks and kills water-skiers and park employees. Once the baby shark is captured, it becomes apparent that a much larger shark, the mother, is present. The characters of Martin's sons from the first two films are developed further in this film: Michael Brody ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is the chief engineer of the park and his younger brother, Sean (John Putch), arrives at the resort to visit him. The events of the earlier films are implied through Sean's dislike of the water because of \"something that happened when he was a kid.\" The events and character development from ''Jaws 3-D'' are independent from the rest of the series.<ref name=\"young\">{{cite press release |publisher=Universal Studios |year=1987 |title=Karen Young \"Jaws The Revenge\" Universal News}}</ref>\n\n===''Jaws: The Revenge'' (1987)===\n{{Main|Jaws: The Revenge}}\nThe fourth and final film, ''[[Jaws: The Revenge]]'', sees the storyline returning to Amity Island, but ignores all plot elements introduced in ''Jaws 3-D''. No mention is made to Michael's girlfriend from the previous film, Kathryn Morgan ([[Bess Armstrong]]), or his career change from an engineer at SeaWorld to a marine biologist. In fact, one of the [[Universal Studios]] press releases for ''Jaws: The Revenge'' omits ''Jaws 3-D'' entirely by referring to ''Jaws: The Revenge'' as the \"''third'' film of the remarkable ''Jaws'' trilogy.\"<ref name=\"young\"/> By the start of the film, Martin Brody had died of a heart attack, although his wife, Ellen Brody ([[Lorraine Gary]]), claims that he died through fear of the shark. Her youngest son, Sean ([[Mitchell Anderson]]), now working as a police deputy in Amity, is dispatched to clear a log from a buoy. As he does so, he is attacked and killed by a shark. Ellen becomes convinced that a shark is deliberately victimizing her family for the deaths of the first two sharks. Michael ([[Lance Guest]]) convinces her to spend some time with his family in [[The Bahamas]]. However, as his job involves a lot of time on and in the sea, Ellen fears that he will be the shark's next victim. When her granddaughter, Thea ([[Judith Barsi]]), narrowly avoids being attacked by a shark, Ellen takes a boat in order to kill her family's alleged stalker. Hoagie ([[Michael Caine]]), Michael, and his friend Jake ([[Mario Van Peebles]]) find Ellen and then proceed to electrocute the shark, driving it out of the water and impaling it on the prow of Ellen's boat.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n===Principal cast===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:99%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"3\" style=\"width:15%;\" | Characters\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Films\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws 2]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws 3-D]]''\n! style=\"text-align:center; width:15%;\" | ''[[Jaws: The Revenge|Jaws:<br>The Revenge]]\n|-\n! 1975\n! 1978\n! 1983\n! 1987\n|-\n!

Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft. The authorship of Quint's monologue about the fate of the cruiser {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} has caused substantial controversy as to who deserves the most credit for the speech. Spielberg described it as a collaboration among John Milius, Howard Sackler, and actor Robert Shaw.<ref name=\"Friedman167\">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=167}}</ref> Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius' contribution.<ref name=\"Gottlieb208\">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=208}}</ref>\n\nThree mechanical sharks were made for the production: a full version for underwater shots, one that moved from the camera left to right (with its hidden side completely exposing the internal machinery), and an opposite model with its right flank uncovered.<ref name=\"Brode 50\">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Their construction was supervised by production designer [[Joe Alves]] and special effects artist [[Robert A. Mattey]]. After the sharks were completed, they were shipped to the shooting location, but had not been tested in water and when placed in the ocean the full model sank to the ocean floor, forcing a team of divers to retrieve it.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> Location shooting occurred on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], chosen because the ocean had a sandy bottom while {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} out at sea.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> This helped the mechanical sharks to operate smoothly and still provide a realistic location. The film nonetheless had a notoriously troubled shoot and went considerably over budget. David Brown said that the budget \"was $4 million and the picture wound up costing $9 million\".<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\">{{harvnb|Prigg\u00e9|2004|p=8}}</ref> Shooting at sea led to many delays: unwanted sailboats drifted into frame, cameras were soaked, and the ''Orca'' once began to sink with the actors on board. The mechanical shark frequently malfunctioned, due to the hydraulic innards being corroded by salt water.<ref name=\"Jaws\"/> The three mechanical sharks were collectively nicknamed \"Bruce\" by the production team after Spielberg's lawyer.<ref name=\"McBride241\">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=241}}</ref> To some degree, the delays in the production proved serendipitous. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot most of the scenes with the shark only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is represented by the floating yellow barrels. Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin due to its ease of filming. This forced restraint is widely thought to have increased the suspense of these scenes, giving it a [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcockian]] tone.<ref name=\"Sinyard36\">{{harvnb|Sinyard|1989|p=36}}</ref>\n\nThe studio ordered a sequel early into the success of ''Jaws''.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> The success of ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and other sequels meant that the producers were under pressure to deliver a bigger and better shark. They realized that someone else would produce the film if they didn't, and they preferred to be in charge of the project themselves.<ref name=\"kach74\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=74}}</ref> Spielberg declined to be involved in the sequel.<ref name=\"Prigg\u00e98\"/><ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\n====''Jaws 2'' (1978)====\nLike the first film, the production of ''Jaws 2'' was troubled.

Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing.<ref>Loynd, p 60-2</ref> The majority of filming was at [[Navarre Beach, Florida]], because of the warm weather and the water's depth being appropriate for the shark platform.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> Like the first film, shooting on water proved challenging. After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction.<ref name=\"kach77\">{{harvnb|Kachmar|2002|p=77}}</ref> The corrosive effect of the saltwater damaged some equipment, including the metal parts in the sharks.<ref name=\"kach77\"/> As with the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers [[Ron & Valerie Taylor]] was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.<ref name=\"makingof\"/>\n\nThe producers of the first two films originally pitched the second ''Jaws'' sequel as a [[Parody|spoof]] named ''Jaws 3, People 0''.<ref name=\"makingof\"/> ''[[National Lampoon magazine|National Lampoon]]'' writers [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] and Todd Carroll were commissioned to write a script.<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |first=Andy |last=Patrizio |title=An Interview with Matty Simmons |url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/457/457486p1.html |work=IGN.com |date=  October 31, 2003}}</ref> The project was abandoned due to conflicts with Universal Studios.<ref name=\"ign\"/>\n\n====''Jaws 3-D'' (1983)====\n[[Alan Landsburg]] and [[Rupert Hitzig]] produced the third film.<ref name=\"Zone\">{{harvnb|Zone|2005|p=49}}</ref> The second sequel capitalized upon the revived interest of [[3-D film]] in the 1980s, amongst other horror films such as ''[[Friday the 13th Part III]]'' and ''[[Amityville 3-D]]'' that also made dual use of the number three.<ref name=\"McGee\">{{harvnb|McGee|2001|pp=97\u20138}}</ref> As it was Joe Alves' first film as director, having been the [[production designer]] for the first two films, he thought that 3-D would \"give him an edge\".<ref name=\"McGee\"/> Cinema audiences could wear disposable cardboard [[polarized glasses]] to create the illusion that elements penetrate the screen.<ref name=\"Ankeney\">{{cite web|first=Jay|last=Ankeney|title=Underwater with Hydroflex's Pete Romano|work=HydroFlex Inc|url=http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|date=March 13, 2000|accessdate=2007-01-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208200630/http://www.hydroflex.com/site/about/crplanet.html|archivedate=February 8, 2007}}</ref> [[Richard Matheson]] worked on the story and script, although many of his contributions were unused: the writer is unhappy with the finished film.<ref name=\"matheson\">{{harvnb|Weaver|2006|p=318}}</ref> [[Carl Gottlieb]], who had also revised the screenplays for the first two ''Jaws'' films, was credited for the script alongside Matheson.<ref name=\"Scheib\">{{cite web|first=Richard |last=Scheib |title=JAWS 3-D aka JAWS III Rating: \u00bd |work=The SF, Horror and Fantasy Film Review |url=http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/jaws3.htm |year=1990 |accessdate=2007-01-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212025003/http://www.moria.co.nz/horror/jaws3.htm |archivedate=2006-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====''Jaws: The Revenge'' (1987)====\n[[Joseph Sargent]] produced and directed the fourth film in the series.

The Blob''),\n''[[Grizzly (film)|Grizzly]]'', ''[[Mako: The Jaws of Death]]'', ''[[Death Bed: The Bed That Eats]]'',  ''[[Day of the Animals]]'', ''[[Claws (1977 film)]]'' \n''[[Orca (film)|Orca]]'' (also known as ''Orca: The Killer Whale''), ''[[Eaten Alive]]'', ''[[The Pack (1977 film)|The Pack]]'', ''[[Snowbeast]]'', ''[[Piranha II: The Spawning]]'', ''[[Barracuda (1978 film)|Barracuda]]'', ''[[Nightwing (film)|Nightwing]]'', ''[[Up from the Depths]]'', ''[[Humanoids from the Deep]]'' (also known as ''Monster''), ''[[Alligator (film)|Alligator]]'', ''[[Blood Beach]]'', ''[[Creature (miniseries)|Creature]]'', the Italian-American ''[[Tentacles (film)|Tentacles]]'', the Mexican ''[[Tintorera]]'' (also known as ''Tintorera: Killer Shark''), the French-Italian ''[[Killer Fish]]'', the Italian ''[[Monster Shark]]'' (also known as ''Devil Fish''), and the Japanese ''[[Jaws in Japan]]'' (also known as ''Psycho Shark'').

It features interviews with a range of cast and crew from the film. It was narrated by the late [[Roy Scheider]] and dedicated to the late [[Peter Benchley]].\n\nThe documentary was produced by ''Jaws'' fans over a seven-year period, building on [[Laurent Bouzereau]]'s 1995 documentary, ''The Making of Jaws'', that has been included on some laserdisc and DVD releases. Throughout other documentaries over the years, such as [[Laurent Bouzereau|Bouzereau's]] and the [[BBC]]'s 1997 documentary ''In the Teeth of Jaws'', actor [[Richard Dreyfuss]] has recounted tales about the troubled production of ''Jaws'' and the quote \u201cThe shark is NOT working\u201d which Dreyfuss would hear constantly from members of the crew. Eventually, upon successful attempts to fix the malfunctioning sea monster, Dreyfuss would regularly hear the quote \u201cThe shark is working.\"\n\n''The Shark Is Still Working'' won Best Documentary Feature at the 2010 DocMiami Film Festival.  The documentary was released on home video as a special feature on the 2012 Blu-ray edition of ''Jaws''.\n\nSome of the interviews were filmed in 4:3 [[Academy ratio]], typical of TV documentaries of the time. As the production went on, [[16:9]] became the TV shape standard and so the documentary crops the top and bottom of the image to reshape it to 16:9. There is no anamorphic enhancement of the documentary on the Jaws Blu-Ray.\n\n=== Toys and merchandise ===\n[[File:Jaws2 merchandise.jpg|thumb|A small selection of merchandise from ''Jaws 2''.]]\nUniversal \"devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan\" for the first film's distribution and exhibition.<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> The studio and publisher Bantam designed a logo which would appear on both the paperback and on all film advertising. \"Both publisher and distributor recognized the mutual benefits that a joint promotion strategy would bring.\"<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> Producers Zanuck and Brown toured six cities to promote the paperback and the film.<ref name=\"Kochberg31\"/> Once the film was released, more merchandising was created, including shark-illustrated swimming towels and T-shirts, plastic shark fins for swimmers to wear, and shark-shaped inflatables for them to float on.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained. In the cities of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;31 is completely city-owned.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_niagara.csv |title=Niagara County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-monroe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Another city-maintained section exists in the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]] from Washburn Street (five blocks east of [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]]) to the eastern city line.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\" /> Two villages\u2014[[Medina, New York|Medina]] and [[Newark, New York|Newark]]\u2014also maintain parts of NY&nbsp;31.

The busiest of these, from [[Interstate&nbsp;590]] (I-590) to [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] in the eastern suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]], carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|per day on average]]. Two other segments\u2014between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY&nbsp;65 to French Road in Brighton and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]\u2014have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY&nbsp;31 in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] town of [[Vernon (town), New York|Vernon]] between the [[Vernon Downs]] racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.<ref name=\"2009tvr\" />\n\n===Western New York===\nNY&nbsp;31 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in northern Niagara Falls. After a short distance eastward through the northern fringe of the city as College Avenue, the road encounters [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]] at the northeastern city line. NY&nbsp;31 continues northeastward into the town of [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], following Witmer Road to an interchange with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] at exit&nbsp;24. Past I-190, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] south of the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] reservoir. At the intersection, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Saunders Settlement Road, a name it retains for almost {{convert|15|mi|0}}. Continuing through [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], NY&nbsp;31 passes the south end of the [[Tuscarora Indian Reservation]] ahead of a brief [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. Past the east end of the concurrency, NY&nbsp;429 travels north toward NY&nbsp;104 while NY&nbsp;31 continues east past [[Niagara County Community College]] to an intersection with [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]], the final state route that NY&nbsp;31 intersects before entering the [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] area.<ref name=\"ilnymap\">{{cite map |title=I Love New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |cartography=[[Map Works]] |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"bing1\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2sYrt88 |title=overview map of NY 31 from Niagara Falls to Gates |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:NY 63-31 in Medina.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;63 north through Medina village]]\nWest of Lockport, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 270|NY&nbsp;270]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY&nbsp;93]]. Continuing into the city, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]] (Transit Street) at an intersection partially located over the [[Erie Canal]]. NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]]. Midway between Albion and [[Holley, New York|Holley]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects the southern end of [[New York State Route 387|NY&nbsp;387]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues to the southeast, entering Holley and intersecting [[New York State Route 237|NY&nbsp;237]] in the village center. The route quickly leaves Holley soon after, crossing into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] just over a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) from the village line.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n===Rochester area===\n====Western suburbs and downtown====\n[[File:NY 31 at NY 31A in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Approaching NY&nbsp;31A on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in Sweden]]\nJust inside the Monroe County line, the road traverses the [[Erie Canal]] before intersecting Redman Road about {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]]. NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]].

It heads onward toward a pair of overpasses, one carrying I-490 and another holding the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[Rochester Subdivision]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard. It turns east here, following Woodbury Boulevard for two blocks to Chestnut Street, at which point NY&nbsp;31 turns southward to follow Chestnut Street. Westbound NY&nbsp;31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street.

From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south.

Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County. The route proceeds across the northeastern most corner of the county before crossing into [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] via a bridge over the Erie Canal after just {{convert|1.5|mi|1}}.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n===Central New York===\nShortly after entering Cayuga County, NY&nbsp;31 crosses and begins to parallel the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]), which NY&nbsp;31 does for most of its routing west of the outer [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] suburbs. In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time. The route continues southeast into the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]] and the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of the same name]] within, where NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Among these was Route&nbsp;30, which was modified to follow Ridge Road instead between Ridgeway and Rochester. Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route&nbsp;30 mostly became part of an extended Route&nbsp;20, which now began in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] and followed modern NY&nbsp;425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]] to Medina, however, Route&nbsp;20 was routed on modern NY&nbsp;31 instead. East of Rochester, the section of Route&nbsp;20 between [[Fairport, New York|Fairport]] and Macedon was reconfigured to utilize what is now [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] and NY&nbsp;31.<ref name=\"1921book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pE4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA42 |author=New York State Legislature |title=Laws of the State of New York passed at the One Hundred and Forty-Fourth Session of the Legislature |chapter=Tables of Laws and Codes Amended or Repealed |year=1921 |publisher=J.

From [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]] to Jordan, NY&nbsp;31 used a slightly different routing. It initially exited the village on Clinton Road and followed that road to Jordan, where NY&nbsp;31 turned north and followed modern [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] and NY&nbsp;31 north and east to modern CR&nbsp;84. NY&nbsp;31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route&nbsp;31, current NY&nbsp;31, and Downer Street to reach [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]]. Within the village, NY&nbsp;31 followed Downer Street and what is now [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY&nbsp;31 remained on its current routing to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road. It rejoined its modern alignment near the eastern town line, and followed it east to what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] in [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]].

York (state)|New York]] in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]]. Its eastern terminus is at a [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]] in Vernon Center, a [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] within the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]]. Over its routing, NY&nbsp;31 spans 10 counties and indirectly connects three major urban areas in [[Upstate New York]]: [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\u2013Niagara Falls, [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]]. The route is one of the longest routes in New York State, paralleling two similarly lengthy routes, [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] to the north and [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] to the south, as well as the [[Erie Canal]], as it proceeds east.\n\nMuch of NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] was originally designated as part of a [[legislative route]] from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY&nbsp;31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route&nbsp;30 (modern NY&nbsp;31, [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]], and NY&nbsp;104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to [[Lenox, New York|Lenox]]. At Lenox, NY&nbsp;31 turned southeast to follow what is now [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] and [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] to [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] in [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]]. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to [[Lewiston (village), New York|Lewiston]] on [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] and altered in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 renumbering of state highways in New York]] to continue east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] via [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. With the advent of [[U.S. Route&nbsp;104]] (US&nbsp;104) {{circa|1935}}, NY&nbsp;31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.\n\nNY&nbsp;31 was truncated westward to [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] in Verona in the early 1940s, moving the eastern terminus of NY&nbsp;31 to the same junction that also had served as the northern terminus of '''New York State Route&nbsp;234''', a north\u2013south route that extended southeastward to Vernon Center, since the early 1930s. The two routes continued to share a terminus until 1981, when ownership and maintenance of part of NY&nbsp;234 was transferred from the state of New York to [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. In return, the state acquired a pair of county roads that followed a routing parallel to that of the transferred section of NY&nbsp;234. The new state highways and the remainder of NY&nbsp;234 became an extension of NY&nbsp;31.\n\n==Route description==\nMost of NY&nbsp;31 is owned by the state of New York and maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] (NYSDOT); however, some sections of the route\u2014mostly within cities\u2014are locally owned and maintained. In the cities of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] and [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY&nbsp;31 is completely city-owned.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_niagara.csv |title=Niagara County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"inv-monroe\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dot.ny.gov/divisions/engineering/technical-services/hds-repository2/INV_2010-03-02_monroe.csv |title=Monroe County Inventory Listing |date=March 2, 2010 |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |format=CSV |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Another city-maintained section exists in the [[Lockport (city), New York|city of Lockport]] from Washburn Street (five blocks east of [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]]) to the eastern city line.<ref name=\"inv-niagara\" /> Two villages\u2014[[Medina, New York|Medina]] and [[Newark, New York|Newark]]\u2014also maintain parts of NY&nbsp;31.

The busiest of these, from [[Interstate&nbsp;590]] (I-590) to [[New York State Route 65|NY&nbsp;65]] in the eastern suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]], carries in excess of 40,000 vehicles [[average annual daily traffic|per day on average]]. Two other segments\u2014between South and Woodbury Avenues in downtown Rochester and from NY&nbsp;65 to French Road in Brighton and [[Pittsford (town), New York|Pittsford]]\u2014have traffic volumes in excess of 30,000 vehicles. On the other hand, the portion of NY&nbsp;31 in the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] town of [[Vernon (town), New York|Vernon]] between the [[Vernon Downs]] racetrack and Youngs Road handles just 910 cars per day on average, making it the least-traveled segment of the route.<ref name=\"2009tvr\" />\n\n===Western New York===\nNY&nbsp;31 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 104|NY&nbsp;104]] in northern Niagara Falls. After a short distance eastward through the northern fringe of the city as College Avenue, the road encounters [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]] at the northeastern city line. NY&nbsp;31 continues northeastward into the town of [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], following Witmer Road to an interchange with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|I-190]] at exit&nbsp;24. Past I-190, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 265|NY&nbsp;265]] south of the [[Robert Moses Niagara Power Plant]] reservoir. At the intersection, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Saunders Settlement Road, a name it retains for almost {{convert|15|mi|0}}. Continuing through [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]], NY&nbsp;31 passes the south end of the [[Tuscarora Indian Reservation]] ahead of a brief [[overlap (road)|overlap]] with [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. Past the east end of the concurrency, NY&nbsp;429 travels north toward NY&nbsp;104 while NY&nbsp;31 continues east past [[Niagara County Community College]] to an intersection with [[New York State Route 425|NY&nbsp;425]], the final state route that NY&nbsp;31 intersects before entering the [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport]] area.<ref name=\"ilnymap\">{{cite map |title=I Love New York State Map |publisher=[[I Love New York]] |cartography=[[Map Works]] |year=2009}}</ref><ref name=\"bing1\">{{bing maps |url=https://binged.it/2sYrt88 |title=overview map of NY 31 from Niagara Falls to Gates |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:NY 63-31 in Medina.jpg|left|thumb|NY&nbsp;31 and NY&nbsp;63 north through Medina village]]\nWest of Lockport, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 270|NY&nbsp;270]] and [[New York State Route 93|NY&nbsp;93]]. Continuing into the city, NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 78|NY&nbsp;78]] (Transit Street) at an intersection partially located over the [[Erie Canal]]. NY&nbsp;31 heads eastward through Lockport, intersecting the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 77|NY&nbsp;77]] at the eastern edge of the city. While NY&nbsp;77 continues along the right-of-way of NY&nbsp;31, NY&nbsp;31 exits, following a northeasterly alignment through [[Gasport, New York|Gasport]] to [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]], where it acts as the western and southern terminus of [[New York State Route 31E|NY&nbsp;31E]] and [[New York State Route 271|NY&nbsp;271]], respectively. Just east of town, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the first of nine county lines along its routing, entering [[Orleans County, New York|Orleans County]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nAt an intersection south of [[Medina, New York|Medina]], [[New York State Route 31A|NY&nbsp;31A]] branches off, continuing straight from NY&nbsp;31 while NY&nbsp;31 turns north to overlap [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] for a short distance between NY&nbsp;31A and NY&nbsp;31E in Medina. At NY&nbsp;31E, NY&nbsp;31 separates from NY&nbsp;63, following the path of NY&nbsp;31E east out of the village. {{convert|10|mi|0}} to the east, NY&nbsp;31 crosses [[New York State Route 98|NY&nbsp;98]] in [[Albion (village), Orleans County, New York|Albion]]. Midway between Albion and [[Holley, New York|Holley]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects the southern end of [[New York State Route 387|NY&nbsp;387]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues to the southeast, entering Holley and intersecting [[New York State Route 237|NY&nbsp;237]] in the village center. The route quickly leaves Holley soon after, crossing into [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] just over a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) from the village line.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n===Rochester area===\n====Western suburbs and downtown====\n[[File:NY 31 at NY 31A in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Approaching NY&nbsp;31A on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in Sweden]]\nJust inside the Monroe County line, the road traverses the [[Erie Canal]] before intersecting Redman Road about {{convert|1.5|mi|1}} west of the village of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]]. NY&nbsp;31 turns south here, following Redman Road back across the Erie Canal and past the western fringe of the [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] campus to a junction with Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31A enters the intersection from the west and ends at NY&nbsp;31 while the latter turns east onto Fourth Section Road. NY&nbsp;31 progresses eastward, intersecting [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] in a commercialized area directly south of Brockport and becoming Brockport&ndash;Spencerport Road. East of the village in the surrounding town of [[Sweden, New York|Sweden]], NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 260|NY&nbsp;260]]. The route continues eastward, paralleling the Erie Canal as it enters [[Ogden, New York|Ogden]], where NY&nbsp;31 comes to the current western terminus of [[New York State Route 531|NY&nbsp;531]], the Spencerport Expressway, and, shortly after, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 36|NY&nbsp;36]]. NY&nbsp;31, now sandwiched by the canal to the north and NY&nbsp;531 to the south, heads eastward into the village of [[Spencerport, New York|Spencerport]], where it becomes Nichols Street and meets [[New York State Route 259|NY&nbsp;259]] in the center of the community.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nOutside of Spencerport, NY&nbsp;31 becomes Spencerport Road as it heads eastward into the town of [[Gates, New York|Gates]]. The route heads past residential neighborhoods to the north and mostly undeveloped land to the south as it enters the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of Elmgrove, built up around NY&nbsp;31's junction with [[New York State Route 386|NY&nbsp;386]].<ref name=\"bing1\" /> Not far to the east, NY&nbsp;31 enters [[North Gates, New York|North Gates]], a densely populated residential community near the northern town line of Gates.

Not far to the east is the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line, which NY&nbsp;31 crosses upon traversing the Erie Canal once again.<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\n[[File:PAETEC Park Exterior.jpg|thumb|left|Broad Street at Sahlen's Stadium]]\nNY&nbsp;31 follows Lyell Avenue through the city to West Broad Street, where it turns to follow Broad Street southeastward past [[Marina Auto Stadium]]. It heads onward toward a pair of overpasses, one carrying I-490 and another holding the [[CSX Transportation]]-owned [[Rochester Subdivision]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues under both, following the former path of the Erie Canal southeast through the city to the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 33|NY&nbsp;33]] at West Main Street. NY&nbsp;31 follows West Main Street to the east, passing under I-490 once again before breaking from Main Street and occupying East Broad Street. The street proceeds to the east, passing through the commercial heart of the city. Just east of Exchange Boulevard, the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 383|NY&nbsp;383]], the route crosses the [[Genesee River]] on the [[Erie Canal: Second Genesee Aqueduct|Broad Street Aqueduct]].<ref name=\"bing1\" />\n\nEast of the waterway, NY&nbsp;31 follows East Broad Street to South Avenue, where it turns south for two blocks to a junction with Woodbury Boulevard. It turns east here, following Woodbury Boulevard for two blocks to Chestnut Street, at which point NY&nbsp;31 turns southward to follow Chestnut Street. Westbound NY&nbsp;31 in the area, however, follows one block of Woodbury Boulevard and two blocks of South Clinton Avenue to reach East Broad Street. At the [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]], Chestnut Street becomes Monroe Avenue, the name NY&nbsp;31 retains to [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]].<ref name=\"rochester east quad\">{{cite map |url=http://gis.ny.gov/gisdata/quads/drg24/dotpreview/index.cfm?code=o18 |title=Rochester East Digital Raster Quadrangle |publisher=New York State Department of Transportation |year=1997 |scale=1:24,000 |accessdate=April 9, 2010}}</ref> Over this stretch, NY&nbsp;31 maintains a constant southeasterly progression as it passes through southeastern Rochester and the town of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]].

From NY&nbsp;65, NY&nbsp;31 continues southeast into the [[Pittsford (town), New York|town of Pittsford]], passing along the southern fringe of [[Oak Hill Country Club]] and paralleling the former right-of-way of the [[Auburn and Syracuse Railroad#Auburn road|Auburn Road]] railroad line to the [[Pittsford (town), New York|village of Pittsford]]. Just inside the village limits, NY&nbsp;31 crosses the Erie Canal once more and intersects the [[West Shore Subdivision]] at-grade. In the village center, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]]. East of NY&nbsp;96, the route crosses over the Erie Canal once again and exits the village. Outside of the village, NY&nbsp;31 parallels I-490 for a short distance across slightly open areas before connecting to the freeway near the [[Perinton, New York|Perinton]] town line at exit&nbsp;26. The route continues east into Perinton, where it traverses the Erie Canal for one final time within the county and crosses [[New York State Route 250|NY&nbsp;250]] near Perinton Square Mall.<ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\nEast of the mall, the route passes through increasingly rural areas, with the exception of the hamlet of Egypt midway between NY&nbsp;250 and the [[Wayne County, New York|Wayne County]] line.<ref name=\"bing2\" /> NY&nbsp;31 progresses onward into Wayne County, where the Rochester suburbs end as the route heads eastward through the mostly rural [[Macedon (town), New York|town of Macedon]] to the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of the same name]]. Prior to exiting the village, NY&nbsp;31 meets the southern terminus of [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] and the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]]. The highway continues on, exiting the village and proceeding eastward through the town of Macedon, bordered by the Erie Canal to the north and Ganargua Creek to the south. In [[Palmyra (village), New York|Palmyra]], NY&nbsp;31 joins [[New York State Route 21|NY&nbsp;21]] through the center of the village.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 west at NY 89.jpg|thumb|left|Approaching NY&nbsp;89 on NY&nbsp;31 westbound in [[Tyre, New York|Tyre]]]]\nFrom Palmyra east, the route parallels the Erie Canal for a considerable distance. Between Palmyra and [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 dips into [[Ontario County, New York|Ontario County]] for less than a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) before reentering Wayne County. In [[Newark, New York|Newark]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 88|NY&nbsp;88]]. Farther east, in [[Lyons (hamlet), New York|Lyons]], it crosses [[New York State Route 14|NY&nbsp;14]] and the Erie Canal. At [[Clyde, New York|Clyde]], NY&nbsp;31 briefly overlaps [[New York State Route 414|NY&nbsp;414]] in the center of the village. Outside of Clyde, the Erie Canal veers off to the southeast while NY&nbsp;31 continues east alongside the Rochester Subdivision to the [[hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] of [[Savannah, New York|Savannah]], the final centralized community within Wayne County. Here, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 89|NY&nbsp;89]] and follows it southward toward the [[Seneca County, New York|Seneca County]] line. At the county line, NY&nbsp;89 turns west to follow the county line while NY&nbsp;31 heads southeast into Seneca County. The route proceeds across the northeastern most corner of the county before crossing into [[Cayuga County, New York|Cayuga County]] via a bridge over the Erie Canal after just {{convert|1.5|mi|1}}.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" /><ref name=\"bing2\" />\n\n===Central New York===\nShortly after entering Cayuga County, NY&nbsp;31 crosses and begins to parallel the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]), which NY&nbsp;31 does for most of its routing west of the outer [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] suburbs. In [[Port Byron, New York|Port Byron]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 38|NY&nbsp;38]] in the center of the village. The routes embark on an overlap through the village before separating near the eastern edge of Port Byron. NY&nbsp;31 continues alone to [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]], where the route meets [[New York State Route 34|NY&nbsp;34]] and [[County Route 31B (Cayuga County, New York)|County Route&nbsp;31B]] (CR&nbsp;31B, formerly [[New York State Route 31B|NY&nbsp;31B]]) north of the village. East of Weedsport, NY&nbsp;31 and the Thruway are joined by the CSX Rochester Subdivision mainline, which runs down the center of the strip of land created by the Thruway to the north and NY&nbsp;31 to the south.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:Junction of NY 38 with NY 31.jpg|thumb|right|Western terminus of the NY&nbsp;31&nbsp;/ NY&nbsp;38 overlap in Port Byron]]\nContinuing into [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] and the village of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]], NY&nbsp;31 begins to make a turn northward while connecting to the northern end of [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] (the former northern terminus of [[New York State Route 31C|NY&nbsp;31C]]) a short distance north of the village center. With the turn complete, NY&nbsp;31 traverses the CSX mainline and the Thruway via successive overpasses before returning to level ground and resuming an eastward alignment in the shadow of the Thruway. Once inside the limits of [[Van Buren, New York|Van Buren]], NY&nbsp;31 separates from the Thruway, curving north and intersecting the western terminus of [[New York State Route 173|NY&nbsp;173]] in quick succession. The alignment remains fairly straight to the outskirts of [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]], where NY&nbsp;31 turns to the right onto Downer Street to avoid the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]] to the immediate north. The eastward progression is limited, however, as NY&nbsp;31 merges with [[New York State Route 690|NY&nbsp;690]] northward, traversing the Seneca River and straddling the western edge of Baldwinsville.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nOn the north bank of the river, NY&nbsp;31 exits NY&nbsp;690 but joins [[New York State Route 370|NY&nbsp;370]] at the end of the exit ramp. Together, NY&nbsp;31 and 370 enter Baldwinsville, intersecting [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] in the village center. Three blocks from NY&nbsp;48, NY&nbsp;370 splits from NY&nbsp;31. As NY&nbsp;370 heads for downtown [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], NY&nbsp;31 continues east, overlapping [[New York State Route 631|NY&nbsp;631]] for a short distance before passing through [[Lysander New Community, New York|Lysander New Community]] and crossing the Seneca River again. Now in the town of [[Clay, New York|Clay]], NY&nbsp;31 meets [[New York State Route 481|NY&nbsp;481]] at an interchange in the shadow of the [[Great Northern Mall (New York)|Great Northern Mall]]. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward through the town to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it meets [[U.S. Route 11 in New York|US&nbsp;11]] and [[Interstate 81 in New York|I-81]] at exit&nbsp;30. As NY&nbsp;31 heads away from I-81, [[Oneida Lake]] slowly becomes visible to the north. NY&nbsp;31 comes within a mile (about 1.6&nbsp;km) of the lakeshore before turning slightly to parallel the shoreline. Near the [[Madison County, New York|Madison County]] line, here delimited by [[Chittenango Creek]], NY&nbsp;31 enters the western half of [[Bridgeport, New York|Bridgeport]] and meets the eastern terminus of [[New York State Route 298|NY&nbsp;298]] near the banks of the creek. NY&nbsp;31 continues eastward, crossing the creek and entering Madison County and the remaining portion of Bridgeport.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n[[File:NY 31 east at NY 46.jpg|thumb|left|Eastbound NY&nbsp;31 at NY&nbsp;46 in Verona]]\nEast of Bridgeport, NY&nbsp;31 moves closer to Oneida Lake, eventually coming to within {{convert|200|yd|m}} of the lakeshore at points. Near the eastern edge of Oneida Lake, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 13|NY&nbsp;13]] in the hamlet of [[South Bay, New York|South Bay]]. To the east, NY&nbsp;31 meets the northern terminus of [[New York State Route 316|NY&nbsp;316]] at a junction adjacent to the [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] line, again marked by a body of water, the [[Oneida Creek]]. NY&nbsp;31 traverses the creek and proceeds eastward through the Oneida County town of [[Verona, New York|Verona]]. Northeast of [[Oneida, New York|Oneida]], NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 46|NY&nbsp;46]] adjacent to the path of the old routing of the [[Erie Canal]]. Farther east, NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 365|NY&nbsp;365]] just north of its interchange with the Thruway. The [[Turning Stone Resort & Casino]], located {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} south of the intersection, is accessible via NY&nbsp;365.<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\nPast NY&nbsp;365, NY&nbsp;31 passes over the Thruway (I-90) for the final time. The route continues southeast into the [[Vernon (town), New York|town of Vernon]] and the [[Vernon (village), New York|village of the same name]] within, where NY&nbsp;31 intersects [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]]. NY&nbsp;31 joins NY&nbsp;5, following the route eastward for about {{convert|0.75|mi|2}} out of the village to Stuhlman Road. Here, NY&nbsp;31 splits from NY&nbsp;5 and follows Stuhlman Road southward, passing to the east of [[Vernon Downs]] before intersecting Youngs Road. Stuhlman Road ends here; however, NY&nbsp;31 turns eastward onto Youngs Road, following it into the hamlet of Vernon Center. The route continues eastward into the center of the community, where it ends at a large [[traffic circle]] with [[New York State Route 26|NY&nbsp;26]].<ref name=\"ilnymap\" />\n\n==History==\n===Early designations===\nIn 1908, the [[New York State Legislature]] established a statewide [[legislative route]] system that initially consisted of 37 [[unsigned highway|unsigned]] routes. Much of what is now NY&nbsp;31 west of [[Jordan, New York|Jordan]] became part of one of three routes, namely Route&nbsp;14, Route&nbsp;20, and Route&nbsp;30. Route&nbsp;30 began at the [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] city line (delimited by modern [[New York State Route 61|NY&nbsp;61]]) and followed current NY&nbsp;31 east to [[Sanborn, New York|Sanborn]], where it turned north onto modern [[New York State Route 429|NY&nbsp;429]]. The route followed current NY&nbsp;429 to [[Ridge Road (Western New York)|Ridge Road]] in [[Porter, New York|Porter]], at which point it turned to follow Ridge Road eastward to what is now [[New York State Route 63|NY&nbsp;63]] in [[Ridgeway, New York|Ridgeway]]. Route&nbsp;30 went south here, utilizing modern NY&nbsp;63 between Ridgeway and Medina. It rejoined what is now NY&nbsp;31 in the latter location and proceeded eastward on roughly current NY&nbsp;31 to the [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] city line. In the vicinity of [[Brockport, New York|Brockport]], however, Route&nbsp;30 was routed on West Avenue and modern [[New York State Route 19|NY&nbsp;19]] instead. From the southeastern city line to [[New York State Route 96|NY&nbsp;96]] in the [[Pittsford (village), New York|village of Pittsford]], Monroe Avenue (modern NY&nbsp;31) was part of Route&nbsp;14, which turned south onto South Main Street in the center of Pittsford. Lastly, the segment what is now NY&nbsp;31 between current [[New York State Route 31F|NY&nbsp;31F]] and [[New York State Route 350|NY&nbsp;350]] in the [[Macedon (village), New York|village of Macedon]] and [[New York State Route 317|NY&nbsp;317]] in Jordan was part of Route&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"1909book\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZ0AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA52 |author=State of New York Department of Highways |title=The Highway Law |year=1909 |publisher=J.

Among these was Route&nbsp;30, which was modified to follow Ridge Road instead between Ridgeway and Rochester. Its former routing from Medina eastward and the Lockport spur of Route&nbsp;30 mostly became part of an extended Route&nbsp;20, which now began in [[North Tonawanda, New York|North Tonawanda]] and followed modern NY&nbsp;425 and Lower Mountain, Gothic Hill, and Upper Mountain Roads north and east through Cambria Center to Lockport. From [[Middleport, New York|Middleport]] to Medina, however, Route&nbsp;20 was routed on modern NY&nbsp;31 instead.

From [[Weedsport, New York|Weedsport]] to Jordan, NY&nbsp;31 used a slightly different routing.

NY&nbsp;31 turned north here, using what is now Old Route&nbsp;31, current NY&nbsp;31, and Downer Street to reach [[Baldwinsville, New York|Baldwinsville]]. Within the village, NY&nbsp;31 followed Downer Street and what is now [[New York State Route 48|NY&nbsp;48]] along Syracuse Street between Downer and Genesee Streets. Outside of Baldwinsville, NY&nbsp;31 remained on its current routing to [[Cicero, New York|Cicero]], where it followed a more northerly alignment along Lakeshore Road.
