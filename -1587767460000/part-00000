He is best known as the lead singer of the late-1970s British [[punk rock|punk]] band the [[Sex Pistols]], which lasted from 1975 until 1978, and again for various revivals during the 1990s and 2000s. He is also the lead singer of [[post-punk]] band [[Public Image Ltd]] (PiL), which he founded and fronted from 1978 until 1993, and again since 2009.\n\nLydon's outspoken persona, rebellious image and fashion style led to his being asked to become the singer of the Sex Pistols by their manager, [[Malcolm McLaren]]. With the Sex Pistols, he penned singles including \"[[Anarchy in the U.K.]],\" \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\", \"[[Pretty Vacant]]\" and \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\", the content of which precipitated what one commentator described as the \"last and greatest outbreak of pop-based [[moral pandemonium]]\" in Britain.<ref name=O50>{{cite news|author=O'Hagan, Sean|date=2 May 2004| title=Fifty Years of Pop|work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/02/popandrock|accessdate=20 March 2009}}</ref> The band scandalised much of the media, and Lydon was seen as a figurehead of the burgeoning punk movement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sex Pistol singer John Lydon to reform Public Image|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-42268020090907|publisher=Reuters|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref> Because of their controversial lyrics and disrepute at the time, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web|title=Sex Pistols|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/sex-pistols/bio|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=S&S>{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Camilla|last2=Skinner|first2=Tony|title=Popular Music Theory: Grade 4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sQ6YL6I7KFcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sheldon,+Camilla+Popular+Music+Theory:+Grade+4#v=onepage&q=sex%20pistols&f=false|accessdate=28 May 2010|year=2006|publisher=Registry Publications Ltd|pages=29\u201330|isbn=9781898466444}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Sex Pistols disbanded in 1978, Lydon founded his own band, Public Image Ltd, which was far more experimental in nature and described in a 2005 ''[[NME]]'' review as \"arguably the first [[post-rock]] group.\"<ref name=\"Plastic Box\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/public-image-ltd/641|title=Plastic Box album review|accessdate=15 January 2008|work=NME|location=UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610054006/http://www.nme.com/reviews/public-image-ltd/641|archive-date=10 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band produced eight albums and a string of singles, including \"[[Public Image (song)|Public Image]]\", \"[[Death Disco]]\", and \"[[Rise (Public Image Ltd song)|Rise]]\", before they went on hiatus in 1993, reforming in 2009. In subsequent years, Lydon has hosted television shows in the UK, US, and Belgium, appeared on ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in the UK, appeared in advertisements on UK television promoting [[Dairy Crest]], a brand of British butter, written two autobiographies, and produced some solo musical work, such as the album ''[[Psycho's Path]]'' (1997). In 2005, he released a compilation album, ''[[The Best of British \u00a31 Notes]]''.\n\nIn 2015, there was a revival of a 1980s movement to have Lydon [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] for his achievements with the Sex Pistols, even though he has declined efforts to award him an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his services to music.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Lydon: 'They're trying to give me a MBE or whatever it is.

McLaren had returned from a brief stint travelling with American [[protopunk]] band the [[New York Dolls]], and he was working on promoting a new band formed by [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], [[Glen Matlock]] and [[Paul Cook]] called the [[Sex Pistols]]. McLaren was impressed with Lydon's ragged look and unique sense of style, particularly his orange hair and modified [[Pink Floyd]] T-shirt (with the band members' eyes scratched out and the words ''I Hate'' scrawled in felt-tip pen above the band's logo). After tunelessly singing [[Alice Cooper]]'s \"[[I'm Eighteen]]\" to the accompaniment of the shop's jukebox, Lydon was chosen as the band's frontman.<ref name=\"young_rs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/9437647/page/3 |title=Rock Is Sick and Living in London |first=Charles M. |last=Young |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212349/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/9437647/page/3 |archivedate=15 April 2010 |date=20 October 1977 |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> In 1977, the band released \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\" during the week of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]].

The reasons for this are disputed, but Lydon claimed in his autobiography that he believed Matlock to be too [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] and middle-class and that Matlock was \"always going on about nice things like [[the Beatles]]\". Matlock stated in his own autobiography that most of the tension in the band, and between himself and Lydon, was orchestrated by McLaren. Matlock quit and as a replacement, Lydon recommended his school friend John Simon Ritchie, who used the stage name [[Sid Vicious]]. Although Ritchie was an incompetent bassist, McLaren agreed that he had the look the band wanted: pale, emaciated, spike-haired, with ripped clothes and a perpetual sneer. In 1977, the Sex Pistols released their only and highly influential studio album ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]''.\n\nVicious' chaotic relationship with girlfriend [[Nancy Spungen]], and his worsening heroin addiction, caused a great deal of friction among the band members, particularly with Lydon, whose sarcastic remarks often exacerbated the situation. Lydon closed the final Sid Vicious-era Sex Pistols concert in San Francisco's [[Winterland]] in January 1978 with a rhetorical question to the audience: \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" Shortly thereafter, McLaren, Jones, and Cook went to Brazil to meet and record with former train robber [[Ronnie Biggs]]. Lydon declined to go, deriding the concept as a whole and feeling that they were attempting to make a hero out of a criminal who attacked a train driver and stole \"working-class money\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Untold Story Behind The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/the-untold-story-behind-the-great-rock-n-roll-swindle/|work=Sabotage Times|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Richard Luck|date=12 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Sex Pistols' disintegration was documented in [[Julian Temple]]'s satirical pseudo-biographical film, ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]'', in which Jones, Cook and Vicious each played a character. Matlock only appeared in previously recorded live footage and as an animation and did not participate personally. Lydon refused to have anything to do with it, feeling that McLaren had far too much control over the project. Although Lydon was highly critical of the film, many years later he agreed to let Temple direct the Sex Pistols documentary ''[[The Filth and the Fury]]''. That film included new interviews with the band members' faces hidden in silhouette. It featured an uncharacteristically emotional Lydon choking up as he discussed Vicious' decline and death. Lydon denounced previous journalistic works regarding the Sex Pistols in the introduction to his autobiography, ''Rotten \u2013 No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'', which he described as \"as close to the truth as one can get\".<ref>Lydon, John.

The first lineup of the band included bassist [[Jah Wobble]] and former [[The Clash]] guitarist [[Keith Levene]]. They released the albums ''[[Public Image: First Issue]]'' (1978), ''[[Metal Box]]'' (1979) and the live album ''[[Paris au Printemps]]'' (1980). Wobble left and Lydon and Levene made ''[[The Flowers of Romance (album)|The Flowers of Romance]]'' (1981). It followed by ''[[This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get]]'' (1984) featuring [[Martin Atkins]] on drums (he had also appeared on ''Metal Box'' and ''The Flowers of Romance''); it featured their biggest hit, \"[[This Is Not a Love Song (Public Image Ltd song)|This Is Not a Love Song]]\", which hit No.&nbsp;5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19831002/7501/ |accessdate=17 July 2019 |agency=Official Charts Company}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Lydon co-starred with [[Harvey Keitel]] in the film ''[[Copkiller]]''', also released as 'Corrupt'' and ''The Order of Death''. He had a small role in the 2000 film ''[[The Independent (2000 film)|The Independent]]''.\n\nIn 1984, Lydon worked with [[Time Zone (band)|Time Zone]] on their single \"World Destruction\". A collaboration between Lydon, [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and producer/bassist [[Bill Laswell]], the single was an early example of \"[[rap rock]]\", along with [[Run-DMC]]. The song appears on Afrika Bambaataa's 1997 compilation album ''Zulu Groove''. It was arranged by Laswell after Lydon and Bambaataa had acknowledged respect for each other's work, as described in an interview from 1984:\n\n{{quote|Afrika Bambaataa: I was talking to Bill Laswell saying I need somebody who's really crazy, man, and he thought of John Lydon. I knew he was perfect because I'd seen this movie that he'd made [''Copkiller''], I knew about all the Sex Pistols and Public Image stuff, so we got together and we did a smashing crazy version, and a version where he cussed the Queen something terrible, which was never released.\n\nJohn Lydon: We went in, put a drum beat down on the machine and did the whole thing in about four-and-a-half hours. It was very, very quick.<ref>[http://www.fodderstompf.com/CHRONOLOGY/1984.html 1984 interview]</ref>}}\n\nThe single featured [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Nicky Skopelitis]] and [[A\u00efyb Dieng]], all of whom would later play on PiL's ''Album''; Laswell played bass and produced. In 1986, Public Image Ltd released ''[[Album (Public Image Ltd album)|Album]]'' (also known as ''Compact Disc'' and ''Cassette'' depending on the format). Most of the tracks on this album were written by Lydon and [[Bill Laswell]]. The musicians were session musicians including bassist [[Jonas Hellborg]], guitarist [[Steve Vai]] and Cream drummer [[Ginger Baker]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn 1987, a new lineup was formed consisting of Lydon, former [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] guitarist [[John McGeoch]], Allan Dias on bass guitar in addition to drummer [[Bruce Smith (musician)|Bruce Smith]] and [[Lu Edmunds]]. This lineup released ''Happy?'' and all except Lu Edmunds released the album ''9'' in 1989. In 1992, Lydon, Dias and McGeoch were joined by [[Curt Bisquera]] on drums and Gregg Arreguin on rhythm guitar for the album ''That What Is Not''. This album also features the [[Tower of Power]] horns on two songs and Jimmie Wood on harmonica. Lydon, McGeoch and Dias wrote the song \"Criminal\" for the film ''[[Point Break]]''. After this album, in 1993, Lydon put PiL on indefinite hiatus.\n\n===1993\u20132006: Solo album, autobiography and celebrity status===\nIn 1993, Lydon's first autobiography, ''Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'', was published. Aided by Keith and Kent Zimmerman, and featuring contributions from figures including [[Paul Cook]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Billy Idol]] and [[Don Letts]], the work covered his life up until the collapse of the Sex Pistols. Describing the book, he stated that it \"is as close to the truth as one can get, looking back on events from the inside. All the people in this book were actually there, and this book is as much their point of view as it is mine. This means contradictions and insults have not been edited, and neither have the compliments, if any. I have no time for lies or fantasy, and neither should you. Enjoy or die.\"<ref>Lydon, p. ix.</ref> In December 2005, Lydon told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' that he was working on a second autobiography to cover the PiL years.<ref name=\"q\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Lydon hosted ''Rotten Day'', a daily syndicated US radio feature written by [[George Gimarc]]. The format of the show was a look back at events in popular music and culture occurring on the particular broadcast calendar date about which Lydon would offer cynical commentary. The show was originally developed as a radio vehicle for Gimarc's book, ''Punk Diary 1970\u201379'', but after bringing Lydon onboard it was expanded to cover notable events from most of the second half of the 20th century.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1997 Lydon released a solo album on [[Virgin Records]] called ''[[Psycho's Path]]''. He wrote all the songs and played all the instruments.

It was a club hit in the US and a big hit in the UK. Lydon has recorded a second solo-album but it has not been released, except for one song that appeared on ''[[The Best of British \u00a31 Notes]]''. In November 1997, Lydon appeared on ''[[Judge Judy]]'' fighting a suit filed by his former tour drummer Robert Williams for breach of contract, [[Assault (tort)|assault]] and [[Battery (tort)|battery]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431464/19971024/story.jhtml|title=John Lydon Appears On Judge Judy|publisher=MTV|date=24 October 1997|accessdate=27 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2004, Lydon appeared on the British reality television programme ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

He is best known as the lead singer of the late-1970s British [[punk rock|punk]] band the [[Sex Pistols]], which lasted from 1975 until 1978, and again for various revivals during the 1990s and 2000s. He is also the lead singer of [[post-punk]] band [[Public Image Ltd]] (PiL), which he founded and fronted from 1978 until 1993, and again since 2009.\n\nLydon's outspoken persona, rebellious image and fashion style led to his being asked to become the singer of the Sex Pistols by their manager, [[Malcolm McLaren]]. With the Sex Pistols, he penned singles including \"[[Anarchy in the U.K.]],\" \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\", \"[[Pretty Vacant]]\" and \"[[Holidays in the Sun (song)|Holidays in the Sun]]\", the content of which precipitated what one commentator described as the \"last and greatest outbreak of pop-based [[moral pandemonium]]\" in Britain.<ref name=O50>{{cite news|author=O'Hagan, Sean|date=2 May 2004| title=Fifty Years of Pop|work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/02/popandrock|accessdate=20 March 2009}}</ref> The band scandalised much of the media, and Lydon was seen as a figurehead of the burgeoning punk movement.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sex Pistol singer John Lydon to reform Public Image|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idINIndia-42268020090907|publisher=Reuters|date=7 September 2009|accessdate=7 September 2009}}</ref> Because of their controversial lyrics and disrepute at the time, they are regarded as one of the most influential acts in the history of popular music.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web|title=Sex Pistols|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/sex-pistols/bio|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=S&S>{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Camilla|last2=Skinner|first2=Tony|title=Popular Music Theory: Grade 4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sQ6YL6I7KFcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sheldon,+Camilla+Popular+Music+Theory:+Grade+4#v=onepage&q=sex%20pistols&f=false|accessdate=28 May 2010|year=2006|publisher=Registry Publications Ltd|pages=29\u201330|isbn=9781898466444}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Sex Pistols disbanded in 1978, Lydon founded his own band, Public Image Ltd, which was far more experimental in nature and described in a 2005 ''[[NME]]'' review as \"arguably the first [[post-rock]] group.\"<ref name=\"Plastic Box\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/public-image-ltd/641|title=Plastic Box album review|accessdate=15 January 2008|work=NME|location=UK|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610054006/http://www.nme.com/reviews/public-image-ltd/641|archive-date=10 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band produced eight albums and a string of singles, including \"[[Public Image (song)|Public Image]]\", \"[[Death Disco]]\", and \"[[Rise (Public Image Ltd song)|Rise]]\", before they went on hiatus in 1993, reforming in 2009. In subsequent years, Lydon has hosted television shows in the UK, US, and Belgium, appeared on ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (UK TV series)|I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in the UK, appeared in advertisements on UK television promoting [[Dairy Crest]], a brand of British butter, written two autobiographies, and produced some solo musical work, such as the album ''[[Psycho's Path]]'' (1997). In 2005, he released a compilation album, ''[[The Best of British \u00a31 Notes]]''.\n\nIn 2015, there was a revival of a 1980s movement to have Lydon [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] for his achievements with the Sex Pistols, even though he has declined efforts to award him an [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] for his services to music.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Lydon: 'They're trying to give me a MBE or whatever it is.

McLaren had returned from a brief stint travelling with American [[protopunk]] band the [[New York Dolls]], and he was working on promoting a new band formed by [[Steve Jones (musician)|Steve Jones]], [[Glen Matlock]] and [[Paul Cook]] called the [[Sex Pistols]]. McLaren was impressed with Lydon's ragged look and unique sense of style, particularly his orange hair and modified [[Pink Floyd]] T-shirt (with the band members' eyes scratched out and the words ''I Hate'' scrawled in felt-tip pen above the band's logo). After tunelessly singing [[Alice Cooper]]'s \"[[I'm Eighteen]]\" to the accompaniment of the shop's jukebox, Lydon was chosen as the band's frontman.<ref name=\"young_rs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/9437647/page/3 |title=Rock Is Sick and Living in London |first=Charles M. |last=Young |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415212349/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/9437647/page/3 |archivedate=15 April 2010 |date=20 October 1977 |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> In 1977, the band released \"[[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|God Save the Queen]]\" during the week of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee]]. At the time, August 1977, Lydon commented: \"Turn the other cheek too often and you get a razor through it.\"{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years\">{{cite book|first= John|last=Tobler|year=1992|title=NME Rock 'N' Roll Years|edition= 1st|publisher=Reed International Books Ltd|location=London|page=303|id=CN 5585}}</ref>\n\nLydon was interested in [[dub music]]. McLaren was said to have been upset when Lydon revealed during a radio interview that his influences included [[progressive rock|progressive]] [[experimental rock|experimentalists]] like [[Magma (band)|Magma]], [[Can (band)|Can]], [[Captain Beefheart]] and [[Van der Graaf Generator]].<ref name=\"Reynolds\">{{cite book|author=Simon Reynolds|title=Rip it Up and Start Again \u2013 Postpunk 1978\u20131984|year=2005|publisher=faber and faber|isbn=978-0-571-21570-6}}</ref> Tensions between Lydon and bassist [[Glen Matlock]] arose. The reasons for this are disputed, but Lydon claimed in his autobiography that he believed Matlock to be too [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] and middle-class and that Matlock was \"always going on about nice things like [[the Beatles]]\". Matlock stated in his own autobiography that most of the tension in the band, and between himself and Lydon, was orchestrated by McLaren. Matlock quit and as a replacement, Lydon recommended his school friend John Simon Ritchie, who used the stage name [[Sid Vicious]]. Although Ritchie was an incompetent bassist, McLaren agreed that he had the look the band wanted: pale, emaciated, spike-haired, with ripped clothes and a perpetual sneer. In 1977, the Sex Pistols released their only and highly influential studio album ''[[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols]]''.\n\nVicious' chaotic relationship with girlfriend [[Nancy Spungen]], and his worsening heroin addiction, caused a great deal of friction among the band members, particularly with Lydon, whose sarcastic remarks often exacerbated the situation. Lydon closed the final Sid Vicious-era Sex Pistols concert in San Francisco's [[Winterland]] in January 1978 with a rhetorical question to the audience: \"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?\" Shortly thereafter, McLaren, Jones, and Cook went to Brazil to meet and record with former train robber [[Ronnie Biggs]]. Lydon declined to go, deriding the concept as a whole and feeling that they were attempting to make a hero out of a criminal who attacked a train driver and stole \"working-class money\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Untold Story Behind The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/reportage/the-untold-story-behind-the-great-rock-n-roll-swindle/|work=Sabotage Times|accessdate=13 December 2013|author=Richard Luck|date=12 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Sex Pistols' disintegration was documented in [[Julian Temple]]'s satirical pseudo-biographical film, ''[[The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle]]'', in which Jones, Cook and Vicious each played a character. Matlock only appeared in previously recorded live footage and as an animation and did not participate personally. Lydon refused to have anything to do with it, feeling that McLaren had far too much control over the project. Although Lydon was highly critical of the film, many years later he agreed to let Temple direct the Sex Pistols documentary ''[[The Filth and the Fury]]''. That film included new interviews with the band members' faces hidden in silhouette. It featured an uncharacteristically emotional Lydon choking up as he discussed Vicious' decline and death. Lydon denounced previous journalistic works regarding the Sex Pistols in the introduction to his autobiography, ''Rotten \u2013 No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'', which he described as \"as close to the truth as one can get\".<ref>Lydon, John.

The first lineup of the band included bassist [[Jah Wobble]] and former [[The Clash]] guitarist [[Keith Levene]]. They released the albums ''[[Public Image: First Issue]]'' (1978), ''[[Metal Box]]'' (1979) and the live album ''[[Paris au Printemps]]'' (1980). Wobble left and Lydon and Levene made ''[[The Flowers of Romance (album)|The Flowers of Romance]]'' (1981). It followed by ''[[This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get]]'' (1984) featuring [[Martin Atkins]] on drums (he had also appeared on ''Metal Box'' and ''The Flowers of Romance''); it featured their biggest hit, \"[[This Is Not a Love Song (Public Image Ltd song)|This Is Not a Love Song]]\", which hit No.&nbsp;5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=Official Singles Chart Top 100 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19831002/7501/ |accessdate=17 July 2019 |agency=Official Charts Company}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Lydon co-starred with [[Harvey Keitel]] in the film ''[[Copkiller]]''', also released as 'Corrupt'' and ''The Order of Death''. He had a small role in the 2000 film ''[[The Independent (2000 film)|The Independent]]''.\n\nIn 1984, Lydon worked with [[Time Zone (band)|Time Zone]] on their single \"World Destruction\". A collaboration between Lydon, [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and producer/bassist [[Bill Laswell]], the single was an early example of \"[[rap rock]]\", along with [[Run-DMC]]. The song appears on Afrika Bambaataa's 1997 compilation album ''Zulu Groove''. It was arranged by Laswell after Lydon and Bambaataa had acknowledged respect for each other's work, as described in an interview from 1984:\n\n{{quote|Afrika Bambaataa: I was talking to Bill Laswell saying I need somebody who's really crazy, man, and he thought of John Lydon. I knew he was perfect because I'd seen this movie that he'd made [''Copkiller''], I knew about all the Sex Pistols and Public Image stuff, so we got together and we did a smashing crazy version, and a version where he cussed the Queen something terrible, which was never released.\n\nJohn Lydon: We went in, put a drum beat down on the machine and did the whole thing in about four-and-a-half hours.

In 1986, Public Image Ltd released ''[[Album (Public Image Ltd album)|Album]]'' (also known as ''Compact Disc'' and ''Cassette'' depending on the format). Most of the tracks on this album were written by Lydon and [[Bill Laswell]]. The musicians were session musicians including bassist [[Jonas Hellborg]], guitarist [[Steve Vai]] and Cream drummer [[Ginger Baker]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nIn 1987, a new lineup was formed consisting of Lydon, former [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] guitarist [[John McGeoch]], Allan Dias on bass guitar in addition to drummer [[Bruce Smith (musician)|Bruce Smith]] and [[Lu Edmunds]]. This lineup released ''Happy?'' and all except Lu Edmunds released the album ''9'' in 1989. In 1992, Lydon, Dias and McGeoch were joined by [[Curt Bisquera]] on drums and Gregg Arreguin on rhythm guitar for the album ''That What Is Not''. This album also features the [[Tower of Power]] horns on two songs and Jimmie Wood on harmonica. Lydon, McGeoch and Dias wrote the song \"Criminal\" for the film ''[[Point Break]]''. After this album, in 1993, Lydon put PiL on indefinite hiatus.\n\n===1993\u20132006: Solo album, autobiography and celebrity status===\nIn 1993, Lydon's first autobiography, ''Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs'', was published. Aided by Keith and Kent Zimmerman, and featuring contributions from figures including [[Paul Cook]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Billy Idol]] and [[Don Letts]], the work covered his life up until the collapse of the Sex Pistols. Describing the book, he stated that it \"is as close to the truth as one can get, looking back on events from the inside. All the people in this book were actually there, and this book is as much their point of view as it is mine. This means contradictions and insults have not been edited, and neither have the compliments, if any. I have no time for lies or fantasy, and neither should you. Enjoy or die.\"<ref>Lydon, p. ix.</ref> In December 2005, Lydon told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' that he was working on a second autobiography to cover the PiL years.<ref name=\"q\"/>\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Lydon hosted ''Rotten Day'', a daily syndicated US radio feature written by [[George Gimarc]]. The format of the show was a look back at events in popular music and culture occurring on the particular broadcast calendar date about which Lydon would offer cynical commentary. The show was originally developed as a radio vehicle for Gimarc's book, ''Punk Diary 1970\u201379'', but after bringing Lydon onboard it was expanded to cover notable events from most of the second half of the 20th century.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 1997 Lydon released a solo album on [[Virgin Records]] called ''[[Psycho's Path]]''.

Lydon defended the move by stating that the main reason he accepted the offer was to raise money to reform [[Public Image Ltd]] without a record deal. The advertising campaign proved to be highly successful, with sales of the brand raising 85% in the quarter following, which many in the media attributed to Lydon's presence in the advert.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/feb/03/dairycrestgroup-sexpistols|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Country Life butter soars after Johnny Rotten's star turn|first=David|last=Teather|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132009: Potential Sex Pistols revival===\n[[File:John Lydon - Sex Pistols Live 2008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|John Lydon in 2008]]\n\nAlthough Lydon spent years denying that the Sex Pistols would ever perform together again, the band re-united (with Matlock returning on bass) in the 1990s, and continues to perform occasionally.

In the mid-1970s, Rowley, which had once boasted a population of about 500 in the 1920s, was a beat-up dying community, with rows of empty houses and businesses, and inhabited by only a few dozen prairie-hardened souls. But one night, a few party-happy locals, whose [[liquor]] supply was fast dwindling, decided on a quick solution \u2013 a \"B & E party\" at a boarded-up old saloon.

That earned Clayton the [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] (1992) for \u201ctheoretical astrophysics related to the formation of (chemical) elements in the explosions of stars and to the observable products of these explosions\u201d. Supernovae thereafter became the most important stellar events in astronomy owing to their profoundly radioactive nature.

With his focus on radioactive supernova gas Clayton discovered a new chemical pathway causing carbon dust to condense there by a process that is activated by the radioactivity.<ref name=\"Radioactivity 2011\">\u201cA New Astronomy with Radioactivity: Radiogenic Carbon Chemistry\u201d, ''New Astronomy Reviews'', 55, 155\u201365  (2011)]</ref>\n\nClayton's foundational ideas for five original subfields of astrophysics are detailed in Section 5 below. They are: (1) [[nucleosynthesis]], the assembly within stars of the atomic nuclei of the common [[chemical element]]s by nuclear reactions occurring therein; (2) astronomical detection of [[gamma-ray]] lines emitted by [[radioactive]] atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) mathematical models of the growth over time of the interstellar abundances of radioactive atoms; (4) predictions of the existence of interstellar [[cosmic dust]] grains from individual stars\u2014individual chunks of long-dead stars. He named those [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], each containing isotopically identifiable radioactive atoms of the host stars; (5) predictions of the condensation of solid grains of pure [[carbon]] within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive [[supernova]] gases. Clayton launched these original ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University (England), Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics (Germany), Durham University (England) and Clemson University during an international academic career spanning six decades.\n\nClayton also authored four books for the public: (1) a novel, ''The Joshua Factor'' (1985), is a parable of the origin of mankind utilizing the mystery of solar neutrinos; (2) a science autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'';<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\">{{cite book |first=Donald D|last= Clayton |title=Catch a Falling Star: A Life Discovering Our Universe |year=2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> (3) a mid-career memoir ''The Dark Night Sky'',<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite book|publisher=Quadrangle|location= New York |year=1975|title=The Dark Night Sky: A Personal Adventure in Cosmology|url=https://archive.org/details/darknightskypers0000clay|url-access=registration|first=Donald D|last= Clayton|isbn=0812905857}}</ref> of cultural interest owing to Clayton's conception of it in 1970 as layout for a movie<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|245\u2013249}} with Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]] <ref name=\"clemson.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70CRosselini1.html|title=1970 Clayton and Rosselini in Sardinia|accessdate=27 August 2014|publisher=[[Clemson University]]}}</ref> about growing awareness during a cosmological life (See Personal below); (4)''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' (Cambridge Univ.

Clayton spent much of his early childhood on those farms and has rhapsodized over his love of the farm.<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|1\u20136}} Clayton attended public school in [[Texas]] after his father's new job as co-pilot for [[Braniff Airlines]] moved the family to [[Dallas]] in 1939. His parents purchased a home in the already renowned [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]] school system, providing him excellent education. He  graduated third in his 1953 class of 92 students<ref>Catch a Falling Star op cit , p. 84</ref> from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]]. Becoming the first among his entire Iowa relations to seek post-high-school education, Clayton matriculated at [[Southern Methodist University]] and excelled in physics and mathematics, graduating ''summa cum laude'' in 1956.\n\nAt the urging of his SMU professors, he applied as a physics research student to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), which he attended bearing a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. In the 1957 [[nuclear physics]] course at Caltech Clayton learned from [[William Alfred Fowler]] about a new theory that the chemical elements had been assembled within the stars by nuclear reactions occurring there. He was captivated for life by that idea.<ref name=\"dark\"/>{{rp|112\u2013114}} Clayton completed his Ph.D. Thesis in 1961 on the growth of the abundances of the heavy elements owing to the slow capture of free neutrons (the [[s process]]) by more abundant lighter elements in stars. Clayton and his wife Mary Lou<ref>Note: Mary Lou Clayton was hired by Mathew Sands on the Ford Foundation project for these lectures. Donald Clayton contributed time to help identify the physics vocabulary that Feynman used. See ''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 142</ref> played a small role in producing the celebrated [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]] by converting the taped audio of [[Richard Feynman]]'s lectures to prose. Caltech afforded Clayton the chance to meet and later become a lifelong friend of [[Fred Hoyle]], British cosmologist and creator of the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars. Hoyle exerted strong lifetime influence on Clayton. Clayton's published collaborations with Fowler (1983 Nobel Laureate in Physics) as Fowler's<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&lpg=PT162&pg=PT179 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=S Process and my Journeyman's Rating |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> research student (1957\u201360) and subsequently as Fowler's post-doctoral research associate (1961\u201363) launched Clayton's scientific career.\n\nHe established himself at Caltech as a new worker in the field of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars by calculating the first time-dependent models of both the [[s process]] and the fast neutron-capture chains of the [[r process]] of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and of the nuclear abundance quasiequilibrium that establishes the highly radioactive abundances between silicon and nickel during silicon burning in stars. He came onto the field early, when nucleosynthesis was a vibrant, modern frontier. Citations are in the Nucleosynthesis section below.\n\n==Academic history==\nA historic connection of Clayton's academic career to NASA's Apollo Program arose  arose through establishment by Rice University of its Department of Space Science in 1963. This action by Rice University provided the academic position assumed by Clayton in 1963. Clayton described this good fortune in his autobiography.<ref>p. 159-163, ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> His academic research into five fields of astrophysics championed by him is detailed in section 5 below. Foundational academic positions at Caltech, Rice University and Clemson University were augmented by international breadth: seven-year-long academic affiliations in Cambridge (1967\u20131974) and later in Heidelberg (1976\u201382),<ref>Clayton, p. 178, Chapters 10 and 15 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as by visiting summer positions in Cardiff UK (1976, 1977)<ref>Chap. 15, p.369 of Clayton's autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as sabbatical leaves in Cambridge (1971), Heidelberg (1981) and Durham University UK (1987).<ref>p. 439\u2013442, autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>\n\nFollowing his two-year (1961\u201363) postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech, Clayton was awarded an Assistant Professorship, one of the four founding faculty members in [[Rice University]]'s newly created Department of Space Science (later renamed Space Physics and Astronomy). There he initiated  a graduate-student course explaining nuclear reactions in stars as the mechanism for the creation of the atoms of our chemical elements. His pioneering textbook based on that course (''Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis'', McGraw-Hill 1968) earned ongoing praise. In 2018, 50 years after its first publication, it is still in common usage<ref>University of Chicago Press, reprint edition 1983</ref> in graduate education throughout the world. At Rice Clayton was awarded the newly endowed Andrew Hays Buchanan Professorship of Astrophysics in 1968 and held that endowed professorship for twenty years until responding to the opportunity to guide a new astrophysics program at [[Clemson University]] in 1989. During the 1970s at Rice University Clayton guided Ph.D. theses of many research students who achieved renown, especially [[Stanford E. Woosley]], William Michael Howard, H. C. Goldwire, Richard A. Ward, Michael J. Newman, Eliahu Dwek, Mark Leising and Kurt Liffman. Senior thesis students at Rice University included Bradley S. Meyer and Lucy Ziurys, both of whom forged distinguished careers in the subjects of those senior theses. Historical photos of several students can be seen on Clayton' s photo archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics: Photo List |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> Clayton followed the historic Apollo 11 mission while on holiday with his family in Ireland while traveling to Cambridge UK for his third research summer there.\n\nLetters in  winter 1966 from W.A. Fowler unexpectedly invited Clayton to return to Caltech in order to coauthor a book on [[nucleosynthesis]] with Fowler and Fred Hoyle. In his autobiography Clayton quotes these letters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&pg=PT215 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=Getting the Call |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> He accepted that offer but the book was never written because while he was resident at Caltech Clayton was invited by Fred Hoyle to [[Cambridge University]] (UK) in spring 1967 to advise a research program in nucleosynthesis at Hoyle's newly created [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]]. The award to Clayton of an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellowship (1966\u201368) facilitated leaves of absence from Rice University for this purpose. Clayton exerted that research leadership in Cambridge during 1967-72 by bringing his research students from Rice University with him. That prolific period ended abruptly by Hoyle's unexpected resignation from Cambridge University in 1972.<ref>Fred Hoyle, ''Home is where the wind blows'' (University Science Books, Mill Valley CA 1994) p. 372-376</ref> Clayton was during these years a Visiting Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]]. At Rice University W.D. Arnett, S.E. Woosley, and W.M. Howard published jointly numerous innovative studies with Clayton on the topic of explosive [[supernova]] nucleosynthesis.<ref>W. David Arnett & Donald D. Clayton, \"Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars\", ''Nature'' 227, pp. 780-784 (1970); Woosley, S.E, Arnett, W.D., Clayton, D.D., \"Explosive burning of oxygen and silicon\", ''Astrophys.

Fishman]], and [[Joseph Silk]]). Detection of these gamma-ray lines two decades later provided the decisive proof that [[iron]] had been synthesized explosively in supernovae in the form of radioactive [[nickel]] isotopes rather than as iron itself, which Fowler and Hoyle had both advocated.\n\nDuring (1977\u201384) Clayton resided part-time annually at the [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]] in [[Heidelberg]] as [[Humboldt Prize]] awardee, sponsored by Till Kirsten. Annual academic leaves from Rice University facilitated this. There he joined the [[Meteoritical Society]] seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains\u201d, ''Astrophys.

He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within [[meteorites]];<ref>Clayton, ''Catch a falling star'', op cit, p. 354\u201357, p. 387\u2013395</ref> and he also advanced a related theory that he called ''cosmic chemical memory''<ref>Cosmic chemical memory: a new astronomy (1981 George Darwin Lecture of the RAS), QJRAS 23, 174-212 (1982)</ref> by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, ''stardust''. Stardust became an important component of [[cosmic dust]]. Clayton has described<ref>Chapter 14 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars;<ref>Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust, ''Proceedings Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 18, 637-657 (1988); Astrophys. J. 340, 853-868 (1989)</ref> and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines within nova explosions<ref>Astrophys.

J. 294, 591-598 (1985)</ref> Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic  ''stardust'' bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 [[Leonard Medal]], the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society. Feeling vindicated,<ref>Clayton's own words in ''Catch a falling star'' op cit attest to his sense of vindication over this issue:(1) ''The telephone rings in s-process stardust'', p 400-401; (2)\"Comic battle over the Leonard Medal'', p. 489\u2013491</ref> Clayton exulted in ''Nature'' \"the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories\".<ref>Donald D. Clayton, Nature 404, 329 (2000)</ref>\n\nIn 1989 Clayton accepted a professorship at Clemson University to develop a graduate research program in astrophysics there.<ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', Chap. 18</ref> He began this academic segment (1989\u2013present) by hiring three talented young astrophysicists <ref>Mark Leising, Dieter Hartmann and Bradley S. Meyer: ''Catch a Falling Star'' photo p. 494</ref> to vitalize joint research with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (launched in 1991 after several delays). Its four  instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted to be present in supernova remnants. Clayton had been designated ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment [[OSSE]], one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']], and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Workshop_2012.html |title=Presolar Grain workshop 2012 |publisher=Presolar.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The initial NASA-sponsored workshop at Clemson in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with [[Washington University (St. Louis)]] cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the [[University of Chicago]] and by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, and also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized.\n\nEventually a unique new goal became to assemble from his large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> and to donate the original photographs<ref>[https://photos.aip.org/taxonomy/term/253]</ref> to the Center for the History of Physics<ref>Center for History of Physics is a wing of American Institute of Physics. It can be reached on the web at aip.org and clicking on History Programs</ref> The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovae<ref>Donald Clayton & Bradley S.

In 1989 he resigned to accept an offer from Clemson University in South Carolina to guide the establishment of a research program in astrophysics. Clemson University had launched an effort to move into the top 20 of public universities, and Clayton's hire was part of that plan. He resides with Nancy in historic G. W. Gignilliat House (1898) in [[Seneca, South Carolina]] (pop. 8,000), seven miles from the city of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]]. They jointly have one son who grew up in that house, Andrew, born in 1987 in [[Houston]]. Clayton's three previous children arose from his earlier marriages. A son (Donald Douglas Clayton b.1960, Pasadena CA) lives in Houston and a daughter (Alia Clayton Fisher, b. 1977, Houston) lives with her husband and four children in [[Longmont, Colorado]]. Another son, Devon Clayton (b. 1961 Pasadena), died in 1996 in Seneca SC. Clayton has one brother (d. 1980) and two sisters living in [[Texas]], two of whom were also born in [[Iowa]]. Clayton's mother and father had both been born on family farms in Fontanelle IA to parents <ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 6-9</ref> who had lived their entire lives on Fontanelle farms. Their own parents had immigrated to Iowa near 1850 from England and Germany. Two of Clayton's great grandfathers (Kembery and Clayton) fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (North). Robert M. Clayton fought in Sherman's Army at the battle of Atlanta.<ref>National Archives, Muster Roll, 43rd Company, Army of Ohio Infantry</ref>\n\nWhile at Rice University Clayton was introduced by patron of the arts [[Dominique de Menil]] to Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]], and they jointly conceived of a film about one scientist's deepening realizations during a cosmological life, a sequence of experiences which Clayton proposed <ref>p. 245\u2013249 in ''Catch a Falling Star''. The wiki article on [[Dominique de Menil]] documents the interaction of the de Menils with Rosselini through the Rice University Media Center</ref> to provide for that project. In summer 1970 Clayton spent two weeks in Rome working daily with Rosselini <ref name=\"clemson.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70Clayton.html|title=PHOTO ARCHIVE IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS|publisher=Clemson.edu|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> on that effort, which failed owing to insufficient financial support or to insufficiently theatrical plan.<ref>No documentation exists for this failure, so this conclusion is based on Clayton's memory of it in his autobiography</ref> Clayton's published early memoir ''The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmology''<ref>Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (1975): A book columnist for the ''Washington Post'' wrote on March 21, 1976: \"Altogether more personal (than other books on cosmology that he was reviewing), ''The Dark Night Sky'' alternates cosmology with affable reminiscence. Clayton knows the rapture of astronomy and uses it to shuttle engagingly back and forth between Copernicus, Einstein, Stonehenge, the Milky Way and punts on Cambridge's Cam. A brooding, ecumenical enthusiast, Clayton dreads the vacant interstellar spaces as much as he loves galaxies, Texas, and the maple tree he planted a quarter of a century ago. His is a book of brainy charm\"</ref> laid out his plan for that film.\n\n==Citations of seminal research==\nClayton's research innovations in astrophysics and planetary science lay in five disciplines that have been largely introduced above; but the five sections here provide more details and more complete citations to his work for readers wanting more information. Clayton's own history of each topic as described within his autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonstarcatcher.com|title=Donald D. Clayton|publisher=Claytonstarcatcher.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> is given at the end of each section. The references are to Clayton's noteworthy published papers. Clayton's independent style produced an unusual 120 single-author research papers, a relatively large number for astrophysicists.\n\n===Nuclear physics origin of the chemical elements ([[Nucleosynthesis]])===\nTrained at Caltech as a nuclear physicist by Wm. A. Fowler, Clayton was well positioned to consider interactions of heavy nuclei with neutrons. These were believed by Fowler to govern the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron. Clayton established that theory by calculations of the isotopic abundances of heavier elements produced by neutron irradiation of iron in stars for both the slow neutron capture [[S-process]] and the rapid neutron capture [[R-process]] of heavy-element [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] (processes first defined by [[B2FH|B<sup>2</sup>FH]]<ref>Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle RMP 29, 547 (1957)</ref>). Clayton's two papers in 1961 and 1965 on those topics demonstrated that the solar-system abundances had been created not by a single neutron irradiation but as superpositions of abundance patterns established in presolar stars by differing neutron irradiations.<ref>[Donald D. Clayton,W.A. Fowler, T. Hull & B.Zimmerman\"Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis\" Annals of Physics, 12, 331-408 (1961); Phillip A. Seeger, Donald D. Clayton and W. A. Fowler \"Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture\" Ap. J. Suppl. 11, 121-166 (1965)]</ref> His 1961 calculations of s-process abundance patterns, achieved by mathematical analysis rather than by not-yet-mature digital computation, established Clayton as a nucleosynthesis theorist. They also provided a ''standard model'' for the s process abundance patterns<ref>Clayton published subsequent papers on the mathematical properties of that standard model, each bearing the title ''s-process studies'', followed by a specific subtitle. Those papers and their subtitles were: \"exact solution to a chain having two distinct cross section values\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 192, 501 (1974 with M.J. Newman; \"exact evaluation of an exponential distribution of exposures\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 193, 397 (1974) with R.A. Ward; \"Branching and the time scale\", ''Astrophys. J. Suppl.'' 31, 35 (1976) with R.A. Ward and M. J. Newman; \"Xenon and krypton isotopic abundances\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 224, 1000 (1978) with R. A. Ward; \"s-process studies in the light of new experimental cross section: distribution of neutron fluences and r-process residuals\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 257, 821 (1982) with F. Kaeppeler, H. Beer, K. Wisshak, R.L. Macklin and R. A. Ward</ref> that guided four decades of progress on the s process abundances and on derived characteristics of the r-process abundances. In 1967 Clayton turned to the supernova origin of the abundances of elements that can be created in stars from hydrogen and helium alone. Those so-called ''primary nucleosynthesis'' nuclei having atomic weights between silicon and nickel (A=28-62) are very abundant. To understand their dramatic alternating abundances he tested a new conceptual idea that he named ''nuclear quasiequilibrium during silicon burning''<ref name=\"D. Bodansky. D.D 1968\"/> The quasiequilibrium concept did explain the observed numbers of isotopes in the A=28-62 mass range, which had previously been unsolved.<ref>/ The B<sup>2</sup>FH review \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\" RMP 29, 547 (1957) had little correct to say in explanation of primary nucleosynthesis in this mass region. The highly acclaimed B<sup>2</sup>FH review focussed more on isotopes that can be converted in stars to other isotopes, the so-called ''secondary processes''</ref> Nuclear quasiequilibrium was at that time the grandest advance in theory of primary nucleosynthesis in supernovae since Hoyle's 1954 paper, whose focus it validated. Of extreme importance was its demonstration that supernova silicon burning should become profoundly radioactive because rapid quasiequilibrium between atomic weights A=44-62 is overwhelmingly of radioactive nuclei.<ref>Phys. Rev.Letters 20, 161 (1968); Astrophys. J. 16,299 (1968)</ref> Clayton's recent description in 2016 in terms of a ''secondary supernova machine'' of this important process with B. S. Meyer<ref>Donald D. Clayton & B.S. Meyer, \"The Secondary Supernova Machine: Gravitational Compression, Stored Coulomb Energy, and SNII Displays\", ''New Astronomy Reviews'' 71, 1-8 (2016)</ref> clarified that the intense radioactivity resulted from supernova shock waves forcing excess Coulomb energy into those nuclei.\n\nAbundant radioactivity is widely regarded as Clayton's most important discovery for astronomy because it controls the late luminosity of supernovae. Quasiequilibrium demanded that even the mountain-like abundance peak at iron was synthesized as radioactive nickel parents <sup>56</sup>[[nickel|Ni]] and <sup>57</sup>[[nickel|Ni]] in the supernovae explosions rather than as iron directly<ref>D.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, ''Astrophys. J.'' 155, 75 (1969); S. Woosley, W. Arnett & D. Clayton, ''Astrophys. J. Suppl''. 26, 231\u2013312 (1973). See Radioactive Progenitors  on p. 286\u201387</ref> as Hoyle and Fowler maintained. This discovery ignited Clayton's long and productive focus with radioactive isotopes ejected from supernovae, leading to his predictions of both gamma-ray line astronomy<ref>D.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, ''Astrophys. J.'' 155, 75 (1969); D. Clayton, ''Astrophys. J.'' 188, 155 (1974); D. Clayton, ''Astrophys.

Clayton, ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109 (1978)</ref> Experimental confirmation two decades later of both predictions spurred those new fields of astronomy and brought Clayton high honors. At Rice University a prolific 1970\u201374 with colleagues W. David Arnett, Stanford E. Woosley and W.Michael Howard explored other explosive nucleosynthesis caused by the radially outgoing supernova shock wave.<ref>[Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars, W.D. Arnett & D.D.

Clayton did this by bringing his graduate students at Rice with him to Cambridge. After Hoyle's abrupt 1972 resignation from Cambridge Hoyle made three research visits with Clayton at Rice University.<ref>http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/73HC_Rice.html shows photographs of Hoyle and Clayton at work in Houston.</ref><ref>http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/75letterHC.html</ref> After Clayton's 1989 move to Clemson University, his research with Bradley S. Meyer showed how the uniquely puzzling <sup>48</sup>[[calcium|Ca]] isotope of calcium had become so abundant in the Galaxy<ref>B. S. Meyer & D.D. Clayton, \"48Ca Production in Matter expanding from High Temperature and Density\" ''Astrophys. J.'' 462, 825 (1996); Meyer, Krishnan & Clayton, ''Astrophys. J.

They subsequently explained why the minor <sup>95</sup>[[molybdenum|Mo]] and <sup>97</sup>[[molybdenum|Mo]] isotopes of the element molybdenum had become dominant in supernovae stardust<ref>B.S. Meyer & D. D, Clayton, ''Astrophys.J.'', 540, L49\u201352 (2000)</ref> explaining an experimental riddle in stardust isotopic abundances.\n\nClayton began in 2000 a spirited prose description of isotopic nucleosynthesis<ref>''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' Cambridge University Press 2003</ref> in order to increase its accessibility both to laymen and to scientists conducting isotopic analyses of stardust. Becoming increasingly disappointed at the same time that Hoyle's theory of primary nucleosynthesis in massive stars was being overlooked and forgotten after he fell into science disfavor over his views on interstellar biology, Clayton published two historical papers reestablishing community consciousness of Hoyle's pioneering achievement.<ref>Donald D.Clayton  \"Hoyle\u2019s Equation\" ''Scienc''e 318, 1876\u201377 (2007); Donald D. Clayton \"Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity\" ''New Astronomy Reviews'' 52, 360\u201363 (2008). Younger scientists who never knew Hoyle were overlooking what his 1954 paper had achieved</ref> See chapters 7, 9 and 18 of Clayton's life in ''Catch a Falling Star''.\n\n===Gamma-ray-line astronomy of radioactive nuclei in supernovae===\nClayton, Colgate and Fishman's 1969 prediction that motivated pursuing gamma-ray-line astronomy <ref name=\"Clayton, Colgate 1969\"/> as an empirical test of supernova nucleosynthesis was recognized in the American Astronomical Society Centennial Volume <ref name=\"clemson1\"/> as one of the 50 most influential astrophysics papers of the 20th century. Observational discovery of those gamma rays would later confirm explosive nucleosynthesis theory and cement mankind's understanding of the profoundly radioactive nature of supernovae.  It is  the innovation for which Clayton is best known. His NASA-funded research at Rice University during the 1970s sought after additional nuclear prospects<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\">Donald Clayton, \"Cosmic radioactivity: a gamma-ray search for the origins of atomic nuclei, in ''ESSAYS IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS'', Barnes, Clayton & Schramm, eds., pp. 401\u2013426 (Cambridge University Press, 1982)</ref> for that high-energy spectroscopic astronomy, which is based on the recognizable energies of gamma rays emitted by individual radioactive nuclei that had recently been ejected from supernovae. Today it has blossomed with many observational results after quickly becoming a goal for future space astronomy missions, especially at a time when [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] was being proposed to NASA in 1977 (launched by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] in 1991). Hopes were suddenly raised for a detectable source when in 1987 optical astronomers discovered a nearby supernova called [[SN1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Clayton described those hopes from his 1987 sabbatical-year office at Durham University UK as a mounting excitement generated by observed X-ray emission from its supernova surface.<ref>\"Hard X rays imply more to come\", ''Nature'' 330, 423 (1987)</ref> His research with L-S The augmented understanding of those hard X-rays and their derivation from the radioactivity gamma rays permeating supernova interiors.<ref>[Clayton & The \"Bremmsstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\" (1991) ApJ, 375, 221]</ref> Supernova 1987A gamma-ray-line emission did yield exciting first detections of those gamma-ray lines from <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]]<ref>\"Gamma-ray line emission from SN1987A\", S.M.

Letters, 399, L137 (1992)</ref> (by [[OSSE]] with Clayton a coauthor) thereby establishing this field of astronomy.  [[CGRO]], the space gamma-ray telescope mission that detected several predicted gamma-ray lines, was the second mission of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories program.\n\nIn 1977 at Rice University Clayton had been named ''Co-Investigator'' for the NASA-approved proposal for the [[OSSE]] spectrometer on CGRO, and in 1982 he  summarized physical expectations for several gamma-ray-line emitting young nuclei.<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\"/> Key to the intense supernova radioactivity had been Clayton's 1967 discovery that rapid-silicon-burning was dominated by abundances of radioactive alpha-particle nuclei (those having equal numbers of protons and neutrons<ref>''Phys.

Supernova 1987A ejected 20,000 times the mass of the earth<ref>Donald D.

Those grains reveal the isotopic composition of their parent stars. He named these solids ''stardust'',<ref>Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109 (1978)</ref> postulating thereby a new component of interstellar [[Cosmic dust]].

He described stardust as a ubiquitous component within interstellar dust, a peppering of the interstellar medium. These papers initially encountered such incredulity in the field of cosmochemistry that most were rejected first and published only later;<ref>Chap. 14, \"Falling Stardust\", p. 299\u2013368 , ''Catch a Falling Star'' (iUniverse; New York 2009</ref> nonetheless, Robert Walker and Ernst Zinner at Washington University undertook instrumental development that would prove capable of measuring isotope ratios in such tiny solids.<ref name=\"D.

Chapters 14 and 15 and pages 504\u2013508 in ''Catch a Falling Star''\n\n===Galactic abundance evolution of radioactive nuclei===\nClayton created mathematical tools for calculating the interstellar abundances of radioactive nuclei in the Galaxy. In 1964 he discovered a new method for measuring the age of interstellar nuclei based on the larger than expected observed abundances of stable daughters of radioactive nuclei.<ref>[Donald D. Clayton, \u201cCosmoradiogenic chronologies of nucleosynthesis\u201d, ''Astrophys.

Merging his cosmoradiogenic method with an earlier method based only on the abundances of uranium and thorium themselves<ref>W.A. Fowler and Fred Hoyle, ''Annals of Phys.'' 10, 280(1960)</ref> still did not yield a consistent galactic age, however. Clayton wrote<ref name=\"Mon. Notices Roy 1988\">Nuclear cosmochronology within analytic models of the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood, ''Mon. Notices Roy. Astron. Soc.'', 234, 1\u201336 (1988)</ref> that the discord arose from inadequate treatments of both the history of star formation in the Galaxy and of the rate of infall of pristine metal-free gas onto the young Milky Way, compounded by a prevailing but erroneous technique for computation of the radioactive abundances within interstellar gas. Reasoning that interstellar gas contains a higher concentrations of shorter-lived radioactive nuclei than do the stars, Clayton invented in 1985 new mathematical solutions for the simplified differential equations of galactic abundance evolution that for the first time rendered these relationships understandable,<ref>Donald Clayton, \u201cGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model\u201d, in ''Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis'', W.

J.'', 334, 191\u2013195, (1988)</ref> ending decades of poor reasoning about radioactive abundances. Clayton then calculated an age of 13-15 billion years for the oldest galactic nuclei,<ref name=\"Mon. Notices Roy 1988\"/> which would necessarily approximate the long-sought age of our galaxy. More recently radioactive  cosmochronology has diminished in importance because more precise techniques for determining the age of the Milky Way have been discovered in the cosmic microwave background. Nonetheless, his analytic solutions demonstrated importantly that the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclei in interstellar gas had routinely been underestimated by the factor (k+1), where k is an integer near 2 or 3 that measures the steepness of the rate of decline of the infall of pristine gas onto our growing galactic mass.<ref>[Donald D.

These are called the ''extinct radioactivities'' because none remain on earth today but which did leave clear evidence of their prior existence in meteorites. Solution for a model history for the origin of our solar system that simultaneously fits their residual abundances became the guiding principle for a new discipline that focuses on local ''extra'' nucleosynthesis near the solar interstellar cloud during the billion years preceding solar birth.<ref>[\u201cShort-lived Radioactivities and the Birth of the Sun\u201d, B.S.

J.'', 268, 381-384,1983</ref> that has proven to be essential for understanding the abundances of the extinct radioactivities; namely the time required for isotopic mixing between freshly synthesized atoms ejected from supernovae with distinct physical phases of interstellar gas. He showed that because those time delays allowed more interstellar decay of radioactive nuclei, each phase of interstellar gas contains a distinctly different concentration of each of the extinct radioactive nuclides, whereas the early solar system radioactivities measure only those abundances present in the dense molecular-cloud phase<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: A three-phase mixing model\u201d, D.

Aspects of interstellar-phase mixing are sure to remain important for decades to come while astronomers probe the circumstances of solar birth using accurate meteoritic data revealing the abundances of the extinct radioactive nuclei. Clayton therefore gave emphasis to ''extinct radioactivity'' in the Glossary of his 2003 book on isotopes in the cosmos.<ref>Donald Clayton, ''Handbook of isotopes in the cosmos'', Cambridge University Press 2003), p.285\u2013289</ref> Chapters 16 and 17 of ''Catch a Falling Star''.\n\n===Condensation of carbon solids from oxygen-rich supernova gas===\nIn 1998 Clayton voiced a new idea for supernova chemistry by arguing that radioactive decay causes carbon to condense within oxygen-rich supernova gas. He reached that conclusion after Weihong Liu and Alexander Dalgarno<ref>W. Liu & A. Dalgarno, ''Astrophys. J.'' 454, 472\u201379 (1995)</ref> showed that radioactive decays of <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]] create fast Compton-scattered electrons that would dissociate the CO molecule [e+CO > e'+C+O], thereby preventing the complete oxidation of carbon atoms within young remnants of core-collapse supernovae. Clayton initiated an energetic crusade in 1998<ref>D. D. Clayton, \"Condensing carbon SUNOCONs when O>C\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 29 (1998); D Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science'' 283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); W Liu & D Clayton, \"Condensation of carbon in supernovae: 1. Basic Chemistry\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999), and D. Clayton & W. Liu \"Condensation of Carbon in Supernovae 2. Graphite in meteorites\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 30 (1999)</ref> demonstrating that the vast reservoir of carbon in core-collapse supernovae must condense as carbon dust despite being bathed in more-abundant oxygen gas. This idea met skepticism from meteoriiticists and cosmochemists because it contradicted a commonly accepted rule of thumb that held that the abundance of carbon must exceed that of oxygen (written C>O) in order for carbon to condense. Clayton advocated that supernova carbon stardust (which in 1977 he had named<ref>Donald D. Clayton, \"Precondensed matter: Key to the early solar system\", ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109(1978)</ref> ''SUNOCONs'', an acronym for SUperNOva CONdensates) could therefore assemble within hot supernova C+O gases containing more oxygen than carbon and nothing else. Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed  doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules\u2014an expectation that holds true in ordinary stars. Clayton asserted that this incorrect chemical rule-of-thumb was erroneously biasing interpretive studies of carbon SUNOCONs (primarily SiC grains and graphite grains). With Lih-Sin The at Clemson he computed the large density of energetic electrons produced by scattering of gamma rays <ref>D.D. Clayton and L.S. The, ''Astrophys J.'', \"Bremmstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\", ''Ap.J.'' 375, 221-38 (1991)</ref> emitted by radioactive cobalt. Those continuously replenish the abundance of free carbon atoms in the supernova gas by breaking apart the abundant CO molecules.

He was awarded many supporting fellowships: [[National Science Foundation]] Predoctoral Fellow (1956\u201358); [[Alfred P.

Clayton spent much of his early childhood on those farms and has rhapsodized over his love of the farm.<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|1\u20136}} Clayton attended public school in [[Texas]] after his father's new job as co-pilot for [[Braniff Airlines]] moved the family to [[Dallas]] in 1939. His parents purchased a home in the already renowned [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]] school system, providing him excellent education. He  graduated third in his 1953 class of 92 students<ref>Catch a Falling Star op cit , p. 84</ref> from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]]. Becoming the first among his entire Iowa relations to seek post-high-school education, Clayton matriculated at [[Southern Methodist University]] and excelled in physics and mathematics, graduating ''summa cum laude'' in 1956.\n\nAt the urging of his SMU professors, he applied as a physics research student to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), which he attended bearing a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. In the 1957 [[nuclear physics]] course at Caltech Clayton learned from [[William Alfred Fowler]] about a new theory that the chemical elements had been assembled within the stars by nuclear reactions occurring there. He was captivated for life by that idea.<ref name=\"dark\"/>{{rp|112\u2013114}} Clayton completed his Ph.D. Thesis in 1961 on the growth of the abundances of the heavy elements owing to the slow capture of free neutrons (the [[s process]]) by more abundant lighter elements in stars. Clayton and his wife Mary Lou<ref>Note: Mary Lou Clayton was hired by Mathew Sands on the Ford Foundation project for these lectures. Donald Clayton contributed time to help identify the physics vocabulary that Feynman used. See ''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 142</ref> played a small role in producing the celebrated [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]] by converting the taped audio of [[Richard Feynman]]'s lectures to prose. Caltech afforded Clayton the chance to meet and later become a lifelong friend of [[Fred Hoyle]], British cosmologist and creator of the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars. Hoyle exerted strong lifetime influence on Clayton. Clayton's published collaborations with Fowler (1983 Nobel Laureate in Physics) as Fowler's<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&lpg=PT162&pg=PT179 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=S Process and my Journeyman's Rating |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> research student (1957\u201360) and subsequently as Fowler's post-doctoral research associate (1961\u201363) launched Clayton's scientific career.\n\nHe established himself at Caltech as a new worker in the field of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars by calculating the first time-dependent models of both the [[s process]] and the fast neutron-capture chains of the [[r process]] of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and of the nuclear abundance quasiequilibrium that establishes the highly radioactive abundances between silicon and nickel during silicon burning in stars. He came onto the field early, when nucleosynthesis was a vibrant, modern frontier. Citations are in the Nucleosynthesis section below.\n\n==Academic history==\nA historic connection of Clayton's academic career to NASA's Apollo Program arose  arose through establishment by Rice University of its Department of Space Science in 1963. This action by Rice University provided the academic position assumed by Clayton in 1963. Clayton described this good fortune in his autobiography<ref>p. 159-163, ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>. His academic research into five fields of astrophysics championed by him is detailed in section 5 below. Foundational academic positions at Caltech, Rice University and Clemson University were augmented by international breadth: seven-year-long academic affiliations in Cambridge (1967\u20131974) and later in Heidelberg (1976\u201382),<ref>Clayton, p. 178, Chapters 10 and 15 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as by visiting summer positions in Cardiff UK (1976, 1977)<ref>Chap. 15, p.369 of Clayton's autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as sabbatical leaves in Cambridge (1971), Heidelberg (1981) and Durham University UK (1987).<ref>p. 439\u2013442, autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>\n\nFollowing his two-year (1961\u201363) postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech, Clayton was awarded an Assistant Professorship, one of the four founding faculty members in [[Rice University]]'s newly created Department of Space Science (later renamed Space Physics and Astronomy). There he initiated  a graduate-student course explaining nuclear reactions in stars as the mechanism for the creation of the atoms of our chemical elements. His pioneering textbook based on that course (''Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis'', McGraw-Hill 1968) earned ongoing praise. In 2018, 50 years after its first publication, it is still in common usage<ref>University of Chicago Press, reprint edition 1983</ref> in graduate education throughout the world. At Rice Clayton was awarded the newly endowed Andrew Hays Buchanan Professorship of Astrophysics in 1968 and held that endowed professorship for twenty years until responding to the opportunity to guide a new astrophysics program at [[Clemson University]] in 1989. During the 1970s at Rice University Clayton guided Ph.D. theses of many research students who achieved renown, especially [[Stanford E. Woosley]], William Michael Howard, H. C. Goldwire, Richard A. Ward, Michael J. Newman, Eliahu Dwek, Mark Leising and Kurt Liffman. Senior thesis students at Rice University included Bradley S. Meyer and Lucy Ziurys, both of whom forged distinguished careers in the subjects of those senior theses. Historical photos of several students can be seen on Clayton' s photo archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics: Photo List |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref>. Clayton followed the historic Apollo 11 mission while on holiday with his family in Ireland while traveling to Cambridge UK for his third research summer there.\n\nLetters in  winter 1966 from W.A. Fowler unexpectedly invited Clayton to return to Caltech in order to coauthor a book on [[nucleosynthesis]] with Fowler and Fred Hoyle. In his autobiography Clayton quotes these letters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&pg=PT215 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=Getting the Call |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> He accepted that offer but the book was never written because while he was resident at Caltech Clayton was invited by Fred Hoyle to [[Cambridge University]] (UK) in spring 1967 to advise a research program in nucleosynthesis at Hoyle's newly created [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]]. The award to Clayton of an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellowship (1966\u201368) facilitated leaves of absence from Rice University for this purpose. Clayton exerted that research leadership in Cambridge during 1967-72 by bringing his research students from Rice University with him. That prolific period ended abruptly by Hoyle's unexpected resignation from Cambridge University in 1972.<ref>Fred Hoyle, ''Home is where the wind blows'' (University Science Books, Mill Valley CA 1994) p. 372-376</ref> Clayton was during these years a Visiting Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]]. At Rice University W.D. Arnett, S.E. Woosley, and W.M. Howard published jointly numerous innovative studies with Clayton on the topic of explosive [[supernova]] nucleosynthesis.<ref>W. David Arnett & Donald D. Clayton, \"Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars\", ''Nature'' 227, pp. 780-784 (1970); Woosley, S.E, Arnett, W.D., Clayton, D.D., \"Explosive burning of oxygen and silicon\", ''Astrophys. Journal'' Supplement 26, 231\u2013312 (1973)</ref> During his Cambridge years, Clayton proposed<ref>Clayton, S. Colgate and G. Fishman, Astrophysical Journal 155, 75 (1969); Clayton and J. Silk, ''Astrophysical Journal'' 158, L43 (1969)</ref> radioactive gamma-ray-emitting nuclei as nucleosynthesis sources for the field of [[gamma-ray astronomy]] of line transitions from radioactive nuclei with coauthors  ([[Stirling Colgate]], [[Gerald J. Fishman]], and [[Joseph Silk]]). Detection of these gamma-ray lines two decades later provided the decisive proof that [[iron]] had been synthesized explosively in supernovae in the form of radioactive [[nickel]] isotopes rather than as iron itself, which Fowler and Hoyle had both advocated.\n\nDuring (1977\u201384) Clayton resided part-time annually at the [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]] in [[Heidelberg]] as [[Humboldt Prize]] awardee, sponsored by Till Kirsten. Annual academic leaves from Rice University facilitated this. There he joined the [[Meteoritical Society]] seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains\u201d, ''Astrophys. J.'', 199, 765\u201369, (1975); \u201c22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar\u201d, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975); \u201cCosmoradiogenic ghosts and the origin of Ca-Al-rich inclusions\u201d, Earth and Planetary Sci.

He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within [[meteorites]];<ref>Clayton, ''Catch a falling star'', op cit, p. 354\u201357, p. 387\u2013395</ref> and he also advanced a related theory that he called ''cosmic chemical memory''<ref>Cosmic chemical memory: a new astronomy (1981 George Darwin Lecture of the RAS), QJRAS 23, 174-212 (1982)</ref> by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, ''stardust''. Stardust became an important component of [[cosmic dust]]. Clayton has described<ref>Chapter 14 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars;<ref>Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust, ''Proceedings Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 18, 637-657 (1988); Astrophys. J. 340, 853-868 (1989)</ref> and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines within nova explosions<ref>Astrophys. J. 323, 159-169 (1987)</ref> and of the angular distribution of gamma ray lines from radioactive <sup>26</sup>[[aluminum|Al]]  in the galaxy.<ref>Astrophys. J. 294, 591-598 (1985)</ref> Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic  ''stardust'' bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 [[Leonard Medal]], the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society. Feeling vindicated,<ref>Clayton's own words in ''Catch a falling star'' op cit attest to his sense of vindication over this issue:(1) ''The telephone rings in s-process stardust'', p 400-401; (2)\"Comic battle over the Leonard Medal'', p. 489\u2013491</ref> Clayton exulted in ''Nature'' \"the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories\".<ref>Donald D. Clayton, Nature 404, 329 (2000)</ref>\n\nIn 1989 Clayton accepted a professorship at Clemson University to develop a graduate research program in astrophysics there.<ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', Chap. 18</ref> He began this academic segment (1989\u2013present) by hiring three talented young astrophysicists <ref>Mark Leising, Dieter Hartmann and Bradley S. Meyer: ''Catch a Falling Star'' photo p. 494</ref> to vitalize joint research with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (launched in 1991 after several delays). Its four  instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted to be present in supernova remnants. Clayton had been designated ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment [[OSSE]], one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']], and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Workshop_2012.html |title=Presolar Grain workshop 2012 |publisher=Presolar.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The initial NASA-sponsored workshop at Clemson in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with [[Washington University (St. Louis)]] cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the [[University of Chicago]] and by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, and also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized.\n\nEventually a unique new goal became to assemble from his large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> and to donate the original photographs<ref>[https://photos.aip.org/taxonomy/term/253]</ref> to the Center for the History of Physics<ref>Center for History of Physics is a wing of American Institute of Physics. It can be reached on the web at aip.org and clicking on History Programs</ref> The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovae<ref>Donald Clayton & Bradley S.

In 1989 he resigned to accept an offer from Clemson University in South Carolina to guide the establishment of a research program in astrophysics. Clemson University had launched an effort to move into the top 20 of public universities, and Clayton's hire was part of that plan. He resides with Nancy in historic G. W. Gignilliat House (1898) in [[Seneca, South Carolina]] (pop. 8,000), seven miles from the city of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]]. They jointly have one son who grew up in that house, Andrew, born in 1987 in [[Houston]]. Clayton's three previous children arose from his earlier marriages. A son (Donald Douglas Clayton b.1960, Pasadena CA) lives in Houston and a daughter (Alia Clayton Fisher, b. 1977, Houston) lives with her husband and four children in [[Longmont, Colorado]]. Another son, Devon Clayton (b. 1961 Pasadena), died in 1996 in Seneca SC. Clayton has one brother (d. 1980) and two sisters living in [[Texas]], two of whom were also born in [[Iowa]]. Clayton's mother and father had both been born on family farms in Fontanelle IA to parents <ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 6-9</ref> who had lived their entire lives on Fontanelle farms. Their own parents had immigrated to Iowa near 1850 from England and Germany. Two of Clayton's great grandfathers (Kembery and Clayton) fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (North). Robert M. Clayton fought in Sherman's Army at the battle of Atlanta.<ref>National Archives, Muster Roll, 43rd Company, Army of Ohio Infantry</ref>\n\nWhile at Rice University Clayton was introduced by patron of the arts [[Dominique de Menil]] to Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]], and they jointly conceived of a film about one scientist's deepening realizations during a cosmological life, a sequence of experiences which Clayton proposed <ref>p. 245\u2013249 in ''Catch a Falling Star''. The wiki article on [[Dominique de Menil]] documents the interaction of the de Menils with Rosselini through the Rice University Media Center</ref> to provide for that project. In summer 1970 Clayton spent two weeks in Rome working daily with Rosselini <ref name=\"clemson.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70Clayton.html|title=PHOTO ARCHIVE IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS|publisher=Clemson.edu|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> on that effort, which failed owing to insufficient financial support or to insufficiently theatrical plan.<ref>No documentation exists for this failure, so this conclusion is based on Clayton's memory of it in his autobiography</ref> Clayton's published early memoir ''The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmology''<ref>Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (1975): A book columnist for the ''Washington Post'' wrote on March 21, 1976: \"Altogether more personal (than other books on cosmology that he was reviewing), ''The Dark Night Sky'' alternates cosmology with affable reminiscence. Clayton knows the rapture of astronomy and uses it to shuttle engagingly back and forth between Copernicus, Einstein, Stonehenge, the Milky Way and punts on Cambridge's Cam. A brooding, ecumenical enthusiast, Clayton dreads the vacant interstellar spaces as much as he loves galaxies, Texas, and the maple tree he planted a quarter of a century ago. His is a book of brainy charm\"</ref> laid out his plan for that film.\n\n==Citations of seminal research==\nClayton's research innovations in astrophysics and planetary science lay in five disciplines that have been largely introduced above; but the five sections here provide more details and more complete citations to his work for readers wanting more information. Clayton's own history of each topic as described within his autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonstarcatcher.com|title=Donald D. Clayton|publisher=Claytonstarcatcher.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> is given at the end of each section. The references are to Clayton's noteworthy published papers. Clayton's independent style produced an unusual 120 single-author research papers, a relatively large number for astrophysicists.\n\n===Nuclear physics origin of the chemical elements ([[Nucleosynthesis]])===\nTrained at Caltech as a nuclear physicist by Wm. A. Fowler, Clayton was well positioned to consider interactions of heavy nuclei with neutrons. These were believed by Fowler to govern the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron. Clayton established that theory by calculations of the isotopic abundances of heavier elements produced by neutron irradiation of iron in stars for both the slow neutron capture [[S-process]] and the rapid neutron capture [[R-process]] of heavy-element [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] (processes first defined by [[B2FH|B<sup>2</sup>FH]]<ref>Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle RMP 29, 547 (1957)</ref>). Clayton's two papers in 1961 and 1965 on those topics demonstrated that the solar-system abundances had been created not by a single neutron irradiation but as superpositions of abundance patterns established in presolar stars by differing neutron irradiations.<ref>[Donald D. Clayton,W.A. Fowler, T. Hull & B.Zimmerman\"Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis\" Annals of Physics, 12, 331-408 (1961); Phillip A. Seeger, Donald D. Clayton and W. A. Fowler \"Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture\" Ap. J. Suppl. 11, 121-166 (1965)]</ref> His 1961 calculations of s-process abundance patterns, achieved by mathematical analysis rather than by not-yet-mature digital computation, established Clayton as a nucleosynthesis theorist. They also provided a ''standard model'' for the s process abundance patterns<ref>Clayton published subsequent papers on the mathematical properties of that standard model, each bearing the title ''s-process studies'', followed by a specific subtitle. Those papers and their subtitles were: \"exact solution to a chain having two distinct cross section values\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 192, 501 (1974 with M.J. Newman; \"exact evaluation of an exponential distribution of exposures\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 193, 397 (1974) with R.A. Ward; \"Branching and the time scale\", ''Astrophys. J. Suppl.'' 31, 35 (1976) with R.A. Ward and M. J. Newman; \"Xenon and krypton isotopic abundances\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 224, 1000 (1978) with R. A. Ward; \"s-process studies in the light of new experimental cross section: distribution of neutron fluences and r-process residuals\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 257, 821 (1982) with F. Kaeppeler, H. Beer, K. Wisshak, R.L. Macklin and R. A. Ward</ref> that guided four decades of progress on the s process abundances and on derived characteristics of the r-process abundances. In 1967 Clayton turned to the supernova origin of the abundances of elements that can be created in stars from hydrogen and helium alone. Those so-called ''primary nucleosynthesis'' nuclei having atomic weights between silicon and nickel (A=28-62) are very abundant. To understand their dramatic alternating abundances he tested a new conceptual idea that he named ''nuclear quasiequilibrium during silicon burning''<ref name=\"D. Bodansky. D.D 1968\"/> The quasiequilibrium concept did explain the observed numbers of isotopes in the A=28-62 mass range, which had previously been unsolved.<ref>/ The B<sup>2</sup>FH review \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\" RMP 29, 547 (1957) had little correct to say in explanation of primary nucleosynthesis in this mass region.

Observational discovery of those gamma rays would later confirm explosive nucleosynthesis theory and cement mankind's understanding of the profoundly radioactive nature of supernovae.  It is  the innovation for which Clayton is best known. His NASA-funded research at Rice University during the 1970s sought after additional nuclear prospects<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\">Donald Clayton, \"Cosmic radioactivity: a gamma-ray search for the origins of atomic nuclei, in ''ESSAYS IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS'', Barnes, Clayton & Schramm, eds., pp. 401\u2013426 (Cambridge University Press, 1982)</ref> for that high-energy spectroscopic astronomy, which is based on the recognizable energies of gamma rays emitted by individual radioactive nuclei that had recently been ejected from supernovae. Today it has blossomed with many observational results after quickly becoming a goal for future space astronomy missions, especially at a time when [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] was being proposed to NASA in 1977 (launched by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] in 1991). Hopes were suddenly raised for a detectable source when in 1987 optical astronomers discovered a nearby supernova called [[SN1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].

In 1964 he discovered a new method for measuring the age of interstellar nuclei based on the larger than expected observed abundances of stable daughters of radioactive nuclei.<ref>[Donald D.

Reasoning that interstellar gas contains a higher concentrations of shorter-lived radioactive nuclei than do the stars, Clayton invented in 1985 new mathematical solutions for the simplified differential equations of galactic abundance evolution that for the first time rendered these relationships understandable,<ref>Donald Clayton, \u201cGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model\u201d, in ''Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis'', W.

Clayton then calculated an age of 13-15 billion years for the oldest galactic nuclei,<ref name=\"Mon. Notices Roy 1988\"/> which would necessarily approximate the long-sought age of our galaxy. More recently radioactive  cosmochronology has diminished in importance because more precise techniques for determining the age of the Milky Way have been discovered in the cosmic microwave background. Nonetheless, his analytic solutions demonstrated importantly that the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclei in interstellar gas had routinely been underestimated by the factor (k+1), where k is an integer near 2 or 3 that measures the steepness of the rate of decline of the infall of pristine gas onto our growing galactic mass.<ref>[Donald D.

These are called the ''extinct radioactivities'' because none remain on earth today but which did leave clear evidence of their prior existence in meteorites. Solution for a model history for the origin of our solar system that simultaneously fits their residual abundances became the guiding principle for a new discipline that focuses on local ''extra'' nucleosynthesis near the solar interstellar cloud during the billion years preceding solar birth.<ref>[\u201cShort-lived Radioactivities and the Birth of the Sun\u201d, B.S.

Aspects of interstellar-phase mixing are sure to remain important for decades to come while astronomers probe the circumstances of solar birth using accurate meteoritic data revealing the abundances of the extinct radioactive nuclei.

He reached that conclusion after Weihong Liu and Alexander Dalgarno<ref>W. Liu & A. Dalgarno, ''Astrophys. J.'' 454, 472\u201379 (1995)</ref> showed that radioactive decays of <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]] create fast Compton-scattered electrons that would dissociate the CO molecule [e+CO > e'+C+O], thereby preventing the complete oxidation of carbon atoms within young remnants of core-collapse supernovae. Clayton initiated an energetic crusade in 1998<ref>D. D. Clayton, \"Condensing carbon SUNOCONs when O>C\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 29 (1998); D Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science'' 283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); W Liu & D Clayton, \"Condensation of carbon in supernovae: 1. Basic Chemistry\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999), and D. Clayton & W. Liu \"Condensation of Carbon in Supernovae 2. Graphite in meteorites\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 30 (1999)</ref> demonstrating that the vast reservoir of carbon in core-collapse supernovae must condense as carbon dust despite being bathed in more-abundant oxygen gas. This idea met skepticism from meteoriiticists and cosmochemists because it contradicted a commonly accepted rule of thumb that held that the abundance of carbon must exceed that of oxygen (written C>O) in order for carbon to condense. Clayton advocated that supernova carbon stardust (which in 1977 he had named<ref>Donald D. Clayton, \"Precondensed matter: Key to the early solar system\", ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109(1978)</ref> ''SUNOCONs'', an acronym for SUperNOva CONdensates) could therefore assemble within hot supernova C+O gases containing more oxygen than carbon and nothing else. Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed  doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules\u2014an expectation that holds true in ordinary stars. Clayton asserted that this incorrect chemical rule-of-thumb was erroneously biasing interpretive studies of carbon SUNOCONs (primarily SiC grains and graphite grains). With Lih-Sin The at Clemson he computed the large density of energetic electrons produced by scattering of gamma rays <ref>D.D. Clayton and L.S. The, ''Astrophys J.'', \"Bremmstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\", ''Ap.J.'' 375, 221-38 (1991)</ref> emitted by radioactive cobalt. Those continuously replenish the abundance of free carbon atoms in the supernova gas by breaking apart the abundant CO molecules. In the most recent of his papers, Clayton & Meyer (2017) <ref name=\"D.D.Clayton 2017\">D.D.Clayton & B. S. Meyer, \"Graphite Grain-Size Spectrum and Molecules from Core-Collapse Supernovae\", ''Geochimica et Cosmochimica Act''a (2017) doi:10.1016/j.gca.2017.06.027</ref> computed every reaction step from hot gas to cold grains during the cooling expansion of the supernova gas. Those quite abundant free carbon atoms enable carbon-chain molecules to maintain their small abundances against constant oxidation and later capture carbon atoms until they become macroscopic grains of carbon.<ref>[DD Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno, \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science''  283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); DD Clayton, E Deneault & BS Meyer ''Astrophysical Journal'' 562, 480\u2013493 (2001); E Deneault, DD Clayton & A Heger, \u201cSupernova Reverse Shocks: SiC growth and isotopic composition\u201d, ''Astrophys.

Clayton, \"A new astronomy with radioactivity: radiogenic carbon chemistry\", New Astronomy Reviews, 55, 155-165 (2011)</ref> advancing new rules for carbon condensation in oxygen-rich supernovae gases. The kinetic-chemical-reaction model underlying all of these works was initially devised with Weihong Liu and Alexander Dalgarno<ref>DD Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno, ''Science'' 283, 1290\u201392 (1999)</ref> and later expanded by Clayton and his colleagues at Clemson.<ref>DD Clayton, E Deneault & BS Meyer, ''Astrophys.

Yu, BS Meyer & DD Clayton, ''Astrophys. J''. 769, 2013\u201319 (2013)</ref> Their works  showed that very large dust grains (micrometers in radius) in comparison with average interstellar-medium dust sizes grow within the expanding oxygen-rich supernova interiors owing to the principle  of ''Population Control''.<ref>[D. D. Clayton, ''New Astronomy Reviews'' 55, 155\u201365  (2011), section 5.5, p. 163]</ref>  According to that principle rapid oxidation actually intensifies growth of large grains of carbon by keeping the population of carbon solids small so that those few can grow large by accreting the continuously replenished free carbon. This topic establishes another new aspect of carbon's uniquely versatile chemistry. Their 2017 paper <ref name=\"D.D.Clayton 2017\"/> also computes the abundances of molecules and of Buckminsterfullerene grains ejected along with the graphite grains.

The character made his debut in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', where he appeared as part of the game's [[framing device]] as the [[unreliable narrator]] of its plot. He also serves as a [[Party (role playing games)|party]] member, a role which he reprises in its sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''. In-universe, he is a renowned novelist as well as a self-appointed [[celebrity biographer|biographer]] to Hawke and the Inquisitor, the protagonists of ''Dragon Age II'' and ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' respectively. [[Brian Bloom]] provides the voice for Varric in all media.\n\nVarric has consistently received a positive reception since his debut, with attention drawn to his sense of [[humour]], loyalty, and wisecracking personality. The character's popularity have led BioWare to turn his most notable in-universe work, ''Hard in Hightown'', into a real-world publication. Varric is listed as the first author; the actual novel is written by Mary Kirby, a BioWare employee who is one of the main writers of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box |width = 25em |align = right |quote = \"But additionally, some characters, Varric's a very good character because one of 'Varric's primary motivations is he's the guy that\u2019s got your back. He's your friend. He\u2019s a very good character to have because it's good to have someone in your camp no matter what. That makes him a very attractive character. It makes him an interesting character to have because he offers a nice counterpoint to a lot of other kinds of characters. |source = \u2014Mike Darrah on Varric's personality.<ref name=\"Darrah interview\"/>}}\n\nVarric is a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] from House Tethras, a dwarven noble house which was exiled in disgrace to the surface world from their subterranean homeland, the kingdom of Orzammar, generations prior to the events of ''Dragon Age II''. He is depicted as wielding considerable [[de facto]] political power by virtue of economic assets derived from his family's involvement in trade and commerce. He is considered a merchant prince among the surface dwarves of Thedas, the setting in which the ''Dragon Age'' franchise take place, and has a reputation for being the best dressed man in Kirkwall's Lowtown.<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n \nVarric claims he runs a \"[[espionage|spy network]]\" with contacts to deal with various troubles that come along with being in a family that is part of the Dwarven Merchants Guild, although he has little interest in their agenda and schemes; he maintains an outward facade as the idle younger scion of his family; while his older brother is in charge of the family business, he usually spends his time in taverns spinning wild stories to the local gamblers and thieves while people buy him drinks. On occasion, his storytelling act is also a cover of him to rob his audience blind.<ref name=\"Kits\"/> Varric is also an accomplished author renowned throughout Thedas; his most notable work is ''Hard in Hightown'', which features the clash between a secretive group of agents of the Chantry's leader Divine with a mysterious organization known as the Executors over a mysterious artifact, with a member of the Kirkwall City Guard, Donnen Brennokovic, caught between the fronts.<ref name=\"Hightown\"/>  \n\nVarric is the only companion member to be a permanent fixture in both ''Dragon Age II'' and ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''; the player will never encounter crisis points with Varric or risk him leaving the party due to his central role in the games' storylines. His loyalty to the player characters of both games is noted by Mike Darrah as a defining character trait.<ref name=\"Darrah interview\"/> His signature weapon is a [[repeating crossbow]] he named Bianca. Bianca has a carved wood stock and brass embellishments, as well as a retractable [[bayonet]] that slides out of a slot in the front. As such, Varric is the only companion who cannot equip alternative ranged weapons in the ''Dragon Age'' series besides his crossbow, which could be upgraded throughout the course of the games. Whenever he is asked about the story behind how Bianca got her name, he replies that it involves a girl and a promise, and that it is the one story that he can never tell.\n\nIn ''Dragon Age II'', Varric is depicted as constantly spinning exaggerated stories about Hawke's heroic deeds. Solving problems and gaining an advantage through diplomacy, lying, and blackmail impresses him, whereas he finds straightforward violence and outright thuggery to be distasteful. He also responds well to irreverent humor and sarcasm. The events of ''Dragon Age II'' evoke his compassion and selflessness, revealing Varric to be a goodhearted person who appreciates kind and thoughtful acts, and who is determined to rebuild Kirkwall after being elected as Viscount following his adventures in ''Inquisition''.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>   \n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Brian Bloom.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=A cropped image of Brian Bloom, Varric Tethras's voice actor|[[Brian Bloom]], the voice of Varric.]]\nVarric was originally written as a sleazy and untrustworthy character. The development team later decided to add a companion who would stand up for the protagonist of ''Dragon Age II'' given all the opposing personalities in the party, and Varric eased into the place.<ref name=\"Creating\"/> In order to find Varric's voice, Bloom would metaphorically \"gargle glass and [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] and [[sharks teeth]]\".<ref name=\"Varric and Morrigan\"/> \n\nMary Kirby wrote Varric in both games, and is the author of ''Dragon Age: Hard in Hightown''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> She explained in an interview that ''Hard in Hightown'' was conceived as a side project during the development of ''Inquisition'', where the staff would set aside one week every few months to work on creative projects that were related to the ''Dragon Age'' franchise but might not be included as in-game content for ''Inquisition''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> ''Hard in Hightown'' serves as flavor text in the form of in-game codex entries, which are set at a maximum word limit of 500 words.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> Kirby noted that then-Creative Director Mike Laidlaw offered her the opportunity to flesh out and publish ''Hard in Hightown'' as a novel following the conclusion of the development cycle for ''Inquisition'' downloadable content.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> \n\nKirby originally envisioned ''Hard in Hightown'' as a [[buddy cop film|parody of the buddy cop film genre]], but later wrote it as a \"hardboiled detective story\" as she felt that [[film noir]] would better fit Varric\u2019s voice.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> The title of the book references the movie series ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'', whereas other elements within the book's narrative references the ''[[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|Lethal Weapon franchise]]''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> Kirby described ''Hard in Hightown'' as a mystery crime novel with \"more swords\", and that the plot is inspired by a combination of buddy cop films from the 1980's and the works of [[Dashiell Hammett]], in particular [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|''The Maltese Falcon'']].<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> \n\n===Visual Design===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 35em\n| align = right\n| quote = \n\"The famed companion to the Champion of Kirkwall knows a good shirt can sell a story, and the right clothes are every bit as valuable as coin.

Varric's brother, Bartrand, rejected Hawke's request to join his expedition into the Deep Roads. The future Champion is pick-pocketed by a thief whom Varric shoots and pins to a wall using Bianca. Returning Hawke's money, Varric, having heard of Hawke's reputation for skill, competence and reliability, offers them a place on the excavation as an investor. Tagging along to help Hawke gain the necessary money, Varric requests that Hawke speak to him privately in The Hanged Man in Lowtown later. At the Hanged Man, Varric tells Hawke the excavation doesn't have a suitable route to the Deep Roads and requests Hawke get one from a Grey Warden Varric has found in the city. Varric later accompanies both Bartrand and Hawke in The Deep Roads Expedition. They encountered a Primeval Thaig with a lyrium idol within. Bartrand, enamored by the idol, locks both Hawke and Varric in the room where the idol was found and makes off with idol, leaving the other two for dead. Varric is livid over this betrayal and swears to find and kill Bartrand.\n\nHawke and Varric managed to escape the Deep Roads and the treasures they found in their expedition made the two of them extremely wealthy. Bartrand vanished after the Deep Roads expedition, and Varric had to divert his attention from searching for his wayward brother to keeping the now-abandoned family business from falling apart. Varric would then occupy his missing brother's seat in the Dwarven Merchants' Guild, though he rarely attends Guild meetings and is hardly ever seen actually occupying the chair in their hall that belongs to House Tethras. He prefers to run the Tethras financial empire from his suite at the Hanged Man Tavern.\n\nEventually, Varric's spy network discovered Bartrand has returned to Kirkwall and is staying in a mansion in Hightown. Varric enlists Hawke's aid in paying Bartrand a visit, starting the quest Family Matter. Yet when they arrived at the mansion, Varric discovers that Bartrand's guards have turned crazed and hostile. After plowing through all the enemies, Hawke and Varric discover Hugin, the last surviving servant of the household. He revealed that after Bartrand left Varric and Hawke to die in the abandoned thaig, he started hearing voices, claiming the lyrium idol was 'singing' to him. Even after selling it, Bartrand could still hear the idol and was eventually driven mad by it. He tortures the servants by cutting pieces off them to help them 'hear the song'. Bartrand also feeds the guards lyrium, which makes them go insane. Hugin begs Varric and Hawke to give a quick and merciful death to anything still alive in Bartrand\u2019s study. Varric and Hawke's party proceed to fight off Bartrand and his remaining crazed guards. Once Bartrand is defeated, Varric tries to talk to him, but it becomes clear that Bartrand is crazy - he recognizes his brother and requests he help him find the idol again before talking to someone or something in his head. Varric could be persuaded to kill Bartrand, or spare him as his descent into madness is punishment enough.\n\nWhen the conflict between Kirkwall's mage and templar organisations comes to a head following the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry by one of Hawke's companions, the rebel mage Anders, Varric will side with Hawke regardless of which faction the player chooses to support. Varric leaves Kirkwall with Hawke at the end of the game; however, he later returned. [[Cassandra Pentaghast]], a Seeker of the Chantry, travels there to interrogate him on the Chantry's behalf, believing that Hawke is the only hope of stopping the war between the mages and the Chantry. He tells her the Champion's story in full, though he exaggerates on some details. At the end of the interrogation, Varric informs Cassandra that he does not know where Hawke is, though he very much doubts that the Champion is dead. Cassandra thanks him and allows him to leave.\n\nHe later wrote and published a book called ''The Tale of the Champion'', about the rise of his close friend Hawke and their involvement in the Kirkwall Rebellion.\n\n===In ''Dragon Age Inquisition''===\nVarric is brought to the Temple of Sacred Ashes, located near a town called Haven, by Cassandra to provide the Chantry with information on Hawke. An explosion at the temple is triggered by an entity known as the Elder One and his agents, which creates a massive portal in the sky known as the Breach, allowing multitudes of demons to escape from an otherworldly realm called the Fade into the mortal world. The explosion kills thousands, with the sole survivor being the player protagonist. Varric decides to remain to assist the Chantry forces. He later joins the Inquisition along with the protagonist, who is hailed as the Herald of Andraste due to their newfound power to banish demons as well as close the Breach and any similar portals of smaller size known as Fade Rifts.\n\nAfter the Elder One's subsequent attack on Haven forces the Inquisition to move to a fortress known as Skyhold, Varric informs the Herald of Andraste, now known as the Inquisitor, that he knows someone who might be able to help. This contact is none other than Hawke. Cassandra, who is angry that he lied to her about not knowing Hawke's whereabouts, confronts Varric about his duplicity; the player may choose to intervene.\n\nThe Inquisitor may eventually encounter a dwarven woman talking to Varric at Skyhold, discussing a possible lead on Corypheus's source of red lyrium. Eventually revealed as his on-and-off love interest, Bianca Davri, she informs the Inquisitor that the location of Bartrand's Folly has been leaked, and that there are humans carting red lyrium out by the handful though the Valammar entrance. Varric discloses that her knowledge of the thaig came from him; he sent her letters after the Deep Roads Expedition.\n\nThe Inquisitor joins the duo on a mission to seal off the entrance in Valammar. At the end of the mission, the Inquisitor or Varric will come to the conclusion that it was Bianca who leaked the location of the thaig, which will result in a confrontation between the three. She reveals that she went into the ruins herself to study the red lyrium after receiving Varric's letter. If Bartrand was kept alive during the events of ''Dragon Age II'', she will mention him as one of the reasons for going into the ruins, saying she was doing him a favour. If Varric was allowed to keep the fragment of the lyrium idol, that can also be used as a justification as she says that she was trying to help him study it. According to her research, red lyrium is corrupted with the Blight. This proves lyrium to be alive, as the Blight can only taint living things. This research led to her indirectly introducing the Elder One to red lyrium, whom she met while seeking a Grey Warden Mage.\n\nTwo years after the Inquisition's defeat of the Elder One, Varric is elected as the new Viscount of Kirkwall. Varric has been funding numerous reconstruction projects in Kirkwall, and when he publicly complained that the lack of a ruling viscount was interfering with his reconstruction operations, the city state's nobility foisted the crown on Varric since they thought his complaining was \"volunteering\". The nobles feared the responsibility of running the city state, considering the fates of their past leaders, but couldn't leave the throne vacant out of concern that it could facilitate a foreign invasion. Under his rule, Kirkwall finally resumed its place as the major trade hub in the Free Marches. He also wrote a book about the Inquisition called All This Shit Is Weird, from which Cassandra reads excerpts out loud during the credits of the ''Trespasser'' DLC.\n\n===Other appearances===\n====Comics====\nVarric has appeared in a series of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] digital comics set in the ''Dragon Age'' universe. He appears as the central character of ''Dragon Age: Until We Sleep'', and as a supporting character in ''Dragon Age: The Silent Grove'', ''Dragon Age: Those Who Speak'', and ''Dragon Age: Knight Errant''. \n\n====Hard in Hightown====\nVarric is listed as the author of ''Dragon Age: Hard in Hightown'', a novel based on his in-universe work released in July 31, 2018.

The character made his debut in 2011's ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', where he appeared as part of the game's [[framing device]] as the [[unreliable narrator]] of its plot. He also serves as a [[Party (role playing games)|party]] member, a role which he reprises in its sequel, ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''. In-universe, he is a renowned novelist as well as a self-appointed [[celebrity biographer|biographer]] to Hawke and the Inquisitor, the protagonists of ''Dragon Age II'' and ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' respectively. [[Brian Bloom]] provides the voice for Varric in all media.\n\nVarric has consistently received a positive reception since his debut, with attention drawn to his sense of [[humour]], loyalty, and wisecracking personality. The character's popularity have led BioWare to turn his most notable in-universe work, ''Hard in Hightown'', into a real-world publication. Varric is listed as the first author; the actual novel is written by Mary Kirby, a BioWare employee who is one of the main writers of the ''Dragon Age'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\n{{Quote box |width = 25em |align = right |quote = \"But additionally, some characters, Varric's a very good character because one of 'Varric's primary motivations is he's the guy that\u2019s got your back. He's your friend. He\u2019s a very good character to have because it's good to have someone in your camp no matter what. That makes him a very attractive character. It makes him an interesting character to have because he offers a nice counterpoint to a lot of other kinds of characters. |source = \u2014Mike Darrah on Varric's personality.<ref name=\"Darrah interview\"/>}}\n\nVarric is a [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] from House Tethras, a dwarven noble house which was exiled in disgrace to the surface world from their subterranean homeland, the kingdom of Orzammar, generations prior to the events of ''Dragon Age II''. He is depicted as wielding considerable [[de facto]] political power by virtue of economic assets derived from his family's involvement in trade and commerce. He is considered a merchant prince among the surface dwarves of Thedas, the setting in which the ''Dragon Age'' franchise take place, and has a reputation for being the best dressed man in Kirkwall's Lowtown.<ref name=\"Kits\"/>\n \nVarric claims he runs a \"[[espionage|spy network]]\" with contacts to deal with various troubles that come along with being in a family that is part of the Dwarven Merchants Guild, although he has little interest in their agenda and schemes; he maintains an outward facade as the idle younger scion of his family; while his older brother is in charge of the family business, he usually spends his time in taverns spinning wild stories to the local gamblers and thieves while people buy him drinks. On occasion, his storytelling act is also a cover of him to rob his audience blind.<ref name=\"Kits\"/> Varric is also an accomplished author renowned throughout Thedas; his most notable work is ''Hard in Hightown'', which features the clash between a secretive group of agents of the Chantry's leader Divine with a mysterious organization known as the Executors over a mysterious artifact, with a member of the Kirkwall City Guard, Donnen Brennokovic, caught between the fronts.<ref name=\"Hightown\"/>  \n\nVarric is the only companion member to be a permanent fixture in both ''Dragon Age II'' and ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''; the player will never encounter crisis points with Varric or risk him leaving the party due to his central role in the games' storylines. His loyalty to the player characters of both games is noted by Mike Darrah as a defining character trait.<ref name=\"Darrah interview\"/> His signature weapon is a [[repeating crossbow]] he named Bianca. Bianca has a carved wood stock and brass embellishments, as well as a retractable [[bayonet]] that slides out of a slot in the front. As such, Varric is the only companion who cannot equip alternative ranged weapons in the ''Dragon Age'' series besides his crossbow, which could be upgraded throughout the course of the games. Whenever he is asked about the story behind how Bianca got her name, he replies that it involves a girl and a promise, and that it is the one story that he can never tell.\n\nIn ''Dragon Age II'', Varric is depicted as constantly spinning exaggerated stories about Hawke's heroic deeds. Solving problems and gaining an advantage through diplomacy, lying, and blackmail impresses him, whereas he finds straightforward violence and outright thuggery to be distasteful. He also responds well to irreverent humor and sarcasm. The events of ''Dragon Age II'' evoke his compassion and selflessness, revealing Varric to be a goodhearted person who appreciates kind and thoughtful acts, and who is determined to rebuild Kirkwall after being elected as Viscount following his adventures in ''Inquisition''.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>   \n\n==Conception and creation==\n[[File:Brian Bloom.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=A cropped image of Brian Bloom, Varric Tethras's voice actor|[[Brian Bloom]], the voice of Varric.]]\nVarric was originally written as a sleazy and untrustworthy character. The development team later decided to add a companion who would stand up for the protagonist of ''Dragon Age II'' given all the opposing personalities in the party, and Varric eased into the place.<ref name=\"Creating\"/> In order to find Varric's voice, Bloom would metaphorically \"gargle glass and [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] and [[sharks teeth]]\".<ref name=\"Varric and Morrigan\"/> \n\nMary Kirby wrote Varric in both games, and is the author of ''Dragon Age: Hard in Hightown''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> She explained in an interview that ''Hard in Hightown'' was conceived as a side project during the development of ''Inquisition'', where the staff would set aside one week every few months to work on creative projects that were related to the ''Dragon Age'' franchise but might not be included as in-game content for ''Inquisition''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> ''Hard in Hightown'' serves as flavor text in the form of in-game codex entries, which are set at a maximum word limit of 500 words.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> Kirby noted that then-Creative Director Mike Laidlaw offered her the opportunity to flesh out and publish ''Hard in Hightown'' as a novel following the conclusion of the development cycle for ''Inquisition'' downloadable content.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> \n\nKirby originally envisioned ''Hard in Hightown'' as a [[buddy cop film|parody of the buddy cop film genre]], but later wrote it as a \"hardboiled detective story\" as she felt that [[film noir]] would better fit Varric\u2019s voice.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> The title of the book references the movie series ''[[Die Hard (film series)|Die Hard]]'', whereas other elements within the book's narrative references the ''[[Lethal Weapon (franchise)|Lethal Weapon franchise]]''.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> Kirby described ''Hard in Hightown'' as a mystery crime novel with \"more swords\", and that the plot is inspired by a combination of buddy cop films from the 1980's and the works of [[Dashiell Hammet]], in particular [[The Maltese Falcon (novel)|''The Maltese Falcon'']].<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> \n\n===Visual Design===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 35em\n| align = right\n| quote = \n\"The famed companion to the Champion of Kirkwall knows a good shirt can sell a story, and the right clothes are every bit as valuable as coin.

Varric's brother, Bartrand, rejected Hawke's request to join his expedition into the Deep Roads. The future Champion is pick-pocketed by a thief whom Varric shoots and pins to a wall using Bianca. Returning Hawke's money, Varric, having heard of Hawke's reputation for skill, competence and reliability, offers them a place on the excavation as an investor. Tagging along to help Hawke gain the necessary money, Varric requests that Hawke speak to him privately in The Hanged Man in Lowtown later. At the Hanged Man, Varric tells Hawke the excavation doesn't have a suitable route to the Deep Roads and requests Hawke get one from a Grey Warden Varric has found in the city. Varric later accompanies both Bartrand and Hawke in The Deep Roads Expedition. They encountered a Primeval Thaig with a lyrium idol within. Bartrand, enamored by the idol, locks both Hawke and Varric in the room where the idol was found and makes off with idol, leaving the other two for dead. Varric is livid over this betrayal and swears to find and kill Bartrand.\n\nHawke and Varric managed to escape the Deep Roads and the treasures they found in their expedition made the two of them extremely wealthy. Bartrand vanished after the Deep Roads expedition, and Varric had to divert his attention from searching for his wayward brother to keeping the now-abandoned family business from falling apart. Varric would then occupy his missing brother's seat in the Dwarven Merchants' Guild, though he rarely attends Guild meetings and is hardly ever seen actually occupying the chair in their hall that belongs to House Tethras. He prefers to run the Tethras financial empire from his suite at the Hanged Man Tavern.\n\nEventually, Varric's spy network discovered Bartrand has returned to Kirkwall and is staying in a mansion in Hightown. Varric enlists Hawke's aid in paying Bartrand a visit, starting the quest Family Matter. Yet when they arrived at the mansion, Varric discovers that Bartrand's guards have turned crazed and hostile. After plowing through all the enemies, Hawke and Varric discover Hugin, the last surviving servant of the household. He revealed that after Bartrand left Varric and Hawke to die in the abandoned thaig, he started hearing voices, claiming the lyrium idol was 'singing' to him. Even after selling it, Bartrand could still hear the idol and was eventually driven mad by it. He tortures the servants by cutting pieces off them to help them 'hear the song'. Bartrand also feeds the guards lyrium, which makes them go insane. Hugin begs Varric and Hawke to give a quick and merciful death to anything still alive in Bartrand\u2019s study. Varric and Hawke's party proceed to fight off Bartrand and his remaining crazed guards. Once Bartrand is defeated, Varric tries to talk to him, but it becomes clear that Bartrand is crazy - he recognizes his brother and requests he help him find the idol again before talking to someone or something in his head. Varric could be persuaded to kill Bartrand, or spare him as his descent into madness is punishment enough.\n\nWhen the conflict between Kirkwall's mage and templar organisations comes to a head following the destruction of the Kirkwall Chantry by one of Hawke's companions, the rebel mage Anders, Varric will side with Hawke regardless of which faction the player chooses to support. Varric leaves Kirkwall with Hawke at the end of the game; however, he later returned. [[Cassandra Pentaghast]], a Seeker of the Chantry, travels there to interrogate him on the Chantry's behalf, believing that Hawke is the only hope of stopping the war between the mages and the Chantry. He tells her the Champion's story in full, though he exaggerates on some details. At the end of the interrogation, Varric informs Cassandra that he does not know where Hawke is, though he very much doubts that the Champion is dead. Cassandra thanks him and allows him to leave.\n\nHe later wrote and published a book called ''The Tale of the Champion'', about the rise of his close friend Hawke and their involvement in the Kirkwall Rebellion.\n\n===In ''Dragon Age Inquisition''===\nVarric is brought to the Temple of Sacred Ashes, located near a town called Haven, by Cassandra to provide the Chantry with information on Hawke. An explosion at the temple is triggered by an entity known as the Elder One and his agents, which creates a massive portal in the sky known as the Breach, allowing multitudes of demons to escape from an otherworldly realm called the Fade into the mortal world. The explosion kills thousands, with the sole survivor being the player protagonist. Varric decides to remain to assist the Chantry forces. He later joins the Inquisition along with the protagonist, who is hailed as the Herald of Andraste due to their newfound power to banish demons as well as close the Breach and any similar portals of smaller size known as Fade Rifts.\n\nAfter the Elder One's subsequent attack on Haven forces the Inquisition to move to a fortress known as Skyhold, Varric informs the Herald of Andraste, now known as the Inquisitor, that he knows someone who might be able to help. This contact is none other than Hawke. Cassandra, who is angry that he lied to her about not knowing Hawke's whereabouts, confronts Varric about his duplicity; the player may choose to intervene.\n\nThe Inquisitor may eventually encounter a dwarven woman talking to Varric at Skyhold, discussing a possible lead on Corypheus's source of red lyrium. Eventually revealed as his on-and-off love interest, Bianca Davri, she informs the Inquisitor that the location of Bartrand's Folly has been leaked, and that there are humans carting red lyrium out by the handful though the Valammar entrance. Varric discloses that her knowledge of the thaig came from him; he sent her letters after the Deep Roads Expedition.\n\nThe Inquisitor joins the duo on a mission to seal off the entrance in Valammar. At the end of the mission, the Inquisitor or Varric will come to the conclusion that it was Bianca who leaked the location of the thaig, which will result in a confrontation between the three. She reveals that she went into the ruins herself to study the red lyrium after receiving Varric's letter. If Bartrand was kept alive during the events of ''Dragon Age II'', she will mention him as one of the reasons for going into the ruins, saying she was doing him a favour. If Varric was allowed to keep the fragment of the lyrium idol, that can also be used as a justification as she says that she was trying to help him study it. According to her research, red lyrium is corrupted with the Blight. This proves lyrium to be alive, as the Blight can only taint living things. This research led to her indirectly introducing the Elder One to red lyrium, whom she met while seeking a Grey Warden Mage.\n\nTwo years after the Inquisition's defeat of the Elder One, Varric is elected as the new Viscount of Kirkwall. Varric has been funding numerous reconstruction projects in Kirkwall, and when he publicly complained that the lack of a ruling viscount was interfering with his reconstruction operations, the city state's nobility foisted the crown on Varric since they thought his complaining was \"volunteering\". The nobles feared the responsibility of running the city state, considering the fates of their past leaders, but couldn't leave the throne vacant out of concern that it could facilitate a foreign invasion. Under his rule, Kirkwall finally resumed its place as the major trade hub in the Free Marches. He also wrote a book about the Inquisition called All This Shit Is Weird, from which Cassandra reads excerpts out loud during the credits of the ''Trespasser'' DLC.\n\n===Other appearances===\n====Comics====\nVarric has appeared in a series of [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] digital comics set in the ''Dragon Age'' universe. He appears as the central character of ''Dragon Age: Until We Sleep'', and as a supporting character in ''Dragon Age: The Silent Grove'', ''Dragon Age: Those Who Speak'', and ''Dragon Age: Knight Errant''. \n\n====Hard in Hightown====\nVarric is listed as the author of ''Dragon Age: Hard in Hightown'', a novel based on his in-universe work released in July 31, 2018. For the novel, Mary Kirby uses the character as her ''[[nom de plume]]''.<ref name=\"Polygon\"/> Kirby noted that there are \"a lot of dry dwarven observations about Kirkwall society and snide comments about the Merchants\u2019 Guild\" in the story.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> A female version of Hawke is depicted on the cover, and several characters from ''Dragon Age II'', including Hawke's companions, are portrayed in the story though their names are altered; some are cameo appearances, while others are major characters in the narrative.<ref name=\"Kirby interview\"/> BioWare uploaded a video of Brian Bloom reading an excerpt from ''Hard in Hightown'' on their official YouTube channel to promote the novel.<ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEuh8SKLQ7k|title=Hard in Hightown with Brian Bloom|date=July 31, 2018 |publisher=BioWare|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 35em\n| align = right\n| quote = \n\"Who doesn't love a good rogue? There are loads of contenders for this role, but Varric stands out because he's more than a joke machine. He's comfortable on the street and he'll do a dodgy deal to get by, but he does have values. He has a good heart, and he'll tell you straight if he thinks you're making an evil move. The best companions are able to give the player some friction, and I think Varric is the guy for the job.

\"kick-ass crossbow rogue\", Ray Ivey of [[Just Adventure]] notes that Varric's character arc in ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'' \"leads into several interesting directions, including plagiarism, spies

serials\".<ref name=\"Killer Cast\"/> Samuel Roberts from ''PC Gamer'' named Varric as his personal favorite Bioware companion, commenting \"Varric wins out for me because he's the closest your main

{"title_page": "Politics of Greece", "text_new": "{{Politics of Greece}}\n\nThe '''politics of Greece''' takes place in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Government of Greece|government]] and the [[Hellenic Parliament]]. Between the [[Metapolitefsi|restoration of democracy]] in 1974 and the [[Greek government-debt crisis]] the party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]  and the social-democratic [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] \n\nThe [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Greece]], which describes [[Greece]] as a \"presidential parliamentary republic\", includes extensive specific guarantees of [[civil liberties]] and vests the powers of the [[head of state]] in a president elected by parliament. The Greek governmental structure is similar to that found in many other Western [[democracy|democracies]], and has been described as a compromise between the French and German models. The prime minister and cabinet play the central role in the political process, while the president perform some executive and legislative functions in addition to ceremonial duties. Voting in Greece is compulsory but is not enforced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout/compulsory-voting|title=Compulsory Voting|last=|first=|date=|website=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe [[Cabinet of Greece]], which is the main organ of the [[Government of Greece|government]], includes the heads of all executive ministries, appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\n=== President ===\n{{Further|President of Greece}}\n\nThe President of the elected by the Parliament for a five-year term (election last held 15 January 2020), and a maximum of two terms in office. When a presidential term expires, Parliament votes to elect the new President. In the first two votes, a {{frac|2|3}} majority (200 votes) is necessary. The third and final vote requires a {{frac|3|5}} (180 votes) majority.\n\nIf the third vote is fruitless, Parliament is dissolved and elections are proclaimed by the outgoing President within the next 30 days. In the new Parliament, the election for President is repeated immediately with a {{frac|3|5}} majority required for the initial vote, an absolute majority for the second one (151 votes) and a simple majority for the third and final one. The system is so designed as to promote consensus presidential candidates among the main political parties.\n\nThe president has the power to [[declare war]], to grant [[pardon]] (forgiveness) and to conclude agreements of peace, alliance, and participation in international organizations; upon the request of the government a simple parliamentary majority is required to confirm such actions, agreements, or treaties. An absolute or a three-fifths majority is required in exceptional cases (for example, the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession into the EU]] needed a {{frac|3|5}} majority).\n\nThe president can also exercise certain emergency powers, which must be countersigned by the appropriate cabinet minister.  The president may not dissolve parliament, dismiss the government, suspend certain articles of the constitution, issue a proclamation or declare a state of siege without countersigning by the prime minister or the appropriate cabinet minister. To call a referendum, he must obtain approval from parliament.\n\n=== Prime minister ===\n{{Further|Prime Minister of Greece}}\n\nThe prime minister is elected by the Parliament and he or she is usually the leader of the party controlling the absolute majority of MPs. According to the Constitution, the prime minister safeguards the unity of the government and directs its activities. He or she is the most powerful person of the Greek political system and recommends ministers to the President for appointment or dismissal.\n\n=== Maintaining the support of parliament ===\nGreek parliamentary politics hinge upon the principle of the \"{{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}}\" (pronounced \"dhedhilom'''e'''ni\"), the \"declared confidence\" of Parliament to the Prime Minister and his/her administration. This means that the President of the Republic is bound to appoint, as Prime Minister, a person who will be approved by a majority of the Parliament's members (i.e. 151 votes). With the current electoral system, it is the leader of the party gaining a plurality of the votes in the Parliamentary elections who gets appointed Prime Minister.\n\nAn administration may at any time seek a \"vote of confidence\". Conversely a number of Members of Parliament may ask that a \"vote of reproach\" be taken. Both are rare occurrences with usually predictable outcomes as voting outside the party line happens very seldom.\n\nOn 4 October 2009, [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party and son and grandson of Prime Ministers, [[2009 Greek legislative election|was elected]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Greece]], following five years of government under [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] leader [[Kostas Karamanlis]], the nephew of long-time Prime Minister and President [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Further|Hellenic Parliament|Elections in Greece}}\n\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 10 Parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Greek Parliament]] building, which was the [[Old Royal Palace]].]]\n\nGreece elects a legislature by universal suffrage of all citizens over the age of 18. The [[Parliament of Greece|Greek Parliament]] (\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of reinforced [[proportional representation]] in 48 multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], 8 single-seat constituencies and a single nationwide list. 288 of the 300 seats are determined by constituency voting, and voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot. The remaining 12 seats are filled from nationwide party lists on a top-down basis and based on the proportion of the total vote each party received.\n\nGreece uses a complex reinforced proportional representation electoral system which discourages splinter parties and makes a parliamentary majority possible even if the leading party falls short of a majority of the popular vote. Under the current electoral law, any single party must receive at least a 3% nationwide vote tally in order to elect Members of Parliament (the so-called \"3% threshold\"). The largest party gets a 50-seat bonus (out of 300 seats) ostensibly to ensure elections return viable governing majorities.\n\nThe law in its current form favors the [[first past the post]] party to achieve an absolute (151 parliamentary seats) majority, provided it receives a 41%+ nationwide vote. This is touted to enhance governmental stability. These electoral laws can be changed by simple parliamentary majority, but a law so changed will not come into effect for two election cycles unless passed by a {{frac|2|3}} majority in the Hellenic Parliament.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main|Judicial system of Greece}}\n[[File:Council of State, Greece, 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|The building of the ''Arsakeion'' in Athens, where the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is seated.]]\n\nIn Greece the judicial branch is divided into civil, and administrative courts. Civil courts judge civil and penal cases, whereas administrative courts judge administrative cases, namely disputes between the citizens and the State.\n\nThe judicial system of Greece comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)]] (\u0386\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2), the [[Council oes of the National School of Judges. The way the judges are gradually promoted, until they become members of the Supreme Courts, is defined by the Constitution and the existing laws. The presidents and the vice-presidents of the three Supreme Courts are chosen by the [[Cabinet of Greece]] among the serving members of each of the Supreme Courts.\n\nThe [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] is the supreme civil and penal court, whereas the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is the supreme administrative court. The [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Chamber of Accounts]] has an [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over certain administrative areas (for example it judges disputes arising from the legislation regulating the pensions of civil servants) and its decisions are irrevocable. This means that they are not judged at second instance by the Council of State.\n\nSometimes, the Supreme Courts take contradictory decisions or they judge differently the constitutionality of a legal provision. These disputes are resolved by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], whose composition and jurisdiction is regulated by the Constitution (article 100). As its name reveals, this court is not permanent and it sits when a special case belonging to its jurisdiction arises. When the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]] sits, it comprises eleven members: the Presidents of the three Supreme Courts, four members of the Court of Cassation and four members of the Council of State.\n\nWhen it judges the constitutionality of a law or resolves the disputes between Supreme Courts, its composition comprises two more members: two professors of the Law Schools of Greece. The Supreme Special Court is the only court which can declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"powerless\" (something like \"null and void\"), while the three Supreme Courts can only declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"inapplicable\" to that particular case. The Supreme Special Court is also the Supreme Electoral Court, judging pleas against the legality of the legislative elections.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{Further|Administrative divisions of Greece}}\n[[File:Kallikratis dioikisi.png|thumb|350px|The [[administrative divisions of Greece]], showing Administrative Regions and Regional Units]]\n\nGreece is divided in [[modern regions of Greece|13 Administrative Regions]] which are further divided into [[regional units of Greece|74 Regional Units]]. The 13 Administrative Regions (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ries) are each headed by a popularly elected Governor (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Periferi\u00e1rhis) and presided over by the popularly elected Regional Council (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Periferiak\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each of the 74 Regional Units (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Periferiak\u00e9s En\u00f3ti\u0331tes) are headed by a Vice Governor (\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Antiperiferi\u00e1rhis), who is taken from the same political party as the elected Governor.\n\nGreece's 74 Regional Units are divided into [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|325 Municipalities]] (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, Dh\u00edmi) which are lead by a popularly elected Mayor (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, Dh\u00edmarhos) and Municipal Council (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Dhimotik\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each Municipality is divided into small Municipal Units (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Dhimotik\u00e9s En\u00f3tites) which in turn contain Municipal Communities (relatively urban communities) and Local Communities (relatively rural communities). Municipal Councils select community members to serve on more local Town Hall Councils which focus on local needs in the Municipality's communities and give local feedback to the Municipal Government.\n\nAlthough Municipalities and villages have elected officials, they often do not have an adequate independent revenue base and must depend on the central government budget for a large part of their financial needs. Consequently, they are subject to numerous central government controls. This also leads to extremely low municipal taxes (usually around 0.2% or less).\n\nGreece also includes one autonomous region, the [[monastery|Monastic]] Community of the Holy Mountain, [[Mount Athos]].\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Greece}}\n\nAs one of the oldest Euro-Atlantic member states in the region of [[Southeast Europe]], Greece enjoys a prominent geopolitical role, due to its political and geographical proximity to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. Its main allies are [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]], United States, the other [[NATO]] countries like [[Albania]], and the [[European Union]].\n\nGreece also maintains strong diplomatic relations with [[Cyprus]], [[Albania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Israel]], while at the same time focuses at improving further the good relations with [[Egypt]] and the [[Arab World]], [[Caucasus]], and [[China]]. As member of both the EU and the [[Union for the Mediterranean]], Greece is a key player in the eastern Mediterranean region and has encouraged the collaboration between neighbors, as well as promoting the [[Energy Triangle]], for gas exports to Europe. Greece also has the largest economy in the [[Balkans]], where it is an important regional investor.\n\nProminent issues in Hellenic foreign policy include the [[Aegean dispute|claims in the Aegean Sea]] and Eastern Mediterranean by [[Turkey]], the Turkish [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|occupation of Cyprus]], and the [[Macedonia naming dispute|dispute over the name]] of [[North Macedonia]]\n\n==Notable politicians of Greece==\n\n===Former===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]\n* [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]\n* [[Spyridon Trikoupis]]\n* [[Andreas Metaxas]]\n* [[Dimitrios Kallergis]]\n* [[Alexandros Koumoundouros]]\n* [[Ioannis Kolettis]]\n* [[Epameinondas Deligiorgis]]\n* [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]\n* [[Theodoros Deligiannis]]\n* [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]]\n* [[Alexandros Zaimis]]\n* [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]]\n* [[Georgios Theotokis]]\n* [[Ioannis Sfakianakis]]\n* [[Stephanos Dragoumis]]\n* [[Ion Dragoumis]]\n* [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]\n* [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ioannis Metaxas]]\n* [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]\n* [[Themistoklis Sofoulis]]\n* [[Nikos Zachariadis]]\n* [[Sofoklis Venizelos]]\n* [[Georgios Papandreou]]\n* [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]\n* [[Grigoris Lambrakis]]\n* [[Ilias Iliou]]\n* [[Alexandros Panagoulis]]\n* [[Alexandros Papagos]]\n* [[Prokopis Pavlopoulos]]\n* [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]]\n* [[Spyros Markezinis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]\n* [[Evangelos Averoff]]\n* [[Leonidas Kyrkos]]\n* [[Andreas Papandreou]]\n* [[Georgios Rallis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Current===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]\n* [[Dora Bakoyannis]]\n* [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]]\n* [[Maria Damanaki]]\n* [[Nikos Dendias]]\n* [[Anna Diamantopoulou]]\n* [[Stavros Dimas]]\n* [[Adonis Georgiades]]\n* [[Pavlos Geroulanos]]\n* [[Kostis Hatzidakis]]\n* [[Kostas Karamanlis]]\n* [[Dimitris Koutsoumpas]]\n* [[Fotis Kouvelis]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Stefanos Manos]]\n* [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]]\n* [[Dimitrios Papadimoulis]]\n* [[George Papandreou]]\n* [[Giannis Ragousis]]\n* [[Katerina Sakellaropoulou]]\n* [[Antonis Samaras]]\n* [[Alexis Tsipras]]\n* [[Stavros Theodorakis]]\n* [[Yanis Varoufakis]]\n* [[Kyriakos Velopoulos]]\n* [[Evangelos Venizelos]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Political issues ==\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in Greece}}\n[[File:Working-class protest in Greece.JPG|thumb|A [[working class]] political protest in Athens, Greece calling for the boycott of a local bookshop after, allegedly, an employee was fired for her political activism]]\n\nUnder the Greek constitution,<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-General\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece].</ref> education is the responsibility of the state. Most Greeks attend public primary and secondary schools. There are a few private schools, which must meet the standard curriculum of and are supervised by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education oversees and directs every aspect of the public education process at all levels, including hiring all teachers and professors and producing all required textbooks.\n\n====Non-state owned universities====\nA recent issue concerning education in Greece is the institutionalisation of private universities. According to the constitution<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-Universities\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece], Section 5:  \"Education at university level shall be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed public law legal persons\".</ref> only state-run universities operate on the land. However, in the recent years many foreign private universities have established branches in Greece, offering [[Bachelor's]] level degrees, thus creating a legal contradiction between the Greek constitution and the EU laws allowing foreign companies to operate anywhere in the Union. Additionally, every year, tens of thousands of Greek students are not accepted to the state-run University system and become \"educational immigrants\" to other countries' Higher Education institutions, where they move to study.\n\nThis has created a chronic problem for Greece, in terms of loss of capital as well as human resources, since many of those students opt to seek employment in the countries they studied, after completing their studies. It is characteristic that in 2006, Greece, with 11.5&nbsp;million inhabitants, was fourth in the world in terms of student export in absolute numbers, with 60,000 students abroad, while the first country in this regard, People's Republic of China of over 1,3&nbsp;billion inhabitants, had 100,000 students abroad. In terms of students abroad as a percent of the general population, Greece is by far the leading country, with 5,250 students per million, compared to second Malaysia's 1,780 students per million inhabitants.\n\nCiting these problems as a result of the state's monopoly on Higher Education, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) committed to amending the constitution, in order to allow private universities to operate in Greece on a non-profit basis. This proposal was rejected by then-ruling [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in the late nineties, and thus could not muster the support necessary to be put to vote on the constitutional amendment of 2001. However, PASOK has since changed its stance, and now also supports a constitutional provision for the creation of private Universities on a non-profit basis. This proposal continues to encounter the fierce opposition of the Left parties and part of the academic community, both professors and students.\n\nAt the outset of 2006, prime minister [[Kostas Karamanlis]] announced the initiative of his government for a new amendment of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]]. According to his assertion one of the main issues of this amendment (the second within less than 10 years) is going to be the creation of \"non-state owned\" universities.\n\n=== Illegal immigration ===\n{{main|Immigration to Greece}}\n\nGreece has  problems with illegal immigration, especially from or via Turkey. Greek authorities believe that 90% of illegal immigrants in the EU enter through Greece, many fleeing because of unrest and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.<ref>{{cite news|title= Tensions Rise Over Illegal Immigrants In Greece |work=[[NPR]]|date=|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/14/139613525/tensions-over-illegal-immigrants-in-greece-rises|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Southern Europe's Immigration Test|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2010-02-18|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1964957_1964954_1964953,00.html|accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\nSeveral European courts have held that Greece is not complying with minimum standards of treatment for asylum seekers, so that illegal migrants who reach other countries cannot be sent back to Greece.<ref>{{cite news|title= On illegal immigration, Greek left, war damages, Klaus Boetig, traffic accidents   |work=[[Ekathimerini]]|date=|url= http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_30/03/2012_435673|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref>\n\nNumerous solutions have been proposed by the Greek government such as building a fence on the Turkish border and setting up detention camps.<ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to Build Border Fence to Deter Illegal Immigrants |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-02-06|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/world/europe/greece-to-build-fence-on-turkish-border-to-curb-illegal-immigrants.html|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to open new detention centres for illegal migrants  |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-03-29|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/29/greece-detention-centres-migrants?newsfeed=true|accessdate=2012-04-01|location=London|first=Helena|last=Smith}}</ref>\n\n=== Judicial system ===\n{{main|Judicial system of Greece}}\nOne of the main problems of the system is the long-time process needed, even for a simple case, something that negatively impacts investment, entrepreneurship, social relations, corporate governance, and public governance.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/163295/article/ekathimerini/comment/the-greek-judicial-system-in-critical-condition The Greek judicial system in critical condition]</ref><ref>[http://bponline.amcham.gr/?p=2828 The Greek Legal Crisis & Reform Of The Greek Legal System]</ref> Also corruption cases have appeared during the last years, such as the ''[[Paradikastiko]]'' organization scandal.<ref>[http://www.koutipandoras.gr/article/premiera-ths-dikhs-toy-paradikastikoy-kyklwmatos-me-fonto-apeilhtika-shmeiwmata-kai-sfaires \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd]</ref>\n\nManipulation of the judicial system and its decisions by each government, is another common phenomenon which violates the independency of the system.\n\n====Prisons====\nThere are three prison types in Greece: general, special, and therapeutic prisons. General prisons include three different types of inmates: type A inmates, type B inmates, and type C inmates. Special prisons include rural units, juvenile institutions, and semi-liberty centers. One example of a special prison would be an Agricultural Prison. The last prison type is a therapeutic prison; which includes hospitals and rehab centers for inmates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisonobservatory.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:prison-conditions-in-greek&catid=13:documents&Itemid=116|title=Prison conditions in Greece|last=|first=|date=July 4, 2014|website=European Prison Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Within these centers the percentage of female prisoners is 5.5%, which amounts to around 538 female prisoners. The percentage of juveniles in Greek prison is 2.9%. Greece\u2019s occupancy rate in prisons is 99%, which means that Greece\u2019s prisons are near full capacity. With some exceptions occupancy exceeds 100%, and in some establishments, it reaches, or surpasses, 300%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisonobservatory.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:prison-conditions-in-greek&catid=13:documents&Itemid=116|title=Prison conditions in Greece|last=|first=|date=July 4, 2014|website=European Prison Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Because of this the Greek Justice Ministry and the European Council want to improve Greek prison conditions. These improvements include training for guards, improving of medical facilities, and better treatment of prisoners. These selected improvements are three human rights that the Greek correctional system would like to tackle.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{main|Media in Greece}}\nThe Greek media, collectively, is a very influential institution \u2013 usually aggressive, sensationalist. As with many countries, most of the media are owned by businesses with commercial interests in other sectors of the economy. There are often accusations of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television channels being used to promote their commercial enterprises as well as to seek political influence.\n\nIn 1994, the [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|Ministry of Press and Media]] was established to deal with media and communication issues. [[Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi|ERT S.A.]], a public corporation supervised by the Minister of Press, operates three national television channels and five national radio channels. The Minister of Press also serves as the primary government spokesperson.\n\nThe Secretary General of Press and Information prepares the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) Bulletin. Along with [[Associated Press|AP]] and [[Reuters]], this is a primary source of information for the Greek press. The Ministry of Press and Information also issues the semi-official Macedonian News Agency (MPE) Bulletin, which is distributed throughout the Balkan region. For international news, [[CNN]] is a particular influence in the Greek market; the major television channels often use it as a source. State and private television stations also use [[European Broadcasting Union|Eurovision]] and [[Visnews]] as sources. While few papers and stations have overseas correspondents, those few correspondents abroad can be very influential.\n\nIn 1988, a new law provided the legal framework for the establishment of private radio stations and, in 1989, private television stations. According to the law, supervision of radio and television is exercised by the National Radio and Television Council. In practice, however, official licensing has been delayed for many years. Because of this, there has been a proliferation of private radio and television stations, as well as European satellite channels, including [[Euronews]]. More than 1,000 radio stations were operating before March 2002, when the government implemented plans to reallocate television frequencies and issue licenses as authorized by the 1993 Media Law, effectively reducing this number.\n\n====Media freedom====\nIn 2011, the government proposed new measures that will restrict the freedom of speech in the internet. According to some proposals, every individual who would like to use free platforms, such like [[Blogspot]] or [[WordPress.com]] will be forced to get officially registered in the courts, as due to tough austerity measures web sites that criticize the government and the political system in general have been multiplied.<ref>[http://www.avgi.gr/ArticleActionshow.action?articleID=634166]</ref>\n\n[[Press freedom]] sharply eroded in Greece during [[Greek government-debt crisis|the economic and financial crisis of 2010\u20132015]], passing from the 35th place in 2009 in [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] to the 99th place in 2014, well below all [[Western Balkans]] countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as [[Gabon]], [[Kuwait]] or [[Liberia]].<ref name=euroscope>Thomas Van Der Heijden, [http://publications.europeintheworld.com/media-landscape-greece-must-reform-quickly-3/ Media landscape in Greece must reform quickly], ''Euroscope'', 28 November 2014</ref> Greece is today the [[EU member state]] \"where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis\".<ref name=OSF>Petros Iosifidis and Dimitris Boucas, [https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/media-policy-independent-journalism-greece-20150511.pdf Media Policy and Independent Journalism in Greece] (PDF), ''[[Open Society Foundation]] report'', 1 May 2015</ref>\n\n=== Military service ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n\nNine months for all males of 18 years of age; Compulsory with fines and imprisonment if denied, but neither fine nor imprisonment has been imposed since 1994, where the last warrant against a draft-dodger was issued. Members of families with three children serve a reduced time of six months. Military service can also be substituted with a longer public service, which by the standards of Amnesty International, ought to be considered punitive as it is twice as long as the regular tour of duty.\n\nLimited steps have been taken to turn the Greek military into a semi-[[professional army]] in the last years, leading to the gradual reduction of the service from 18 to 12 to 9 months and the inclusion of a greater number of professional military personnel in most vertices of the force. Recent developments, though, within the anti-conscription movement in Greece, such as the high{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} death rate from suicides during service and work-related accidents, such as the [[Manitsa]] incident, combined with a high rate of draft-dodging, have advanced the idea that mandatory conscription should be abolished and an all-professional/all-volunteer army should be put in place.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==== Military spending ====\nGreece directs approximately 1.7% of its GDP <!--This most probably refers to direct military spending. \"Indirect\" was mentioned.

For more information see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]. Conversely, the foreign relations of Greece as well as many internal policy decisions are largely affected by its arms purchases. The United States, being the major arms seller to Greece has been known to actively intervene in military spending decisions made by the Greek government.<ref name=\"mil_explanation_sources2\">[https://fas.org/asmp/profiles/greece.htm#Arms%20Sales%20Tables US Arms Clients Profiles \u2013 Greece]: \"The Greek publication Elevtherotipia reported that former Ambassador Nicholas Burns had taken part in attempting to dissuade Greek officials from purchasing the Eurofighter in favor of a U.S. military aircraft.\"</ref> The US has at times actively stepped in to help avoid large scale crisis, as in the case of the [[Imia-Kardak crisis]].\n\nThe reduction of military spending has long been an issue in Greek politics. The former prime minister, [[Kostas Karamanlis]] had proposed a reduction to military spending through a \"Defence Eurozone\",<ref name=\"mil_Karam_expo\">[http://www.hri.org/news/greek/eragr/2003/03-09-13_1.eragr.htmlThe Hellenic Radio (ERA): News in Greek, 03-09-13]</ref> referring to the [[European Security and Defence Policy]]. The previous PASOK administration, also planned on reducing military spending<ref name=\"mil_pasok_2001\">[http://www.hri.org/news/grpapers/typos/2001/01-11-15.typos.html Athens News Agency: Press Review in Greek, 01-11-15]</ref> prior to its failure to be re-elected in 2004, while PASOK politicians usually refer to money saved from reducing military spending as a \"peace dividend\" (\"\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\").<ref name=\"mil_pasok_div\">[http://www.mnec.gr/christ_int_211203.aspx Speech of PASOK former finance minister Nikos Christodoulakis]</ref>\n\nSome of the parties on the left, such as the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and [[Synaspismos]], have been vocal in condemning military spending. Regarding the purchase of 30 [[F-16]] and 333 [[Leopard 2|Leopard tank]]s in 2005, both parties criticized the New Democracy administration for spending money on weapons while doing nothing to relieve the lower classes and said that high military spending \"does not correspond to the real needs of the country but is carried out according to [[NATO]] planning and to serve weapon manufacturers and the countries that host them\".<ref name=\"mil_left\">[http://www.hri.org/news/europe/bbc/2005/05-07-19.bbc.html HR-NET index of BBC broadcasts in Greek, 05-07-19 News]</ref>\n\n=== Church-State relations===\n{{main|Religion in Greece}}\n\nThe [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] is under the protection of the State, which pays the clergy's salaries, and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] is the \"'prevailing\" religion of Greece according to the Constitution. The Greek Orthodox Church is self-governing but under the spiritual guidance of the Ecumenical Patriarch in [[Constantinople]]. Freedom of religious beliefs is guaranteed by the Constitution, but \"[[proselytism]]\" is officially illegal. According to the most recent Eurostat \"Eurobarometer\" poll, in 2005,<ref name=\"Eurostat poll on the social and religious beliefs of Europeans\">Eurobarometer, http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf</ref> 81% of Greek citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 16% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and only 3% that \"they do not believe there is a God, spirit, nor life force\". This would make Greece one of the most religious countries in the European Union of 25 members, after Malta and Cyprus.\n\nThe Muslim minority, concentrated in [[Thrace]], was given legal status by provisions of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and is Greece's only officially recognized religious minority. There are small Roman Catholic communities on some of the [[Cyclades]] and the Ionian Islands, remnants of the long [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule over the islands. The recent influx of (mostly illegal) immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Third World has an expectedly varied multi-religious profile (Roman Catholic, Muslim, [[Hindu]] etc.).\n\nDuring the 2001 constitutional amendment, complete separation of church and state was proposed, but the two major parties, ND and PASOK, decided not to open this controversial matter, which clashes with both the population and the clergy. For example, numerous protests occurred over the removal of the Religious Denomination entry from the National ID card in 2000.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gpsg.org.uk Greek Politics Specialist Group (GPSG) of the UK's Political Studies Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090609065440/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html Official election results], via the Greek Ministry of Internal Affairs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031222005835/http://www.ekloges.gr/ ekloges.gr] Greek Elections\n* [http://www.primeminister.gr Official website of the Prime Minister of Greece]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013150/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_1_30/03/2006_179002 Greece the first country in the globe in terms of student export]\n* [http://www.politicsgr.com Greek Politics Community Forums]\n*[http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20100628-eurozone-crisis Greece and eurozone in crisis] dossier by Radio France Internationale in English June 2010\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Politics of Europe}}\n{{Europe topic|Parliament of}}\n{{Commons category|Politics of Greece}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of Greece| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Politics of Greece}}\n\nThe '''politics of Greece''' takes place in a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[Prime Minister of Greece]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Government of Greece|government]] and the [[Hellenic Parliament]].

The Greek governmental structure is similar to that found in many other Western [[democracy|democracies]], and has been described as a compromise between the French and German models. The prime minister and cabinet play the central role in the political process, while the president perform some executive and legislative functions in addition to ceremonial duties. Voting in Greece is compulsory but is not enforced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idea.int/data-tools/data/voter-turnout/compulsory-voting|title=Compulsory Voting|last=|first=|date=|website=International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Executive branch ==\nThe [[Cabinet of Greece]], which is the main organ of the [[Government of Greece|government]], includes the heads of all executive ministries, appointed by the president on the recommendation of the prime minister.\n\n=== President ===\n{{Further|President of Greece}}\n\nThe President of the Republic is elected by the Parliament for a five-year term (election last held 15 January 2020), and a maximum of two terms in office. When a presidential term expires, Parliament votes to elect the new President. In the first two votes, a {{frac|2|3}} majority (200 votes) is necessary. The third and final vote requires a {{frac|3|5}} (180 votes) majority.\n\nIf the third vote is fruitless, Parliament is dissolved and elections are proclaimed by the outgoing President within the next 30 days. In the new Parliament, the election for President is repeated immediately with a {{frac|3|5}} majority required for the initial vote, an absolute majority for the second one (151 votes) and a simple majority for the third and final one. The system is so designed as to promote consensus presidential candidates among the main political parties.\n\nThe president has the power to [[declare war]], to grant [[pardon]] (forgiveness) and to conclude agreements of peace, alliance, and participation in international organizations; upon the request of the government a simple parliamentary majority is required to confirm such actions, agreements, or treaties. An absolute or a three-fifths majority is required in exceptional cases (for example, the [[Enlargement of the European Union|accession into the EU]] needed a {{frac|3|5}} majority).\n\nThe president can also exercise certain emergency powers, which must be countersigned by the appropriate cabinet minister.  The president may not dissolve parliament, dismiss the government, suspend certain articles of the constitution, issue a proclamation or declare a state of siege without countersigning by the prime minister or the appropriate cabinet minister. To call a referendum, he must obtain approval from parliament.\n\n=== Prime minister ===\n{{Further|Prime Minister of Greece}}\n\nThe prime minister is elected by the Parliament and he or she is usually the leader of the party controlling the absolute majority of MPs. According to the Constitution, the prime minister safeguards the unity of the government and directs its activities. He or she is the most powerful person of the Greek political system and recommends ministers to the President for appointment or dismissal.\n\n=== Maintaining the support of parliament ===\nGreek parliamentary politics hinge upon the principle of the \"{{lang|el|\u03b4\u03b5\u03b4\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}}\" (pronounced \"dhedhilom'''e'''ni\"), the \"declared confidence\" of Parliament to the Prime Minister and his/her administration. This means that the President of the Republic is bound to appoint, as Prime Minister, a person who will be approved by a majority of the Parliament's members (i.e. 151 votes). With the current electoral system, it is the leader of the party gaining a plurality of the votes in the Parliamentary elections who gets appointed Prime Minister.\n\nAn administration may at any time seek a \"vote of confidence\". Conversely a number of Members of Parliament may ask that a \"vote of reproach\" be taken. Both are rare occurrences with usually predictable outcomes as voting outside the party line happens very seldom.\n\nOn 4 October 2009, [[George Papandreou (junior)|George Papandreou]], president of the [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] party and son and grandson of Prime Ministers, [[2009 Greek legislative election|was elected]] as the new [[Prime Minister of Greece]], following five years of government under [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] leader [[Kostas Karamanlis]], the nephew of long-time Prime Minister and President [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]].\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{Further|Hellenic Parliament|Elections in Greece}}\n\n[[File:Attica 06-13 Athens 10 Parliament.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Greek Parliament]] building, which was the [[Old Royal Palace]].]]\n\nGreece elects a legislature by universal suffrage of all citizens over the age of 18. The [[Parliament of Greece|Greek Parliament]] (\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03ae \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ae\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of reinforced [[proportional representation]] in 48 multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]], 8 single-seat constituencies and a single nationwide list. 288 of the 300 seats are determined by constituency voting, and voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot. The remaining 12 seats are filled from nationwide party lists on a top-down basis and based on the proportion of the total vote each party received.\n\nGreece uses a complex reinforced proportional representation electoral system which discourages splinter parties and makes a parliamentary majority possible even if the leading party falls short of a majority of the popular vote. Under the current electoral law, any single party must receive at least a 3% nationwide vote tally in order to elect Members of Parliament (the so-called \"3% threshold\"). The largest party gets a 50-seat bonus (out of 300 seats) ostensibly to ensure elections return viable governing majorities.\n\nThe law in its current form favors the [[first past the post]] party to achieve an absolute (151 parliamentary seats) majority, provided it receives a 41%+ nationwide vote. This is touted to enhance governmental stability. These electoral laws can be changed by simple parliamentary majority, but a law so changed will not come into effect for two election cycles unless passed by a {{frac|2|3}} majority in the Hellenic Parliament.\n\n==Judicial branch==\n{{Main|Judicial system of Greece}}\n[[File:Council of State, Greece, 2008.jpg|thumb|300px|The building of the ''Arsakeion'' in Athens, where the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is seated.]]\n\nIn Greece the judicial branch is divided into civil, and administrative courts. Civil courts judge civil and penal cases, whereas administrative courts judge administrative cases, namely disputes between the citizens and the State.\n\nThe judicial system of Greece comprises three Supreme Courts: the [[Court of Cassation (Greece)]] (\u0386\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2), the [[Council oes of the National School of Judges. The way the judges are gradually promoted, until they become members of the Supreme Courts, is defined by the Constitution and the existing laws. The presidents and the vice-presidents of the three Supreme Courts are chosen by the [[Cabinet of Greece]] among the serving members of each of the Supreme Courts.\n\nThe [[Court of Cassation (Greece)|Court of Cassation]] is the supreme civil and penal court, whereas the [[Council of State (Greece)|Council of State]] is the supreme administrative court. The [[Chamber of Accounts (Greece)|Chamber of Accounts]] has an [[exclusive jurisdiction]] over certain administrative areas (for example it judges disputes arising from the legislation regulating the pensions of civil servants) and its decisions are irrevocable. This means that they are not judged at second instance by the Council of State.\n\nSometimes, the Supreme Courts take contradictory decisions or they judge differently the constitutionality of a legal provision. These disputes are resolved by the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]], whose composition and jurisdiction is regulated by the Constitution (article 100). As its name reveals, this court is not permanent and it sits when a special case belonging to its jurisdiction arises. When the [[Supreme Special Court (Greece)|Supreme Special Court]] sits, it comprises eleven members: the Presidents of the three Supreme Courts, four members of the Court of Cassation and four members of the Council of State.\n\nWhen it judges the constitutionality of a law or resolves the disputes between Supreme Courts, its composition comprises two more members: two professors of the Law Schools of Greece. The Supreme Special Court is the only court which can declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"powerless\" (something like \"null and void\"), while the three Supreme Courts can only declare an unconstitutional legal provision as \"inapplicable\" to that particular case. The Supreme Special Court is also the Supreme Electoral Court, judging pleas against the legality of the legislative elections.\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n{{Further|Administrative divisions of Greece}}\n[[File:Kallikratis dioikisi.png|thumb|350px|The [[administrative divisions of Greece]], showing Administrative Regions and Regional Units]]\n\nGreece is divided in [[modern regions of Greece|13 Administrative Regions]] which are further divided into [[regional units of Greece|74 Regional Units]]. The 13 Administrative Regions (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b5\u03c2, Perif\u00e9ries) are each headed by a popularly elected Governor (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Periferi\u00e1rhis) and presided over by the popularly elected Regional Council (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Periferiak\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each of the 74 Regional Units (\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Periferiak\u00e9s En\u00f3ti\u0331tes) are headed by a Vice Governor (\u0391\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b7\u03c2, Antiperiferi\u00e1rhis), who is taken from the same political party as the elected Governor.\n\nGreece's 74 Regional Units are divided into [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|325 Municipalities]] (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03b9, Dh\u00edmi) which are lead by a popularly elected Mayor (\u0394\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2, Dh\u00edmarhos) and Municipal Council (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a3\u03c5\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf, Dhimotik\u00f3 Simvo\u00falio). Each Municipality is divided into small Municipal Units (\u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, Dhimotik\u00e9s En\u00f3tites) which in turn contain Municipal Communities (relatively urban communities) and Local Communities (relatively rural communities). Municipal Councils select community members to serve on more local Town Hall Councils which focus on local needs in the Municipality's communities and give local feedback to the Municipal Government.\n\nAlthough Municipalities and villages have elected officials, they often do not have an adequate independent revenue base and must depend on the central government budget for a large part of their financial needs. Consequently, they are subject to numerous central government controls. This also leads to extremely low municipal taxes (usually around 0.2% or less).\n\nGreece also includes one autonomous region, the [[monastery|Monastic]] Community of the Holy Mountain, [[Mount Athos]].\n\n==Foreign relations==\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Greece}}\n\nAs one of the oldest Euro-Atlantic member states in the region of [[Southeast Europe]], Greece enjoys a prominent geopolitical role, due to its political and geographical proximity to [[Europe]], [[Asia]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Africa]]. Its main allies are [[France]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Italy]], [[Bulgaria]], United States, the other [[NATO]] countries like [[Albania]], and the [[European Union]].\n\nGreece also maintains strong diplomatic relations with [[Cyprus]], [[Albania]], [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Armenia]] and [[Israel]], while at the same time focuses at improving further the good relations with [[Egypt]] and the [[Arab World]], [[Caucasus]], and [[China]]. As member of both the EU and the [[Union for the Mediterranean]], Greece is a key player in the eastern Mediterranean region and has encouraged the collaboration between neighbors, as well as promoting the [[Energy Triangle]], for gas exports to Europe. Greece also has the largest economy in the [[Balkans]], where it is an important regional investor.\n\nProminent issues in Hellenic foreign policy include the [[Aegean dispute|claims in the Aegean Sea]] and Eastern Mediterranean by [[Turkey]], the Turkish [[Turkish Invasion of Cyprus|occupation of Cyprus]], and the [[Macedonia naming dispute|dispute over the name]] of [[North Macedonia]]\n\n==Notable politicians of Greece==\n\n===Former===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Alexandros Mavrokordatos]]\n* [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]]\n* [[Spyridon Trikoupis]]\n* [[Andreas Metaxas]]\n* [[Dimitrios Kallergis]]\n* [[Alexandros Koumoundouros]]\n* [[Ioannis Kolettis]]\n* [[Epameinondas Deligiorgis]]\n* [[Charilaos Trikoupis]]\n* [[Theodoros Deligiannis]]\n* [[Alexandros Rizos Rangavis]]\n* [[Alexandros Zaimis]]\n* [[Georgios Christakis-Zografos]]\n* [[Georgios Theotokis]]\n* [[Ioannis Sfakianakis]]\n* [[Stephanos Dragoumis]]\n* [[Ion Dragoumis]]\n* [[Eleftherios Venizelos]]\n* [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ioannis Metaxas]]\n* [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]]\n* [[Themistoklis Sofoulis]]\n* [[Nikos Zachariadis]]\n* [[Sofoklis Venizelos]]\n* [[Georgios Papandreou]]\n* [[Nikolaos Plastiras]]\n* [[Grigoris Lambrakis]]\n* [[Ilias Iliou]]\n* [[Alexandros Panagoulis]]\n* [[Alexandros Papagos]]\n* [[Prokopis Pavlopoulos]]\n* [[Panagiotis Kanellopoulos]]\n* [[Spyros Markezinis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]\n* [[Evangelos Averoff]]\n* [[Leonidas Kyrkos]]\n* [[Andreas Papandreou]]\n* [[Georgios Rallis]]\n* [[Konstantinos Mitsotakis]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Current===\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dimitris Avramopoulos]]\n* [[Dora Bakoyannis]]\n* [[Michalis Chrisochoidis]]\n* [[Maria Damanaki]]\n* [[Nikos Dendias]]\n* [[Anna Diamantopoulou]]\n* [[Stavros Dimas]]\n* [[Adonis Georgiades]]\n* [[Pavlos Geroulanos]]\n* [[Kostis Hatzidakis]]\n* [[Kostas Karamanlis]]\n* [[Dimitris Koutsoumpas]]\n* [[Fotis Kouvelis]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Stefanos Manos]]\n* [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]]\n* [[Dimitrios Papadimoulis]]\n* [[George Papandreou]]\n* [[Giannis Ragousis]]\n* [[Katerina Sakellaropoulou]]\n* [[Antonis Samaras]]\n* [[Alexis Tsipras]]\n* [[Stavros Theodorakis]]\n* [[Yanis Varoufakis]]\n* [[Kyriakos Velopoulos]]\n* [[Evangelos Venizelos]]\n\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Political issues ==\n\n=== Education ===\n{{main|Education in Greece}}\n[[File:Working-class protest in Greece.JPG|thumb|A [[working class]] political protest in Athens, Greece calling for the boycott of a local bookshop after, allegedly, an employee was fired for her political activism]]\n\nUnder the Greek constitution,<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-General\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece].</ref> education is the responsibility of the state. Most Greeks attend public primary and secondary schools. There are a few private schools, which must meet the standard curriculum of and are supervised by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education oversees and directs every aspect of the public education process at all levels, including hiring all teachers and professors and producing all required textbooks.\n\n====Non-state owned universities====\nA recent issue concerning education in Greece is the institutionalisation of private universities. According to the constitution<ref name=\"GreekConstitution-Education-Universities\">[http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A16 Article 16 of the Constitution of Greece], Section 5:  \"Education at university level shall be provided exclusively by institutions which are fully self-governed public law legal persons\".</ref> only state-run universities operate on the land. However, in the recent years many foreign private universities have established branches in Greece, offering [[Bachelor's]] level degrees, thus creating a legal contradiction between the Greek constitution and the EU laws allowing foreign companies to operate anywhere in the Union. Additionally, every year, tens of thousands of Greek students are not accepted to the state-run University system and become \"educational immigrants\" to other countries' Higher Education institutions, where they move to study.\n\nThis has created a chronic problem for Greece, in terms of loss of capital as well as human resources, since many of those students opt to seek employment in the countries they studied, after completing their studies. It is characteristic that in 2006, Greece, with 11.5&nbsp;million inhabitants, was fourth in the world in terms of student export in absolute numbers, with 60,000 students abroad, while the first country in this regard, People's Republic of China of over 1,3&nbsp;billion inhabitants, had 100,000 students abroad. In terms of students abroad as a percent of the general population, Greece is by far the leading country, with 5,250 students per million, compared to second Malaysia's 1,780 students per million inhabitants.\n\nCiting these problems as a result of the state's monopoly on Higher Education, [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] (ND) committed to amending the constitution, in order to allow private universities to operate in Greece on a non-profit basis. This proposal was rejected by then-ruling [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK) in the late nineties, and thus could not muster the support necessary to be put to vote on the constitutional amendment of 2001. However, PASOK has since changed its stance, and now also supports a constitutional provision for the creation of private Universities on a non-profit basis. This proposal continues to encounter the fierce opposition of the Left parties and part of the academic community, both professors and students.\n\nAt the outset of 2006, prime minister [[Kostas Karamanlis]] announced the initiative of his government for a new amendment of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]]. According to his assertion one of the main issues of this amendment (the second within less than 10 years) is going to be the creation of \"non-state owned\" universities.\n\n=== Illegal immigration ===\n{{main|Immigration to Greece}}\n\nGreece has  problems with illegal immigration, especially from or via Turkey. Greek authorities believe that 90% of illegal immigrants in the EU enter through Greece, many fleeing because of unrest and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.<ref>{{cite news|title= Tensions Rise Over Illegal Immigrants In Greece |work=[[NPR]]|date=|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/08/14/139613525/tensions-over-illegal-immigrants-in-greece-rises|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Southern Europe's Immigration Test|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=2010-02-18|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1964957_1964954_1964953,00.html|accessdate=2012-05-30}}</ref>\n\nSeveral European courts have held that Greece is not complying with minimum standards of treatment for asylum seekers, so that illegal migrants who reach other countries cannot be sent back to Greece.<ref>{{cite news|title= On illegal immigration, Greek left, war damages, Klaus Boetig, traffic accidents   |work=[[Ekathimerini]]|date=|url= http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite3_1_30/03/2012_435673|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref>\n\nNumerous solutions have been proposed by the Greek government such as building a fence on the Turkish border and setting up detention camps.<ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to Build Border Fence to Deter Illegal Immigrants |work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-02-06|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/world/europe/greece-to-build-fence-on-turkish-border-to-curb-illegal-immigrants.html|accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Greece to open new detention centres for illegal migrants  |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-03-29|url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/29/greece-detention-centres-migrants?newsfeed=true|accessdate=2012-04-01|location=London|first=Helena|last=Smith}}</ref>\n\n=== Judicial system ===\n{{main|Judicial system of Greece}}\nOne of the main problems of the system is the long-time process needed, even for a simple case, something that negatively impacts investment, entrepreneurship, social relations, corporate governance, and public governance.<ref>[http://www.ekathimerini.com/163295/article/ekathimerini/comment/the-greek-judicial-system-in-critical-condition The Greek judicial system in critical condition]</ref><ref>[http://bponline.amcham.gr/?p=2828 The Greek Legal Crisis & Reform Of The Greek Legal System]</ref> Also corruption cases have appeared during the last years, such as the ''[[Paradikastiko]]'' organization scandal.<ref>[http://www.koutipandoras.gr/article/premiera-ths-dikhs-toy-paradikastikoy-kyklwmatos-me-fonto-apeilhtika-shmeiwmata-kai-sfaires \u03a0\u03c1\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd]</ref>\n\nManipulation of the judicial system and its decisions by each government, is another common phenomenon which violates the independency of the system.\n\n====Prisons====\nThere are three prison types in Greece: general, special, and therapeutic prisons. General prisons include three different types of inmates: type A inmates, type B inmates, and type C inmates. Special prisons include rural units, juvenile institutions, and semi-liberty centers. One example of a special prison would be an Agricultural Prison. The last prison type is a therapeutic prison; which includes hospitals and rehab centers for inmates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisonobservatory.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:prison-conditions-in-greek&catid=13:documents&Itemid=116|title=Prison conditions in Greece|last=|first=|date=July 4, 2014|website=European Prison Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Within these centers the percentage of female prisoners is 5.5%, which amounts to around 538 female prisoners. The percentage of juveniles in Greek prison is 2.9%. Greece\u2019s occupancy rate in prisons is 99%, which means that Greece\u2019s prisons are near full capacity. With some exceptions occupancy exceeds 100%, and in some establishments, it reaches, or surpasses, 300%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prisonobservatory.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14:prison-conditions-in-greek&catid=13:documents&Itemid=116|title=Prison conditions in Greece|last=|first=|date=July 4, 2014|website=European Prison Observatory|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Because of this the Greek Justice Ministry and the European Council want to improve Greek prison conditions. These improvements include training for guards, improving of medical facilities, and better treatment of prisoners. These selected improvements are three human rights that the Greek correctional system would like to tackle.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{main|Media in Greece}}\nThe Greek media, collectively, is a very influential institution \u2013 usually aggressive, sensationalist. As with many countries, most of the media are owned by businesses with commercial interests in other sectors of the economy. There are often accusations of newspapers, magazines, and radio and television channels being used to promote their commercial enterprises as well as to seek political influence.\n\nIn 1994, the [[Minister for the Press and the Media (Greece)|Ministry of Press and Media]] was established to deal with media and communication issues. [[Ellinik\u00ed Radiofon\u00eda Tile\u00f3rasi|ERT S.A.]], a public corporation supervised by the Minister of Press, operates three national television channels and five national radio channels. The Minister of Press also serves as the primary government spokesperson.\n\nThe Secretary General of Press and Information prepares the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) Bulletin. Along with [[Associated Press|AP]] and [[Reuters]], this is a primary source of information for the Greek press. The Ministry of Press and Information also issues the semi-official Macedonian News Agency (MPE) Bulletin, which is distributed throughout the Balkan region. For international news, [[CNN]] is a particular influence in the Greek market; the major television channels often use it as a source. State and private television stations also use [[European Broadcasting Union|Eurovision]] and [[Visnews]] as sources. While few papers and stations have overseas correspondents, those few correspondents abroad can be very influential.\n\nIn 1988, a new law provided the legal framework for the establishment of private radio stations and, in 1989, private television stations. According to the law, supervision of radio and television is exercised by the National Radio and Television Council. In practice, however, official licensing has been delayed for many years. Because of this, there has been a proliferation of private radio and television stations, as well as European satellite channels, including [[Euronews]]. More than 1,000 radio stations were operating before March 2002, when the government implemented plans to reallocate television frequencies and issue licenses as authorized by the 1993 Media Law, effectively reducing this number.\n\n====Media freedom====\nIn 2011, the government proposed new measures that will restrict the freedom of speech in the internet. According to some proposals, every individual who would like to use free platforms, such like [[Blogspot]] or [[WordPress.com]] will be forced to get officially registered in the courts, as due to tough austerity measures web sites that criticize the government and the political system in general have been multiplied.<ref>[http://www.avgi.gr/ArticleActionshow.action?articleID=634166]</ref>\n\n[[Press freedom]] sharply eroded in Greece during [[Greek government-debt crisis|the economic and financial crisis of 2010\u20132015]], passing from the 35th place in 2009 in [[Reporters Without Borders]] [[Press Freedom Index]] to the 99th place in 2014, well below all [[Western Balkans]] countries as well as states with repressive media policies such as [[Gabon]], [[Kuwait]] or [[Liberia]].<ref name=euroscope>Thomas Van Der Heijden, [http://publications.europeintheworld.com/media-landscape-greece-must-reform-quickly-3/ Media landscape in Greece must reform quickly], ''Euroscope'', 28 November 2014</ref> Greece is today the [[EU member state]] \"where journalism and the media face their most acute crisis\".<ref name=OSF>Petros Iosifidis and Dimitris Boucas, [https://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/sites/default/files/media-policy-independent-journalism-greece-20150511.pdf Media Policy and Independent Journalism in Greece] (PDF), ''[[Open Society Foundation]] report'', 1 May 2015</ref>\n\n=== Military service ===\n{{Main|Conscription in Greece}}\n\nNine months for all males of 18 years of age; Compulsory with fines and imprisonment if denied, but neither fine nor imprisonment has been imposed since 1994, where the last warrant against a draft-dodger was issued. Members of families with three children serve a reduced time of six months. Military service can also be substituted with a longer public service, which by the standards of Amnesty International, ought to be considered punitive as it is twice as long as the regular tour of duty.\n\nLimited steps have been taken to turn the Greek military into a semi-[[professional army]] in the last years, leading to the gradual reduction of the service from 18 to 12 to 9 months and the inclusion of a greater number of professional military personnel in most vertices of the force. Recent developments, though, within the anti-conscription movement in Greece, such as the high{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} death rate from suicides during service and work-related accidents, such as the [[Manitsa]] incident, combined with a high rate of draft-dodging, have advanced the idea that mandatory conscription should be abolished and an all-professional/all-volunteer army should be put in place.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n==== Military spending ====\nGreece directs approximately 1.7% of its GDP <!--This most probably refers to direct military spending. \"Indirect\" was mentioned.

The previous PASOK administration, also planned on reducing military spending<ref name=\"mil_pasok_2001\">[http://www.hri.org/news/grpapers/typos/2001/01-11-15.typos.html Athens News Agency: Press Review in Greek, 01-11-15]</ref> prior to its failure to be re-elected in 2004, while PASOK politicians usually refer to money saved from reducing military spending as a \"peace dividend\" (\"\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2\").<ref name=\"mil_pasok_div\">[http://www.mnec.gr/christ_int_211203.aspx Speech of PASOK former finance minister Nikos Christodoulakis]</ref>\n\nSome of the parties on the left, such as the [[Communist Party of Greece]] and [[Synaspismos]], have been vocal in condemning military spending. Regarding the purchase of 30 [[F-16]] and 333 [[Leopard 2|Leopard tank]]s in 2005, both parties criticized the New Democracy administration for spending money on weapons while doing nothing to relieve the lower classes and said that high military spending \"does not correspond to the real needs of the country but is carried out according to [[NATO]] planning and to serve weapon manufacturers and the countries that host them\".<ref name=\"mil_left\">[http://www.hri.org/news/europe/bbc/2005/05-07-19.bbc.html HR-NET index of BBC broadcasts in Greek, 05-07-19 News]</ref>\n\n=== Church-State relations===\n{{main|Religion in Greece}}\n\nThe [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] is under the protection of the State, which pays the clergy's salaries, and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] is the \"'prevailing\" religion of Greece according to the Constitution. The Greek Orthodox Church is self-governing but under the spiritual guidance of the Ecumenical Patriarch in [[Constantinople]]. Freedom of religious beliefs is guaranteed by the Constitution, but \"[[proselytism]]\" is officially illegal. According to the most recent Eurostat \"Eurobarometer\" poll, in 2005,<ref name=\"Eurostat poll on the social and religious beliefs of Europeans\">Eurobarometer, http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf</ref> 81% of Greek citizens responded that \"they believe there is a God\", whereas 16% answered that \"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force\" and only 3% that \"they do not believe there is a God, spirit, nor life force\". This would make Greece one of the most religious countries in the European Union of 25 members, after Malta and Cyprus.\n\nThe Muslim minority, concentrated in [[Thrace]], was given legal status by provisions of the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] and is Greece's only officially recognized religious minority. There are small Roman Catholic communities on some of the [[Cyclades]] and the Ionian Islands, remnants of the long [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule over the islands. The recent influx of (mostly illegal) immigrants from Eastern Europe and the Third World has an expectedly varied multi-religious profile (Roman Catholic, Muslim, [[Hindu]] etc.).\n\nDuring the 2001 constitutional amendment, complete separation of church and state was proposed, but the two major parties, ND and PASOK, decided not to open this controversial matter, which clashes with both the population and the clergy. For example, numerous protests occurred over the removal of the Religious Denomination entry from the National ID card in 2000.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gpsg.org.uk Greek Politics Specialist Group (GPSG) of the UK's Political Studies Association]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090609065440/http://ekloges.ypes.gr/pages/index.html Official election results], via the Greek Ministry of Internal Affairs\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20031222005835/http://www.ekloges.gr/ ekloges.gr] Greek Elections\n* [http://www.primeminister.gr Official website of the Prime Minister of Greece]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930013150/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_ell_1_30/03/2006_179002 Greece the first country in the globe in terms of student export]\n* [http://www.politicsgr.com Greek Politics Community Forums]\n*[http://www.english.rfi.fr/economy/20100628-eurozone-crisis Greece and eurozone in crisis] dossier by Radio France Internationale in English June 2010\n\n{{Greece topics}}\n{{Politics of Europe}}\n{{Europe topic|Parliament of}}\n{{Commons category|Politics of Greece}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Politics of Greece| ]]\n", "name_user": "2605:e000:131b:824f:4c40:2ade:841b:4e6d", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePresident)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Greece"}
