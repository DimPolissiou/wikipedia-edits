As part of the proposed coalition deal between Netanyahu and Gantz, Gantz would replace Netanyahu as Prime Minister of Israel in 18 months.<ref name=gantzcrack>{{cite web|url=https://www.axios.com/trump-peace-plan-annexation-gantz-netanyahu-02d228a7-b5a9-49e7-ac15-e8676a193ce7.html|title=Trump peace plan a sticking point in Israel's Netanyahu-Gantz pact|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|author=Barak Ravid|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[2020 in Israel]]\n*[[Elections in Israel]]\n*[[List of elections in 2020]]\n*[[List of members of the twenty-third Knesset]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[https://bechirot23.bechirot.gov.il/election/english/Pages/default.aspx Elections for the 23rd Knesset] at the [[Central Elections Committee (Israel)|Central Elections Committee]]\n\n{{Israeli elections}}\n{{portal bar|Israel|Modern history|Politics}}\n\n[[Category:2020 elections in Asia|Israel]]\n[[Category:2020 in Israel]]\n[[Category:Legislative elections in Israel]]\n[[Category:March 2020 events in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Election for the 23rd Knesset}}\n{{use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Infobox legislative election\n| election_name      = 2020 Israeli legislative election\n| country            = Israel\n| previous_election  = [[September 2019 Israeli legislative election|Sep&nbsp;2019]]\n| next_election      = [[Opinion polling for the next Israeli legislative election|Next]]\n| election_date      = 2 March 2020\n| seats_for_election = All 120 seats in the [[Knesset]]\n| majority_seats     = 61\n| ongoing            =\n| results_sec        = Results\n| turnout            = 71.5% {{increase}}\n\n| party1             = Likud\n| leader1            = {{nowrap|[[Benjamin Netanyahu]]}}\n| percentage1        = 29.46%\n| seats1             = 36\n| last_election1     = 32\n\n| party2             = Blue and White (political alliance)\n| leader2            = {{nowrap|[[Benny Gantz]]}}\n| percentage2        = 26.59%\n| seats2             = 33\n| last_election2     = 33\n\n| party3             = Joint List\n| leader3            = [[Ayman Odeh]]\n| percentage3        = 12.67%\n| seats3             = 15\n| last_election3     = 13\n\n| party4             = Shas\n| leader4            = [[Aryeh Deri]]\n| percentage4        = 7.69%\n| seats4             = 9\n| last_election4     = 9\n\n| party5             = United Torah Judaism\n| leader5            = [[Yaakov Litzman]]\n| percentage5        = 5.98%\n| seats5             = 7 \n| last_election5     = 7\n\n| party6             = {{nowrap|[[Israeli Labor Party|Labor]]\u2013[[Gesher (2019 political party)|Gesher]]\u2013[[Meretz]]}}\n| leader6            = [[Amir Peretz]]\n| percentage6        = 5.83%\n| seats6             = 7\n| last_election6     = 10<!--Labor, Gesher, Meretz and Yair Goland held 10 seats in the last Knesset.

Ravid stated that this would likely make the upcoming deal between Gantz and Netanyahu short-lived.

When an argument about [[Triple Talaq]] between Zara and Kabir becomes viral on the internet, they are forced to marry each other.\n\nGradually after marriage, Zara realizes her love for the still hesitant Kabir. Rukhsaar has been in love with him from a young age and tries to split them up, who brings Miraj to create differences between Zara and Kabir though he goes rogue out to harm everyone in the family.\n\nRukhsaar calls Nilofer to pose as Miraj's sister and instructs her to protect the family from Miraj except for Zara, but is then married off to Hamdaan Alghazi and leaves for [[Dubai]]. Miraj buys out and kills Nilofer. A misunderstanding leads to Kabir divorcing Zara using the Triple Talaq practice. \n\nIt is revealed this was not a part of their nuptials and Zara refuses to accept. Miraj tells Zara that he wants her and can go to any extent, whereas she tries to have Rukhsaar return to expose Miraj's true intentions but is unable to reach her. Miraj makes his way into the local [[Shariah Board]] and turns out to be a diamond smuggler laundering money. \n\nMiraj is arrested and Kabir's dream project loses its funding. Miraj's connection to Rukhsaar is revealed before he swears revenge on Zara and Kabir who confess their love. The family arrange their remarriage. Prior to it, Kabir leaves for Dubai to save Rukhsaar from implication in Hamdaan's death and ends up marrying her. He weds Zara on his return. When Zara finds out, she is heartbroken but decides to stay.\n\nRukhsaar meets with an accident and loses her memory. Kabir takes her responsibility upsetting Zara.

Zara and Kabir thwart their plan with help of army officer Amir, who and Alina fall in love and get married. Salamat tries to kill Kabir and Zara. Kabir becomes the head priest. \n\nZeenat is irked; Salamat threatens to kill Rukhsaar, amd Irfan suggests Zara to become the vice priest. Heer's case is brought before the Sharia Board where she wants to go to Delhi to study but in vain amid her reluctant father. Zara takes the case against Kabir and wins. Suraiya moves to Lucknow with Rizwan and plans to have him replace Kabir as Board Head with Zeenat's help. Salamat bribes Khalid on Zeenat's request.\n\nRizwan exposes Zeenat's actions as soon as he joins the Board and has her declared mentally unsound. She vows revenge on Rizwan who starts poisoning Irfan slowly. Bilal and Kausar's case comes to the Board; Rizwan plans to create a rift between Zara and Kabir, who tells her that Kausar was betrothed to Kashan and eloped on wedding before Kashan married Zeenat who was indebted to Kausar's family. \n\nEveryone in the family request Zara to disagree to the case but she and Kabir decide. Entire city protests against them and Kabir too turns against Zara who is about to drop the case before Kausar's suicide attempt changes her mind. Zara leaves Ahmads and Shahbaz plans her murder. In the Sharia Board, she wins. Kabir in an accident is orchestrated by Rizwan; Zara is shot by a hitman hired by Shahbaz. The two collapse together.\n\n===One year later===\n\nZara and Kabir live separately. While Zara resides with Amina, Azra and Nusu in [[Mumbai]], Kabir lives with his family in [[Lucknow]].

Shahbaz again tries to have her killed but Kabir saves her every time. \n\nThe Ahmads rejoice at the couple's reunion prospect and Kabir insults Irfan, asking the Qazi to beg to him to take Zara back. Upset, Zara breaks up with Kabir, while Irfan has a heart attack. Ayesha is heartbroken and asks him to leave the house. He starts living in the mosque.\n\n=== One month later ===\n\nZara learns about Ayesha's illness from Kashan and decides to go back only for Ayesha's sake. She decides to reunite Ayesha and Kabir on [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]. Shahbaz and Zeenat worry that Zara and Kabir might get back together so Shahbaz constantly provokes Kabir against Zara.

When Zara finds out, she is heartbroken but decides to stay.\n\nRukhsaar meets with an accident and loses her memory. Kabir takes her responsibility upsetting Zara.

She vows revenge on Rizwan who starts poisoning Irfan slowly. Bilal and Kausar's case comes to the Board; Rizwan plans to create a rift between Zara and Kabir, who tells her that Kausar was betrothed to Kashan and eloped on wedding before Kashan married Zeenat who was indebted to Kausar's family. \n\nEveryone in the family request Zara to disagree to the case but she and Kabir decide.

He starts living in the mosque.\n\n=== One month later ===\n\nZara learns about Ayesha's illness from Kashan and decides to go back only for Ayesha's sake. She decides to reunite Ayesha and Kabir on [[Eid al-Fitr|Eid]]. Shahbaz and Zeenat worry that Zara and Kabir might get back together so Shahbaz constantly provokes Kabir against Zara. According to the Sharia Board, all the board members should attend the Eid celebrations with their entire family.\n\nShahbaz tries to foil the plan but Zara is the event organizer and manages the situation. Rukhsar returns and the family is unaware of it. Zara and Azra succeed in reuniting Kabir and Ayesha with Rukhsaar's help.

{"title_page": "Don Garlits", "text_new": "[[Image:DonGarlitsApril1987.jpg|thumb|right|Garlits in 1987]]\n\n'''Donald Glenn \"Don\" Garlits''' (born January 14, 1932, [[Tampa, Florida]] ) is an American race car driver and automotive engineer. He is considered the father of [[drag racing]]. He is [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|known as]] \"Big Daddy\" to drag racing fans around the world. Always a pioneer in the field of drag racing, he perfected the rear-engine [[Top Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragster]], an innovation motivated by the loss of part of his foot in a dragster accident. This design was notably safer since it put most of the fuel processing and rotating parts of the dragster behind the driver. The driver was placed in front of nearly all the mechanical components, thus protecting the driver and allowing him to activate a variety of safety equipment in the event of catastrophic mechanical failure or a fire. Garlits was an early promoter of the full-body, fire-resistant [[Nomex]] driving suit, complete with socks, gloves, and [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].\n\nGarlits was the first drag racer to officially surpass the 170, 180, 200,{{citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=this is debated}} 240, 250, and 270 mile per hour marks in the quarter mile; he was also the first to top {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}} in the {{convert|1/8|mi|abbr=on}}. He has been inducted into several Halls of Fame and has won many awards during his career.\n\nIn May 2014 at age 82, Garlits set a {{convert|184|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed record in an [[EV dragster]], a battery-powered electric vehicle that does not burn fuel.  \n<ref>[http://blog.caranddriver.com/at-82-years-old-don-garlits-sets-184-mph-ev-dragster-record-guns-for-200-mph-next/ ''Car and Driver'' online] (retrieved 24 May 2017<!--again...-->)</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early days===\nAfter [[World War II]], in the central and western United States, many air force bases and landing fields were decommissioned. These abandoned runways were perfect for drag racing. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120720060249/http://www.tbucketplans.com/2010/04/11/how-a-t-bucket-was-key-to-big-daddy-don-garlits-drag-racing-success/ Don Garlits's first drag race car] was built under an oak tree at his home in North Tampa in 1954. He used an arc welder and a cutting torch to modify an old 1927 [[Ford Model T]] Roadster. To this roadster he added a 1948 Mercury engine block, a 1939 Ford floor shift transmission, and a 1948 Ford differential and axle. That early T-Bucket's quarter mile performance was 13.5 seconds, at a top speed of 93&nbsp;mph. It was this successful, formative roadster that would become the basis for his first rail-job dragster. He cut off the body panels, moved the engine back, and installed the seat behind the drive axle. (A similar design was built that same year by [[Mickey Thompson]].) This was the legendary slingshot dragster with which Big Daddy would win the first [[NHRA]] race he entered, the NHRA Safety Safari in [[Lake City, Florida]]. (12.1 seconds, 108&nbsp;mph.) Three years later, he became a professional drag racer. The first national drag racing meet, sponsored by the [[National Hot Rod Association]] was held on an airfield near [[Great Bend, KS]] in 1955. Don Garlits, being from Florida, was something of an outsider. He was sometimes referred to as the Floridian, before permanently adopting the nickname \"Swamp Rat,\" which also became the name for each new generation of his innovative dragster designs.\n\nIn 1959, Garlits traveled to [[Bakersfield, California]] for the US Fuel and Gas Championships, later to be named the \"[[March Meet]]\", to show that the times he was setting were as legitimate as those set by the west coast racers. Over 30,000 people attended the event, the largest attendance at a drag race at that point. His presence helped to grow the sport of [[drag racing]] beyond its California base. In 1964, after winning the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, Garlits traveled to England, with TV [[Tommy Ivo]], Tony Nancy, Dante Duce and other racers, to participate in the first International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK.\n\n===Accident leads to innovation===\nOn March 8, 1970, at [[Lions Drag Strip]],<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.nhra.com/news/2015/front-back-rear-engine-transition NHRA.com] (retrieved 24 May 2017</ref> Garlits was driving ''Swamp Rat XIII'', also called the ''Wynnscharger'', a [[Front engine dragster|slingshot]] rail, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure. The two-speed transmission Garlits was developing exploded and took a piece out of his right foot, while the car broke in half in front of the cockpit;<ref>[http://www.nhra.com/news/2015/front-back-rear-engine-transition NHRA.com photo] (retrieved 24 May 2017)</ref> he was out for the remainder of the season. In an interview by [[Florida Trend]], Garlits said this of the incident: \"In 1970, the transmission exploded in my dragster on the final run, and it cut my foot off and cut the car in two. That\u2019s when I drew up plans for what I thought would be a championship rear-engine car. I would go out to the shop in Seffner on my wheelchair, saw stuff out on the band saw and make the parts.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridatrend.com/article/14743/icon-don-big-daddy-garlits|title= Florida Icon: Don 'Big Daddy' Garlits |date=2012-10-03}}</ref>\n\nGarlits' accident was like many in the 1960s, and his new design followed several other pioneer designers of rear-engined dragsters, including [[Steve Swaja]]'s [[Top Gas|AA/Gas]] [[Tony Nancy Wedge (dragster)|''Wedge I'']] from 1963, [[Roger Lindwall]]'s 1966 Top Fuel [[Re-Entry (dragster)|''Re-Entry'']], and Kent Fuller's fueller ''[[Sidewinder III]]'' from 1969.<ref>Taylor, Thom.  \"Tony Nancy Gas Dragster\", \"Roger Lindwall Re-Entry\", and \"Kent Fuller Sidewinder III\", in \"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\", pp.34, 38, and 42.</ref> He was aided in the construction of his new car by T. C.

He is considered the father of [[drag racing]]. He is [[List of motorsports people by nickname#B|known as]] \"Big Daddy\" to drag racing fans around the world. Always a pioneer in the field of drag racing, he perfected the rear-engine [[Top Fuel]] [[Dragster (car)|dragster]], an innovation motivated by the loss of part of his foot in a dragster accident. This design was notably safer since it put most of the fuel processing and rotating parts of the dragster behind the driver. The driver was placed in front of nearly all the mechanical components, thus protecting the driver and allowing him to activate a variety of safety equipment in the event of catastrophic mechanical failure or a fire. Garlits was an early promoter of the full-body, fire-resistant [[Nomex]] driving suit, complete with socks, gloves, and [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].\n\nGarlits was the first drag racer to officially surpass the 170, 180, 200,{{citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=this is debated}} 240, 250, and 270 mile per hour marks in the quarter mile; he was also the first to top {{convert|200|mph|abbr=on}} in the {{convert|1/8|mi|abbr=on}}. He has been inducted into several Halls of Fame and has won many awards during his career.\n\nIn May 2014 at age 82, Garlits set a {{convert|184|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} speed record in an [[EV dragster]], a battery-powered electric vehicle that does not burn fuel.  \n<ref>[http://blog.caranddriver.com/at-82-years-old-don-garlits-sets-184-mph-ev-dragster-record-guns-for-200-mph-next/ ''Car and Driver'' online] (retrieved 24 May 2017<!--again...-->)</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early days===\nAfter [[World War II]], in the central and western United States, many air force bases and landing fields were decommissioned.

He used an arc welder and a cutting torch to modify an old 1927 [[Ford Model T]] Roadster. To this roadster he added a 1948 Mercury engine block, a 1939 Ford floor shift transmission, and a 1948 Ford differential and axle. That early T-Bucket's quarter mile performance was 13.5 seconds, at a top speed of 93&nbsp;mph. It was this successful, formative roadster that would become the basis for his first rail-job dragster. He cut off the body panels, moved the engine back, and installed the seat behind the drive axle. (A similar design was built that same year by [[Mickey Thompson]].) This was the legendary slingshot dragster with which Big Daddy would win the first [[NHRA]] race he entered, the NHRA Safety Safari in [[Lake City, Florida]]. (12.1 seconds, 108&nbsp;mph.) Three years later, he became a professional drag racer. The first national drag racing meet, sponsored by the [[National Hot Rod Association]] was held on an airfield near [[Great Bend, KS]] in 1955. Don Garlits, being from Florida, was something of an outsider. He was sometimes referred to as the Floridian, before permanently adopting the nickname \"Swamp Rat,\" which also became the name for each new generation of his innovative dragster designs.\n\nIn 1959, Garlits traveled to [[Bakersfield, California]] for the US Fuel and Gas Championships, later to be named the \"[[March Meet]]\", to show that the times he was setting were as legitimate as those set by the west coast racers. Over 30,000 people attended the event, the largest attendance at a drag race at that point. His presence helped to grow the sport of [[drag racing]] beyond its California base. In 1964, after winning the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis, Garlits traveled to England, with TV [[Tommy Ivo]], Tony Nancy, Dante Duce and other racers, to participate in the first International Drag Festival, a six-event series that did much to promote the sport of drag racing in the UK.\n\n===Accident leads to innovation===\nOn March 8, 1970, at [[Lions Drag Strip]],<ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.nhra.com/news/2015/front-back-rear-engine-transition NHRA.com] (retrieved 24 May 2017</ref> Garlits was driving ''Swamp Rat XIII'', also called the ''Wynnscharger'', a [[Front engine dragster|slingshot]] rail, when the vehicle suffered a catastrophic failure.

In an interview by [[Florida Trend]], Garlits said this of the incident: \"In 1970, the transmission exploded in my dragster on the final run, and it cut my foot off and cut the car in two. That\u2019s when I drew up plans for what I thought would be a championship rear-engine car.

Death is often a boss fought toward the end of the game. He is considered Dracula's second-in-command and most trusted minion. Sometimes he has played an important role to the storyline, such as ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence]]''. He is a playable character as the skeletal knight in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn most of his appearances, Death closely resembles the cultural personification of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], being a legless skeleton in a hooded cloak with a [[scythe]]. Like Dracula, but in a lot fewer games, he can change into a second form upon being defeated in the game.\n\nHe is voiced by Dennis Falt in ''Symphony of the Night'', Patrick Seitz in ''The Dracula X Chronicles'' and ''Order of Ecclesia'', [[Douglas Rye]] in ''Judgment'' and [[Tom Wyner]] in earlier games. Death also appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nThe character of Zobek, Lord of the Dead (voiced by [[Patrick Stewart]]) in the reboot ''Castlevania: Lords of Shadow'' has been speculated to be the version of Death of this universe, due to his relationship with Dracula. Additionally, the Lord of the Necromancers is at one point referred to as \"Death itself\". In the game's [[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2|sequel]], when Gabriel Belmont is forced into a confrontation with Zobek sheds his human form and takes on a more traditionalized appearance of Death (including wielding a large scythe).\n\n===Simon Belmont===\n[[File:CVGoS Simon Belmont.png|thumb|right|Simon Belmont is the first protagonist to appear in the ''Castlevania'' series.]]\n{{nihongo|'''Simon Belmont'''|\u30b7\u30e2\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Shimon Berumondo|Simon Belmondo}} is the first protagonist to appear in the series. He has appeared in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]'', ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]''.\n\nSimon initially kills Dracula in the year 1691, an event that is told in multiple games (''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', and ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]''). In ''Castlevania II: Simon's Quest'', it is revealed that Dracula placed a curse on Simon and all of Transylvania after he was defeated by him. To break the curse, Simon must gather the remains of Dracula in order to burn them at the ruins of Dracula's castle &ndash; though the fact that this will cause Dracula to return is unknown to Simon (Dracula's Fang). In the best and canonical ending, Simon breaks the curse, and Transylvania recognizes his bravery, though it is hinted that Dracula will inevitably return, as his skinless hand rises from his grave. Simon is one of only two Belmonts to have faced Dracula twice in his lifetime, the other being his ancestor Christopher. \n\nIn ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', Simon is blue-haired and has a wife called Selena, who is kidnapped by Dracula directly after their marriage. It is actually unknown if this is Simon at all. The guide to the game calls him Simons, a descendant of the canonical  Simon, while a newsletter by Konami itself names him William. <ref>{{cite video|title=Game Simulation Video series: Akumaj\u014d Dracula (arcade version)|language=Japanese|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/Images/Scans/HC/hctape.jpg}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Simon is the first Belmont to appear in a Castlevania game, in the Belmont lineage, [[Leon Belmont]] originates the direct bloodline of the clan. It can then be presumed that he is followed by Trevor, Christopher, Soleil, Simon, Juste, Richter, and then Julius. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance]]'', Simon is playable in the Boss Rush mode, looking exactly as he did in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]''. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]'', Simon is an extra character purchased as downloadable content, the sprite from the original game also being reused here. A special stage that recreates the game's castle layout can also be purchased.\n\nSimon Belmont appears in the rebooted series ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate]]'' (voiced by [[Alec Newman]]), as the son of Trevor Belmont, and grandson of Gabriel Belmont, later known as Dracula. He seeks revenge for the murder of his parents and throughout the game is unaware that Dracula is his grandfather.\n\nSimon's ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'' incarnation (voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]]) was designed by ''[[Death Note]]'' artist [[Takeshi Obata]]. He has red-orange hair comparable to that of [[Light Yagami|Light Yagami]] (the protagonist of Death Note), a jacket with many belts on it that exposes his muscular chest, and bandages on his forearms. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22836|title=Interview: Noisycroak On Traversing Castlevania's Musical Timeline}}</ref> Series director [[Koji Igarashi]] emphasized that these designs were different from what he envisioned, Simon in particular, but commented that this was how Obata envisioned them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/07/why-a-wii-fight|title=Why a Fighting Game?

He is depicted as an arrogant and egotistical vampire hunter who competes with the main character Kevin Keene for the heroine Princess Lana, who he carries a torch for.  Simon has a whip and a backpack of resources which he uses throughout the series. His appearance in the cartoon was met with criticism. Ben Rhudy of Monsters and Critics stated that he looks nothing like his video game counterpart, and that the show's creator [[DiC]] should have consulted the game before choosing this design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |title=DVD Review: Captain N The Game Master \u2013 The Complete Series |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211054536/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |archivedate=December 11, 2013 }}</ref> Simon also appears in several games outside the ''Castlevania'' franchise including the 2003 [[GameCube]] crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=January 12, 2004 | title=''World Fighters'' | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405162602/https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-date=April 5, 2014 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> the 2017 [[Nintendo Switch]] [[action game]] ''[[Super Bomberman R]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=McWhertor | date=April 21, 2017 | title=Pyramid Head, Simon Belmont and Vic Viper coming to ''Bomberman'' for Switch | url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424020854/http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-date=April 24, 2017 | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> and the 2018 Nintendo Switch crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.

She is a servant of Dracula. Her name is a reference to the title character of the 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]'', which predated Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years. Her first appearance was as an antagonist in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref>Castlevania Judgement manual, pg 23</ref> She later reappeared in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Circle of the Moon]]'' (non-canon), and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.  She is a devoted worshiper of chaos and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nIn 1830, she successfully resurrected Dracula in her [[Austria]]n castle, although he hadn't regained his full power.  To restore it, they planned to sacrifice the vampire hunter Morris Baldwin, father to Hugh Baldwin and mentor to Nathan Graves, during a [[lunar eclipse]] of the full moon.  As Nathan began making headway in the effort to rescue his master, Carmilla brainwashed Hugh to do her bidding and challenged Nathan to a battle in the Underground Waterway.  Although she died, Carmilla relished the fact that the rite to restore Dracula's power was nearly finished.\n\nCarmilla's appearances and names have differed. In ''Simon's Quest'', Carmilla was originally known as {{nihongo|Vampira|\u5973\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Jo Ky\u016bketsuki|lit. \"Female Vampire\"}} in the instruction manual, though the in-game hidden clue refers to her as Carmilla.  Her appearance was interpreted as a mask that leaked tears of blood. Until the release of ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla and her mask were available in the game as a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This was the first time in the series she was referenced by the name.\n\nIn ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla has a blue-haired companion called {{nihongo|Laura|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}. Laura was the central protagonist and narrator from the original novel, ''Carmilla''. She is a particularly vicious non-boss enemy in ''Portrait of Ruin'', but is referred to as \"Carmilla's eternal servant\" in her bestiary entry. In the reboot ''Lords of Shadow'', Laura is Carmilla's daughter, who challenges the main character Gabriel with dangerous games. She appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character, based on her appearance in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nShe is voiced by [[Karen Strassman]] in ''Judgment''.\n\nIn the reboot of ''Lords of Shadow'', Carmilla is played by [[Sally Knyvette]]. She is one of the titular Lords, ruling over the vampires and is the second lord faced by the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont. She has a vampire \"daughter\" named Laura. Before sacrificing her soul to heaven, she was known to be a kind woman who loved all of Earth's creatures, and became the opposite as a Lord of Shadow. This is a marked departure from the description of her in life in the original novel. However, the explicit sexuality sometimes attributed to her (seen especially in Castlevania: Judgment) is a direct (albeit exaggerated) reference to her characterization in the novel. She appears again in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', albeit with a different appearance.\n\nShe appears in the ''Castlevania'' animated series, voiced by [[Jaime Murray]], having a distinct disloyalty to Dracula as she considered him a madman whose genocidal vendetta against the humans is threatening their race. She tricks Hector into helping in her attempt to take out Dracula, taking the human as her slave during the aftermath in the season two finale.\n\n===Ferryman===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ferryman'''|\u6e21\u3057\u5b88|Watashimori}} is a character whose task is to carry people across dangerous rivers. He takes characters to \"meet their destiny\". He first appeared in ''Simon's Quest'' helping Simon reach Rover Mansion. He was later seen in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (and its remake, ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles|The Dracula X Chronicles]])'', ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and '' [[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness|Legacy of Darkness]]''.\n\n==''The Adventure'' and ''Belmont's Revenge''==\n{{main|Castlevania: The Adventure|Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge}}\n\n===Christopher Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Christopher Belmont'''|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Kurisutof\u0101 Berumondo|Christopher Belmondo}} starred in three ''Castlevania'' games as a protagonist, two for the Game Boy system and one for the Wii. The two Game Boy games were ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]''. In the latter, Christopher has to rescue his son, Soleil Belmont, after he was kidnapped by Count Dracula. He appears in Nintendo Wii's ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth]]''. He also was the protagonist in the limited ''Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy'' comic book series released by IDW Publishing. Christopher was a pre-existing character in the ''Castlevania'' universe even before the games he starred in were released, as he is mentioned by name in the Japanese manual for the first Famicom ''Castlevania'' title, as the last Belmont to have defeated Dracula, a hundred years before Simon.\n\n===Soleil Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Soleil Belmont'''|\u30bd\u30ec\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Soreiyu Berumondo|Soleil Belmondo}} appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]'', which was released for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] in 1991.  He was called Soleiyu in the original release of ''Belmont's Revenge'' and was later correct to Soleil (French for sun) in the 1998 [[Konami GB Collection#Vol. 3|re-release]] of the game for the European market.\n\nIn 1591, Soleil, who recently celebrated his coming of age, was captured by [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s minions and bewitched to do the Count's evil bidding. With the youth's help, Dracula was able to take human form once again. Christopher Belmont, his father, ultimately rescued him.\n\n==''Dracula's Curse'' and ''Curse of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania: Curse of Darkness|Castlevania (TV series)}}\n\n===Trevor Belmont===\n'''Trevor Belmont''', known as {{nihongo|'''Ralph C. Belmondo'''|\u30e9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fbC\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rarufu Sh\u012b Berumondo}} in Japan, appears in ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'', ''Castlevania: Judgment'', ''Akumajo Dracula Pachislot'', and is a supporting character in ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]].''\n\nTrevor defeated Dracula in ''Castlevania III''. This was accomplished with the aid of Grant Danasty, Sypha Belnades and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]. He would later marry Sypha Belnades and have children with her, adding the prodigious magical powers of the Belnades line to the Belmont line, which would be most prominently seen in [[List of Castlevania characters#Juste Belmont|Juste Belmont]].\n\nHe later plays a secondary role in ''Curse of Darkness'', where he is investigating the rise of Dracula in the region. He confronts the Devil Forgemaster Hector, and although he initially treats Hector with contempt, he aids him in his quest. After being injured by Isaac, Julia LaForeze gets to him in time, but he is unable to do anything for the remainder of the battle. Meanwhile, Hector succeeds in stopping Isaac and sending Dracula's castle back into the abyss, effectively lifting the curse placed three years prior. So, despite his nearly fatal defeat, Trevor's mission was accomplished. In the game, he is unlocked after beating the game with Hector.\n\nHe, along with Sypha Belnades and Grant Danasty, later makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' when zombies impersonate the trio to antagonize [[Alucard Tepes|Alucard]]. The same zombie impersonators also appear in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' when [[List of Castlevania characters#Jonathan Morris|Jonathan Morris]] and Charlotte Aulin trek the Nest of Evil.\n\nBy Simon Belmont's era (as shown in ''Castlevania: Judgment''), Trevor Belmont is looked up to by his future descendants, along with his wife Sypha, his ally Alucard and his friend Grant, known as the \"Greatest Three\". This pushes Simon, who is trapped in the Time Rift, to seek them to prove his worthiness.\n\nIn the ''Lords of Shadow'' series, Trevor is the son of Gabriel Belmont. He makes his debut in ''Mirror of Fate'' where it is revealed that, under orders from Pan, who foresaw Gabriel's turn to darkness, Trevor's existence was kept secret from his father by the Brotherhood of Light, and he was not told of his parentage until adulthood. Shamed by his lineage, he ventured to Dracula's castle to defeat his father and avenge his mother, but falls to Dracula and is impaled by his own combat cross. The Mirror of Fate reveals the truth of his father's circumstances to Trevor, leading him to pity Dracula and reveal his identity as he dies. Horrified, Dracula attempts to revive Trevor by making him drink his blood, but seemingly fails. Never knowing Trevor's true name, Dracula buries him within his castle in a coffin bearing the name \"Alucard\". Trevor reawakens thirty years later as a vampire, taking the name engraved on the coffin. He returns in the sequel ''Lords of Shadow 2'' where he plays an important part in his father's journey of redemption.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Trevor is the last of House Belmont; a noble house whose dedication in protecting the citizens of Wallachia led to the Church excommunicating them and evicting them from their ancestral lands (as they were accused of practicing black magic.) He first appears as a lazy drunkard, though eventually sobers to reveal his great skill in slaying monsters.\n\nTrevor is voiced by [[Richard Madden]] in ''Mirror of Fate'' and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Grant Danasty===\n{{nihongo|'''Grant Danasty'''|\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30ca\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3|Guranto Danasuti}} is a character in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A young [[pirate]] (listed as an acrobat in the ending sequence of the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and skilled knife fighter whose ship was corrupted by Dracula's magic, he was transformed into a demon and took over a clock tower in Wallachia. When defeated by Trevor Belmont, he became human again and decided to travel with Trevor to Dracula's castle. After Dracula's defeat, he oversaw the restoration of the lands that had been affected by Dracula's evil. In ''[[Castlevania Judgement]]'', it is revealed that he had loved Sypha and wanted to marry her. Because of this, he was jealous toward Trevor and chose not to go to their wedding. While rebuilding the nation, he ended up in a time rift and was challenged to fight several champions. He believed that the time rift would give him a chance to change history, allowing him to marry Sypha instead. But his encounters led to battle with both Sypha and Trevor. After defeating them, he learned to forgive his friend. After Grant was returned to his own time, he was later remembered not as the one who had helped defeat Dracula but as the man who had rebuilt Wallachia. Despite this, Simon Belmont is clearly shown to remember him as one of the \"Greatest Three\", forever linked to the Belmont Family as a dear friend of his ancestors and a strong warrior. His surname is likely a reference to the historical [[House of D\u0103ne\u015fti]], who were persecuted by the historical Vlad III. Dracula is very similar to Vlad the Impaler in game, and is said to have killed Grant\u2019s family. This mirrors the real life Vlad Dracula who killed the whole D\u0103ne\u015fti Clan, who were the cousins of the family Vlad\u2019s grandfather usurped.\n\nWhile he has yet to appear in the Animated Series, Grant is referenced in Season 3 by both Trevor Belmont and Saint Germain, said to have \"a Horse-Drawn Sail-Boat on wheels and called himself 'The Pirate of the Roads'\". Writer Warren Ellis has confirmed this to be a nod to the character.\n\n===Sypha Belnades===\n{{nihongo|'''Sypha Belnades'''|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Saifa Verunandesu}} appears in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A [[priest]]ess (although she introduces herself as a vampire hunter to Trevor in the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and [[witch]] of the church who uses elemental magic in battle, Sypha hid her gender to become a vampire hunter. She fought for the church to destroy evil, though her sister witches were hunted down by the church. She went on a journey to confront and destroy Dracula. On her way to the battle, she ended up in the Time Rift and decided to take it upon herself to defeat those tainted by darkness, despite which side they were on. Upon the defeat of the Time Reaper, she was returned to her own era (Judgment). She continued her journey to destroy Dracula, but was defeated by his minion, the [[Cyclops]], and imprisoned in stone. She was freed when Trevor Belmont killed the Cyclops and aided Trevor in his battle against Dracula. After Dracula's death, she and Trevor married, adding her magical [[aptitude]] to the Belmont bloodline.\n\nIn the manual included with the Japanese ''Dracula's Curse'', it is stated that she lost her parents when she was young and was found wandering near a monastery in Wallachia. She was adopted by the monks there. Judgment elaborates that she belonged to a coven of witches who were executed as a result of Dracula's scheming. In the Judgment storyline, it is revealed that Grant actually carried a torch for her since their first meeting in Castlevania, but lacking the resolve to confess to her his feelings, he lets her slip into Trevor Belmont's arms. Despite this, Sypha is said to have missed her friend when he chose to refuse his invitation to her marriage, patching up their friendship only after Grant's return from the Rift. Despite this brief moment of confusion, Sypha, Grant and Trevor are known in Belmont history as ''The Greatest Three'', friends and warriors supreme, an example to all her descendants to follow.\n\nIn ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'', Sypha Belmont, n\u00e9e Belnades, is the wife of Trevor and the mother of Simon. She tries to comfort Trevor when he learns of his parents' fate, and sees him off as he ventures forth to battle Dracula. Following Trevor's death, Dracula's forces are unleashed and she is attacked, telling Simon to escape as she is killed by one of Dracula's werewolves. Years later, her soul is found by Simon beneath Dracula's castle, though he is unaware of her identity, and she joins him to protect him on his quest.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Sypha is a member of a group of nomad scholars known as the Speakers who are demonized by the Church as they are falsely accused causing the attacks conducted by Dracula's army. She seeks out the \"sleeping soldier\" that she hopes will stop Dracula's attack, only to be turned to stone by a cyclops before being saved by Trevor Belmont, who helps her find Alucard and release him from his prison. In the Belmont estate's repository of knowledge, she finds an incomplete spell meant to force Dracula's castle to appear in a given place and trap it there. Completing the spell, she successfully casts it, allowing the trio to confront Dracula. After Alucard drives a wooden stake through Dracula's heart and Trevor beheads him, Sypha burns what's left with her magic.\n\nShe is voiced by Charlotte Emerson in ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'' and Alejandra Reynoso in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Alucard===\n{{Main|Alucard (Castlevania)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Alucard'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Aruk\u0101do}} is Dracula's only child, the half-vampire son of the count and a human woman named Lisa. He appears in Castlevania III, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Judgment & Legends, and stars in Symphony of the Night. He is voiced by [[Robert Belgrade]] (Symphony of the Night) and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (all other roles). A reference to the 1940s movie \"Son of Dracula\", Alucard is \"Dracula\" spelled backwards. This is a title Alucard seems to have adopted for himself, as his actual full name is Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f.\n\nAlucard also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]].\n\nAlucard appears in ''[[Mirror of Fate]]'', the second game in the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot series. It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, before being turned into a vampire. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that Dracula murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him, in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace. During the fight, Trevor is defeated and stabbed with his Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate, he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, feeling confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula tries to bring him back to life by making him drink his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later, Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the Brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.\n\nAlucard also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', playing an important role in his father's journey of redemption. He is playable in the DLC ''Revelations'' taking place shortly prior to the events of the main game. In the ''Lords of Shadow'' series Alucard is voiced by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' actor [[Richard Madden]].\n\nAlucard also appears in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]] voiced by [[James Callis]]. He opposes Dracula's mission to eradicate humanity, but loses their first confrontation, forcing him into slumber to heal his wounds. He is awakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after testing them in battle, joins them in a quest to stop Dracula.\n\n===Hector===\n{{nihongo|'''Hector'''|\u30d8\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Hekut\u0101}} is the devil forgemaster and the main protagonist of ''Curse of Darkness''. He betrayed Dracula and left for a normal life. He took back his devil forgemaster powers to defeat Isaac and once again bring peace back to the land. The player controls Hector in the normal play mode. He has silver hair and wields a war hammer or sword.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series (voiced by [[Theo James]]) Hector is portrayed as a forgemaster for Dracula's castle, creating monsters from dead corpses. As a child, he was beaten and isolated for his penchant of resurrecting dead animals as pets. After burning down his house (parents included), he worked to perfect his craft in Necromancy, leading to his eventual recruitment into Dracula's Castle.\n\n===Isaac===\n{{nihongo|'''Isaac'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b6\u30c3\u30af|Aizakku}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is Hector's villainous rival who stayed loyal to Dracula after Trevor defeated him a few years before the start of the game. The player will fight Isaac a few times over the course of the game.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series, (voiced by [[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]]), Isaac is portrayed as a former African slave who was whipped regularly for small offenses. His suffering led to him developing a complete disdain for humanity, and soon kills his master. Working as one of Dracula's generals, his loyalty comes from Dracula treating him with far more respect than any other human.\n\n===Julia Laforeze===\n{{nihongo|'''Julia Laforeze'''|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bc|Juria Rafor\u0113ze}} is Isaac's sister and a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. She provides items for the player in a shop. Hector notes she bears a resemblance to Rosaly, his deceased lover.\n\n===Saint Germain===\n{{nihongo|'''Saint Germain'''|\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30de\u30f3|Sanjeruman}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is a person against Death. He can travel through time. He constantly asks Hector to abandon his quest, but never succeeds.  He does fight Hector at one point in the game. His name is likely a reference to [[Comte de Saint-Germain|the historical figure of the same name]].\n\nHe is voiced by [[Bill Nighy]] in the animated series.\n\n===Angela===\n'''Angela''' is a magical dancing girl from the Akumajo Dracula Pachislot games. She aids Ralph C. Belmont on his quest to stop Dracula, who has prematurely risen again. She casts a spell that annihilates a horde of skeletons and during Ralph's battle with Dracula, she is able to use magic to resuscitate him to continue the battle.\n\n===Lenore===\n\nLenore is one of the four members in the Council of Sisters in Netflix's animated series. She is in charge of watching over their slave Hector and convincing him to forge them an army. Going against Carmilla, Lenore then gives Hector clothes and moves him to a candle-lit cell with a desk and a blanket. Over time, Hector falls for Lenore's charms. She tricks Hector by slipping a magic ring onto his finger as they are having sex, which enslaves him. Lenore presents the council with rings she had forged to make Hector's night creatures loyal to them. The ring will also instantly kill Hector if he attempts to run away from them. She is voiced by [[Jessica Brown Findlay]].\n\n===Sumi and Taka===\n\nIn Netflix's animated series, Sumi and Taka are Japanese vampire hunters who travel to Transylvania to be trained by Alucard. They were once enslaved by a vampire named Ch\u014d, who actually enlisted into Dracula's army, but was killed by Alucard in the previous season finale. Alucard originally suspected they were thieves but began to bond with them, going as far as showing them the Belmont Hold. While he was in his bed one night, they entered his room and proceeded to have sex with him, but they then suddenly restrain Alucard by using a trap. Taka and Sumi accuse Alucard of witholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. Following their betrayal, Alucard is later seen prostate and weeping on the floor. The series ends with Alucard at the castle's entrance, where he has left the impaled bodies of Sumi and Taka as a warning to future visitors. Sumi is voiced by [[Rila Fukushima]] and Taka is voiced by Toru Uchikado.\n\n==''Kid Dracula''==\n{{main|Kid Dracula (1990 video game)}}\nKid Dracula is a lighthearted spinoff of the Castlevania series set sometime in the distant future. In Japan, the series is called ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula Special: Boku Dracula-kun''. Though elements from the series have been referenced throughout the main Castlevania series, the series has not been listed on any timeline published by Konami.\n\n===Kid Dracula===\n'''Kid Dracula''' is a 10,009 year old being and the lord of Castlevania. He had to retake the castle from Galamoth to return to his throne. In the Game Boy sequel, Kid Dracula defeated Galamoth a second time after the being attempted to capture the castle again. Throughout the series, Kid Dracula makes references to his \"father\", hinting at him to be an alternative version of Alucard.\n\nIn ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kid Dracula's shadow can sometimes be seen in the background of the Dracula's Castle stage, and he can also be obtained as a collectible Spirit.\n\n===Galamoth===\n{{nihongo|'''Galamoth'''|\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u30ac\u30e9\u30e2\u30b9|Daima\u014d Garamosu}} (aka Garamoth) is the Lord of Space. He is originally from the Kid Dracula series. Sometime in the distant future, Galamoth tried to take over the Dracula's Castle to become the new Demonlord, but was defeated by Kid Dracula (Kid Dracula Famicom/Mobile phones). He tried to retake the castle again, but was defeated a second time (Kid Dracula GB). Galamoth later appeared as an optional boss in Symphony of the Night, located in the Floating Catacombs. Galamoth appeared in Aria of Sorrow as a soul that allowed Soma Cruz to see past areas blocked by time.\n\nHe is referred to by name in ''Castlevania Judgment'' when the Time Reaper is defeated. He is implied to be the one who sent the Time Reaper back 10,000 years into the past destroy Dracula and erase history.\n\n==''Rondo of Blood'' and ''Symphony of the Night''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Castlevania: Symphony of the Night}}\n\n===Richter Belmont===\n[[File:richter-rondosotn.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Richter Belmont, as he appears in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (top) and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' (bottom).]]\n{{nihongo|'''Richter Belmont'''|\u30ea\u30d2\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rihit\u0101 Berumondo|Richter Belmondo}} has starred as a protagonist in ''Castlevania: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes), ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal'' (an arcade medallion slot game). His first appearance is the main character in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''.  In ''Symphony of the Night'', a direct sequel which takes place five years later, he became a brainwashed primary antagonist; however, completing the game unlocks an option to play the entire game as Richter. However, there is an alternate ending to ''Symphony of the Night'' that suggests that he was the cause of Dracula's return. He is also playable in an extra mode in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.\n\nHero of the ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'' games and a major character in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', Richter had to battle legions of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s monsters to save his love interest Annette. In ''Symphony of the Night'', Richter mysteriously disappears upon investigating Dracula's recently reconstructed castle. It is later revealed that he was brainwashed by Shaft, a dark priest and servant of Dracula. Players will end up facing Richter: killing him will result in one of two bad endings, whereas saving him will continue the game.\n\nIn his first two appearances, as well as the prologue for the third, Richter wears a headband and a blue uniform. In ''Symphony of the Night'', only in the Saturn version following the prologue, his hair is noticeably longer and his attire appears more regal. He also gains a few new abilities, notably a dash, a slide attack, and a super jump that doubles as an uppercut.\n\nIn ''Portrait of Ruin'', Jonathan Morris fights a recreation of Richter (called \"Whip's Memory\") in a test created by Stella and Loretta Lecarde to unlock the Vampire Killer's full power, as he is the last known Belmont to wield the whip before [[List of characters in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]] killed Dracula in 1999. Richter also appears in the game as one of the Five Greatest. Richter appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a playable character alongside his ancestor Simon.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nRichter is voiced by [[David Vincent (voice actor)|David Vincent]] in the PSP remake of ''Rondo of Blood'', the PSP version of ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. His height is 5\u20194 in game, however in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, he is 5\u20196.\n\n===Maria Renard===\n{{nihongo|'''Maria Renard'''|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\uff65\u30e9\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c9|Maria R\u0101neddo}} is a local village girl with the power to control the [[Four Symbols (China)]] of [[Chinese mythology]]. She appears in the PC Engine video game ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula X: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for PSP and ''Castlevania Dracula X'' for Super NES), as well as in ''Symphony of the Night'', ''Castlevania Judgment'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal''. She is a distant blood relative of the Belmont clan<ref>{{cite web |title=''Rondo of Blood'' manual |website=The CastleVania Dungeon |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/rondomanual.html |access-date=2006-08-15}}</ref><ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 21</ref> (no mention of that connection is to be found in ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles]]'', where she is instead said to be the daughter of a local lord). In the Super NES version of ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', she's also said to be the sister of Richter's beloved Annette, a detail that's not alluded to in the other games. She was later adopted by the Belmont family in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn 1792, Maria's parents were killed, and she was captured, along with several other young women, and taken to Dracula's castle. Richter Belmont saved Maria from Shaft, one of Dracula's servants, who was attempting to cast a spell on her. Once Maria is rescued, she becomes playable and uses various magically enhanced animal attacks for combat. There exists an ending in which Maria confronts and defeats the Count instead of Richter. In the introduction sequence to ''Symphony of the Night'' (a retelling of the final boss battle ''Rondo of Blood''), if Richter's health completely runs out, a 12-year-old Maria will appear and amplify Richter with her magic in his effort to defeat Dracula. ''Judgment'' further explains that she fought alongside Richter in defeating Dracula and has power that rivals the Belmonts. Unlike Annette, if you fail to save her in ''Rondo of Blood'', you will not face her at the end.\n\nFour years after the defeat of Dracula, Richter vanished. Maria immediately set out to find him. After a year of searching, in 1797, she finally found Castlevania. In the castle she learned that Richter was working in concert with the dark forces.  With Maria's help, the half-vampire [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] was able to break Shaft's hold on Richter and defeat Dracula. Depending on certain player actions in Symphony, the player will receive different endings. In one, Maria will admit to not being able to live without Alucard and go after him. In another, she will resign herself due to the fact that she cannot ease his torment and returns home with Richter.\n\nMaria also appears in ''Judgment,'' with a more bratty personality. She constantly trips and miscalculates her powerful magics, for comedic effect, and she acts mostly unaware of the Time Rift's nature, for example believing that Simon and Trevor merely stole the Vampire Killer from her friend Richter. She is also seemingly obsessed with her young age and diminutive body, going so far to openly complain against Carmilla and Shanoa for their developed bodies, and claim that Sypha's large breasts are a \"gift from God\", lashing out to her for suggesting that her beauty may pose a liability in combat.\n\n===Shaft===\n{{nihongo|'''Shaft'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8|Shafuto}} is a dark priest that appears as antagonist in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Akumaj\u014d Dracula X Chi no Rondo]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''. In 1792, Shaft aids [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] in his plans to kidnap several young women. He is defeated by Richter after conjuring several [[monsters]] in an attempt to defeat him. Later in the game, Shaft's ghost makes a final attempt to stop the hero.\n\nIn 1797, Dracula's monsters kidnap Richter and [[brainwashing|brainwash]] him. Shaft is instrumental in using his evil powers to control Richter, turning him against anyone who seeks to defy Dracula. Maria guesses that he is under their influence and helps Alucard to see past Shaft's deception. Alucard is able to save Richter instead of killing him, and goes on to defeat Shaft, although not before Shaft successfully revives Dracula just before being stopped for good.\n\n===Annette===\n{{nihongo|'''Annette'''|\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Anetto}} is Richter's fianc\u00e9e.  In ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''\u2014and also ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for the PSP\u2014she was kidnapped by Dracula's minions, along with Maria, Iris, and Terra. Failing to save her will result in having to face her as a possessed vampiress in ''Dracula X'' and ''The Dracula X Chronicles''. In the English localization of the SNES game ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', her name was spelled as \"'''Anett'''\" during the game's intro storyline. Depicted as a purple haired young girl in her original ''Rondo of Blood'' design, she was redesigned as a blonde in the same way as Maria, and wearing more aristocratic attire in ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and in ''Chronicles'' for the PSP.\n\n===Iris and Tera===\n{{nihongo|'''Tera'''|\u30c6\u30e9|Tera}} is the head nun of Richter's village, and {{nihongo|'''Iris'''|\u30a4\u30ea\u30b9|Irisu}} is the doctor's daughter. They were kidnapped by Dracula's minions to taunt Richter, along with Annette and Maria. Tera sees Richter as a warrior of God and Maria as angel sent by Heaven, thanking them both for saving her. Iris, being a doctor's daughter, helps heal the wounds of the duo when they rescue her as a show of thanks.\n\n===Lisa===\n{{nihongo|'''Lisa'''|\u30ea\u30b5|Risa}} is Alucard's mother and Dracula's second wife, seeing past her husband's personality to see the lonely man he truly is. She was executed on the charge of witchcraft after healing villagers with [[penicillin]], spurring Dracula's genocidal vendetta against humanity. Alucard witnessed her death and promised her not to hate humans and tells Dracula she will love him for eternity, which Alucard relays in ''Symphony of the Night''.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, her story remains the same with the exception that she was accused of witchcraft because she reverse engineered the more advanced technology Dracula possessed to improve the lives of the Wallachian people which the church condemned as the devil's work.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Emily Swallow]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Golem===\n'''[[Golem]]''' is a recurring character found throughout the Castlevania series. His first appearance was in Rondo of Blood.<ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 24</ref> Golem was originally created by Carmilla to be a mindless guard of ancient ruins. When he was pulled into the time rift by Aeon, the rift gives him self-awareness. He fought the champions to become human, and discover the meaning of his existence. He lost his self-awareness, after being returned to his own time frame (Castlevania Judgment). IGA says he is based on Golem-type monsters, like the Franken, from Castlevania I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii |author=Adam Riley |date=November 7, 2008 |work=Cubed3 |publisher= |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Master Librarian===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Master [[Librarian]]'''|\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u4e3b|Toshokan no Aruji}} is the loyal servant of Dracula in charge of the knowledge of the library.

He is a descendant of the Belmont family, and wields the Vampire Killer whip, much like his ancestors. John died some time after the events of ''Bloodlines'', as it was revealed his wounds wouldn't heal. This was caused by his using the [[Vampire Killer whip]], which would sap the strength of someone that was not a full-blooded descendant of the Belmont lineage, but by the time John learned this, it was too late.\n\n''Bloodlines'' is deeply intertwined with the storyline of Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]].  As such, the father of John Morris is Quincy Morris, a character from the novel. It is only known that the Morrises are somehow of Belmont lineage. In the novel, Quincy stabs Dracula at the cost of his life, while Harker cuts off Dracula's head. However, that fact he managed to unknowingly deal a crippling blow to Dracula may have been the foundation for his part in the ''Castlevania'' version of these events.\n\n===Eric Lecarde===\n{{nihongo|'''Eric Lecarde'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Erikku Rik\u0101do}} appears in Bloodlines, Portrait of Ruin, and Judgment. Born on May 3, 1892 in Segovia, Spain, he uses the Alucard Spear (mistranslated as \"Alcarde Spear\" in ''Bloodlines''). The spear was created by Alucard to complement the power of the Vampire Killer, and fight alongside the Morris line. When Elizabeth Bartley attempted to revive Dracula, Eric volunteered to fight alongside his friend John Morris in the hunt. However, he had not told John the real reason behind his appetite for vengeance: the Countess turned the love of his life, Gwendolyn, into a vampire.\n\nYears later, Eric set out towards Dracula's Castle to investigate its reappearance, but was slain by the vampire Brauner. Unbeknownst to him, Eric's daughters had followed him into the castle and bore witness to his death, but both were then bitten by Brauner and turned into vampires. Unable to cross into the afterlife, Eric's ghost remained in the castle and was later met by Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin. Initially calling himself \"Wind\", Eric tested the pair's abilities with various side-quests. After being confronted by Jonathan following a skirmish with Stella, in which a locket holding a photo of him and his daughters was recovered, Eric disclosed his true identity and the full story behind himself, his daughters, and Jonathan's father. Once his daughters are rescued and Brauner and Dracula are both destroyed, Eric appears before his friends and family and gives them one last heartfelt moment together before crossing over into the afterlife.\n\nIn ''Judgment'', Eric believed that the spear's potential was greater than the whip, and sought to prove that. While training he found himself in a time rift, having been brought there by Aeon. Eric believed the rift would give him a chance to prove the spear's potential against the Vampire Killer. After the defeat of Galamoth he was returned to his own time (Judgment).\n\n===Elizabeth Bartley===\nAccording to the game's story, {{nihongo|'''Elizabeth Bartley'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc|Erisab\u0113to B\u0101tor\u012b}} is Dracula's niece, raised back from the dead by her servant {{nihongo|Drolta Tzuentes|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c6\u30a2\u30fb\u30c4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9|Dorotea Tsentesu}}. She triggered the start of [[World War I]] by assassinating the Crown Prince of Austria, then gathered the souls of those who died in the war to revive Dracula. In the final stage, she initially fights John and Eric in the form of a Medusa, then attacks with elemental spells before ultimately being killed.\n\nShe is based on the actual Countess [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]], and was likely intended to ''be'' her, as B\u00e1thory's first name is commonly anglicized to \"Elizabeth\", and the name \"Bartley\" likely being a mistranslation.\n\n===Drolta Tzuentes===\n\n'''Drolta Tzuentes''' is a subservient witch of [[List of Castlevania characters#Elizabeth Bartley|Elizabeth Bartley]] (the American ''Castlevania: Bloodlines'' instruction book gives contradictory information, saying that she is an \"amateur witch\" who \"casts a spell which inadvertently brings Elizabeth Bartley back to life\"), who resurrects her master. Drolta then accompanies Elizabeth in their plot to resurrect Count Dracula.\n\nDrolta Tzuentes is based on Dorottya Szentes (Dorottya Semt\u00e9sz) who is one of the servants of [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]] (the historical version of Elizabeth Bartley) who, along with 2 others, are said to have been tried, convicted, and executed as accomplices to the crimes down by the noblewoman.\n\n===Jonathan Morris===\n{{nihongo|'''Jonathan Morris'''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30ea\u30b9|Jonasan Morisu}} is a member of the Morris family of vampire hunters and appears in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''. The wielder of the Vampire Killer in 1944, Jonathan received basic training from his father John Morris as a child. He tends to be a reckless youth, a trait which makes his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin worry about his well being much of the time. He can, however, be very observant. After his father died, Jonathan grew to resent him, though neither he nor Charlotte knew that the soul-sapping effects of a non-Belmont using the Vampire Killer in battle resulted in his death.\n\nAfter learning the truth about his father and the Vampire Killer from Eric, Jonathan gained a new found respect for his father. Jonathan may then choose whether or not to battle the whip's memory of Richter Belmont, the last Belmont to wield the whip, and successfully unleash the full power of the Vampire Killer, knowing full well that he may perish from using it, though it is up to the player to decide whether to engage this optional encounter, and the canonical choice is unknown. Regardless, Jonathan and Charlotte traveled to the top of Dracula's Castle, and battled the combined forces of Count Dracula and [[Death (Castlevania)|Death]], which had not previously occurred before according to Charlotte. When Dracula was vanquished, his castle was destroyed and Jonathan and the others escaped unscathed.\n\n===Charlotte Aulin===\n{{nihongo|'''Charlotte Aulin'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|Sh\u0101rotto \u014crin}} is a magic user said to be descended from the Belnades clan. She shows strong potential as a sorceress. Along with Jonathan, she ventures into the castle to destroy Dracula. She is a smart girl who relies on enchanted books for information, to cast spells, and to summon weapons for close-range attacks. She also tends to be a nosy and talkative person, which is how she found out about Jonathan and the Vampire Killer, something which, according to Jonathan, she was supposed to keep secret. Charlotte is concerned about Jonathan's ability to wield the whip and assists him with the best she can, but she hates getting treated as (or even being called) a child. She tends to take things rationally and logically, which makes her seem unemotional but she is in fact a caring and compassionate young woman.\n\n===Brauner===\n{{nihongo|'''Brauner'''|\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|Bur\u014dneru}} is a famous painter who forsook his humanity after losing his daughters during World War I. Now a vampire, he screams for vengeance upon humanity for their deaths.\n\nWhen Dracula's Castle first appeared, Brauner used his special paintings to keep Dracula sealed so that he could keep the dark lord's power all for himself. Eric Lecarde set off to investigate the castle, but was ambushed by Brauner and slain. At the same time, Eric's daughters Stella and Loretta arrived to bear witness to their father's death, and Brauner bit both girls so as to turn them into his new vampiric \"daughters\".\n\nWhen Jonathan and Charlotte finally confront Brauner, he flies into a rage over having lost his \"daughters\" again and attacks the pair. As he is defeated, Brauner explains the reasons for his actions, but is then slain by Death in order to revive Dracula.\n\n===Stella and Loretta===\n{{nihongo|'''Stella'''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9|Sutera}} and {{nihongo|'''Loretta'''|\u30ed\u30ec\u30c3\u30bf|Roretta}} are the daughters of Eric Lecarde, the older sister Stella being a master swordswoman with powerful wind-based attacks while Loretta wields powerful ice spells while serving as Stella's support. The vampire Brauner believe the two of them to be the reincarnations of his deceased daughters, having turned them to vampires and subjected them to a spell that causes their past lives to take control of them.\n\nBrauner's \"daughters\" initially prevent Jonathan and Charlotte from investigating the castle. After a short fight with Stella, the two learn of the sisters' true identities when they find a locket containing a picture with both girls and Eric Lecarde, prompting Eric's ghost to reveal what happened to his daughters. The four of them later confront each other in the highest areas of the castle. While it is possible to kill the sisters (triggering a bad ending), Jonathan and Charlotte must use the \"Sanctuary\" spell to restore Stella and Loretta to their true selves. Their minds and humanity restored, the sisters open a door that leads to Brauner's studio and also offer Jonathan a way to unlock the true power of the Vampire Killer.\n\nUpon defeating Dracula, Jonathan, Charlotte, Stella, and Loretta escape the castle, where Eric appears before them and tells his daughters to not burden themselves over their actions and move. Eric passes to the other side, leaving Stella and Loretta in tears, but they soon recover and thank Jonathan and Charlotte.\n\nStella and Loretta are playable in \"Sisters Mode\", which takes place before the main game and chronicles their search for their missing father. Unlike Jonathan and Charlotte, the player use the stylus to attack and the D-Pad to move them around, as they can also fly. As Stella, the player attacks enemies by slicing enemies with the stylus, and as Loretta, the player points at enemies to shoot a beam of ice.\n\n===Vincent Dorin===\n{{nihongo|'''Vincent Dorin'''|\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3|Vinsento Dorin}} is a [[priest]] that serves as the game merchant. Jonathan and Charlotte meet him in front of the castle and then near the entrance. Vincent is a rather greedy person, even if he explains that it is for the church. He also get bitten during the game and begs the two heroes to cure him (the player can choose to cure him or not, and while it affects the ending, it is not something noticeable). Even when cured, he isn't as much in debt concerning his merchandise.\n\nHis name was reused for an abbot in the reboot, ''Lords of Shadow''. He went insane by isolating himself and protecting a priceless artifact, while his townspeople were being slaughtered by supernatural creatures.\n\n==''Castlevania (Nintendo 64)'' and ''Legacy of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness}}\nIGA claimed in 2006 that ''Castlevania'' and ''Legacy of Darkness'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] were considered side projects to his timeline.<ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |title=Tales From The Crypt: Castlevania 20th Anniversary Blowout from |publisher=1UP.com |date=1997-10-31 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215534/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> However, the games were later listed on the 20th Anniversary Timeline, without any description.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/314073086/in/set-72157594405290664/ |title=DSC01722 &#124; Flickr \u2013 Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as \"...a Castlevania \"gaiden\" (subseries)\" and complemented them by stating \"...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world.\"<ref>Nintendo Power, July 2008</ref>  Iga later included Cornell in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008) (drawn from his era of the timeline by magical forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php?option=com_altcaster&task=viewaltcast&altcast_code=9cfac7534b&ipod=y |title=Viewer \u2013 Konami's E3 press conference |publisher=Coveritlive.com |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>). The game and manual makes references to Legacy of Darkness story.

Legacy of Darkness is said to be Cornell's previous appearance in the manual.<ref>\"Appearances: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\", Castlevania Judgment manual, pg 23</ref>\n\n===Reinhardt Schneider===\nThough the Belmont surname may no longer follow {{nihongo|'''Reinhardt Schneider'''|\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30ca\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Rainharuto Shunaid\u0101}}, the blood inside of his veins remains the same, and his destiny is no different. He is the son of Michael Gelhart Schneider. Villagers have been found mutilated and drained of blood near Dracula's castle, and Reinhardt has to stop it.  He carries the typical Vampire Killer whip but can also wield a shortsword for close-range combat for which the whip may prove unsuitable; although the surname \"Schneider\" usually carries the same connotation as does the English surname \"Tailor,\" its literal translation from German is the more general \"one who cuts.\"\n\nHe is voiced by Andrew Hanikson.\n\n===Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez===\n{{nihongo|'''Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Kyar\u012b Verunandesu}} is a magic-wielding girl descended from the Belnades clan. She was estranged from the populace of Wallachia for her affinity with magic, her mother dying to protect her from an angry mob. She turned her back on others, but when she learned that Dracula had once again risen, she took it upon herself to use her powers to stop him. She is Camilla Fern\u00e1ndez's cousin, who is also captured by a vampire and turned into one.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Bianca Allen]].\n\n===Actrise===\n{{nihongo|'''Actrise'''|\u30a2\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30bb|Akutor\u012bse}} is a Dracula's [[Witchcraft|witch]] servant, she sacrificed her own child to become immortal. She plays an antagonist role in Carrie's quest, offering her a chance to join Dracula, in which Carrie refuses. In the Castle Center, Actrise sics a Fern\u00e1ndez warrior, who became a vampire, on Carrie in an attempt to stop her from reaching Dracula. After Carrie defeats her cousin, she and Actrise do battle on top of one of the castle towers, in which Actrise is overwhelmed and killed by Carrie. She also appears in Cornell's quest and taunts him, and is revealed to be responsible for turning Henry's father into a vampire.\n\n===Rosa===\n{{nihongo|'''Rosa'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|R\u014dze|Rose}} is a woman who was recently turned into a [[vampire]]. She meets Reinhardt and Carrie in the Villa, watering flowers with blood. She plays a major role in Reinhardt's quest. She is seen next attempting to kill herself, walking into sunlight. Reinhardt stops her. She is then encountered with Death in the Castle Center in which she and Reinhardt do battle. She is defeated by him but is spared before Death takes her away. When Death ambushes Reinhardt, Rosa sacrifices herself by throwing herself into the path of Death's scythes. Rosa is comforted by Reinhardt as she dies, and then Death is defeated by a vengeful Reinhardt. In the end, after Dracula's defeat, Rosa is seen restored into human form and she and Reinhardt look upon Dracula's sunken castle.\n\n===Gilles de Rais===\n{{nihongo|'''Gilles de Rais'''|\u30b8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Jiru Dore}} is one of Dracula's servants. He used Cornell's power to reincarnate his master in the body of Malus. He later disguises himself as Dracula in preparation for his lord's eventual resurrection and kidnapped children to offer them as sacrifice and thus resurrect his master. He is later defeated by Reinhardt and Carrie in Dracula's throne room, where it is revealed he was an imposter.\n\n===Renon===\n{{nihongo|'''Renon'''|\u30ec\u30ce\u30f3|Renon}} is a demonic salesman who appears intermittently throughout the game. He claims that \"one needs gold even in Hell these days\", and will gladly sell the player various power-ups such as spells and potions. Renon can be summoned by picking up a contract scroll that appears in various levels. The scroll then turns into an open briefcase. If the player spends more than 30,000 gold pieces before encountering Dracula, Renon transforms into his demon form and attempts to claim your soul for Hell.\n\n===Charles Vincent===\n{{nihongo|'''Charles Vincent'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u30d3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8|Ch\u0101ruzu Vinsento}} is a vampire hunter. His mannerisms seem to indicate that he is very intelligent, but lacks real experience with vampires or other evils. Charles plays a key role in the game.\n\nIf the player takes less time in reaching the Castle Keep and defeats Dracula for the first time, he changes back into Malus, but Charles douses him with holy water, before Dracula warps the player to an alternate dimension for the final battle. After Dracula's defeat, Charles' fate is unknown.\n\nHowever, if the player takes more time in reaching the Castle Keep, Charles will arrive before them. He will fail in his attempt to subdue Dracula, and will be turned into a vampire instead. The player will be forced to fight and kill Charles. If this happens, then the heroes will not see through Dracula's illusions and ultimately fail in their quest.\n\n===Cornell===\n{{nihongo|'''Cornell'''|\u30b3\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|K\u014dneru}}, also known as \"Blue Crescent Moon\", is a [[werewolf]] seen in both ''[[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''. He is a member of a warrior clan cursed to turn into beastmen. He is the only member of his clan who had the ability to control his change. He was the only one of his brethren who refused to join the forces of Dracula. He honed his skills in the hopes of finding a cure for his clan and to protect his sister Ada. One day while out training he found himself unable to control his powers and was stuck in beast form (''Castlevania Judgement''). He encountered Aeon, a time traveler, who told him he had entered a time rift. Aeon challenged him, and told him the time rift would let him learn more about the nature of the curse. After encountering several champions from different eras, he learns from Camilla and Death that they still need him, and is told that there is a possibility of a cure for him (though he doesn't trust them). After the defeat of the Time Reaper, Cornell was returned to his own era, 1844. He returned to find his village in flame, and his sister Ada kidnapped. He then journeyed after the kidnappers to save his sister. He discovered that Dracula's castle had risen again, and that his fellow man-beast Ortega had kidnapped his sister. During his battles he saves the young Henry Oldrey, and later defeats Ortega. He learned from Ortega, that Death, Gilles De Rais, and Actrise had plotted the kidnapping of Ada to empower a newly raised Dracula. Dracula later reveals to the audience that his sister is not a blood relative. Cornell fights Dracula to save her causing Dracula to be pulled into a vortex of energy. Dracula traps Cornell with his last power and tries to take Ada with him. The beast within Cornell freed itself from his body and saves Ada, but is captured and pulled into the vortex by Dracula. Cornell had become fully human, and was able to live the rest of a normal life with Ada (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nAccording to IGA, \"I believe many people did not expect to see Cornell. I really wanted to include a beast man type character, so I picked him.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii #1 at Nintendo Cubed3 |publisher=Cubed3.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\nHe is voiced by John Nuzzo (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nA new version of Cornell appears in Lords of Shadow, voiced by [[Richard Ridings]]. He is the Dark Lord of the Lycans and the first Lords of Shadow Gabriel encounters.\n\n===Ortega===\n{{nihongo|'''Ortega'''|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c6\u30ac|Orutega}} grew up in the same village as Cornell, a fellow man-beast, being a friend of his, but also a rival. The rivalry caused Ortega an increasing amount of frustration, as he was constantly being outdone on every occasion, and he started searching for a way to gain the kind of powers that would make him stronger than even Cornell.\n\nThis search led him on the path of darkness, as the only one able to grant him the request proved to be Dracula. As a condition for gaining the new powers, Dracula demanded of Ortega to aid his demons on their mission to kidnap Cornell's sister Ada and destroy the village. He was also to stop Cornell from rescuing Ada. Ortega accepted these conditions, and thus sealed his pact with the devil, gaining amazing power, but losing his humanity.\n\nOrtega eventually fights Cornell as a Chimera on top one of the castle towers, but is defeated by him. Ortega accepts his defeat, but with his powers becoming out of control, he leaps off the castle tower to his death.\n\n===Henry Oldrey===\n{{nihongo|'''Henry Oldrey'''|\u30d8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc|Henr\u012b Orudor\u0113}} is the son of Mary and J.

Nathan has been chosen by Morris to be the successor of the Hunter Whip. He encounters many of Carmilla's cohorts, such as {{nihongo|Necromancer|\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc|Nekuromans\u0101}}, before saving his master from lord Dracula .\n\n===Hugh Baldwin===\n{{nihongo|'''Hugh Baldwin'''|\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3|Hy\u016b B\u014drudowin}} is the son of Morris and Nathan's rival. Hugh envies Nathan for being chosen by his father for possession of the Hunter Whip. However, Nathan does not reciprocate his hate, and often tries to reason with him.

He is responsible for unwillingly triggering the events that take place in 1748, during ''Harmony of Dissonance'', by wishing to relieve Juste of his fate and become more powerful than he is. Inspired by the tale of Simon Belmont, Maxim gathered the cursed remains of Count Dracula so he could destroy them, and in doing so created an evil Maxim in his soul that hungered for power and destruction like Dracula did.\n\nIn the best ending, Juste helps Maxim overcome his dark influence by wearing their bracelets as a reminder of their friendship. Though not at full power, the evil Maxim takes Dracula's remains (gathered by Juste during his quest) and turns into a ghostly incarnation of Dracula (Dracula Wraith), then into a giant creature made of the body parts before finally being slain. Maxim is restored to normal afterwards.\n\nMaxim is playable in a secret gameplay mode of ''Harmony of Dissonance''. His Stellar Sword is also an obtainable weapon in ''Portrait of Ruin''.

He lost both parents at a very young age, and was knighted at the age of 16. When his love interest Sara Trantoul is kidnapped by the vampire [[Walter Bernhard]] he enters the castle grounds unarmed, but is given a whip that is blessed with the power of alchemy by the old man Rinaldo Gandolfi, who lives on the grounds. Rinaldo also enchants Leon's left gauntlet with the power to absorb magical attacks. Using the whip and his magic gauntlet, he enters the castle hoping to rescue his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWithin the castle, Leon fights five guardians: Medusa, a Succubus, a Golem, the vampire [[Joachim Armster]] (Walter Bernhard's former ally), and an undead parasite. He gets a magical orb from each of them that unlocks the way to Walter's lair. When he gets past the initial barrier, Walter is there with Sara, who appears to be in some sort of trance. Walter returns Sara to Leon, who finds out that Sara has been tainted and will soon become a vampire. In an act of self-sacrifice, Sara offers her soul to Leon in a ritual that will make Rinaldo's magic whip deadly to vampires and thus allow Leon to defeat Walter. This is where the whip officially becomes \"Vampire Killer.\"  Leon, armed with the powerful whip, Rinaldo's grief, and his anger for Sara's death, defeats Walter. However, Walter's death was in actuality orchestrated by Leon's friend [[Mathias Cronqvist]] to get Walter's Soul, and absorb its powers to become a powerful vampire through the Crimson Stone, (an artifact that allowed a person to steal a Vampire's soul and make their power theirs, at the price of becoming a vampire themselves) and Vampire Killer can now sense his having abandoned Humanity. He offers Leon eternal life, which Leon refuses, saying that eternal life would be empty without Sara. Mathias then sends his servant Death after Leon, who is defeated by him and gives him a message to pass on to Mathias. Leon swears that his clan and the whip he now carries will destroy Mathias one day, and from that day onward the Belmont clan would hunt the night.  Mathias would later be known as [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nLeon appears in sprite form in Portrait of Ruin as one of the \"Greatest Five\".\n\n===Rinaldo Gandolfi===\n{{nihongo|'''Rinaldo Gandolfi'''|\u30ea\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc|Rinarudo Gandoruf\u012b}} is an alchemist whose daughter was taken and turned into a vampire by Walter Bernhard. He now lives in a small hut in the Forest of Eternal Night. Rinaldo creates the Whip of Alchemy for Leon to use in Walter's castle.

Having grown bored with eternal life, he decides to kidnap young maidens and play a game of Cat-and-mouse with the Hunters who come to rescue them, and attempt to destroy him. He is the antagonist of the game, luring the protagonist Baron Leon Belmont to his castle by kidnapping his fianc\u00e9e, Sara Trantoul. The forest where he lives is called Eternal Night, as it is covered in unending darkness by the means of a jewel called the \"Ebony Stone\".

Joachim has a hatred for Walter and what he has done to him. As well as being a minor boss character, the game includes an unlockable secret mode where Joachim is a playable character; he has the ability to summon flying swords of darkness.\n\n==''Order of Ecclesia''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia}}\n\n===Shanoa===\n{{main|Shanoa}}\n{{nihongo|'''Shanoa'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ce\u30a2|Shanoa}} appears in Order of Ecclesia and Castlevania Judgment. She is the most prodigious member of the Order of Ecclesia, a secret organization devoted to stop Dracula from reviving after the Belmont clan disappeared. She is also a glyph user, capable of absorbing sigil-like characters and using them as weapons. She is chosen by Barlowe to bear Dominus, a series of glyphs designed to destroy Dracula, but her fellow member Albus interferes during the ceremony and steals the glyphs. As a result, Shanoa becomes an amnesiac who is only able to simulate emotions (she cannot truly feel them).\n\nAfter being retrained by Barlowe, Shanoa is dispatched to seek out and retrieve Dominus from Albus by any means necessary. As she travels, she slowly learns Albus's true intentions and the dark reality behind Ecclesia, but she is unable to stop the return of Dracula. With nothing left to her except her mission, Shanoa enters Dracula's castle and destroys the evil count using Dominus.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]].\n\n===Albus===\n{{nihongo|'''Albus'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9|Arubasu}} is one of Ecclesia's veteran members. He wields a magically-infused [[flintlock]] [[pistol]] named Agartha that is capable of firing a variety of projectiles, and also has the ability to [[Warp drive|warp]] across short distances. Initially, Barlowe promised Albus that he would receive the Dominus seal, but changed his mind without his consent and chose Shanoa instead. After stealing Dominus from Ecclesia during the ceremony in which it was to be implanted within Shanoa, Albus flees with the glyph and becomes the enemy of Ecclesia. He spends much of the time researching the Dominus glyph and devising a way to incorporate it into himself. However, when he absorbs one part of the glyph (as he had given the other two away in order to observe how glyphs are absorbed) he is driven mad and Shanoa is forced to slay him.\n\nIf Shanoa kills Albus after rescuing all of the villagers, Albus will speak to her through Dominus and reveal his intentions in stealing the glyph. He had acted the way he did in order to protect Shanoa, who was raised as his younger sister, from the soul-stealing effects of the glyph, as channeling it would kill the user. He also has her promise not to use Dominus, as it would kill her. She also gains Albus' memories, some of which correlate with the ones she had lost. As it transpires, Albus's soul remains within Shanoa as she explores Dracula's castle, and he uses this opportunity to find a way to unlock her emotions, though her own memories are forever lost. When Shanoa uses Dominus to destroy Dracula, Albus offers his own soul as sacrifice, allowing Shanoa to live. Before his soul vanishes, Albus restores Shanoa's emotions and asks that she smile for him, which she manages through deep tears.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]].\n\n===Barlowe===\n{{nihongo|'''Barlowe'''|\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30a6|B\u0101rou}} is Ecclesia's leader, who has been tasked with seeking a way to combat Dracula's power in the absence of the Belmont clan. To this end, he created the Dominus glyph out of Dracula's power and was in the process of giving them to Shanoa when Albus interfered and made off with the glyphs. When Shanoa returns after learning the truth about Dominus and the cost for its use, Barlowe reveals that he himself has been corrupted by Dracula's power, and that his goal all along was to have Shanoa sacrifice her soul to Dracula through Dominus so the evil count can return once more. After Shanoa critically wounds him in battle, Barlowe uses the last of his strength to bring Dracula to life again.\n\n===Villagers of Wygol===\nIn her travels, Shanoa encounters villagers from a location called Wygol, whom Albus captures and takes blood from in his studies on Dominus. After being rescued, the villagers will offer various side-quests for Shanoa to complete in exchange for money and special items. Shanoa must rescue all thirteen of the villagers in order to continue the storyline after defeating Albus.\n\nAfter Albus's death, the villagers are revealed to be indirect descendants of the Belmont clan, and their blood is what allows Albus's soul to live within Shanoa after he himself is killed.\n\n==''Judgment''==\n{{main|Castlevania Judgment}}\nAccording to Iga, \"So as many of you know, the Castlevania timeline goes over 1000 years\", \"And there is a character trying to destroy that timeline.

He plotted to resurrect Dracula using a blood sacrifice and planned to serve at his side. However, the Belmont's and their allies were able to track down the order long before they were ready to revive the Dark Lord properly. He is defeated at the hand of Desmond, who indicated that he was only seeking the prevention of Dracula's revival, not revenge for what he had done to his father. Though his dreams of being one of Dracula's right hand men during his reign was shattered, his own blood was sufficient to raise his lord and Desmond had to battle an early risen Dracula shortly afterwards.\n\n==''Lords of Shadow''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Lords of Shadow}}\n''Lords of Shadow'' is being described as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise;<ref>{{cite web| title = Castlevania: Lords of Shadow at E3 Press Conference| url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/210643/konami-announces-castlevania-lords-of-shadow-at-e3-press-conference/| publisher = [[GamePro]]| accessdate = 2009-05-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018024334/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/210643/konami-announces-castlevania-lords-of-shadow-at-e3-press-conference/|archivedate=2009-10-18}}</ref> it is not part of the main series' timeline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps3/lords_of_shadow/preview-1975.html |title=Lords of Shadow Interview for PS3 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>[http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1016610p1.html It doesn't follow any Castlevania timeline, says Cox, because Konami didn't want to limit the potential audience to the truly hardcore.]</ref>\n\n===Gabriel Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Gabriel Belmont'''|\u30ac\u30d6\u30ea\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Gaburieru Berumondo|Gabriel Belmondo}} is the central character of the ''Lords of Shadow'' series. He is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend the innocent against the supernatural. He learns of a Mask which has the power to bring back the dead, and contemplates on using it to revive his recently murdered wife.\n\nAs an infant he was found abandoned at the door of one of the Brotherhood of the Light convents. It is not known who his original parents were. Some suspect he was the unwanted child of a local wealthy landowner, most likely from the Cronqvist family, though this has never been proven. The Order named the boy after the blessed Archangel Gabriel and raised him as one of their own. The precocious child quickly proved to be extremely talented, developing a mastery of the fighting arts unprecedented in the Brotherhood. Gabriel took the surname of Belmont, due to his love for mountains and the high places of the world. The name Belmont is of French origin, and it means \"beautiful mountain\". The name is the union of two French words: ''bel'', meaning beautiful and ''mont'' meaning mountain.\n\nProne to dark moods and occasional ambivalence, Gabriel was deeply affected by the death of his childhood sweetheart, Marie. Gabriel has embarked on this journey at the request of the elders of the Brotherhood, rejecting the help of his comrades and stoking a burning desire for revenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/player/703749 |title=Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow Video Game, Preview Walkthrough HD |author= |date=August 28, 2010 |work=[[GameTrailers]] |publisher= |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.com/officialsites/castlevania/ |title=''Castlevania \u2013 Lords of Shadow'' Official Site |publisher=[[Konami]] |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204090917/http://www.konami.com/officialsites/castlevania/ |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}</ref> In a [[post-credits scene]], Gabriel is shown to have become the powerful vampire lord Dracula and subsequently the second game explores his quest for redemption and goal to put an end to his immortal existence.\n\nGabriel is voiced in all three games by Scottish actor [[Robert Carlyle]].\n\n===Zobek===\n{{nihongo|'''Zobek'''|\u30be\u30d9\u30c3\u30af|Zobekku}} is a mysterious swordsman who encourages Gabriel to use The Mask to bring back his dead wife Marie.\n\nIf the recorded chronicles of the Brotherhood are to be believed, Zobek is one of their longest serving warriors. The list of heroic deeds attributed to him is as impressive as his vast knowledge of the art of war or indeed the mighty fighting skills he can deploy, despite his age.\n\nHis weapon of choice is a simple long sword which he handles with skill and alacrity. Strangely, he likes to use an old-fashioned uniform of the Brotherhood of Light that, according to him, was inherited from one of his ancestors; one of the founding members of the Brotherhood of Light. In reality, he is the dark side left by one of the founding member of the order, the Lord of the Dead.

He is also the final boss.\n\nSatan's primary motivation seems to be to have his vengeance against God for being cast out of Heaven. He reveals himself as the manipulator of the first game's events in the end. After he is defeated by Gabriel Belmont, he drops the God Mask, which Gabriel uses to speak to his deceased wife for a short time. He reappears in ''Lords of Shadow 2'', where he serves as the main antagonist and final boss again. After his Acolytes manage to summon him to the mortal world, this time Satan chooses to possess Alucard, the son of Gabriel, who is now known as the powerful vampire Dracula. After his defeat, he flees from Alucard's body and is killed by Dracula, who uses his old Vampire Killer weapon to deliver the final blow.\n\nVoiced by [[Jason Isaacs]].\n\n===Victor Belmont===\nVictor Belmont is a descendant of Gabriel Belmont, although his exact relation is unknown.

However, hearing of his skill was Walter Bernhard, a member of the Bernhard family who offered the Toy Maker a place in his Castle to make his craft.\n\nIn time, the Toy Maker realized that Walter came from a family of dark occultists. Walter summoned a demon to possess the Toy Maker's kindly soul, thereby twisting his craft in the darkest way and making weapons of death and destruction, some being the Dark Pain, the Stopwatch, the Macabre Puppet, and Gargoyles.\n\nThe demon, however, was unable to completely corrupt the Toy Maker's soul, resulting in something of a split personality; the original kind old man and the childish, sadistic demon within. Sometime during this period, the Toy Maker was touched by the puppet of a child seeking to free his soul from the demon and escape Walter Bernhard. He then discovered he had regained his innocence and Walter removed his heart, putting the Toy Maker into a deep slumber.\n\nHis fate is unknown when Carmilla took over the castle, and only then until Gabriel Belmont, rechristened as Dracula, took over as well.\n\nVoiced by Mark Healy.\n\n===Agreus===\n\nAgreus is the brother of the deceased Pan, coming to Dracula's Castle to seek revenge against his killer, the vampire lord Dracula. First Agreus lures Dracula into the Castle's gardens with a fragment of the Mirror of Fate knowing that he would seek the fragment for his son Trevor Belmont. As Dracula attempts to claim the fragment, Agreus steals it from him and informs the vampire that he intends to avenge Pan's death. Dracula tries to reason with Agreus that his brother chose to sacrifice himself for a cause that he believed in, but Agreus retorts that Pan only died to serve his quest for power. Declaring that Dracula would pay for what he had done, Agreus retreats into the maze, goading the vampire to follow him.\n\nNow trapped inside the maze with the vengeful God, Dracula is forced to evade him in order to escape. Agreus taunts the vampire, claiming that he would relish hunting him down but Dracula manages to avoid him long enough to reclaim the fragment from his Owl Familiar. Enraged, Agreus vows to destroy Dracula and challenges him to a final battle. Eventually the two warriors tumble off the edge of the cliff but Dracula uses Agreus to break his fall. With the Old God weakened and unable to fight back, Dracula proceeds to crush Agreus' skull, killing him.\n\nVoiced by Aleksander Mikic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Castlevania series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Castlevania Series}}\n[[Category:Castlevania characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Konami characters|Castlevania]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Castlevania'' characters}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=July 2008}}\n{{overly detailed|date=February 2010}}\n}}\nListed below are characters from all of the ''[[Castlevania]]'' video games in the order of their introduction and the game's release.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==''Castlevania'' and ''Simon's Quest''==\n{{Main|Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania II: Simon's Quest}}\n\n===Dracula===\n{{Main|Dracula (Castlevania)}}\nThe main antagonist of the ''Castlevania'' series is {{nihongo|'''Dracula'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30ad\u30e5\u30e9|Dorakyura}}, based on the [[Count Dracula|original character]] by [[Bram Stoker]] and his depictions in film.<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\">{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/castlevania/258652/castlevania-a-dracula-masterpiece-90-years-in-the-making |title=Castlevania: A Dracula Masterpiece 90 Years in the Making |work=Den of Geek! |accessdate=September 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926200259/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/castlevania/258652/castlevania-a-dracula-masterpiece-90-years-in-the-making |archive-date=2018-09-26 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"CVStory\">{{cite web | title=Castlevania Storyline | url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/storyline.html | work=The Castlevania Dungeon | accessdate=2007-08-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718050007/http://www.castlevaniadungeon.net/storyline.html | archive-date=2009-07-18 | url-status=live }}</ref> His real name is Dracula Vlad Tepes, and is extimated to be over 800-years old by ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' (1997).<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\"/> With a few exceptions, he has starred in every title.<ref name=\"CVStory\"/> The series mainly takes place in the eponymous castle of Count Dracula,<ref name=\"DenOfGeek\"/> who resurrects every hundred years to take over the world.<ref>{{cite book| title=Castlevania Chronicles instruction manual| year=2001| publisher=Konami| id=SLUS-01384 | pages=4\u20135}}</ref> Players often assume the role of the Belmonts, a family of vampire hunters who have defeated Dracula for centuries with the Vampire Killer, a legendary whip.<ref name=\"IGNHistory\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/en/feature/21098/ign-presents-the-history-of-castlevania/4 |title=IGN Presents the History of Castlevania |last=Ciolek |first=Todd |date=February 25, 2014 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=March 6, 2014}}</ref> \n\nFirst seen in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' (1986), Dracula is a vampire who was once defeated by Christopher Belmont a hundred years ago in [[Transylvania]].<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\">{{cite book| title=Akumaj\u014d Dracula instruction manual| year=1986| publisher=Konami| language=Japanese| id=KDS-AKM | pages=5\u20138}}</ref> He rises from the dead after his followers hold a black mass.<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\"/> Christopher's descendant, Simon Belmont, enters Dracula's castle<ref name=\"Akumajo1Manual\"/> and defeats him.<ref name=\"NP250\"/> Later titles introduce Dracula's  son, the [[dhampir]] Alucard, who sided with Trevor Belmont against his father.<ref name=\"GameSpotCastlevaniaHistoryP5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p5_01.html |title=The History of Castlevania \u2013 Page 5 |website=[[GameSpot]] |author=Whalen, Mike |author2=Varanici, Giancarlo |date=September 10, 1998 |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705064549/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/history_castlevania/p5_01.html |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> In ''Symphony of the Night'', Alucard's mother was revealed to be Lisa, a human Dracula fell in love with.<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\">{{cite book| title=Castlevania: Symphony of the Night instruction manual| year=1997| publisher=Konami| language=English| id=SLUS-00067 | pages=9-12}}</ref> Her execution for false charges of witchcraft left him griefstricken.<ref name=\"SOTNManualCast\"/>\n\nThe 2010 reboot, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow]]'', reintroduces Dracula as Gabriel Belmont.

Death is often a boss fought toward the end of the game. He is considered Dracula's second-in-command and most trusted minion. Sometimes he has played an important role to the storyline, such as ''[[Castlevania: Lament of Innocence]]''. He is a playable character as the skeletal knight in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn most of his appearances, Death closely resembles the cultural personification of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]], being a legless skeleton in a hooded cloak with a [[scythe]]. Like Dracula, but in a lot fewer games, he can change into a second form upon being defeated in the game.\n\nHe is voiced by Dennis Falt in ''Symphony of the Night'', Patrick Seitz in ''The Dracula X Chronicles'' and ''Order of Ecclesia'', [[Douglas Rye]] in ''Judgment'' and [[Tom Wyner]] in earlier games. Death also appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nThe character of Zobek, Lord of the Dead (voiced by [[Patrick Stewart]]) in the reboot ''Castlevania: Lords of Shadow'' has been speculated to be the version of Death of this universe, due to his relationship with Dracula. Additionally, the Lord of the Necromancers is at one point referred to as \"Death itself\". In the game's [[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2|sequel]], when Gabriel Belmont is forced into a confrontation with Zobek sheds his human form and takes on a more traditionalized appearance of Death (including wielding a large scythe).\n\n===Simon Belmont===\n[[File:CVGoS Simon Belmont.png|thumb|right|Simon Belmont is the first protagonist to appear in the ''Castlevania'' series.]]\n{{nihongo|'''Simon Belmont'''|\u30b7\u30e2\u30f3\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Shimon Berumondo|Simon Belmondo}} is the first protagonist to appear in the series. He has appeared in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]'', ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]''.\n\nSimon initially kills Dracula in the year 1691, an event that is told in multiple games (''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'', ''[[Vampire Killer]]'', ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', ''[[Super Castlevania IV]]'', and ''[[Castlevania Chronicles]]''). In ''Castlevania II: Simon's Quest'', it is revealed that Dracula placed a curse on Simon and all of Transylvania after he was defeated by him. To break the curse, Simon must gather the remains of Dracula in order to burn them at the ruins of Dracula's castle &ndash; though the fact that this will cause Dracula to return is unknown to Simon (Dracula's Fang). In the best and canonical ending, Simon breaks the curse, and Transylvania recognizes his bravery, though it is hinted that Dracula will inevitably return, as his skinless hand rises from his grave. Simon is one of only two Belmonts to have faced Dracula twice in his lifetime, the other being his ancestor Christopher. \n\nIn ''[[Haunted Castle (video game)|Haunted Castle]]'', Simon is blue-haired and has a wife called Selena, who is kidnapped by Dracula directly after their marriage. It is actually unknown if this is Simon at all. The guide to the game calls him Simons, a descendant of the canonical  Simon, while a newsletter by Konami itself names him William. <ref>{{cite video|title=Game Simulation Video series: Akumaj\u014d Dracula (arcade version)|language=Japanese|url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/Images/Scans/HC/hctape.jpg}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Simon is the first Belmont to appear in a Castlevania game, in the Belmont lineage, [[Leon Belmont]] originates the direct bloodline of the clan. It can then be presumed that he is followed by Trevor, Christopher, Soleil, Simon, Juste, Richter, and then Julius. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance]]'', Simon is playable in the Boss Rush mode, looking exactly as he did in ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]''. In ''[[Castlevania: Harmony of Despair]]'', Simon is an extra character purchased as downloadable content, the sprite from the original game also being reused here. A special stage that recreates the game's castle layout can also be purchased.\n\nSimon Belmont appears in the rebooted series ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate]]'' (voiced by [[Alec Newman]]), as the son of Trevor Belmont, and grandson of Gabriel Belmont, later known as Dracula. He seeks revenge for the murder of his parents and throughout the game is unaware that Dracula is his grandfather.\n\nSimon's ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]'' incarnation (voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]]) was designed by ''[[Death Note]]'' artist [[Takeshi Obata]]. He has red-orange hair comparable to that of [[Light Yagami|Light Yagami]] (the protagonist of Death Note), a jacket with many belts on it that exposes his muscular chest, and bandages on his forearms. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=22836|title=Interview: Noisycroak On Traversing Castlevania's Musical Timeline}}</ref> Series director [[Koji Igarashi]] emphasized that these designs were different from what he envisioned, Simon in particular, but commented that this was how Obata envisioned them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2008/07/why-a-wii-fight|title=Why a Fighting Game?

He is depicted as an arrogant and egotistical vampire hunter who competes with the main character Kevin Keene for the heroine Princess Lana, who he carries a torch for.  Simon has a whip and a backpack of resources which he uses throughout the series. His appearance in the cartoon was met with criticism. Ben Rhudy of Monsters and Critics stated that he looks nothing like his video game counterpart, and that the show's creator [[DiC]] should have consulted the game before choosing this design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |title=DVD Review: Captain N The Game Master \u2013 The Complete Series |publisher=Monsters and Critics |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211054536/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/reviews/article_1262477.php/DVD_Review_Captain_N_The_Game_Master_-_The_Complete_Series |archivedate=December 11, 2013 }}</ref> Simon also appears in several games outside the ''Castlevania'' franchise including the 2003 [[GameCube]] crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[DreamMix TV World Fighters]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | date=January 12, 2004 | title=''World Fighters'' | url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405162602/https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/01/12/world-fighters | archive-date=April 5, 2014 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> the 2017 [[Nintendo Switch]] [[action game]] ''[[Super Bomberman R]]'',<ref>{{cite web | author=McWhertor | date=April 21, 2017 | title=Pyramid Head, Simon Belmont and Vic Viper coming to ''Bomberman'' for Switch | url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424020854/http://www.polygon.com/2017/4/21/15383898/super-bomberman-r-silent-hill-castlevania-gradius-characters-nintendo-switch-update | archive-date=April 24, 2017 | publisher=[[Vox Media]] | work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | accessdate=May 6, 2019}}</ref> and the 2018 Nintendo Switch crossover fighting game ''[[Super Smash Bros.

She is a servant of Dracula. Her name is a reference to the title character of the 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]'', which predated Bram Stoker's ''[[Dracula]]'' by 25 years. Her first appearance was as an antagonist in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref>Castlevania Judgement manual, pg 23</ref> She later reappeared in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', and ''[[Castlevania: Circle of the Moon]]'' (non-canon), and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.  She is a devoted worshiper of chaos and [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nIn 1830, she successfully resurrected Dracula in her [[Austria]]n castle, although he hadn't regained his full power.  To restore it, they planned to sacrifice the vampire hunter Morris Baldwin, father to Hugh Baldwin and mentor to Nathan Graves, during a [[lunar eclipse]] of the full moon.  As Nathan began making headway in the effort to rescue his master, Carmilla brainwashed Hugh to do her bidding and challenged Nathan to a battle in the Underground Waterway.  Although she died, Carmilla relished the fact that the rite to restore Dracula's power was nearly finished.\n\nCarmilla's appearances and names have differed. In ''Simon's Quest'', Carmilla was originally known as {{nihongo|Vampira|\u5973\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Jo Ky\u016bketsuki|lit. \"Female Vampire\"}} in the instruction manual, though the in-game hidden clue refers to her as Carmilla.  Her appearance was interpreted as a mask that leaked tears of blood. Until the release of ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla and her mask were available in the game as a [[boss (video games)|boss]]. This was the first time in the series she was referenced by the name.\n\nIn ''Rondo of Blood'', Carmilla has a blue-haired companion called {{nihongo|Laura|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}. Laura was the central protagonist and narrator from the original novel, ''Carmilla''. She is a particularly vicious non-boss enemy in ''Portrait of Ruin'', but is referred to as \"Carmilla's eternal servant\" in her bestiary entry. In the reboot ''Lords of Shadow'', Laura is Carmilla's daughter, who challenges the main character Gabriel with dangerous games. She appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a stage character, based on her appearance in ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]''.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nShe is voiced by [[Karen Strassman]] in ''Judgment''.\n\nIn the reboot of ''Lords of Shadow'', Carmilla is played by [[Sally Knyvette]]. She is one of the titular Lords, ruling over the vampires and is the second lord faced by the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont. She has a vampire \"daughter\" named Laura. Before sacrificing her soul to heaven, she was known to be a kind woman who loved all of Earth's creatures, and became the opposite as a Lord of Shadow. This is a marked departure from the description of her in life in the original novel. However, the explicit sexuality sometimes attributed to her (seen especially in Castlevania: Judgment) is a direct (albeit exaggerated) reference to her characterization in the novel. She appears again in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', albeit with a different appearance.\n\nShe appears in the ''Castlevania'' animated series, voiced by [[Jaime Murray]], having a distinct disloyalty to Dracula as she considered him a madman whose genocidal vendetta against the humans is threatening their race. She tricks Hector into helping in her attempt to take out Dracula, taking the human as her slave during the aftermath in the season two finale.\n\n===Ferryman===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Ferryman'''|\u6e21\u3057\u5b88|Watashimori}} is a character whose task is to carry people across dangerous rivers. He takes characters to \"meet their destiny\". He first appeared in ''Simon's Quest'' helping Simon reach Rover Mansion. He was later seen in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (and its remake, ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles|The Dracula X Chronicles]])'', ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' and '' [[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness|Legacy of Darkness]]''.\n\n==''The Adventure'' and ''Belmont's Revenge''==\n{{main|Castlevania: The Adventure|Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge}}\n\n===Christopher Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Christopher Belmont'''|\u30af\u30ea\u30b9\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Kurisutof\u0101 Berumondo|Christopher Belmondo}} starred in three ''Castlevania'' games as a protagonist, two for the Game Boy system and one for the Wii. The two Game Boy games were ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure]]'' and ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]''. In the latter, Christopher has to rescue his son, Soleil Belmont, after he was kidnapped by Count Dracula. He appears in Nintendo Wii's ''[[Castlevania: The Adventure ReBirth]]''. He also was the protagonist in the limited ''Castlevania: The Belmont Legacy'' comic book series released by IDW Publishing. Christopher was a pre-existing character in the ''Castlevania'' universe even before the games he starred in were released, as he is mentioned by name in the Japanese manual for the first Famicom ''Castlevania'' title, as the last Belmont to have defeated Dracula, a hundred years before Simon.\n\n===Soleil Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Soleil Belmont'''|\u30bd\u30ec\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Soreiyu Berumondo|Soleil Belmondo}} appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Castlevania II: Belmont's Revenge]]'', which was released for the [[Game Boy line|Game Boy]] in 1991.  He was called Soleiyu in the original release of ''Belmont's Revenge'' and was later correct to Soleil (French for sun) in the 1998 [[Konami GB Collection#Vol. 3|re-release]] of the game for the European market.\n\nIn 1591, Soleil, who recently celebrated his coming of age, was captured by [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s minions and bewitched to do the Count's evil bidding. With the youth's help, Dracula was able to take human form once again. Christopher Belmont, his father, ultimately rescued him.\n\n==''Dracula's Curse'' and ''Curse of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|Castlevania: Curse of Darkness|Castlevania (TV series)}}\n\n===Trevor Belmont===\n'''Trevor Belmont''', known as {{nihongo|'''Ralph C. Belmondo'''|\u30e9\u30eb\u30d5\u30fbC\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rarufu Sh\u012b Berumondo}} in Japan, appears in ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse]]'', ''Castlevania: Judgment'', ''Akumajo Dracula Pachislot'', and is a supporting character in ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]].''\n\nTrevor defeated Dracula in ''Castlevania III''. This was accomplished with the aid of Grant Danasty, Sypha Belnades and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]]. He would later marry Sypha Belnades and have children with her, adding the prodigious magical powers of the Belnades line to the Belmont line, which would be most prominently seen in [[List of Castlevania characters#Juste Belmont|Juste Belmont]].\n\nHe later plays a secondary role in ''Curse of Darkness'', where he is investigating the rise of Dracula in the region. He confronts the Devil Forgemaster Hector, and although he initially treats Hector with contempt, he aids him in his quest. After being injured by Isaac, Julia LaForeze gets to him in time, but he is unable to do anything for the remainder of the battle. Meanwhile, Hector succeeds in stopping Isaac and sending Dracula's castle back into the abyss, effectively lifting the curse placed three years prior. So, despite his nearly fatal defeat, Trevor's mission was accomplished. In the game, he is unlocked after beating the game with Hector.\n\nHe, along with Sypha Belnades and Grant Danasty, later makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' when zombies impersonate the trio to antagonize [[Alucard Tepes|Alucard]]. The same zombie impersonators also appear in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]'' when [[List of Castlevania characters#Jonathan Morris|Jonathan Morris]] and Charlotte Aulin trek the Nest of Evil.\n\nBy Simon Belmont's era (as shown in ''Castlevania: Judgment''), Trevor Belmont is looked up to by his future descendants, along with his wife Sypha, his ally Alucard and his friend Grant, known as the \"Greatest Three\". This pushes Simon, who is trapped in the Time Rift, to seek them to prove his worthiness.\n\nIn the ''Lords of Shadow'' series, Trevor is the son of Gabriel Belmont. He makes his debut in ''Mirror of Fate'' where it is revealed that, under orders from Pan, who foresaw Gabriel's turn to darkness, Trevor's existence was kept secret from his father by the Brotherhood of Light, and he was not told of his parentage until adulthood. Shamed by his lineage, he ventured to Dracula's castle to defeat his father and avenge his mother, but falls to Dracula and is impaled by his own combat cross. The Mirror of Fate reveals the truth of his father's circumstances to Trevor, leading him to pity Dracula and reveal his identity as he dies. Horrified, Dracula attempts to revive Trevor by making him drink his blood, but seemingly fails. Never knowing Trevor's true name, Dracula buries him within his castle in a coffin bearing the name \"Alucard\". Trevor reawakens thirty years later as a vampire, taking the name engraved on the coffin. He returns in the sequel ''Lords of Shadow 2'' where he plays an important part in his father's journey of redemption.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Trevor is the last of House Belmont; a noble house whose dedication in protecting the citizens of Wallachia led to the Church excommunicating them and evicting them from their ancestral lands (as they were accused of practicing black magic.) He first appears as a lazy drunkard, though eventually sobers to reveal his great skill in slaying monsters.\n\nTrevor is voiced by [[Richard Madden]] in ''Mirror of Fate'' and [[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Grant Danasty===\n{{nihongo|'''Grant Danasty'''|\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c0\u30ca\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3|Guranto Danasuti}} is a character in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A young [[pirate]] (listed as an acrobat in the ending sequence of the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and skilled knife fighter whose ship was corrupted by Dracula's magic, he was transformed into a demon and took over a clock tower in Wallachia. When defeated by Trevor Belmont, he became human again and decided to travel with Trevor to Dracula's castle. After Dracula's defeat, he oversaw the restoration of the lands that had been affected by Dracula's evil. In ''[[Castlevania Judgement]]'', it is revealed that he had loved Sypha and wanted to marry her. Because of this, he was jealous toward Trevor and chose not to go to their wedding. While rebuilding the nation, he ended up in a time rift and was challenged to fight several champions. He believed that the time rift would give him a chance to change history, allowing him to marry Sypha instead. But his encounters led to battle with both Sypha and Trevor. After defeating them, he learned to forgive his friend. After Grant was returned to his own time, he was later remembered not as the one who had helped defeat Dracula but as the man who had rebuilt Wallachia. Despite this, Simon Belmont is clearly shown to remember him as one of the \"Greatest Three\", forever linked to the Belmont Family as a dear friend of his ancestors and a strong warrior. His surname is likely a reference to the historical [[House of D\u0103ne\u015fti]], who were persecuted by the historical Vlad III. Dracula is very similar to Vlad the Impaler in game, and is said to have killed Grant\u2019s family. This mirrors the real life Vlad Dracula who killed the whole D\u0103ne\u015fti Clan, who were the cousins of the family Vlad\u2019s grandfather usurped.\n\nWhile he has yet to appear in the Animated Series, Grant is referenced in Season 3 by both Trevor Belmont and Saint Germain, said to have \"a Horse-Drawn Sail-Boat on wheels and called himself 'The Pirate of the Roads'\". Writer Warren Ellis has confirmed this to be a nod to the character.\n\n===Sypha Belnades===\n{{nihongo|'''Sypha Belnades'''|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d5\u30a1\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Saifa Verunandesu}} appears in ''Castlevania III'' and ''Castlevania: Judgment''. A [[priest]]ess (although she introduces herself as a vampire hunter to Trevor in the ''Castlevania III'' Japanese version) and [[witch]] of the church who uses elemental magic in battle, Sypha hid her gender to become a vampire hunter. She fought for the church to destroy evil, though her sister witches were hunted down by the church. She went on a journey to confront and destroy Dracula. On her way to the battle, she ended up in the Time Rift and decided to take it upon herself to defeat those tainted by darkness, despite which side they were on. Upon the defeat of the Time Reaper, she was returned to her own era (Judgment). She continued her journey to destroy Dracula, but was defeated by his minion, the [[Cyclops]], and imprisoned in stone. She was freed when Trevor Belmont killed the Cyclops and aided Trevor in his battle against Dracula. After Dracula's death, she and Trevor married, adding her magical [[aptitude]] to the Belmont bloodline.\n\nIn the manual included with the Japanese ''Dracula's Curse'', it is stated that she lost her parents when she was young and was found wandering near a monastery in Wallachia. She was adopted by the monks there. Judgment elaborates that she belonged to a coven of witches who were executed as a result of Dracula's scheming. In the Judgment storyline, it is revealed that Grant actually carried a torch for her since their first meeting in Castlevania, but lacking the resolve to confess to her his feelings, he lets her slip into Trevor Belmont's arms. Despite this, Sypha is said to have missed her friend when he chose to refuse his invitation to her marriage, patching up their friendship only after Grant's return from the Rift. Despite this brief moment of confusion, Sypha, Grant and Trevor are known in Belmont history as ''The Greatest Three'', friends and warriors supreme, an example to all her descendants to follow.\n\nIn ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'', Sypha Belmont, n\u00e9e Belnades, is the wife of Trevor and the mother of Simon. She tries to comfort Trevor when he learns of his parents' fate, and sees him off as he ventures forth to battle Dracula. Following Trevor's death, Dracula's forces are unleashed and she is attacked, telling Simon to escape as she is killed by one of Dracula's werewolves. Years later, her soul is found by Simon beneath Dracula's castle, though he is unaware of her identity, and she joins him to protect him on his quest.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, Sypha is a member of a group of nomad scholars known as the Speakers who are demonized by the Church as they are falsely accused causing the attacks conducted by Dracula's army. She seeks out the \"sleeping soldier\" that she hopes will stop Dracula's attack, only to be turned to stone by a cyclops before being saved by Trevor Belmont, who helps her find Alucard and release him from his prison. In the Belmont estate's repository of knowledge, she finds an incomplete spell meant to force Dracula's castle to appear in a given place and trap it there. Completing the spell, she successfully casts it, allowing the trio to confront Dracula. After Alucard drives a wooden stake through Dracula's heart and Trevor beheads him, Sypha burns what's left with her magic.\n\nShe is voiced by Charlotte Emerson in ''Lords of Shadow \u2013 Mirror of Fate'' and Alejandra Reynoso in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Alucard===\n{{Main|Alucard (Castlevania)}}\n{{nihongo|'''Alucard'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Aruk\u0101do}} is Dracula's only child, the half-vampire son of the count and a human woman named Lisa. He appears in Castlevania III, Aria of Sorrow, Dawn of Sorrow, Judgment & Legends, and stars in Symphony of the Night. He is voiced by [[Robert Belgrade]] (Symphony of the Night) and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (all other roles). A reference to the 1940s movie \"Son of Dracula\", Alucard is \"Dracula\" spelled backwards. This is a title Alucard seems to have adopted for himself, as his actual full name is Adrian Fahrenheit \u0162epe\u015f.\n\nAlucard also appeared in ''[[Captain N: The Game Master]]'' voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]].\n\nAlucard appears in ''[[Mirror of Fate]]'', the second game in the ''[[Lords of Shadow]]'' reboot series. It is revealed that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, before being turned into a vampire. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that Dracula murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him, in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace. During the fight, Trevor is defeated and stabbed with his Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate, he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, feeling confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula tries to bring him back to life by making him drink his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later, Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father turned him into a vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the Brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.\n\nAlucard also appears as a supporting character in the sequel, ''[[Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2]]'', playing an important role in his father's journey of redemption. He is playable in the DLC ''Revelations'' taking place shortly prior to the events of the main game. In the ''Lords of Shadow'' series Alucard is voiced by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' actor [[Richard Madden]].\n\nAlucard also appears in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]] voiced by [[James Callis]]. He opposes Dracula's mission to eradicate humanity, but loses their first confrontation, forcing him into slumber to heal his wounds. He is awakened by Trevor Belmont and Sypha Belnades, and after testing them in battle, joins them in a quest to stop Dracula.\n\n===Hector===\n{{nihongo|'''Hector'''|\u30d8\u30af\u30bf\u30fc|Hekut\u0101}} is the devil forgemaster and the main protagonist of ''Curse of Darkness''. He betrayed Dracula and left for a normal life. He took back his devil forgemaster powers to defeat Isaac and once again bring peace back to the land. The player controls Hector in the normal play mode. He has silver hair and wields a war hammer or sword.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series (voiced by [[Theo James]]) Hector is portrayed as a forgemaster for Dracula's castle, creating monsters from dead corpses. As a child, he was beaten and isolated for his penchant of resurrecting dead animals as pets. After burning down his house (parents included), he worked to perfect his craft in Necromancy, leading to his eventual recruitment into Dracula's Castle.\n\n===Isaac===\n{{nihongo|'''Isaac'''|\u30a2\u30a4\u30b6\u30c3\u30af|Aizakku}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is Hector's villainous rival who stayed loyal to Dracula after Trevor defeated him a few years before the start of the game. The player will fight Isaac a few times over the course of the game.\n\nIn the ''Castlevania'' animated series, (voiced by [[Adetokumboh M'Cormack]]), Isaac is portrayed as a former African slave who was whipped regularly for small offenses. His suffering led to him developing a complete disdain for humanity, and soon kills his master. Working as one of Dracula's generals, his loyalty comes from Dracula treating him with far more respect than any other human.\n\n===Julia Laforeze===\n{{nihongo|'''Julia Laforeze'''|\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fb\u30e9\u30d5\u30a9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bc|Juria Rafor\u0113ze}} is Isaac's sister and a [[Witchcraft|witch]]. She provides items for the player in a shop. Hector notes she bears a resemblance to Rosaly, his deceased lover.\n\n===Saint Germain===\n{{nihongo|'''Saint Germain'''|\u30b5\u30f3\u30b8\u30a7\u30eb\u30de\u30f3|Sanjeruman}} appears in Curse of Darkness and Akumajo Dracula Pachislot. He is a person against Death. He can travel through time. He constantly asks Hector to abandon his quest, but never succeeds.  He does fight Hector at one point in the game. His name is likely a reference to [[Comte de Saint-Germain|the historical figure of the same name]].\n\nHe is voiced by [[Bill Nighy]] in the animated series.\n\n===Angela===\n'''Angela''' is a magical dancing girl from the Akumajo Dracula Pachislot games. She aids Ralph C. Belmont on his quest to stop Dracula, who has prematurely risen again. She casts a spell that annihilates a horde of skeletons and during Ralph's battle with Dracula, she is able to use magic to resuscitate him to continue the battle.\n\n===Lenore===\n\nLenore is one of the four members in the Council of Sisters in Netflix's animated series. She is in charge of watching over their slave Hector and convincing him to forge them an army. Going against Carmilla, Lenore then gives Hector clothes and moves him to a candle-lit cell with a desk and a blanket. Over time, Hector falls for Lenore's charms. She tricks Hector by slipping a magic ring onto his finger as they are having sex, which enslaves him. Lenore presents the council with rings she had forged to make Hector's night creatures loyal to them. The ring will also instantly kill Hector if he attempts to run away from them. She is voiced by [[Jessica Brown Findlay]].\n\n===Sumi and Taka===\n\nIn Netflix's animated series, Sumi and Taka are Japanese vampire hunters who travel to Transylvania to be trained by Alucard. They were once enslaved by a vampire named Ch\u014d, who actually enlisted into Dracula's army, but was killed by Alucard in the previous season finale. Alucard originally suspected they were thieves but began to bond with them, going as far as showing them the Belmont Hold. While he was in his bed one night, they entered his room and proceeded to have sex with him, but they then suddenly restrain Alucard by using a trap. Taka and Sumi accuse Alucard of witholding his knowledge of magic from them and not teaching them how to operate the castle. Before they can stake him, he uses his sword to slit their throats. Following their betrayal, Alucard is later seen prostate and weeping on the floor. The series ends with Alucard at the castle's entrance, where he has left the impaled bodies of Sumi and Taka as a warning to future visitors. Sumi is voiced by [[Rila Fukushima]] and Taka is voiced by Toru Uchikado.\n\n==''Kid Dracula''==\n{{main|Kid Dracula (1990 video game)}}\nKid Dracula is a lighthearted spinoff of the Castlevania series set sometime in the distant future. In Japan, the series is called ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula Special: Boku Dracula-kun''. Though elements from the series have been referenced throughout the main Castlevania series, the series has not been listed on any timeline published by Konami.\n\n===Kid Dracula===\n'''Kid Dracula''' is a 10,009 year old being and the lord of Castlevania. He had to retake the castle from Galamoth to return to his throne. In the Game Boy sequel, Kid Dracula defeated Galamoth a second time after the being attempted to capture the castle again. Throughout the series, Kid Dracula makes references to his \"father\", hinting at him to be an alternative version of Alucard.\n\nIn ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'', Kid Dracula's shadow can sometimes be seen in the background of the Dracula's Castle stage, and he can also be obtained as a collectible Spirit.\n\n===Galamoth===\n{{nihongo|'''Galamoth'''|\u5927\u9b54\u738b\u30ac\u30e9\u30e2\u30b9|Daima\u014d Garamosu}} (aka Garamoth) is the Lord of Space. He is originally from the Kid Dracula series. Sometime in the distant future, Galamoth tried to take over the Dracula's Castle to become the new Demonlord, but was defeated by Kid Dracula (Kid Dracula Famicom/Mobile phones). He tried to retake the castle again, but was defeated a second time (Kid Dracula GB). Galamoth later appeared as an optional boss in Symphony of the Night, located in the Floating Catacombs. Galamoth appeared in Aria of Sorrow as a soul that allowed Soma Cruz to see past areas blocked by time.\n\nHe is referred to by name in ''Castlevania Judgment'' when the Time Reaper is defeated. He is implied to be the one who sent the Time Reaper back 10,000 years into the past destroy Dracula and erase history.\n\n==''Rondo of Blood'' and ''Symphony of the Night''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Castlevania: Symphony of the Night}}\n\n===Richter Belmont===\n[[File:richter-rondosotn.jpg|right|thumb|120px|Richter Belmont, as he appears in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Rondo of Blood]]'' (top) and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night|Symphony of the Night]]'' (bottom).]]\n{{nihongo|'''Richter Belmont'''|\u30ea\u30d2\u30bf\u30fc\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Rihit\u0101 Berumondo|Richter Belmondo}} has starred as a protagonist in ''Castlevania: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes), ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal'' (an arcade medallion slot game). His first appearance is the main character in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''.  In ''Symphony of the Night'', a direct sequel which takes place five years later, he became a brainwashed primary antagonist; however, completing the game unlocks an option to play the entire game as Richter. However, there is an alternate ending to ''Symphony of the Night'' that suggests that he was the cause of Dracula's return. He is also playable in an extra mode in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''.\n\nHero of the ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'' games and a major character in ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'', Richter had to battle legions of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]]'s monsters to save his love interest Annette. In ''Symphony of the Night'', Richter mysteriously disappears upon investigating Dracula's recently reconstructed castle. It is later revealed that he was brainwashed by Shaft, a dark priest and servant of Dracula. Players will end up facing Richter: killing him will result in one of two bad endings, whereas saving him will continue the game.\n\nIn his first two appearances, as well as the prologue for the third, Richter wears a headband and a blue uniform. In ''Symphony of the Night'', only in the Saturn version following the prologue, his hair is noticeably longer and his attire appears more regal. He also gains a few new abilities, notably a dash, a slide attack, and a super jump that doubles as an uppercut.\n\nIn ''Portrait of Ruin'', Jonathan Morris fights a recreation of Richter (called \"Whip's Memory\") in a test created by Stella and Loretta Lecarde to unlock the Vampire Killer's full power, as he is the last known Belmont to wield the whip before [[List of characters in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow#Julius Belmont|Julius Belmont]] killed Dracula in 1999. Richter also appears in the game as one of the Five Greatest. Richter appears in the 2018 crossover [[fighting game]] ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a playable character alongside his ancestor Simon.<ref name=\"SmashBros\"/>\n\nRichter is voiced by [[David Vincent (voice actor)|David Vincent]] in the PSP remake of ''Rondo of Blood'', the PSP version of ''Symphony of the Night'', and ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate''. His height is 5\u20194 in game, however in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, he is 5\u20196.\n\n===Maria Renard===\n{{nihongo|'''Maria Renard'''|\u30de\u30ea\u30a2\uff65\u30e9\u30fc\u30cd\u30c3\u30c9|Maria R\u0101neddo}} is a local village girl with the power to control the [[Four Symbols (China)]] of [[Chinese mythology]]. She appears in the PC Engine video game ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula X: Rondo of Blood'' (and its remakes ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for PSP and ''Castlevania Dracula X'' for Super NES), as well as in ''Symphony of the Night'', ''Castlevania Judgment'', and ''Akumaj\u014d Dracula: The Medal''. She is a distant blood relative of the Belmont clan<ref>{{cite web |title=''Rondo of Blood'' manual |website=The CastleVania Dungeon |url=http://castlevaniadungeon.net/games/rondomanual.html |access-date=2006-08-15}}</ref><ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 21</ref> (no mention of that connection is to be found in ''[[Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles]]'', where she is instead said to be the daughter of a local lord). In the Super NES version of ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood#Castlevania: Dracula X|Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', she's also said to be the sister of Richter's beloved Annette, a detail that's not alluded to in the other games. She was later adopted by the Belmont family in ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''.\n\nIn 1792, Maria's parents were killed, and she was captured, along with several other young women, and taken to Dracula's castle. Richter Belmont saved Maria from Shaft, one of Dracula's servants, who was attempting to cast a spell on her. Once Maria is rescued, she becomes playable and uses various magically enhanced animal attacks for combat. There exists an ending in which Maria confronts and defeats the Count instead of Richter. In the introduction sequence to ''Symphony of the Night'' (a retelling of the final boss battle ''Rondo of Blood''), if Richter's health completely runs out, a 12-year-old Maria will appear and amplify Richter with her magic in his effort to defeat Dracula. ''Judgment'' further explains that she fought alongside Richter in defeating Dracula and has power that rivals the Belmonts. Unlike Annette, if you fail to save her in ''Rondo of Blood'', you will not face her at the end.\n\nFour years after the defeat of Dracula, Richter vanished. Maria immediately set out to find him. After a year of searching, in 1797, she finally found Castlevania. In the castle she learned that Richter was working in concert with the dark forces.  With Maria's help, the half-vampire [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]] was able to break Shaft's hold on Richter and defeat Dracula. Depending on certain player actions in Symphony, the player will receive different endings. In one, Maria will admit to not being able to live without Alucard and go after him. In another, she will resign herself due to the fact that she cannot ease his torment and returns home with Richter.\n\nMaria also appears in ''Judgment,'' with a more bratty personality. She constantly trips and miscalculates her powerful magics, for comedic effect, and she acts mostly unaware of the Time Rift's nature, for example believing that Simon and Trevor merely stole the Vampire Killer from her friend Richter. She is also seemingly obsessed with her young age and diminutive body, going so far to openly complain against Carmilla and Shanoa for their developed bodies, and claim that Sypha's large breasts are a \"gift from God\", lashing out to her for suggesting that her beauty may pose a liability in combat.\n\n===Shaft===\n{{nihongo|'''Shaft'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30d5\u30c8|Shafuto}} is a dark priest that appears as antagonist in ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood|Akumaj\u014d Dracula X Chi no Rondo]]'' and ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]''. In 1792, Shaft aids [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] in his plans to kidnap several young women. He is defeated by Richter after conjuring several [[monsters]] in an attempt to defeat him. Later in the game, Shaft's ghost makes a final attempt to stop the hero.\n\nIn 1797, Dracula's monsters kidnap Richter and [[brainwashing|brainwash]] him. Shaft is instrumental in using his evil powers to control Richter, turning him against anyone who seeks to defy Dracula. Maria guesses that he is under their influence and helps Alucard to see past Shaft's deception. Alucard is able to save Richter instead of killing him, and goes on to defeat Shaft, although not before Shaft successfully revives Dracula just before being stopped for good.\n\n===Annette===\n{{nihongo|'''Annette'''|\u30a2\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8|Anetto}} is Richter's fianc\u00e9e.  In ''[[Castlevania: Rondo of Blood]]''\u2014and also ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and ''Dracula X Chronicles'' for the PSP\u2014she was kidnapped by Dracula's minions, along with Maria, Iris, and Terra. Failing to save her will result in having to face her as a possessed vampiress in ''Dracula X'' and ''The Dracula X Chronicles''. In the English localization of the SNES game ''[[Castlevania: Dracula X]]'', her name was spelled as \"'''Anett'''\" during the game's intro storyline. Depicted as a purple haired young girl in her original ''Rondo of Blood'' design, she was redesigned as a blonde in the same way as Maria, and wearing more aristocratic attire in ''Dracula X'' for the SNES and in ''Chronicles'' for the PSP.\n\n===Iris and Tera===\n{{nihongo|'''Tera'''|\u30c6\u30e9|Tera}} is the head nun of Richter's village, and {{nihongo|'''Iris'''|\u30a4\u30ea\u30b9|Irisu}} is the doctor's daughter. They were kidnapped by Dracula's minions to taunt Richter, along with Annette and Maria. Tera sees Richter as a warrior of God and Maria as angel sent by Heaven, thanking them both for saving her. Iris, being a doctor's daughter, helps heal the wounds of the duo when they rescue her as a show of thanks.\n\n===Lisa===\n{{nihongo|'''Lisa'''|\u30ea\u30b5|Risa}} is Alucard's mother and Dracula's second wife, seeing past her husband's personality to see the lonely man he truly is. She was executed on the charge of witchcraft after healing villagers with [[penicillin]], spurring Dracula's genocidal vendetta against humanity. Alucard witnessed her death and promised her not to hate humans and tells Dracula she will love him for eternity, which Alucard relays in ''Symphony of the Night''.\n\nIn the animated adaptation, her story remains the same with the exception that she was accused of witchcraft because she reverse engineered the more advanced technology Dracula possessed to improve the lives of the Wallachian people which the church condemned as the devil's work.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Emily Swallow]] in the [[Castlevania (TV series)|''Castlevania'' animated series]].\n\n===Golem===\n'''[[Golem]]''' is a recurring character found throughout the Castlevania series. His first appearance was in Rondo of Blood.<ref>Castlevania Judgement Manual, pg 24</ref> Golem was originally created by Carmilla to be a mindless guard of ancient ruins. When he was pulled into the time rift by Aeon, the rift gives him self-awareness. He fought the champions to become human, and discover the meaning of his existence. He lost his self-awareness, after being returned to his own time frame (Castlevania Judgment). IGA says he is based on Golem-type monsters, like the Franken, from Castlevania I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii |author=Adam Riley |date=November 7, 2008 |work=Cubed3 |publisher= |access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Master Librarian===\nThe {{nihongo|'''Master [[Librarian]]'''|\u56f3\u66f8\u9928\u306e\u4e3b|Toshokan no Aruji}} is the loyal servant of Dracula in charge of the knowledge of the library.

He is a descendant of the Belmont family, and wields the Vampire Killer whip, much like his ancestors. John died some time after the events of ''Bloodlines'', as it was revealed his wounds wouldn't heal. This was caused by his using the [[Vampire Killer whip]], which would sap the strength of someone that was not a full-blooded descendant of the Belmont lineage, but by the time John learned this, it was too late.\n\n''Bloodlines'' is deeply intertwined with the storyline of Bram Stoker's [[Dracula]].  As such, the father of John Morris is Quincy Morris, a character from the novel. It is only known that the Morrises are somehow of Belmont lineage. In the novel, Quincy stabs Dracula at the cost of his life, while Harker cuts off Dracula's head. However, that fact he managed to unknowingly deal a crippling blow to Dracula may have been the foundation for his part in the ''Castlevania'' version of these events.\n\n===Eric Lecarde===\n{{nihongo|'''Eric Lecarde'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30ea\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9|Erikku Rik\u0101do}} appears in Bloodlines, Portrait of Ruin, and Judgment. Born on May 3, 1892 in Segovia, Spain, he uses the Alucard Spear (mistranslated as \"Alcarde Spear\" in ''Bloodlines''). The spear was created by Alucard to complement the power of the Vampire Killer, and fight alongside the Morris line. When Elizabeth Bartley attempted to revive Dracula, Eric volunteered to fight alongside his friend John Morris in the hunt. However, he had not told John the real reason behind his appetite for vengeance: the Countess turned the love of his life, Gwendolyn, into a vampire.\n\nYears later, Eric set out towards Dracula's Castle to investigate its reappearance, but was slain by the vampire Brauner. Unbeknownst to him, Eric's daughters had followed him into the castle and bore witness to his death, but both were then bitten by Brauner and turned into vampires. Unable to cross into the afterlife, Eric's ghost remained in the castle and was later met by Jonathan Morris and Charlotte Aulin. Initially calling himself \"Wind\", Eric tested the pair's abilities with various side-quests. After being confronted by Jonathan following a skirmish with Stella, in which a locket holding a photo of him and his daughters was recovered, Eric disclosed his true identity and the full story behind himself, his daughters, and Jonathan's father. Once his daughters are rescued and Brauner and Dracula are both destroyed, Eric appears before his friends and family and gives them one last heartfelt moment together before crossing over into the afterlife.\n\nIn ''Judgment'', Eric believed that the spear's potential was greater than the whip, and sought to prove that. While training he found himself in a time rift, having been brought there by Aeon. Eric believed the rift would give him a chance to prove the spear's potential against the Vampire Killer. After the defeat of Galamoth he was returned to his own time (Judgment).\n\n===Elizabeth Bartley===\nAccording to the game's story, {{nihongo|'''Elizabeth Bartley'''|\u30a8\u30ea\u30b6\u30d9\u30fc\u30c8\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc|Erisab\u0113to B\u0101tor\u012b}} is Dracula's niece, raised back from the dead by her servant {{nihongo|Drolta Tzuentes|\u30c9\u30ed\u30c6\u30a2\u30fb\u30c4\u30a7\u30f3\u30c6\u30b9|Dorotea Tsentesu}}. She triggered the start of [[World War I]] by assassinating the Crown Prince of Austria, then gathered the souls of those who died in the war to revive Dracula. In the final stage, she initially fights John and Eric in the form of a Medusa, then attacks with elemental spells before ultimately being killed.\n\nShe is based on the actual Countess [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]], and was likely intended to ''be'' her, as B\u00e1thory's first name is commonly anglicized to \"Elizabeth\", and the name \"Bartley\" likely being a mistranslation.\n\n===Drolta Tzuentes===\n\n'''Drolta Tzuentes''' is a subservient witch of [[List of Castlevania characters#Elizabeth Bartley|Elizabeth Bartley]] (the American ''Castlevania: Bloodlines'' instruction book gives contradictory information, saying that she is an \"amateur witch\" who \"casts a spell which inadvertently brings Elizabeth Bartley back to life\"), who resurrects her master. Drolta then accompanies Elizabeth in their plot to resurrect Count Dracula.\n\nDrolta Tzuentes is based on Dorottya Szentes (Dorottya Semt\u00e9sz) who is one of the servants of [[Erzs\u00e9bet B\u00e1thory]] (the historical version of Elizabeth Bartley) who, along with 2 others, are said to have been tried, convicted, and executed as accomplices to the crimes down by the noblewoman.\n\n===Jonathan Morris===\n{{nihongo|'''Jonathan Morris'''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30ca\u30b5\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30ea\u30b9|Jonasan Morisu}} is a member of the Morris family of vampire hunters and appears in ''[[Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin]]''. The wielder of the Vampire Killer in 1944, Jonathan received basic training from his father John Morris as a child. He tends to be a reckless youth, a trait which makes his childhood friend Charlotte Aulin worry about his well being much of the time. He can, however, be very observant. After his father died, Jonathan grew to resent him, though neither he nor Charlotte knew that the soul-sapping effects of a non-Belmont using the Vampire Killer in battle resulted in his death.\n\nAfter learning the truth about his father and the Vampire Killer from Eric, Jonathan gained a new found respect for his father. Jonathan may then choose whether or not to battle the whip's memory of Richter Belmont, the last Belmont to wield the whip, and successfully unleash the full power of the Vampire Killer, knowing full well that he may perish from using it, though it is up to the player to decide whether to engage this optional encounter, and the canonical choice is unknown. Regardless, Jonathan and Charlotte traveled to the top of Dracula's Castle, and battled the combined forces of Count Dracula and [[Death (Castlevania)|Death]], which had not previously occurred before according to Charlotte. When Dracula was vanquished, his castle was destroyed and Jonathan and the others escaped unscathed.\n\n===Charlotte Aulin===\n{{nihongo|'''Charlotte Aulin'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30c8\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3|Sh\u0101rotto \u014crin}} is a magic user said to be descended from the Belnades clan. She shows strong potential as a sorceress. Along with Jonathan, she ventures into the castle to destroy Dracula. She is a smart girl who relies on enchanted books for information, to cast spells, and to summon weapons for close-range attacks. She also tends to be a nosy and talkative person, which is how she found out about Jonathan and the Vampire Killer, something which, according to Jonathan, she was supposed to keep secret. Charlotte is concerned about Jonathan's ability to wield the whip and assists him with the best she can, but she hates getting treated as (or even being called) a child. She tends to take things rationally and logically, which makes her seem unemotional but she is in fact a caring and compassionate young woman.\n\n===Brauner===\n{{nihongo|'''Brauner'''|\u30d6\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|Bur\u014dneru}} is a famous painter who forsook his humanity after losing his daughters during World War I. Now a vampire, he screams for vengeance upon humanity for their deaths.\n\nWhen Dracula's Castle first appeared, Brauner used his special paintings to keep Dracula sealed so that he could keep the dark lord's power all for himself. Eric Lecarde set off to investigate the castle, but was ambushed by Brauner and slain. At the same time, Eric's daughters Stella and Loretta arrived to bear witness to their father's death, and Brauner bit both girls so as to turn them into his new vampiric \"daughters\".\n\nWhen Jonathan and Charlotte finally confront Brauner, he flies into a rage over having lost his \"daughters\" again and attacks the pair. As he is defeated, Brauner explains the reasons for his actions, but is then slain by Death in order to revive Dracula.\n\n===Stella and Loretta===\n{{nihongo|'''Stella'''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30e9|Sutera}} and {{nihongo|'''Loretta'''|\u30ed\u30ec\u30c3\u30bf|Roretta}} are the daughters of Eric Lecarde, the older sister Stella being a master swordswoman with powerful wind-based attacks while Loretta wields powerful ice spells while serving as Stella's support. The vampire Brauner believe the two of them to be the reincarnations of his deceased daughters, having turned them to vampires and subjected them to a spell that causes their past lives to take control of them.\n\nBrauner's \"daughters\" initially prevent Jonathan and Charlotte from investigating the castle. After a short fight with Stella, the two learn of the sisters' true identities when they find a locket containing a picture with both girls and Eric Lecarde, prompting Eric's ghost to reveal what happened to his daughters. The four of them later confront each other in the highest areas of the castle. While it is possible to kill the sisters (triggering a bad ending), Jonathan and Charlotte must use the \"Sanctuary\" spell to restore Stella and Loretta to their true selves. Their minds and humanity restored, the sisters open a door that leads to Brauner's studio and also offer Jonathan a way to unlock the true power of the Vampire Killer.\n\nUpon defeating Dracula, Jonathan, Charlotte, Stella, and Loretta escape the castle, where Eric appears before them and tells his daughters to not burden themselves over their actions and move. Eric passes to the other side, leaving Stella and Loretta in tears, but they soon recover and thank Jonathan and Charlotte.\n\nStella and Loretta are playable in \"Sisters Mode\", which takes place before the main game and chronicles their search for their missing father. Unlike Jonathan and Charlotte, the player use the stylus to attack and the D-Pad to move them around, as they can also fly. As Stella, the player attacks enemies by slicing enemies with the stylus, and as Loretta, the player points at enemies to shoot a beam of ice.\n\n===Vincent Dorin===\n{{nihongo|'''Vincent Dorin'''|\u30f4\u30a3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30c9\u30ea\u30f3|Vinsento Dorin}} is a [[priest]] that serves as the game merchant. Jonathan and Charlotte meet him in front of the castle and then near the entrance. Vincent is a rather greedy person, even if he explains that it is for the church. He also get bitten during the game and begs the two heroes to cure him (the player can choose to cure him or not, and while it affects the ending, it is not something noticeable). Even when cured, he isn't as much in debt concerning his merchandise.\n\nHis name was reused for an abbot in the reboot, ''Lords of Shadow''. He went insane by isolating himself and protecting a priceless artifact, while his townspeople were being slaughtered by supernatural creatures.\n\n==''Castlevania (Nintendo 64)'' and ''Legacy of Darkness''==\n{{main|Castlevania (Nintendo 64)|Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness}}\nIGA claimed in 2006 that ''Castlevania'' and ''Legacy of Darkness'' for the [[Nintendo 64]] were considered side projects to his timeline.<ref name=\"1up.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |title=Tales From The Crypt: Castlevania 20th Anniversary Blowout from |publisher=1UP.com |date=1997-10-31 |accessdate=2013-08-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215534/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=4&cId=3152109 |archivedate=2007-09-27 }}</ref> However, the games were later listed on the 20th Anniversary Timeline, without any description.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/puyo/314073086/in/set-72157594405290664/ |title=DSC01722 &#124; Flickr \u2013 Condivisione di foto! |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref> IGA later clarified that he looks at the titles as \"...a Castlevania \"gaiden\" (subseries)\" and complemented them by stating \"...they both have a really unique take on the Castlevania world.\"<ref>Nintendo Power, July 2008</ref>  Iga later included Cornell in Castlevania Judgment (Nov 2008) (drawn from his era of the timeline by magical forces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coveritlive.com/index2.php?option=com_altcaster&task=viewaltcast&altcast_code=9cfac7534b&ipod=y |title=Viewer \u2013 Konami's E3 press conference |publisher=Coveritlive.com |date=2008-07-16 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>). The game and manual makes references to Legacy of Darkness story. Events and characters related to the game such as Ada are mentioned during Cornell's mission and by some of the characters who encounter Cornell during their missions (such as Death & Camilla). Legacy of Darkness is said to be Cornell's previous appearance in the manual.<ref>\"Appearances: Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness\", Castlevania Judgment manual, pg 23</ref>\n\n===Reinhardt Schneider===\nThough the Belmont surname may no longer follow {{nihongo|'''Reinhardt Schneider'''|\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30cf\u30eb\u30c8\u30fb\u30b7\u30e5\u30ca\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc|Rainharuto Shunaid\u0101}}, the blood inside of his veins remains the same, and his destiny is no different. He is the son of Michael Gelhart Schneider. Villagers have been found mutilated and drained of blood near Dracula's castle, and Reinhardt has to stop it.  He carries the typical Vampire Killer whip but can also wield a shortsword for close-range combat for which the whip may prove unsuitable; although the surname \"Schneider\" usually carries the same connotation as does the English surname \"Tailor,\" its literal translation from German is the more general \"one who cuts.\"\n\nHe is voiced by Andrew Hanikson.\n\n===Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez===\n{{nihongo|'''Carrie Fern\u00e1ndez'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30ca\u30f3\u30c7\u30b9|Kyar\u012b Verunandesu}} is a magic-wielding girl descended from the Belnades clan. She was estranged from the populace of Wallachia for her affinity with magic, her mother dying to protect her from an angry mob. She turned her back on others, but when she learned that Dracula had once again risen, she took it upon herself to use her powers to stop him. She is Camilla Fern\u00e1ndez's cousin, who is also captured by a vampire and turned into one.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Bianca Allen]].\n\n===Actrise===\n{{nihongo|'''Actrise'''|\u30a2\u30af\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30bb|Akutor\u012bse}} is a Dracula's [[Witchcraft|witch]] servant, she sacrificed her own child to become immortal. She plays an antagonist role in Carrie's quest, offering her a chance to join Dracula, in which Carrie refuses. In the Castle Center, Actrise sics a Fern\u00e1ndez warrior, who became a vampire, on Carrie in an attempt to stop her from reaching Dracula. After Carrie defeats her cousin, she and Actrise do battle on top of one of the castle towers, in which Actrise is overwhelmed and killed by Carrie. She also appears in Cornell's quest and taunts him, and is revealed to be responsible for turning Henry's father into a vampire.\n\n===Rosa===\n{{nihongo|'''Rosa'''|\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|R\u014dze|Rose}} is a woman who was recently turned into a [[vampire]]. She meets Reinhardt and Carrie in the Villa, watering flowers with blood. She plays a major role in Reinhardt's quest. She is seen next attempting to kill herself, walking into sunlight. Reinhardt stops her. She is then encountered with Death in the Castle Center in which she and Reinhardt do battle. She is defeated by him but is spared before Death takes her away. When Death ambushes Reinhardt, Rosa sacrifices herself by throwing herself into the path of Death's scythes. Rosa is comforted by Reinhardt as she dies, and then Death is defeated by a vengeful Reinhardt. In the end, after Dracula's defeat, Rosa is seen restored into human form and she and Reinhardt look upon Dracula's sunken castle.\n\n===Gilles de Rais===\n{{nihongo|'''Gilles de Rais'''|\u30b8\u30eb\u30fb\u30c9\u30ec|Jiru Dore}} is one of Dracula's servants. He used Cornell's power to reincarnate his master in the body of Malus. He later disguises himself as Dracula in preparation for his lord's eventual resurrection and kidnapped children to offer them as sacrifice and thus resurrect his master. He is later defeated by Reinhardt and Carrie in Dracula's throne room, where it is revealed he was an imposter.\n\n===Renon===\n{{nihongo|'''Renon'''|\u30ec\u30ce\u30f3|Renon}} is a demonic salesman who appears intermittently throughout the game. He claims that \"one needs gold even in Hell these days\", and will gladly sell the player various power-ups such as spells and potions. Renon can be summoned by picking up a contract scroll that appears in various levels. The scroll then turns into an open briefcase. If the player spends more than 30,000 gold pieces before encountering Dracula, Renon transforms into his demon form and attempts to claim your soul for Hell.\n\n===Charles Vincent===\n{{nihongo|'''Charles Vincent'''|\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba\u30d3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8|Ch\u0101ruzu Vinsento}} is a vampire hunter. His mannerisms seem to indicate that he is very intelligent, but lacks real experience with vampires or other evils. Charles plays a key role in the game.\n\nIf the player takes less time in reaching the Castle Keep and defeats Dracula for the first time, he changes back into Malus, but Charles douses him with holy water, before Dracula warps the player to an alternate dimension for the final battle. After Dracula's defeat, Charles' fate is unknown.\n\nHowever, if the player takes more time in reaching the Castle Keep, Charles will arrive before them. He will fail in his attempt to subdue Dracula, and will be turned into a vampire instead. The player will be forced to fight and kill Charles. If this happens, then the heroes will not see through Dracula's illusions and ultimately fail in their quest.\n\n===Cornell===\n{{nihongo|'''Cornell'''|\u30b3\u30fc\u30cd\u30eb|K\u014dneru}}, also known as \"Blue Crescent Moon\", is a [[werewolf]] seen in both ''[[Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Castlevania Judgment]]''. He is a member of a warrior clan cursed to turn into beastmen. He is the only member of his clan who had the ability to control his change. He was the only one of his brethren who refused to join the forces of Dracula. He honed his skills in the hopes of finding a cure for his clan and to protect his sister Ada. One day while out training he found himself unable to control his powers and was stuck in beast form (''Castlevania Judgement''). He encountered Aeon, a time traveler, who told him he had entered a time rift. Aeon challenged him, and told him the time rift would let him learn more about the nature of the curse. After encountering several champions from different eras, he learns from Camilla and Death that they still need him, and is told that there is a possibility of a cure for him (though he doesn't trust them). After the defeat of the Time Reaper, Cornell was returned to his own era, 1844. He returned to find his village in flame, and his sister Ada kidnapped. He then journeyed after the kidnappers to save his sister. He discovered that Dracula's castle had risen again, and that his fellow man-beast Ortega had kidnapped his sister. During his battles he saves the young Henry Oldrey, and later defeats Ortega. He learned from Ortega, that Death, Gilles De Rais, and Actrise had plotted the kidnapping of Ada to empower a newly raised Dracula. Dracula later reveals to the audience that his sister is not a blood relative. Cornell fights Dracula to save her causing Dracula to be pulled into a vortex of energy. Dracula traps Cornell with his last power and tries to take Ada with him. The beast within Cornell freed itself from his body and saves Ada, but is captured and pulled into the vortex by Dracula. Cornell had become fully human, and was able to live the rest of a normal life with Ada (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nAccording to IGA, \"I believe many people did not expect to see Cornell. I really wanted to include a beast man type character, so I picked him.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubed3.com/news/11037 |title=Interview: IGA-san Talks Castlevania Judgment on Nintendo Wii #1 at Nintendo Cubed3 |publisher=Cubed3.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref>\n\nHe is voiced by John Nuzzo (Legacy of Darkness).\n\nA new version of Cornell appears in Lords of Shadow, voiced by [[Richard Ridings]]. He is the Dark Lord of the Lycans and the first Lords of Shadow Gabriel encounters.\n\n===Ortega===\n{{nihongo|'''Ortega'''|\u30aa\u30eb\u30c6\u30ac|Orutega}} grew up in the same village as Cornell, a fellow man-beast, being a friend of his, but also a rival. The rivalry caused Ortega an increasing amount of frustration, as he was constantly being outdone on every occasion, and he started searching for a way to gain the kind of powers that would make him stronger than even Cornell.\n\nThis search led him on the path of darkness, as the only one able to grant him the request proved to be Dracula. As a condition for gaining the new powers, Dracula demanded of Ortega to aid his demons on their mission to kidnap Cornell's sister Ada and destroy the village. He was also to stop Cornell from rescuing Ada. Ortega accepted these conditions, and thus sealed his pact with the devil, gaining amazing power, but losing his humanity.\n\nOrtega eventually fights Cornell as a Chimera on top one of the castle towers, but is defeated by him. Ortega accepts his defeat, but with his powers becoming out of control, he leaps off the castle tower to his death.\n\n===Henry Oldrey===\n{{nihongo|'''Henry Oldrey'''|\u30d8\u30f3\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30aa\u30eb\u30c9\u30ec\u30fc|Henr\u012b Orudor\u0113}} is the son of Mary and J. A. Oldrey. He was rescued by Cornell. Years later he became a knight of the church. He helped rescue the children kidnapped by Gilles de Rais.\n\n==''Circle of the Moon''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Circle of the Moon}}\nIGA claimed in 2006 that ''Circle of the Moon'' was considered a side project to his timeline.<ref name=\"1up.com\"/> Elements from the game were mentioned in the English Xtreme Desktop Timeline, but the game itself was not included on the timeline.

Nathan's parents were friends of his teacher, Morris Baldwin. Ten years before the events in ''Circle of the Moon'', Nathan's parents banished Dracula, at the cost of their lives. Morris managed to survive, and took Nathan as a student. Nathan was trained alongside Morris' son, Hugh, to become a vampire killer. Nathan has been chosen by Morris to be the successor of the Hunter Whip. He encounters many of Carmilla's cohorts, such as {{nihongo|Necromancer|\u30cd\u30af\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b5\u30fc|Nekuromans\u0101}}, before saving his master from lord Dracula .\n\n===Hugh Baldwin===\n{{nihongo|'''Hugh Baldwin'''|\u30d2\u30e5\u30fc\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3|Hy\u016b B\u014drudowin}} is the son of Morris and Nathan's rival. Hugh envies Nathan for being chosen by his father for possession of the Hunter Whip. However, Nathan does not reciprocate his hate, and often tries to reason with him. Dracula takes advantage of Hugh's discontent and entices him to kill Nathan near the end of the game. After being defeated, Hugh comes back to his senses and feels a new-found respect for Nathan and his father's decision to give Nathan the Hunter Whip.\n\n===Morris Baldwin===\n{{nihongo|'''Morris Baldwin'''|\u30e2\u30fc\u30ea\u30b9\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30a6\u30a3\u30f3|M\u014drisu B\u014drudowin}} is Hugh's father and a veteran Vampire Hunter. He and Nathan's parents sealed Count Dracula in 1820, ten years before the events in ''Circle of the Moon''.

He is responsible for unwillingly triggering the events that take place in 1748, during ''Harmony of Dissonance'', by wishing to relieve Juste of his fate and become more powerful than he is. Inspired by the tale of Simon Belmont, Maxim gathered the cursed remains of Count Dracula so he could destroy them, and in doing so created an evil Maxim in his soul that hungered for power and destruction like Dracula did.\n\nIn the best ending, Juste helps Maxim overcome his dark influence by wearing their bracelets as a reminder of their friendship. Though not at full power, the evil Maxim takes Dracula's remains (gathered by Juste during his quest) and turns into a ghostly incarnation of Dracula (Dracula Wraith), then into a giant creature made of the body parts before finally being slain. Maxim is restored to normal afterwards.\n\nMaxim is playable in a secret gameplay mode of ''Harmony of Dissonance''. His Stellar Sword is also an obtainable weapon in ''Portrait of Ruin''.

He lost both parents at a very young age, and was knighted at the age of 16. When his love interest Sara Trantoul is kidnapped by the vampire [[Walter Bernhard]] he enters the castle grounds unarmed, but is given a whip that is blessed with the power of alchemy by the old man Rinaldo Gandolfi, who lives on the grounds. Rinaldo also enchants Leon's left gauntlet with the power to absorb magical attacks. Using the whip and his magic gauntlet, he enters the castle hoping to rescue his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nWithin the castle, Leon fights five guardians: Medusa, a Succubus, a Golem, the vampire [[Joachim Armster]] (Walter Bernhard's former ally), and an undead parasite. He gets a magical orb from each of them that unlocks the way to Walter's lair. When he gets past the initial barrier, Walter is there with Sara, who appears to be in some sort of trance. Walter returns Sara to Leon, who finds out that Sara has been tainted and will soon become a vampire. In an act of self-sacrifice, Sara offers her soul to Leon in a ritual that will make Rinaldo's magic whip deadly to vampires and thus allow Leon to defeat Walter. This is where the whip officially becomes \"Vampire Killer.\"  Leon, armed with the powerful whip, Rinaldo's grief, and his anger for Sara's death, defeats Walter. However, Walter's death was in actuality orchestrated by Leon's friend [[Mathias Cronqvist]] to get Walter's Soul, and absorb its powers to become a powerful vampire through the Crimson Stone, (an artifact that allowed a person to steal a Vampire's soul and make their power theirs, at the price of becoming a vampire themselves) and Vampire Killer can now sense his having abandoned Humanity. He offers Leon eternal life, which Leon refuses, saying that eternal life would be empty without Sara. Mathias then sends his servant Death after Leon, who is defeated by him and gives him a message to pass on to Mathias. Leon swears that his clan and the whip he now carries will destroy Mathias one day, and from that day onward the Belmont clan would hunt the night.  Mathias would later be known as [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]].\n\nLeon appears in sprite form in Portrait of Ruin as one of the \"Greatest Five\".\n\n===Rinaldo Gandolfi===\n{{nihongo|'''Rinaldo Gandolfi'''|\u30ea\u30ca\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30ac\u30f3\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc|Rinarudo Gandoruf\u012b}} is an alchemist whose daughter was taken and turned into a vampire by Walter Bernhard. He now lives in a small hut in the Forest of Eternal Night. Rinaldo creates the Whip of Alchemy for Leon to use in Walter's castle.

Having grown bored with eternal life, he decides to kidnap young maidens and play a game of Cat-and-mouse with the Hunters who come to rescue them, and attempt to destroy him. He is the antagonist of the game, luring the protagonist Baron Leon Belmont to his castle by kidnapping his fianc\u00e9e, Sara Trantoul. The forest where he lives is called Eternal Night, as it is covered in unending darkness by the means of a jewel called the \"Ebony Stone\". In the end, Walter is defeated, and Mathias absorbs his soul.\n\n===Joachim Armster===\n{{nihongo|'''Joachim Armster'''|\u30e8\u30a2\u30d2\u30e0\u30fb\u30a2\u30eb\u30e0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc|Yoahimu Arumasut\u0101}} is another vampire who is kept prisoner by Walter in his castle. Joachim has a hatred for Walter and what he has done to him. As well as being a minor boss character, the game includes an unlockable secret mode where Joachim is a playable character; he has the ability to summon flying swords of darkness.\n\n==''Order of Ecclesia''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia}}\n\n===Shanoa===\n{{main|Shanoa}}\n{{nihongo|'''Shanoa'''|\u30b7\u30e3\u30ce\u30a2|Shanoa}} appears in Order of Ecclesia and Castlevania Judgment. She is the most prodigious member of the Order of Ecclesia, a secret organization devoted to stop Dracula from reviving after the Belmont clan disappeared. She is also a glyph user, capable of absorbing sigil-like characters and using them as weapons. She is chosen by Barlowe to bear Dominus, a series of glyphs designed to destroy Dracula, but her fellow member Albus interferes during the ceremony and steals the glyphs. As a result, Shanoa becomes an amnesiac who is only able to simulate emotions (she cannot truly feel them).\n\nAfter being retrained by Barlowe, Shanoa is dispatched to seek out and retrieve Dominus from Albus by any means necessary. As she travels, she slowly learns Albus's true intentions and the dark reality behind Ecclesia, but she is unable to stop the return of Dracula. With nothing left to her except her mission, Shanoa enters Dracula's castle and destroys the evil count using Dominus.\n\nShe is voiced by [[Houko Kuwashima]].\n\n===Albus===\n{{nihongo|'''Albus'''|\u30a2\u30eb\u30d0\u30b9|Arubasu}} is one of Ecclesia's veteran members. He wields a magically-infused [[flintlock]] [[pistol]] named Agartha that is capable of firing a variety of projectiles, and also has the ability to [[Warp drive|warp]] across short distances. Initially, Barlowe promised Albus that he would receive the Dominus seal, but changed his mind without his consent and chose Shanoa instead. After stealing Dominus from Ecclesia during the ceremony in which it was to be implanted within Shanoa, Albus flees with the glyph and becomes the enemy of Ecclesia. He spends much of the time researching the Dominus glyph and devising a way to incorporate it into himself. However, when he absorbs one part of the glyph (as he had given the other two away in order to observe how glyphs are absorbed) he is driven mad and Shanoa is forced to slay him.\n\nIf Shanoa kills Albus after rescuing all of the villagers, Albus will speak to her through Dominus and reveal his intentions in stealing the glyph. He had acted the way he did in order to protect Shanoa, who was raised as his younger sister, from the soul-stealing effects of the glyph, as channeling it would kill the user. He also has her promise not to use Dominus, as it would kill her. She also gains Albus' memories, some of which correlate with the ones she had lost. As it transpires, Albus's soul remains within Shanoa as she explores Dracula's castle, and he uses this opportunity to find a way to unlock her emotions, though her own memories are forever lost. When Shanoa uses Dominus to destroy Dracula, Albus offers his own soul as sacrifice, allowing Shanoa to live. Before his soul vanishes, Albus restores Shanoa's emotions and asks that she smile for him, which she manages through deep tears.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Keith Silverstein]].\n\n===Barlowe===\n{{nihongo|'''Barlowe'''|\u30d0\u30fc\u30ed\u30a6|B\u0101rou}} is Ecclesia's leader, who has been tasked with seeking a way to combat Dracula's power in the absence of the Belmont clan. To this end, he created the Dominus glyph out of Dracula's power and was in the process of giving them to Shanoa when Albus interfered and made off with the glyphs. When Shanoa returns after learning the truth about Dominus and the cost for its use, Barlowe reveals that he himself has been corrupted by Dracula's power, and that his goal all along was to have Shanoa sacrifice her soul to Dracula through Dominus so the evil count can return once more. After Shanoa critically wounds him in battle, Barlowe uses the last of his strength to bring Dracula to life again.\n\n===Villagers of Wygol===\nIn her travels, Shanoa encounters villagers from a location called Wygol, whom Albus captures and takes blood from in his studies on Dominus. After being rescued, the villagers will offer various side-quests for Shanoa to complete in exchange for money and special items. Shanoa must rescue all thirteen of the villagers in order to continue the storyline after defeating Albus.\n\nAfter Albus's death, the villagers are revealed to be indirect descendants of the Belmont clan, and their blood is what allows Albus's soul to live within Shanoa after he himself is killed.\n\n==''Judgment''==\n{{main|Castlevania Judgment}}\nAccording to Iga, \"So as many of you know, the Castlevania timeline goes over 1000 years\", \"And there is a character trying to destroy that timeline.

He plotted to resurrect Dracula using a blood sacrifice and planned to serve at his side. However, the Belmont's and their allies were able to track down the order long before they were ready to revive the Dark Lord properly. He is defeated at the hand of Desmond, who indicated that he was only seeking the prevention of Dracula's revival, not revenge for what he had done to his father. Though his dreams of being one of Dracula's right hand men during his reign was shattered, his own blood was sufficient to raise his lord and Desmond had to battle an early risen Dracula shortly afterwards.\n\n==''Lords of Shadow''==\n{{main|Castlevania: Lords of Shadow}}\n''Lords of Shadow'' is being described as a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the franchise;<ref>{{cite web| title = Castlevania: Lords of Shadow at E3 Press Conference| url = http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/210643/konami-announces-castlevania-lords-of-shadow-at-e3-press-conference/| publisher = [[GamePro]]| accessdate = 2009-05-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018024334/http://www.gamepro.com/article/news/210643/konami-announces-castlevania-lords-of-shadow-at-e3-press-conference/|archivedate=2009-10-18}}</ref> it is not part of the main series' timeline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps3/lords_of_shadow/preview-1975.html |title=Lords of Shadow Interview for PS3 |publisher=VideoGamer.com |date=2009-09-03 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>[http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/101/1016610p1.html It doesn't follow any Castlevania timeline, says Cox, because Konami didn't want to limit the potential audience to the truly hardcore.]</ref>\n\n===Gabriel Belmont===\n{{nihongo|'''Gabriel Belmont'''|\u30ac\u30d6\u30ea\u30a8\u30eb\u30fb\u30d9\u30eb\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9|Gaburieru Berumondo|Gabriel Belmondo}} is the central character of the ''Lords of Shadow'' series. He is a member of the Brotherhood of Light, an elite group of holy knights who protect and defend the innocent against the supernatural. He learns of a Mask which has the power to bring back the dead, and contemplates on using it to revive his recently murdered wife.\n\nAs an infant he was found abandoned at the door of one of the Brotherhood of the Light convents. It is not known who his original parents were. Some suspect he was the unwanted child of a local wealthy landowner, most likely from the Cronqvist family, though this has never been proven. The Order named the boy after the blessed Archangel Gabriel and raised him as one of their own. The precocious child quickly proved to be extremely talented, developing a mastery of the fighting arts unprecedented in the Brotherhood. Gabriel took the surname of Belmont, due to his love for mountains and the high places of the world. The name Belmont is of French origin, and it means \"beautiful mountain\". The name is the union of two French words: ''bel'', meaning beautiful and ''mont'' meaning mountain.\n\nProne to dark moods and occasional ambivalence, Gabriel was deeply affected by the death of his childhood sweetheart, Marie. Gabriel has embarked on this journey at the request of the elders of the Brotherhood, rejecting the help of his comrades and stoking a burning desire for revenge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/player/703749 |title=Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow Video Game, Preview Walkthrough HD |author= |date=August 28, 2010 |work=[[GameTrailers]] |publisher= |accessdate=October 28, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.com/officialsites/castlevania/ |title=''Castlevania \u2013 Lords of Shadow'' Official Site |publisher=[[Konami]] |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204090917/http://www.konami.com/officialsites/castlevania/ |archivedate=December 4, 2010 }}</ref> In a [[post-credits scene]], Gabriel is shown to have become the powerful vampire lord Dracula and subsequently the second game explores his quest for redemption and goal to put an end to his immortal existence.\n\nGabriel is voiced in all three games by Scottish actor [[Robert Carlyle]].\n\n===Zobek===\n{{nihongo|'''Zobek'''|\u30be\u30d9\u30c3\u30af|Zobekku}} is a mysterious swordsman who encourages Gabriel to use The Mask to bring back his dead wife Marie.\n\nIf the recorded chronicles of the Brotherhood are to be believed, Zobek is one of their longest serving warriors. The list of heroic deeds attributed to him is as impressive as his vast knowledge of the art of war or indeed the mighty fighting skills he can deploy, despite his age.\n\nHis weapon of choice is a simple long sword which he handles with skill and alacrity. Strangely, he likes to use an old-fashioned uniform of the Brotherhood of Light that, according to him, was inherited from one of his ancestors; one of the founding members of the Brotherhood of Light. In reality, he is the dark side left by one of the founding member of the order, the Lord of the Dead.

He is also the final boss.\n\nSatan's primary motivation seems to be to have his vengeance against God for being cast out of Heaven. He reveals himself as the manipulator of the first game's events in the end. After he is defeated by Gabriel Belmont, he drops the God Mask, which Gabriel uses to speak to his deceased wife for a short time. He reappears in ''Lords of Shadow 2'', where he serves as the main antagonist and final boss again. After his Acolytes manage to summon him to the mortal world, this time Satan chooses to possess Alucard, the son of Gabriel, who is now known as the powerful vampire Dracula. After his defeat, he flees from Alucard's body and is killed by Dracula, who uses his old Vampire Killer weapon to deliver the final blow.\n\nVoiced by [[Jason Isaacs]].\n\n===Victor Belmont===\nVictor Belmont is a descendant of Gabriel Belmont, although his exact relation is unknown.

However, hearing of his skill was Walter Bernhard, a member of the Bernhard family who offered the Toy Maker a place in his Castle to make his craft.\n\nIn time, the Toy Maker realized that Walter came from a family of dark occultists. Walter summoned a demon to possess the Toy Maker's kindly soul, thereby twisting his craft in the darkest way and making weapons of death and destruction, some being the Dark Pain, the Stopwatch, the Macabre Puppet, and Gargoyles.\n\nThe demon, however, was unable to completely corrupt the Toy Maker's soul, resulting in something of a split personality; the original kind old man and the childish, sadistic demon within. Sometime during this period, the Toy Maker was touched by the puppet of a child seeking to free his soul from the demon and escape Walter Bernhard. He then discovered he had regained his innocence and Walter removed his heart, putting the Toy Maker into a deep slumber.\n\nHis fate is unknown when Carmilla took over the castle, and only then until Gabriel Belmont, rechristened as Dracula, took over as well.\n\nVoiced by Mark Healy.\n\n===Agreus===\n\nAgreus is the brother of the deceased Pan, coming to Dracula's Castle to seek revenge against his killer, the vampire lord Dracula. First Agreus lures Dracula into the Castle's gardens with a fragment of the Mirror of Fate knowing that he would seek the fragment for his son Trevor Belmont. As Dracula attempts to claim the fragment, Agreus steals it from him and informs the vampire that he intends to avenge Pan's death. Dracula tries to reason with Agreus that his brother chose to sacrifice himself for a cause that he believed in, but Agreus retorts that Pan only died to serve his quest for power. Declaring that Dracula would pay for what he had done, Agreus retreats into the maze, goading the vampire to follow him.\n\nNow trapped inside the maze with the vengeful God, Dracula is forced to evade him in order to escape. Agreus taunts the vampire, claiming that he would relish hunting him down but Dracula manages to avoid him long enough to reclaim the fragment from his Owl Familiar. Enraged, Agreus vows to destroy Dracula and challenges him to a final battle. Eventually the two warriors tumble off the edge of the cliff but Dracula uses Agreus to break his fall. With the Old God weakened and unable to fight back, Dracula proceeds to crush Agreus' skull, killing him.\n\nVoiced by Aleksander Mikic.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Castlevania series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Characters In The Castlevania Series}}\n[[Category:Castlevania characters| ]]\n[[Category:Lists of Konami characters|Castlevania]]\n[[Category:Fictional vampire hunters]]\n", "name_user": "Memomick", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDracula", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Castlevania_characters"}
