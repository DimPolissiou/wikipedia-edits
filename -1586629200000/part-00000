Smith first gained popularity in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine when she won the title of 1993 [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]]. She modeled for fashion companies, including [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]], [[H&M]], [[Heatherette]] and [[Lane Bryant]].\n\nSmith dropped out of high school at age 14 in 1982, married in 1985, and divorced in 1993. In 1994, her highly publicized second marriage to 89-year old [[billionaire]] [[J. Howard Marshall]] resulted in speculation that she married the octogenarian for his money, which she denied. Following Marshall's death in 1995, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate. Her cases reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: ''[[Marshall v. Marshall]]'' on a question of [[Federal jurisdiction (United States)|federal jurisdiction]] and ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]'' on a question of bankruptcy court authority.\n\nSmith died in 2007 in a [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], [[Florida]] hotel room as a result of an overdose of prescription drugs. In the months leading up to her death, Smith was the focus of renewed press coverage surrounding the death of her son, [[Daniel Wayne Smith|Daniel]], and the paternity and custody battle over her newborn daughter, [[Dannielynn Birkhead]].\n\n==Early life==\nAnna Nicole Smith was born as Vickie Lynn Hogan in 1967 in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. She was the only daughter of Donald Eugene Hogan (1947\u20132009) and Virgie  Arthur (''n\u00e9e'' Tabers; 1951\u20132018),{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} who married on February 22, 1967{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and divorced on November 4, 1969. She had five half [[siblings]] from father's and  mother's side.  Smith was raised by her mother and an aunt. Smith's mother married Donald R. Hart in 1971, after which Smith changed her name from Vickie Hogan to Nikki Hart.<ref name=Stoddard>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212044127/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc|archivedate=February 12, 2007|title=High school remembers Anna Nicole&nbsp;\u2013 barely|author1=Ed Stoddard|author2=Jessica Rinaldi|work=Reuters|accessdate=February 14, 2007|date=February 9, 2007}}</ref>\nSmith attended Durkee Elementary School and Aldine High School in Houston.

During the Guess campaign, Smith changed her name to Anna Nicole Smith. Guess photographers noticed Smith bore a striking resemblance to bombshell [[Jayne Mansfield]] and showcased her in several Mansfield-inspired photo sessions. In 1993, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company [[H&M]], which led to her picture being displayed on large billboards in Sweden and Norway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsvery.net/anna-nicole-smith.html | title=Anna Nicole Smith |date=February 8, 2007 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/extra/dottern-kan-bli-som-anna-nicole-smith/ |title=Dottern kan bli som Anna Nicole Smith | language=Swedish |newspaper=[[Expressen]] |date=November 5, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/galerie-archiv/anna-nicole-smith-bio-und-prozess |title=Anna Nicole Smith Bio und Prozess | newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] | language=German |date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref> Smith appeared on the cover of German magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', photographed by [[Peter Lindbergh]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patidubroff.com/covers/german-marie-claire-anna-nicole-smith.html|title=German Marie Claire: Anna Nicole Smith {{!}} Pati PREMA Dubroff|last=pati|language=en-US|access-date=March 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA photograph of Smith was used by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine on the cover of its August 22, 1994 issue titled ''White Trash Nation.'' In the photo, she appears squatting in a short skirt with cowboy boots as she eats chips. In October 1994, her lawyer, T. Patrick Freydl, initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the magazine, claiming that Smith did not authorize the use of her photo. The suit also alleged that the article damaged her reputation. Freydl stated that Smith was under the impression that she was being photographed to embody the \"all-American look.\" Editor said that the photo was one of dozens taken. The lawsuit was reported to be settled. <ref>{{cite journal|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2007/02/anna_nicole_and_new_york_a_nol_1.html |title=Anna Nicole and ''New York'': A No-Love-Lost Story \u2013 Daily Intelligencer |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://nytimes.com/1994/10/21/style/chronicle-595543.html |title=Chronicle \u2013 Anna Nicole Smith |first=Nadine |last=Brozan |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1994 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Film and television===\nSmith was successful as a model, but she never found the same recognition or success as an actress. She made her screen debut in the 1994 [[screwball comedy film]] ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' as Za-Za, a flirtatious celebrity who flirts with the lead character, played by [[Tim Robbins]], in a barbershop scene. Smith was next given a larger role as Tanya Peters in ''[[Naked Gun 33\u2153: The Final Insult|Naked Gun {{frac|33|1|3}}: The Final Insult]]'' (1994), which was released seven days after her initial film debut. Her role as a pivotal contact to a crime earned her favorable reviews and the film enjoyed box office success. Despite the publicity for her performance in both films, neither did much to advance her acting career.\n\nSmith wanted to be taken more seriously as an actress, but Hollywood studios were reluctant. Her persona of a ditzy dumb blonde was compressed heavily in her film roles, which sought only to market her physical assets. In an attempt to earn acting respect, Smith agreed to appear in ''[[To the Limit (1995 film)|To the Limit]]'' (1995), her first starring role. She played Colette Dubois, a retired spy seeking revenge on the murderer of her husband. Although the film was highly publicized and boasted a lavish budget and script, Smith's performance drew negative reviews and was ultimately a [[box office bomb]]. It was Smith's only venture in a mainstream Hollywood leading role.\n\nSmith appeared as herself in the 1995 [[pilot episode]] of ''[[The Naked Truth (TV series)|The Naked Truth]]'', then attempted to revitalize her film career with a leading role in ''[[Skyscraper (1996 film)|Skyscraper]]'' in 1996. The low-budget, [[direct-to-video]] film offered Smith no more than \"soft-core exploitation\" and her movie career again stalled.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Smith focused her acting career on television. She appeared on the variety series ''[[Sin City Spectacular]]'' in 1998. That same year, Smith appeared in the tell-all self-promoting film, ''Anna Nicole Smith: Exposed'', which was based on several photo sessions during her Playboy career. She appeared as Donna, the friend of Veronica Chase, played by [[Kirstie Alley]], on the sitcom ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'' in 1999. Smith guest-starred as Myra Jacobs in a 1999 episode of the surreal series, ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Smith had very few acting roles. As a result of her rising popularity with tabloids and gossip columnists, Smith was given her own [[reality show]] on the [[E!]] cable network. ''[[The Anna Nicole Show]]'' premiered on August 4, 2002, achieving the highest cable rating for a reality show. The day the series premiered was the seventh anniversary of the death of [[J. Howard Marshall]]. The series attempted to focus on the private life of Smith, her boyfriend/attorney [[Howard K. Stern]], her son [[Daniel Wayne Smith]], her assistant Kimberly \"Kimmie\" Walther, her miniature poodle Sugar Pie, her interior decorator [[Bobby Trendy]] and her cousin from Texas, Shelly Cloud. The  show  was canceled  in  June  2003. \n\nSmith returned to film acting in 2003 with the comedy film ''[[Wasabi Tuna]]''. In the film she played an over-the-top version of herself whose miniature poodle, Sugar Pie, is stolen from her on Halloween by a team of [[drag queen]]s dressed like her. Neither the film nor her performance drew positive reviews. In 2005, she briefly appeared as a spectator at a basketball game in ''[[Be Cool]]'', starring [[John Travolta]]. In late 2005, she agreed to play Lucy in the self-produced independent parody film ''[[Illegal Aliens (film)|Illegal Aliens]]'' alongside wrestler Joani \"[[Chyna]]\" Laurer. It attempted to parody several popular television shows from the 1970s and 1980s as well as several film franchises and was released direct-to-video on May 1, 2007, three months after Smith's death.\n\n===Endorsements===\nIn an interview on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Smith was asked what her \"Playmate diet\" consisted of. She instantly replied, \"Fried chicken.\" In October 2003, she became a spokeswoman for [[TrimSpa]], which allegedly helped her lose a reported {{convert|69|lb|kg}}. TrimSpa diet product company and Smith were sued in a [[class action]] lawsuit alleging their marketing of a weight loss pill was false or misleading.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17008284/ns/business-us-_business/t/anna-nicole-smith-trimspa-sued-over-diet-ads/ \"Anna Nicole Smith, TrimSpa Sued Over Diet Ads\"].

Smith first gained popularity in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine when she won the title of 1993 [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]]. She modeled for fashion companies, including [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]], [[H&M]], [[Heatherette]] and [[Lane Bryant]].\n\nSmith dropped out of high school at age 14 in 1982, married in 1985, and divorced in 1993. In 1994, her highly publicized second marriage to 89-year old [[billionaire]] [[J. Howard Marshall]] resulted in speculation that she married the octogenarian for his money, which she denied. Following Marshall's death in 1995, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate. Her cases reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: ''[[Marshall v. Marshall]]'' on a question of [[Federal jurisdiction (United States)|federal jurisdiction]] and ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]'' on a question of bankruptcy court authority.\n\nSmith died in 2007 in a [[Hollywood, Florida|Hollywood]], [[Florida]] hotel room as a result of an overdose of prescription drugs. In the months leading up to her death, Smith was the focus of renewed press coverage surrounding the death of her son, [[Daniel Wayne Smith|Daniel]], and the paternity and custody battle over her newborn daughter, [[Dannielynn Birkhead]].\n\n==Early life==\nAnna Nicole Smith was born as Vickie Lynn Hogan in 1967 in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. She was the only daughter of Donald Eugene Hogan (1947\u20132009) and Virgie  Arthur (''n\u00e9e'' Tabers; 1951\u20132018),{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} who married on February 22, 1967{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} and divorced on November 4, 1969. She had five half [[siblings]] from father's and  mother's side.  Smith was raised by her mother and an aunt. Smith's mother married Donald R. Hart in 1971, after which Smith changed her name from Vickie Hogan to Nikki Hart.<ref name=Stoddard>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212044127/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc|archivedate=February 12, 2007|title=High school remembers Anna Nicole&nbsp;\u2013 barely|author1=Ed Stoddard|author2=Jessica Rinaldi|work=Reuters|accessdate=February 14, 2007|date=February 9, 2007}}</ref>\nSmith attended Durkee Elementary School and Aldine High School in Houston.

She appeared as the [[Playboy Playmate]] [[List of Playboy Playmates of the Month|of the Month]] in a pictorial shot by [[Stephen Wayda]] for the May 1992 issue.\n\nSmith secured a contract to replace supermodel [[Claudia Schiffer]] in a [[Guess jeans]] ad campaign featuring a series of sultry black-and-white photographs. During the Guess campaign, Smith changed her name to Anna Nicole Smith. Guess photographers noticed Smith bore a striking resemblance to bombshell [[Jayne Mansfield]] and showcased her in several Mansfield-inspired photo sessions. In 1993, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company [[H&M]], which led to her picture being displayed on large billboards in Sweden and Norway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.itsvery.net/anna-nicole-smith.html | title=Anna Nicole Smith |date=February 8, 2007 |accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.expressen.se/noje/extra/dottern-kan-bli-som-anna-nicole-smith/ |title=Dottern kan bli som Anna Nicole Smith | language=Swedish |newspaper=[[Expressen]] |date=November 5, 2014 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/galerie-archiv/anna-nicole-smith-bio-und-prozess |title=Anna Nicole Smith Bio und Prozess | newspaper=[[Berliner Zeitung]] | language=German |date=August 5, 2010 | accessdate=February 22, 2016}}</ref> Smith appeared on the cover of German magazine ''[[Marie Claire]]'', photographed by [[Peter Lindbergh]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patidubroff.com/covers/german-marie-claire-anna-nicole-smith.html|title=German Marie Claire: Anna Nicole Smith {{!}} Pati PREMA Dubroff|last=pati|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\nA photograph of Smith was used by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine on the cover of its August 22, 1994 issue titled ''White Trash Nation.'' In the photo, she appears squatting in a short skirt with cowboy boots as she eats chips. In October 1994, her lawyer, T. Patrick Freydl, initiated a $5 million lawsuit against the magazine, claiming that Smith did not authorize the use of her photo. The suit also alleged that the article damaged her reputation. Freydl stated that Smith was under the impression that she was being photographed to embody the \"all-American look.\" Editor said that the photo was one of dozens taken. The lawsuit was reported to be settled. <ref>{{cite journal|url=https://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2007/02/anna_nicole_and_new_york_a_nol_1.html |title=Anna Nicole and ''New York'': A No-Love-Lost Story \u2013 Daily Intelligencer |journal=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://nytimes.com/1994/10/21/style/chronicle-595543.html |title=Chronicle \u2013 Anna Nicole Smith |first=Nadine |last=Brozan |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 21, 1994 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Film and television===\nSmith was successful as a model, but she never found the same recognition or success as an actress. She made her screen debut in the 1994 [[screwball comedy film]] ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]'' as Za-Za, a flirtatious celebrity who flirts with the lead character, played by [[Tim Robbins]], in a barbershop scene. Smith was next given a larger role as Tanya Peters in ''[[Naked Gun 33\u2153: The Final Insult|Naked Gun {{frac|33|1|3}}: The Final Insult]]'' (1994), which was released seven days after her initial film debut. Her role as a pivotal contact to a crime earned her favorable reviews and the film enjoyed box office success. Despite the publicity for her performance in both films, neither did much to advance her acting career.\n\nSmith wanted to be taken more seriously as an actress, but Hollywood studios were reluctant. Her persona of a ditzy dumb blonde was compressed heavily in her film roles, which sought only to market her physical assets. In an attempt to earn acting respect, Smith agreed to appear in ''[[To the Limit (1995 film)|To the Limit]]'' (1995), her first starring role. She played Colette Dubois, a retired spy seeking revenge on the murderer of her husband. Although the film was highly publicized and boasted a lavish budget and script, Smith's performance drew negative reviews and was ultimately a [[box office bomb]]. It was Smith's only venture in a mainstream Hollywood leading role.\n\nSmith appeared as herself in the 1995 [[pilot episode]] of ''[[The Naked Truth (TV series)|The Naked Truth]]'', then attempted to revitalize her film career with a leading role in ''[[Skyscraper (1996 film)|Skyscraper]]'' in 1996. The low-budget, [[direct-to-video]] film offered Smith no more than \"soft-core exploitation\" and her movie career again stalled.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Smith focused her acting career on television. She appeared on the variety series ''[[Sin City Spectacular]]'' in 1998. That same year, Smith appeared in the tell-all self-promoting film, ''Anna Nicole Smith: Exposed'', which was based on several photo sessions during her Playboy career. She appeared as Donna, the friend of Veronica Chase, played by [[Kirstie Alley]], on the sitcom ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'' in 1999. Smith guest-starred as Myra Jacobs in a 1999 episode of the surreal series, ''[[Ally McBeal]]''.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Smith had very few acting roles. As a result of her rising popularity with tabloids and gossip columnists, Smith was given her own [[reality show]] on the [[E!]] cable network. ''[[The Anna Nicole Show]]'' premiered on August 4, 2002, achieving the highest cable rating for a reality show. The day the series premiered was the seventh anniversary of the death of [[J. Howard Marshall]]. The series attempted to focus on the private life of Smith, her boyfriend/attorney [[Howard K. Stern]], her son [[Daniel Wayne Smith]], her assistant Kimberly \"Kimmie\" Walther, her miniature poodle Sugar Pie, her interior decorator [[Bobby Trendy]] and her cousin from Texas, Shelly Cloud. The  show  was canceled  in  June  2003. \n\nSmith returned to film acting in 2003 with the comedy film ''[[Wasabi Tuna]]''. In the film she played an over-the-top version of herself whose miniature poodle, Sugar Pie, is stolen from her on Halloween by a team of [[drag queen]]s dressed like her. Neither the film nor her performance drew positive reviews. In 2005, she briefly appeared as a spectator at a basketball game in ''[[Be Cool]]'', starring [[John Travolta]]. In late 2005, she agreed to play Lucy in the self-produced independent parody film ''[[Illegal Aliens (film)|Illegal Aliens]]'' alongside wrestler Joani \"[[Chyna]]\" Laurer. It attempted to parody several popular television shows from the 1970s and 1980s as well as several film franchises and was released direct-to-video on May 1, 2007, three months after Smith's death.\n\n===Endorsements===\nIn an interview on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Smith was asked what her \"Playmate diet\" consisted of. She instantly replied, \"Fried chicken.\" In October 2003, she became a spokeswoman for [[TrimSpa]], which allegedly helped her lose a reported {{convert|69|lb|kg}}. TrimSpa diet product company and Smith were sued in a [[class action]] lawsuit alleging their marketing of a weight loss pill was false or misleading.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17008284/ns/business-us-_business/t/anna-nicole-smith-trimspa-sued-over-diet-ads/ \"Anna Nicole Smith, TrimSpa Sued Over Diet Ads\"].

An even stronger [[naming taboo]] was current during the time of the [[History of China#Imperial era|Chinese Empire]], when other bearers of the emperor's name could be gravely punished for not having changed their name upon his ascension. Similarly, it is quite rare to see Chinese children bear the same name as their fathers{{spaced ndash}}the closest examples typically include small differences, such as the former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]]'s son, who is named [[Li Xiaopeng (politician)|Li Xiaopeng]].\n\nSince the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, some families have had [[generation name]]s worked out long in advance, and all members (or all male members) of a generation have the same first character in their two-character given names. In other families there is a small number of generational names which are cycled through. Together, these generation names may be a [[generation poem|poem]] about the hope or history of the family. This tradition has largely fallen into abeyance since the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]]; the \"Tse\" in [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-tung]] was the fourteenth generation of such a cycle, but he chose to ignore his family's generational poem to name his own sons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{linktext|\u7389}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nThere are also other conventions. It is frequently the case that children are given names based on [[Gender_role#Gender_stereotypes|gender stereotypes]], with boys acquiring 'masculine' names implying strength or courage while girls receive 'feminine' names concerning beauty or flowers. Since doubled characters are considered [[Chinese diminutives|diminutives]] in Chinese, many girls also receive names including a doubled pair of characters or two characters with identical pronunciation. A famous exception to this generally feminine practice is [[Yo-Yo Ma]].\n\nApart from generational names, siblings' names are frequently related in other ways as well. For example, one son's name may include a character meaning \"Sun\" ({{linktext|\u9633}} or {{linktext|\u65e5}}) while his sister would have the character for \"Moon\" ({{linktext|\u6708}}) or a character including the moon [[radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. It is also common to split [[modern Chinese]] words{{spaced ndash}}which now usually consist of two characters of similar meaning both to each other and the full word{{spaced ndash}}among a pair of children, such as Jiankang ({{linktext|\u5065\u5eb7}}, \"healthy\") appearing in the children's names as -jian ({{linktext|\u5065}}, \"strong\") and -kang ({{linktext|\u5eb7}}, \"healthy\").\n\nChinese personal names can also reflect periods of history. For example, many Chinese born during the [[Cultural Revolution]] have \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{linktext|\u5f3a\u56fd}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Country\" or \"Strengthening the Country\") or Dongfeng ({{linktext|\u4e1c|\u98ce}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). On [[Taiwan]], it was formerly common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Taiwan|Republic of China]]\" ({{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Patriotic names remain common but are becoming less popular{{spaced ndash}}960,000 Chinese are currently named Jianguo ({{linktext|\u5efa\u56fd}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Building the Country\") but only a few thousand more are now being added each year.<ref>Xinhua Net. \"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2007-10/01/content_6819482.htm]\". Oct 2007. Accessed 17 Mar 2012. {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n\nWithin families, adults rarely refer to each other by personal names. Adult relatives and children referring to adults generally use a family title such as \"Big Sister\", \"Second Sister\", \"Third Sister\", and so on. It is considered rude for a child to refer to parents by their given name, and this taboo is extended to all adult relatives.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title{{spaced ndash}}for example, \"Mister Zhang\", \"Mother Li\" or \"Chu's Wife\". Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children and are typically spoken completely; if the given name is two characters long, it is almost never truncated. Another common way to reference someone in a friendly way is to call them \"Old\" ({{linktext|\u8001}}, ''L\u01ceo'') or \"Little\" ({{linktext|\u5c0f}}, ''xi\u01ceo'') along with their surname.\n\nMany people have a non-Chinese name (typically [[English name|English]]) in addition to their Chinese names. For example, the Taiwanese politician [[James Soong|Soong Chu-yu]] is also known as \"James Soong\". In [[Hong Kong]], it is common to list the names all together, beginning with the English given name, moving on to the Chinese surname, and then ending with the Chinese given name{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[Alex Fong (actor)|Alex Fong Chung-Sun]]. Among [[American-born Chinese|American-born]] and other [[overseas Chinese]] it is common practice to be referred to primarily by one's non-Chinese name, with the Chinese one relegated to alternate or [[middle name]] status. Recent immigrants, however, often use their Chinese name as their [[legal name]] and adopt a non-Chinese name for casual use only.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin|pinyin romanization]] means treating a Chinese given name as a single word with no space between the letters of the two characters: for example, the common name \u738b\u79c0\u82f1 is properly rendered either with its [[Chinese tone|tone marks]] as W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng or without as Wang Xiuying, but should not be written as Wang Xiu Ying, Wang XiuYing, Wangxiuying, &c. The earlier [[Wade-Giles]] system accomplished the same effect by hyphenating the given name between the characters: for example, the same name would be written as Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsi\u00f9<sup>4</sup>-Y\u012bng<sup>1</sup>. However, many Chinese do not follow these rules, romanizing their names with a space between each. This can cause non\u2013Chinese-speakers to incorrectly take the names as divisible.\n\nIn regions where fortune-telling is more popular, many parents may name their children on the advice of [[Literomancy|literomancers]].  The advice are often given based on the number of strokes of the names or the perceived elemental value of the characters in relation to the child's birth time and personal elemental value; rarely on the sound of the name as there is no system of fortune-telling based on character pronunciations.  In jurisdictions where it is possible, people may also choose to change their legal given name, or their children's names, in order to improve their fortune.\n\n{{citation needed span|There is a trend to make the final character in a Chinese given name a character read in one of the level tones and not one read in an oblique tone.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Common Chinese names==\nAs of 2007, the most common names in China were:<ref>''Beijing News''. \"[http://news.thebeijingnews.com/0565/2007/07-26/034@030220.htm \u4e2d\u56fd\u91cd\u540d\u6700\u591a50\u59d3\u540d\u201c\u51fa\u7089\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914115742/http://news.thebeijingnews.com/0565/2007/07-26/034%40030220.htm |date=2007-09-14 }}\" 26 Jul 2007.

name]]s adopted by native speakers of the [[Chinese language]], both in majority-Sinophone countries and among the [[Chinese emigration|Chinese diaspora]].\n\n==Description==\nChinese given names are almost always made up of one or\u2014usually\u2014two [[Chinese characters|characters]] and are written ''after'' the surname. Therefore, Wei ({{linktext|\u4f1f}}) of the [[Zhang (surname)|Zhang]] ({{linktext|\u5f20}}) family is called \"Zhang Wei\" and not \"Wei Zhang\". Despite the relative paucity of [[Chinese surname]]s, given names can theoretically include any of the Chinese language's 100,000 characters<ref>The 2004 [[Taiwan]]ese [[Ministry of Education (Republic of China)|Ministry of Education]] ''[[Dictionary of Chinese Variant Form]]'' compiled 106,230.</ref> and contain almost any meaning.\n\nIt is considered disrespectful in China to name a child after an older relative, and both bad practice and disadvantageous for the child's fortune to copy the names of celebrities or famous historical figures. A common name like \"[[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]]\" might be possessed by tens of thousands of people,<ref>\u6cd5\u5236\u665a\u62a5(\u5317\u4eac).

Accessed 17 Mar 2012. {{in lang|zh}}</ref> but generally they were not named ''for'' the athlete. An even stronger [[naming taboo]] was current during the time of the [[History of China#Imperial era|Chinese Empire]], when other bearers of the emperor's name could be gravely punished for not having changed their name upon his ascension. Similarly, it is quite rare to see Chinese children bear the same name as their fathers{{spaced ndash}}the closest examples typically include small differences, such as the former [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]]'s son, who is named [[Li Xiaopeng (politician)|Li Xiaopeng]].\n\nSince the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, some families have had [[generation name]]s worked out long in advance, and all members (or all male members) of a generation have the same first character in their two-character given names. In other families there is a small number of generational names which are cycled through. Together, these generation names may be a [[generation poem|poem]] about the hope or history of the family. This tradition has largely fallen into abeyance since the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War|Civil War]]; the \"Tse\" in [[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse-tung]] was the fourteenth generation of such a cycle, but he chose to ignore his family's generational poem to name his own sons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} A similar practice was observed regarding the [[stage name]]s of [[Chinese opera]] performers: all the students entering a training academy in the same year would adopt the same first character in their new \"given name\". For example, as part of the class entering the National Drama School in 1933, [[Li Yuru]] adopted a name with the central character \"jade\" ({{linktext|\u7389}}).<ref>{{citation |last=Li |first=Ruru |authormask=Li Ruru |contribution-url=https://chinoperl.osu.edu/sites/chinoperl.osu.edu/files/back-issues-no.29-liruru-caoyu-liyuru-report-color-photos.pdf |contribution=2010 Commemorations of the Theatrical Careers of Cao Yu and Li Yuru |date=2010b |title=CHINOPERL Papers |volume=No. 29 |publisher=Conference on Chinese Oral and Performing Literature |p=225 }}.</ref>\n\nThere are also other conventions. It is frequently the case that children are given names based on [[Gender_role#Gender_stereotypes|gender stereotypes]], with boys acquiring 'masculine' names implying strength or courage while girls receive 'feminine' names concerning beauty or flowers. Since doubled characters are considered [[Chinese diminutives|diminutives]] in Chinese, many girls also receive names including a doubled pair of characters or two characters with identical pronunciation. A famous exception to this generally feminine practice is [[Yo-Yo Ma]].\n\nApart from generational names, siblings' names are frequently related in other ways as well. For example, one son's name may include a character meaning \"Sun\" ({{linktext|\u9633}} or {{linktext|\u65e5}}) while his sister would have the character for \"Moon\" ({{linktext|\u6708}}) or a character including the moon [[radical (Chinese characters)|radical]]. It is also common to split [[modern Chinese]] words{{spaced ndash}}which now usually consist of two characters of similar meaning both to each other and the full word{{spaced ndash}}among a pair of children, such as Jiankang ({{linktext|\u5065\u5eb7}}, \"healthy\") appearing in the children's names as -jian ({{linktext|\u5065}}, \"strong\") and -kang ({{linktext|\u5eb7}}, \"healthy\").\n\nChinese personal names can also reflect periods of history. For example, many Chinese born during the [[Cultural Revolution]] have \"revolutionary names\" such as Qiangguo ({{linktext|\u5f3a\u56fd}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Strong Country\" or \"Strengthening the Country\") or Dongfeng ({{linktext|\u4e1c|\u98ce}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Eastern Wind\"). On [[Taiwan]], it was formerly common to incorporate one of the four characters of the name \"[[Taiwan|Republic of China]]\" ({{linktext|\u4e2d\u83ef|\u6c11\u570b}}, ''Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3'') into masculine names. Patriotic names remain common but are becoming less popular{{spaced ndash}}960,000 Chinese are currently named Jianguo ({{linktext|\u5efa\u56fd}}, <small>lit.</small> \"Building the Country\") but only a few thousand more are now being added each year.<ref>Xinhua Net. \"[http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2007-10/01/content_6819482.htm]\". Oct 2007. Accessed 17 Mar 2012. {{in lang|zh}}</ref>\n\nWithin families, adults rarely refer to each other by personal names. Adult relatives and children referring to adults generally use a family title such as \"Big Sister\", \"Second Sister\", \"Third Sister\", and so on. It is considered rude for a child to refer to parents by their given name, and this taboo is extended to all adult relatives.\n\nWhen speaking of non-family social acquaintances, people are generally referred to by a title{{spaced ndash}}for example, \"Mister Zhang\", \"Mother Li\" or \"Chu's Wife\". Personal names are used when referring to adult friends or to children and are typically spoken completely; if the given name is two characters long, it is almost never truncated. Another common way to reference someone in a friendly way is to call them \"Old\" ({{linktext|\u8001}}, ''L\u01ceo'') or \"Little\" ({{linktext|\u5c0f}}, ''xi\u01ceo'') along with their surname.\n\nMany people have a non-Chinese name (typically [[English name|English]]) in addition to their Chinese names. For example, the Taiwanese politician [[James Soong|Soong Chu-yu]] is also known as \"James Soong\". In [[Hong Kong]], it is common to list the names all together, beginning with the English given name, moving on to the Chinese surname, and then ending with the Chinese given name{{spaced ndash}}for example, [[Alex Fong (actor)|Alex Fong Chung-Sun]]. Among [[American-born Chinese|American-born]] and other [[overseas Chinese]] it is common practice to be referred to primarily by one's non-Chinese name, with the Chinese one relegated to alternate or [[middle name]] status. Recent immigrants, however, often use their Chinese name as their [[legal name]] and adopt a non-Chinese name for casual use only.\n\nProper use of [[Pinyin|pinyin romanization]] means treating a Chinese given name as a single word with no space between the letters of the two characters: for example, the common name \u738b\u79c0\u82f1 is properly rendered either with its [[Chinese tone|tone marks]] as W\u00e1ng Xi\u00f9y\u012bng or without as Wang Xiuying, but should not be written as Wang Xiu Ying, Wang XiuYing, Wangxiuying, &c. The earlier [[Wade-Giles]] system accomplished the same effect by hyphenating the given name between the characters: for example, the same name would be written as Wang<sup>2</sup> Hsi\u00f9<sup>4</sup>-Y\u012bng<sup>1</sup>. However, many Chinese do not follow these rules, romanizing their names with a space between each. This can cause non\u2013Chinese-speakers to incorrectly take the names as divisible.\n\nIn regions where fortune-telling is more popular, many parents may name their children on the advice of [[Literomancy|literomancers]].  The advice are often given based on the number of strokes of the names or the perceived elemental value of the characters in relation to the child's birth time and personal elemental value; rarely on the sound of the name as there is no system of fortune-telling based on character pronunciations.  In jurisdictions where it is possible, people may also choose to change their legal given name, or their children's names, in order to improve their fortune.\n\n{{citation needed span|There is a trend to make the final character in a Chinese given name a character read in one of the level tones and not one read in an oblique tone.|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Common Chinese names==\nAs of 2007, the most common names in China were:<ref>''Beijing News''. \"[http://news.thebeijingnews.com/0565/2007/07-26/034@030220.htm \u4e2d\u56fd\u91cd\u540d\u6700\u591a50\u59d3\u540d\u201c\u51fa\u7089\u201d] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914115742/http://news.thebeijingnews.com/0565/2007/07-26/034%40030220.htm |date=2007-09-14 }}\" 26 Jul 2007.

Incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Governor [[John Bel Edwards]] won re-election to a second term, defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] rube [[Eddie Rispone]]. Edwards became the first Democratic Governor of Louisiana to win re-election to a second consecutive term in 44 years since [[Edwin Edwards]] (no relation) in [[1975 Louisiana gubernatorial election|1975]]. It was the closest Louisiana gubernatorial election since [[1979 Louisiana gubernatorial election|1979]].\n\nUnder Louisiana's [[Louisiana primary|jungle primary]] system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. Because no candidate received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 12, 2019, a runoff election was held on November 16, 2019, between the top two candidates in the primary, Edwards and Rispone.<ref>https://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/PublishedDocuments/ElectionsCalendar2019.pdf</ref> Louisiana is the only state that has a jungle primary system ([[California]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] have a similar [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|top two primary]] system).\n\n== Background ==\nOn Edwards\u2019 Inauguration Day in 2015, House Republicans, in a break with tradition, elected their own speaker, Representative [[Taylor Barras]] of New Iberia, over Edwards' choice, Representative [[Walt Leger III|Walt Leger]] of New Orleans. This move was said to be orchestrated by House GOP Chairman [[Lance Harris]], who was considered a potential gubernatorial 2019 candidate and was a frequent Edwards critic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/legislature/article_1e1b57db-13d3-5822-b86f-62ed800f1ce3.html|title=In rarely seen twist, last-minute candidate Taylor Barras selected Louisiana House speaker|last=mballard@theadvocate.com|first=mark ballard|work=The Advocate|access-date=May 30, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Edwards and Republican Legislative leaders repeatedly clashed over budget, tax and spending measures.\n\n[[Attorney General of Louisiana|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Landry]] was perhaps Edwards' most prominent detractor, filing multiple lawsuits against the governor and frequently criticizing him in the media.

Edwards became the first Democratic Governor of Louisiana to win re-election to a second consecutive term in 44 years since [[Edwin Edwards]] (no relation) in [[1975 Louisiana gubernatorial election|1975]]. It was the closest Louisiana gubernatorial election since [[1979 Louisiana gubernatorial election|1979]].\n\nUnder Louisiana's [[Louisiana primary|jungle primary]] system, all candidates appear on the same ballot, regardless of party, and voters may vote for any candidate, regardless of their party affiliation. Because no candidate received an absolute majority of the vote during the primary election on October 12, 2019, a runoff election was held on November 16, 2019, between the top two candidates in the primary, Edwards and Rispone.<ref>https://www.sos.la.gov/ElectionsAndVoting/PublishedDocuments/ElectionsCalendar2019.pdf</ref> Louisiana is the only state that has a jungle primary system ([[California]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] have a similar [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|top two primary]] system).\n\n== Background ==\nOn Edwards\u2019 Inauguration Day in 2015, House Republicans, in a break with tradition, elected their own speaker, Representative [[Taylor Barras]] of New Iberia, over Edwards' choice, Representative [[Walt Leger III|Walt Leger]] of New Orleans. This move was said to be orchestrated by House GOP Chairman [[Lance Harris]], who was considered a potential gubernatorial 2019 candidate and was a frequent Edwards critic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/politics/legislature/article_1e1b57db-13d3-5822-b86f-62ed800f1ce3.html|title=In rarely seen twist, last-minute candidate Taylor Barras selected Louisiana House speaker|last=mballard@theadvocate.com|first=mark ballard|work=The Advocate|access-date=May 30, 2017|language=en}}</ref> Edwards and Republican Legislative leaders repeatedly clashed over budget, tax and spending measures.\n\n[[Attorney General of Louisiana|Attorney General]] [[Jeff Landry]] was perhaps Edwards' most prominent detractor, filing multiple lawsuits against the governor and frequently criticizing him in the media.

The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984, he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

The acclaim earned by this LP led Prine to focus on his musical career, and he recorded three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine was known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary and songs that recollect melancholy tales from his life. In 2020, he received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].\n\n==Early life==\nPrine was the son of William Mason Prine, a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Valentine (Hamm), a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]].

S. federal budget woes and a general migration of information from printed to digital format, starting in April 2011, most U.S. workers will no longer receive their annual Social Security benefit estimates in the mail. \"In light of the current budget situation, we are suspending the mailing of the annual statements beginning in April\", said Social Security spokesman Mark Lassiter. Congress has failed to agree on a budget for the current fiscal year, which means that most federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, are operating at last year's spending levels. The annual Social Security benefit statement, which contains a summary of an individual's earnings history and estimated retirement benefits at various ages, generally arrives about three months before the worker's birth month. \"So folks born in July will likely be the first ones who won't get the annual statement\", Lassiter says. However, workers can still get an estimate of their projected retirement benefits based on their actual work history at www.ssa.gov/estimator. Thus, U. S. citizens need to look at their social security account retirement benefit estimator at that link instead of passively waiting each year for a paper statement (which from now on they will not receive) \u2013 thus, they should make a bookmark of this government link for yearly use.<ref>[http://money.msn.com/retirement/article.aspx?post=25a6ebe2-e5c2-403b-bcc1-4d946946b812 Social Security won't mail annual statements- MSN Money] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404122948/http://money.msn.com/retirement/article.aspx?post=25a6ebe2-e5c2-403b-bcc1-4d946946b812 |date=2011-04-04 }}.

S. federal budget woes and a general migration of information from printed to digital format, starting in April 2011, most U.S. workers will no longer receive their annual Social Security benefit estimates in the mail. \"In light of the current budget situation, we are suspending the mailing of the annual statements beginning in April\", said Social Security spokesman Mark Lassiter. Congress has failed to agree on a budget for the current fiscal year, which means that most federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, are operating at last year's spending levels. The annual Social Security benefit statement, which contains a summary of an individual's earnings history and estimated retirement benefits at various ages, generally arrives about three months before the worker's birth month. \"So folks born in July will likely be the first ones who won't get the annual statement\", Lassiter says. However, workers can still get an estimate of their projected retirement benefits based on their actual work history at www.ssa.gov/estimator. Thus, U. S. citizens need to look at their social security account retirement benefit estimator at that link instead of passively waiting each year for a paper statement (which from now on they will not receive) \u2013 thus, they should make a bookmark of this government link for yearly use.<ref>[http://money.msn.com/retirement/article.aspx?post=25a6ebe2-e5c2-403b-bcc1-4d946946b812 Social Security won't mail annual statements- MSN Money] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404122948/http://money.msn.com/retirement/article.aspx?post=25a6ebe2-e5c2-403b-bcc1-4d946946b812 |date=2011-04-04 }}.

The Supreme Court denied Vernor's petition for certiorari \u2013 the action affirms the lower court of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] which held that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale it was, in fact, not a \"sale with restrictions on use\", giving rise to no right to resell the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The Ninth Circuit's decision means that the policy considerations involved in the case might affect motion pictures and libraries as well as sales of used software. The net effect of the Ninth Circuit's ruling (and now the Supreme Court's) is to limit the \"You bought it, you own it\" principle asserted by such organizations whom would like to resell items.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/supreme-court-wont-hear-appeal-from-man-who-wants-to-resell-used-software/2011/10/03/gIQAF16xHL_story.html ''Washington Post''].

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God. Its troops have taken over and placed an idol in the city of God.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=MacArthur|first1=John|title=Strange Fire \u2013 Session One \u2013 John MacArthur|url=http://thecripplegate.com/strange-fire-session-one-john-macarthur/|website=The Cripplegate|publisher=DISQUS}}</ref>\n\nHe broadly calls modern \"visions, revelations, voices from heaven...dreams, speaking in tongues, prophecies, out-of-body experiences, trip to heaven, anointings, miracles \u2013 all false, all lies, all deceptions \u2013 attributed falsely to the Holy Spirit.\" And that \"The Charismatic movement has stolen the Holy Spirit and created a golden calf, and they're dancing around the golden calf as if it were the Holy Spirit.\"<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|title=The Modern Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f09vfUgenYQ}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/sermons/90-415/the-modern-blasphemy-of-the-holy-spirit|last1=MacArthur|first1=John|title=The Modern Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit|date=October 23, 2011|publisher=Grace to You|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> He has made a list of Gifts of the Spirit, mostly from 1 Cor. 12-14, but holds that \"once the New Testament was finished, those sign gifts ceased to have a function\", and ended with the conclusion of the [[Apostolic Age]], around AD 100.<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthu|first=John|title=The Temporary Sign Gifts, Part 3|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/print/sermons/1858|publisher=Grace to You|accessdate=December 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a subsequent teaching, \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\" (2013), MacArthur allowed that within the Charismatic movement there were those who believed in the authority of Scripture, honored the Lord, and pursued Godly living, and that the movement retained enough gospel truth so that souls could be saved within it. However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

He believes that the Biblical roles of [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] and [[pastor]] are restricted to men by citing the biblical passage of [[1 Timothy 2:12|1 Timothy 2:11-12]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/articles/A168/Gods-High-Call-for-Women|title=God's High Call for Women|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/bible-qna/BQ112012/Should-Women-Teach-in-Church|title=Should Women Teach in Church?|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/blog/B130829/can-women-exercise-authority-in-the-church|title=Can Women Exercise Authority in the Church?|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychology ===\nMacArthur is also an advocate of [[Nouthetic Counseling]], which stresses the Bible as a sufficient tool for counseling people with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

MacArthur is very open about opposing same-sex marriage, against female pastors, and the social justice movement.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ix_eHfGYuA</ref> He has delivered multiple sermons where he discusses these issues.<ref name=\"gty.org\" />\n\nIn 2012, at The Shepherd's Conference, MacArthur was participating in a word association questionnaire where the moderator gave him the name \"[[Steven Furtick]].\" MacArthur proceeded to argue that Furtick, pastor of [[Elevation Church]], was \"unqualified\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buttel |first1=Cameron |title=Unqualified, Not Unworthy |url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B160509/unqualified-not-unworthy |website=Grace To You |accessdate=25 November 2019 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref> Furtick responded to this comment in his 2016 book ''Unqualified: How God Uses Broken People to Do Big Things''. \n\nIn 2013, after the time of closing for the Annual Conference 'For His sake,' and hosted by pastor Miguel Nunez in the Dominican Republic, pastor MacArthur was asked by one of the attendants, What happens if a christian committed suicide? Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. \n\nIn 2018, and After five years trying to convince MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. \n\nIn 2018, and After five years trying to convince MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

Its associated club has a social structure, culture and rituals based on the walk and Christian and folklore traditions from the area through which it passes.\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea of a walk originated from an article in the ''[[Dalesman]]'' magazine in August 1955. Its author, Bill Cowley, described a {{convert|40|mi|km}} walk across the North York Moors from east to west (or vice versa) on [[Calluna|heather]] all the way except for when crossing one or two roads. Given the remoteness of the area, a lone walker might not encounter another during the one to two day journey. Cowley issued a challenge to see if anyone could walk from Scarth Wood Moor at the western extremity of the moors to [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] on the coast, keeping on or close to the main [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[moorland]], in a twenty-four-hour period. The first crossing was completed shortly afterwards on 1 and 2 October 1955. Cowley was in the party that made the crossing in 23 hours and he wrote a book, ''Lyke Wake Walk'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1959 |title=Lyke Wake Walk: Forty Miles Across the North Yorkshire Moors |edition=1st |location=[[Skipton]], [[Yorkshire]] |publisher=Dalesman Books}}</ref> which he kept up to date by frequent revision. The book ran to twelve editions in the author's lifetime and sold many thousands of copies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1993 |title=Lyke Wake Walk and the Lyke Wake Way |edition=12th |location=Skipton, Yorkshire |publisher=Dalesman Books |isbn=1-85568-063-7}}</ref> It was revised in 2001 by Paul Sherwood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Sherwood |date=2001 |title=Lyke Wake Walk |location=Skipton, Yorkshire |publisher=Dalesman Publishing |isbn=1-85568-191-9}}</ref>\n\nCowley's idea developed over the years before he issued the challenge in 1955. He wrote a poem in 1935/6, ''Storming Along'', describing traversing the moors and mentions a number of the walk's landmarks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1945 |title=Tara Devi and Other Verses |location=India |publisher=Punjab Boy Scouts Association}}</ref> His early contributions to the ''Dalesman'', appear in retrospect, to hint at the idea of the walk<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Bill Cowley |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=17 August 1994 |newspaper=The Guardian |ISSN=0261-3077}}</ref> drawing on his appreciation of the works of the archaeologist [[Frank Elgee]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Elgee |first=F.

A successful crossing must be completed within 24 hours (a ski crossing in 24 hours daylight is also acceptable). There is no exact route but the Lyke Wake Club and its successor have rules regarding what can be considered a successful crossing. For record purposes the walk starts at its original departure point, the [[Ordnance Survey]] [[Triangulation station|Trig point]] on Scarth Wood Moor, near [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire|Osmotherley]],<ref>{{coord|54.389|-1.273|region:GB_scale:50000}}</ref> (NGR: SE 459 997) and finishes in the bar of the Raven Hall Hotel in [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]]. (NGR: NZ 981 018)<ref>{{coord|54.397|-0.492|region:GB_scale:50000}}</ref> For practical purposes the acceptable end points are the Lyke Wake Stone adjacent to Sheep Wash car park at Osmotherley Reservoir at the western end and Beacon Howes car park where there is a second Lyke Wake Stone at the eastern end. Successful crossings must stick to the moorland summits as far as practicable and walkers straying into [[Eskdale, North Yorkshire|Eskdale]] are disqualified. The route crosses the [[Stokesley]]-[[Helmsley]] road (B1257) between Point 842 (Clay Bank Top) and Point 503 (Orterley Lane end), the [[Whitby]]-[[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] road ([[A169 road|A169]]) between Point 945 (Sil Howe) and Point 701 (near Saltergate) and the [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]-Whitby road ([[A171 road|A171]]) between Point 538 (Evan Howe) and Point 579 (Falcon Inn).<ref>''Lyke Wake Club Newsletter'', Summer 1971.</ref> Point numbers are the height in feet above sea level as given on the one inch Ordnance Survey Tourist Map of the North York Moors (1970 edition); the metric equivalents are identified on the Landranger and Explorer Series maps.\n[[File:The Wainstones.jpg|thumb|The Wainstones on Hasty Bank]]\n\nThe original route began at Scarth Wood Moor trig point, followed the Alum/Jet Miners Track from Live Moor to [[Hasty Bank]], then to Smuggler's Trod, Bloworth, Ironstone Railway, Esklets, White Cross (Fat Betty), Shunner Howe, Hamer, [[Blue Man-i'-th'-Moss]], Wheeldale Stepping Stones, Fen House, Tom Cross Rigg, Snod Hill, Lilla Howe, Jugger Howe ravine, Helwath, Pye Howe Rigg, to Ravenscar (Raven Hall Hotel). This route is no longer possible as a section is within the Ministry of Defence controlled area at [[RAF Fylingdales]] Early Warning Radar Station.\n[[File:Boundary Stone, Urra Moor - geograph.org.uk - 11308.jpg|thumb|Boundary Stone, Urra Moor]]\n\nMost crossings now follow the classic route,<ref>{{cite book |last=Goodman |first=Jim |date=1997 |title=The Lyke Wake Walk in Quarter Mile Steps |location=London |publisher=Minerva Press |isbn=1-8610-6368-7}}</ref> a variation of the original. It begins at Scarth Wood Moor trig point or the western Lyke Wake Stone in Sheepwash car park, follows the summit track from Live Moor over [[Carlton Bank|Carlton Moor]], [[Cringle Moor]], Cold Moor and Hasty Bank, Smuggler's Trod, Bloworth, Ironstone Railway, Esklets or South Flat Howe or Lion Inn, White Cross (Fat Betty), Shunner Howe, Hamer, Blue Man-i'-th'-Moss, Wheeldale Stepping Stones, Fen Bogs, Eller Beck, Lilla Howe, Jugger Howe ravine, Stony Marl Moor, to the eastern Lyke Wake Stone at Beacon Howes or Ravenscar. A summary description of the classic route with photographs is described by Richard Gilbert in his book, ''The Big Walks''<ref>{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Ken |last2=Gilbert |first2=Richard |date=1980 |title=The Big Walks : Challenging Mountain Walks and Scrambles in the British Isles |location=London |publisher=Diadem Books |isbn=0-906371-60-0}}</ref> and a guidebook is available.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smailes |first=Brian |date=2013 |title=The Lyke Wake Walk Guide |edition=4th |location=South Yorkshire |publisher=Challenge Publications |isbn=978-1-903568-70-5}}</ref> A detailed illustrated description of the western half of the walk is given in [[Alfred Wainwright]]'s '' A Coast to Coast Walk''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wainwright |first=A. |author-link=Alfred Wainwright |date=1973 |title=A Coast to Coast Walk |location=[[Kendal]], [[Westmorland]] |publisher=[[Westmorland Gazette]]}}</ref>\n\nMost crossings are done west to east. The original challenge, crossing towards the sea in an easterly direction is thought to be easier because of the [[prevailing wind]] from the west<ref>{{cite book |last=Redfern |first=Roger A. |date=1976 |title=Walking in England |location=London |publisher=Robert Hale & Company |isbn=0-7091-5483-6}}</ref> making it easier to walk with the wind on one's back and with the heather lying away from the walker. On a west to east crossing, the major ascents and descents occur in the first ten miles when the walker is relatively fresh. A traverse of the Lyke Wake Walk route is referred to as a crossing and the act of participating in the walk is known as dirging.\n\nIn the first few years, the walk followed a difficult route requiring endeavour and physical endurance as there was no track over most of its length. From the mid-1970s the walk was re-thought because the numbers of people attempting it had, in places, eroded the ground surface,<ref>{{cite book |last=Thackrah |first=Ian |date=1985 |title=Yorkshire: York, Yorkshire Dales & North York Moors |series=Golden Hart Guides |location=London |publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson |isbn=0-283-99203-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/yorkshire00iant }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cleare |first=John |date=1988 |title=Fifty Best Hill Walks of Britain |location=Exeter |publisher=Webb & Bower |isbn=978-0-86350-142-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Smailes |first=Brian |date=1994 |title=The Novices Guide to Completing the Lyke Wake Walk |location=Barnsley |publisher=Challenge Publications |pages=Photographic Plates 3 & 4 |isbn=978-0-95269-001-6}}</ref> and disturbance to game birds, sheep and wildlife by walkers and their support parties at all times of day and night, particularly in Osmotherley, Ravenscar and at remote farms. Footpath erosion was compounded by the walk sharing long stretches of its route with the [[Cleveland Way]] and Wainwright's [[Coast to Coast Walk]]. Other users, some legal, some illegal, including mountain bikes, motor cycles, quad bikes and agricultural and moorland management vehicles exacerbated the problem. Alternative routes are possible and the walk club works with the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] authority to try to limit environmental damage.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey no longer marks the walk route on maps at the recommendation of the National Park Authority, as a measure to discourage large numbers undertaking a crossing and the walk was not mentioned in National Park Authority publication for a number of years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Roland |date=1993 |title=Explore Britain's National Parks |location=Basingstoke |publisher=[[AA plc|Automobile Association]] |isbn=0-7495-0683-0}}</ref> \n[[File:The Face Stone - geograph.org.uk - 24229.jpg|thumb|The Face Stone, on Urra Moor]]\n\n===Other long-distance walks in the area===\nAlternative challenge walks and trails include the Hambleton Hobble, the Shepherd's Round, the [[White Rose Walk]], the Lyke Wake Way, the Monk's Trod, the Rail Trail, Hambleton Drove Road, the Crosses Walk and the long distance trails. A walk from west to east across the North York Moors around ten miles south of the Lyke Wake Walk from [[Gormire Lake]] to Cloughton Wyke termed, in a play on words, the Lake Wyke Walk has been suggested.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehumangenehome.com/#/page-3/4534886078 |title=North York Moors ...

It entails {{convert|50|to|60|mi|km}} of walking depending on the route taken and can be completed over two or three days.\n[[File:Blue Man in the Moss.......... Wheeldale Moor. - geograph.org.uk - 18200.jpg|thumb|Blue Man i' th' Moss, Wheeldale Moor]]\n\nAlfred Wainwright suggested the walk could form an acceptable finish to his Coast to Coast Walk but did not specify if he recommends doing the {{convert|40|mi}} in a single push.

Club meetings were termed \"wakes\" and the club badge was coffin shaped and decorated with the Ordnance Survey symbol for a [[tumulus]] (burial mound), many of which are found along the route.

Its associated club has a social structure, culture and rituals based on the walk and Christian and folklore traditions from the area through which it passes.\n\n==History==\n\nThe idea of a walk originated from an article in the ''[[Dalesman]]'' magazine in August 1955. Its author, Bill Cowley, described a {{convert|40|mi|km}} walk across the North York Moors from east to west (or vice versa) on [[Calluna|heather]] all the way except for when crossing one or two roads. Gven the remoteness of the area, a lone walker might not encounter another during the one to two day journey. Cowley issued a challenge to see if anyone could walk from Scarth Wood Moor at the western extremity of the moors to [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]] on the coast, keeping on or close to the main [[Drainage divide|watershed]] of the [[moorland]], in a twenty-four-hour period. The first crossing was completed shortly afterwards on 1 and 2 October 1955. Cowley was in the party that made the crossing in 23 hours and he wrote a book, ''Lyke Wake Walk'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1959 |title=Lyke Wake Walk: Forty Miles Across the North Yorkshire Moors |edition=1st |location=[[Skipton]], [[Yorkshire]] |publisher=Dalesman Books}}</ref> which he kept up to date by frequent revision. The book ran to twelve editions in the author's lifetime and sold many thousands of copies.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1993 |title=Lyke Wake Walk and the Lyke Wake Way |edition=12th |location=Skipton, Yorkshire |publisher=Dalesman Books |isbn=1-85568-063-7}}</ref> It was revised in 2001 by Paul Sherwood.<ref>{{cite book |last=Paul |first=Sherwood |date=2001 |title=Lyke Wake Walk |location=Skipton, Yorkshire |publisher=Dalesman Publishing |isbn=1-85568-191-9}}</ref>\n\nCowley's idea developed over the years before he issued the challenge in 1955. He wrote a poem in 1935/6, ''Storming Along'', describing traversing the moors and mentions a number of the walk's landmarks.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cowley |first=Bill |date=1945 |title=Tara Devi and Other Verses |location=India |publisher=Punjab Boy Scouts Association}}</ref> His early contributions to the ''Dalesman'', appear in retrospect, to hint at the idea of the walk<ref>{{cite news |title=Obituary: Bill Cowley |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=17 August 1994 |newspaper=The Guardian |ISSN=0261-3077}}</ref> drawing on his appreciation of the works of the archaeologist [[Frank Elgee]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Elgee |first=F.

A successful crossing must be completed within 24 hours (a ski crossing in 24 hours daylight is also acceptable). There is no exact route but the Lyke Wake Club and its successor have rules regarding what can be considered a successful crossing. For record purposes the walk starts at its original departure point, the [[Ordnance Survey]] [[Triangulation station|Trig point]] on Scarth Wood Moor, near [[Osmotherley, North Yorkshire|Osmotherley]],<ref>{{coord|54.389|-1.273|region:GB_scale:50000}}</ref> (NGR: SE 459 997) and finishes in the bar of the Raven Hall Hotel in [[Ravenscar, North Yorkshire|Ravenscar]]. (NGR: NZ 981 018)<ref>{{coord|54.397|-0.492|region:GB_scale:50000}}</ref> For practical purposes the acceptable end points are the Lyke Wake Stone adjacent to Sheep Wash car park at Osmotherley Reservoir at the western end and Beacon Howes car park where there is a second Lyke Wake Stone at the eastern end. Successful crossings must stick to the moorland summits as far as practicable and walkers straying into [[Eskdale, North Yorkshire|Eskdale]] are disqualified. The route crosses the [[Stokesley]]-[[Helmsley]] road (B1257) between Point 842 (Clay Bank Top) and Point 503 (Orterley Lane end), the [[Whitby]]-[[Pickering, North Yorkshire|Pickering]] road ([[A169 road|A169]]) between Point 945 (Sil Howe) and Point 701 (near Saltergate) and the [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]]-Whitby road ([[A171 road|A171]]) between Point 538 (Evan Howe) and Point 579 (Falcon Inn).<ref>''Lyke Wake Club Newsletter'', Summer 1971.</ref> Point numbers are the height in feet above sea level as given on the one inch Ordnance Survey Tourist Map of the North York Moors (1970 edition); the metric equivalents are identified on the Landranger and Explorer Series maps.\n[[File:The Wainstones.jpg|thumb|The Wainstones on Hasty Bank]]\n\nThe original route began at Scarth Wood Moor trig point, followed the Alum/Jet Miners Track from Live Moor to [[Hasty Bank]], then to Smuggler's Trod, Bloworth, Ironstone Railway, Esklets, White Cross (Fat Betty), Shunner Howe, Hamer, [[Blue Man-i'-th'-Moss]], Wheeldale Stepping Stones, Fen House, Tom Cross Rigg, Snod Hill, Lilla Howe, Jugger Howe ravine, Helwath, Pye Howe Rigg, to Ravenscar (Raven Hall Hotel).

The original challenge, crossing towards the sea in an easterly direction is thought to be easier because of the [[prevailing wind]] from the west<ref>{{cite book |last=Redfern |first=Roger A. |date=1976 |title=Walking in England |location=London |publisher=Robert Hale & Company |isbn=0-7091-5483-6}}</ref> making it easier to walk with the wind on one's back and with the heather lying away from the walker. On a west to east crossing, the major ascents and descents occur in the first ten miles when the walker is relatively fresh. A traverse of the Lyke Wake Walk route is referred to as a crossing and the act of participating in the walk is known as dirging.\n\nIn the first few years, the walk followed a difficult route requiring endeavour and physical endurance as there was no track over most of its length. From the mid-1970s the walk was re-thought because the numbers of people attempting it had, in places, eroded the ground surface,<ref>{{cite book |last=Thackrah |first=Ian |date=1985 |title=Yorkshire: York, Yorkshire Dales & North York Moors |series=Golden Hart Guides |location=London |publisher=Sidgwick & Jackson |isbn=0-283-99203-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/yorkshire00iant }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cleare |first=John |date=1988 |title=Fifty Best Hill Walks of Britain |location=Exeter |publisher=Webb & Bower |isbn=978-0-86350-142-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Smailes |first=Brian |date=1994 |title=The Novices Guide to Completing the Lyke Wake Walk |location=Barnsley |publisher=Challenge Publications |pages=Photographic Plates 3 & 4 |isbn=978-0-95269-001-6}}</ref> and disturbance to game birds, sheep and wildlife by walkers and their support parties at all times of day and night, particularly in Osmotherley, Ravenscar and at remote farms. Footpath erosion was compounded by the walk sharing long stretches of its route with the [[Cleveland Way]] and Wainwright's [[Coast to Coast Walk]]. Other users, some legal, some illegal, including mountain bikes, motor cycles, quad bikes and agricultural and moorland management vehicles exacerbated the problem. Alternative routes are possible and the walk club works with the [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] authority to try to limit environmental damage.\n\nThe Ordnance Survey no longer marks the walk route on maps at the recommendation of the National Park Authority, as a measure to discourage large numbers undertaking a crossing and the walk was not mentioned in National Park Authority publication for a number of years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Roland |date=1993 |title=Explore Britain's National Parks |location=Basingstoke |publisher=[[AA plc|Automobile Association]] |isbn=0-7495-0683-0}}</ref> \n[[File:The Face Stone - geograph.org.uk - 24229.jpg|thumb|The Face Stone, on Urra Moor]]\n\n===Other long-distance walks in the area===\nAlternative challenge walks and trails include the Hambleton Hobble, the Shepherd's Round, the [[White Rose Walk]], the Lyke Wake Way, the Monk's Trod, the Rail Trail, Hambleton Drove Road, the Crosses Walk and the long distance trails.
