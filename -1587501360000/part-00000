[[Distilled water]] has been the most common form of purified water, but, in recent years, water is more frequently purified by other processes including [[capacitive deionization]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtering]], [[microfiltration]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[ultraviolet]] [[oxidation]], or [[electrodeionization]]. Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce [[ultrapure water]] of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). \n\nPurified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It is also used in the commercial [[beverage industry]] as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain product consistency. It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which has been treated (\"rendered potable\") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.\n\n==Parameters of water purity==\n\nPurified water is usually produced by the purification of [[drinking water]] or [[ground water]]. The impurities that may need to be removed are:\n*inorganic ions (typically monitored as electrical conductivity or resistivity or specific tests)\n*organic compounds (typically monitored as TOC or by specific tests)\n*bacteria (monitored by total viable counts or [[epifluorescence]])\n*endotoxins and nucleases (monitored by [[limulus amebocyte lysate|LAL]] or specific enzyme tests)\n*particulates (typically controlled by filtration)\n*gases (typically managed by degassing when required)\n\n==Purification methods==\n\n===Distillation===\nDistilled water is produced by a process of [[distillation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/facts-faits/faqs_bottle_water-eau_embouteillee-eng.php|title= Frequently asked questions about bottled water|accessdate=2009-05-24|publisher= Health Canada}}</ref> Distillation involves [[boiling]] the water and then condensing the [[vapor]] into a clean container, leaving solid contaminants behind. Distillation produces very pure water. A white or yellowish mineral scale is left in the distillation apparatus, which requires regular cleaning. Distilled water, like all purified water, must be stored in a sterilized container to guarantee the absence of bacteria. For many procedures, more economical alternatives are available, such as deionized water, and are used in place of distilled water.\n\n===Double distillation===\nDouble-distilled water (abbreviated \"ddH<sub>2</sub>O\", \"Bidest. water\" or \"DDW\") is prepared by slow boiling the uncontaminated condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling. Historically, it was the de facto standard for highly purified laboratory water for [[biochemistry]] and used in laboratory trace analysis until combination purification methods of water purification became widespread.\n\n===Deionization===\n[[File:Cation anion ion exchange.jpg|thumb|Large cation/anion [[ion exchange]]rs used in demineralization of [[boiler feedwater]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mischissin|first1=Stephen G.|title=University of Rochester - Investigation of Steam Turbine Extraction Line Failures|url=http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015|location=Arlington, VA|pages=25\u201326|date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923215229/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>]]\nDeionized water (''DI water'', ''DIW'' or ''de-ionized water''), often synonymous with ''demineralized water / DM water'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.image2output.com/deionised-water-25l.html|title=Deionised Water 25L|publisher=Image2output.com|date=2008-12-21|accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> is [[water]] that has had almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as [[cation]]s like [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[copper]], and [[anion]]s such as [[chloride]] and [[sulfate]]. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured [[ion-exchange resin]]s, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. \n\nHowever, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using [[electrodeionization]].\n\nThree types of deionization exist: co-current, counter-current, and mixed bed.\n\n====Co-current deionization====\nCo-current deionization refers to the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter at the top of an ion exchange column and exit at the bottom. Co-current operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current deionization because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.\n\nThe process is still used, and can be maximized with the fine tuning of the flow of regenerants within the ion exchange column.\n\n====Counter-current deionization====\nCounter-current deionization comes in two forms, each requiring engineered internals:\n#Upflow columns where input water enters from the bottom and regenerants enter from the top of the ion exchange column.\n#Upflow regeneration where water enters from the top and regenerants enter from the bottom.\n\nIn both cases, separate distribution headers (input water, input regenerant, exit water, and exit regenerant) must be tuned to: the input water quality and flow, the time of operation between regenerations, and the desired product water analysis.\n\nCounter-current deionization is the more attractive method of ion exchange. Chemicals (regenerants) flow in the opposite direction to the service flow. Less time for regeneration is required when compared to cocurrent columns. The quality of the finished product can be as low as .5 parts per million. The main advantage of counter-current deionization is the low operating cost, due to a low usage of regenerants during the regeneration process.\n\n====Mixed bed deionization====\nMixed bed deionization is a 50/50 mixture of cation and anion resin combined in a single ion exchange column. With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed ion exchange column is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed deionization units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed deionization units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the ion exchange column. Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, and because of the expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.\n\n===Demineralization===\nDemineralization is often a term used interchangeably with deionization. Demineralization is essentially removing all the minerals that can be found in natural water. This process is usually done when the water will be used for chemical processes and the minerals present may interfere with the other chemicals. All chemistic and beauty products have to be made with demineralized water for this reason. With the demineralization process, the water is \"softened\" replacing the undesired minerals with different salts. Demineralized water has a higher conductivity than deionized water.\n\n===Other processes===\nOther processes are also used to purify water, including [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtration]], microporous filtration, [[ultrafiltration]], ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodialysis. These are used in place of, or in addition to, the processes listed above. Processes rendering water potable but not necessarily closer to being pure H<sub>2</sub>O / [[hydroxide]] + [[hydronium]] ions include the use of dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]], [[ozone]], mixed-oxidants (electro-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl), and [[iodine]]; See discussion regarding potable water treatments under \"Health effects\" below.\n\n==Uses==\nPurified water is suitable for many applications, including autoclaves, hand-pieces, laboratory testing, laser cutting, and automotive use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pureklenz.com|title=Purified Water and Clinical Products|publisher=Pure Klenz|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> Purification removes contaminants that may interfere with processes, or leave residues on evaporation. Although water is generally considered to be a good electrical conductor&mdash;for example domestic electrical systems are considered particularly hazardous to people if they may be in contact with wet surfaces&mdash;''pure'' water is a poor conductor. The conductivity of sea-water is typically 5 S/m,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/water-conductivity.htm|title=Water conductivity|publisher=Lenntech|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> drinking water is typically in the range of 5-50 mS/m, while highly purified water can be as low as 5.5 \u03bcS/m (0.055 \u03bcS/cm), a [[ratio]] of about 1,000,000:1,000:1.\n\nPurified water is used in the pharmaceutical industry. Water of this grade is widely used as a raw material, ingredient, and solvent in the processing, formulation, and manufacture of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates, compendial articles, and analytical reagents. The microbiological content of the water is of importance and the water must be regularly monitored and tested to show that it remains within microbiological control.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T. |title=An approach for the reporting of microbiological results from water systems|journal=PDA J Pharm Sci Technol |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=231\u20137|date=July 2004|pmid=15368993}}</ref>\n\nPurified water is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain critical consistency of taste, clarity, and color. This guarantees the consumer reliably safe and satisfying drinking. In the process prior to filling and sealing, individual bottles are always rinsed with deionised water to remove any particles that could cause a change in taste.\n\nDeionised and distilled water are used in lead-acid batteries to prevent erosion of the cells, although deionised water is the better choice as more impurities are removed from the water in the creation process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fortisbattery.com/latest/2015/12/what-is-deionised-water-fortis-battery-care/|title=What is Deionised Water? {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|website=Your Forklift Battery System Sorted {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Laboratory use===\n[[Technical standard]]s on water quality have been established by a number of professional organizations, including the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS), [[ASTM International]], the U.S. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) which is now [[Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute|CLSI]], and the [[United States Pharmacopeia|U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)]]. The ASTM, NCCLS, and ISO 3696 or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] classify purified water into Grade 1\u20133 or Types I\u2013IV depending on the level of purity. These organizations have similar, although not identical, parameters for highly purified water.\n\nNote that the European Pharmacopeia uses Highly Purified Water (HPW) as a definition for water meeting the quality of Water For Injection, without however having undergone distillation. In the laboratory context, highly purified water is used to denominate various qualities of water having been \"highly\" purified.\n\nRegardless of which organization's water quality norm is used, even Type I water may require further purification depending on the specific laboratory application. For example, water that is being used for molecular-biology experiments needs to be [[DNase]] or [[RNase]]-free, which requires special additional treatment or functional testing. Water for microbiology experiments needs to be completely sterile, which is usually accomplished by autoclaving.

Note that values in this paper are given in S/cm, not S/m, which differs by a factor of 100.</ref> The highest grades of ultrapure water should not be stored in glass or plastic containers because these container materials leach (release) contaminants at very low concentrations. Storage vessels made of [[silica]] are used for less-demanding applications and vessels of ultrapure [[tin]] are used for the highest-purity applications. It is worth noting that, although electrical conductivity only indicates the presence of ions, the majority of common contaminants found naturally in water ionize to some degree. This ionization is a good measure of the efficacy of a filtration system, and more expensive systems incorporate conductivity-based alarms to indicate when filters should be refreshed or replaced. For comparison,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127024904/http://waterfacts.net/html/conductivity.html Conductivity]</ref> sea water has a conductivity of perhaps 5 S/m (53 mS/cm is quoted), while normal un-purified tap water may have conductivity of 5 mS/m (50 \u03bcS/cm) (to within an order of magnitude), which is still about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the output from a well-functioning demineralizing or distillation mechanism, so low levels of contamination or declining performance are easily detected.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Industrial uses===\nSome industrial processes, notably in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, need large amounts of very pure water. In these situations, feedwater is first processed into purified water and then further processed to produce [[ultrapure water]].\n\nAnother class of ultrapure water used for pharmaceutical industries is called Water-For-Inject (WFI), typically generated by multiple distillation or compressed-vaporation process of DI water or RO-DI water. It has tighter bacteria requirement as 10 CFU per 100 mL, instead of the 100 CFU per mL per USP.\n\n===Other uses===\nDistilled or deionized water is commonly used to top up the [[lead-acid batteries]] used in cars and trucks and for other applications. The presence of foreign ions commonly found in tap water will drastically shorten the lifespan of a lead-acid battery.\n\nDistilled or deionized water is preferable to tap water for use in automotive cooling systems.\n\nUsing deionised or distilled water in appliances that evaporate water, such as [[steam iron]]s and humidifiers, can reduce the build-up of mineral [[Limescale|scale]], which shortens appliance life. Some appliance manufacturers say that deionised water is no longer necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersearch.com/steam-irons/important-features|title=How to Buy a Steam Iron|publisher=Consumersearch.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinstitute.com/steam-iron-buying-guide.htm|title=Steam Iron Buying Guide|publisher=Homeinstitute.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\nPurified water is used in freshwater and marine [[aquarium]]s. Since it does not contain impurities such as copper and chlorine, it helps to keep fish free from diseases, and avoids the build-up of algae on aquarium plants due to its lack of phosphate and silicate. Deionized water should be re-mineralized before use in aquaria, since it lacks many macro- and micro-nutrients needed by plants and fish.\n\nWater (sometimes mixed with [[methanol]]) has been used to extend the performance of aircraft engines. In piston engines, it acts to delay the onset of [[engine knocking]]. In turbine engines, it allows more fuel flow for a given turbine temperature limit, and increases mass flow. As an example, it was used on early [[Boeing 707]] models.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch7.htm SP-4221 The Space Shuttle Decision] Retrieved 25 April 2008</ref> Advanced materials and engineering have since rendered such systems obsolete for new designs; however, spray-cooling of incoming air-charge is still used to a limited extent with off-road turbo-charged engines (road-race track cars).\n\nDeionized water is very often used as an ingredient in many cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. \"Aqua\" is the standard name for water in the [[International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients]] standard, which is mandatory on product labels in some countries.\n\nBecause of its high relative [[dielectric constant]] (~80), deionized water is also used (for short durations, when the resistive losses are acceptable) as a high voltage dielectric in many [[pulsed power]] applications, such as the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z Machine]].\n\nDistilled water can be used in PC watercooling systems and Laser Marking Systems. The lack of impurity in the water means that the system stays clean and prevents a buildup of bacteria and algae. Also, the low conductance reduces the risk of electrical damage in the event of a leak. However, deionized water has been known to cause cracks in brass and copper fittings.\n\nWhen used as a rinse after washing cars, windows, and similar applications, purified water dries without leaving spots caused by dissolved solutes.\n\nDeionized water is used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in sensitive environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and are less likely to damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.<ref>[http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306164147/http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm |date=March 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019233111/http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html |date=October 19, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123903/http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDistilled or purified water is used in [[humidor]]s to prevent [[cigar]]s from collecting [[bacteria]], [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], and contaminants, as well as to prevent residue from forming on the [[humidifier]] material.\n\nWindow cleaners using water-fed pole systems also use purified water because it enables the windows to dry by themselves leaving no stains or smears. The use of purified water from water-fed poles also prevents the need for using ladders and therefore ensure compliance with Work at Height Legislation in the UK.\n\n==Health effects of drinking purified water==\nDistillation removes all minerals from water, and the [[Membrane technology|membrane methods]] of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water, which has not been proven to be healthier than [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&nbsp;mg/L with 20\u201330&nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40\u201380&nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2\u20134&nbsp;[[mmol/L]]. At water hardness above 5&nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidences of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. For fluoride, the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5&nbsp;mg/L to avoid [[dental fluorosis]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Nutrients in Drinking Water|isbn=92-4-159398-9|publisher=World Health Organization|author=Kozisek F|chapter=Health risks from drinking demineralised water|year=2005|pages=148\u201363|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWater filtration devices are becoming increasingly common in households. Most of these devices do not distill water, though there continues to be an increase in consumer-oriented water distillers and [[reverse osmosis]] machines being sold and used. Municipal water supplies often add or have trace impurities at levels that are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as [[volatile organic compounds]], [[fluoride]], and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watersystems.walton.com/|title=Walton International - Home|publisher=Watersystems.walton.com|date=2010-11-05|accessdate=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904210320/http://watersystems.walton.com/|archivedate=2014-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|title=Our Technology - Purification Technology|publisher=Drinkmorewater.com|accessdate=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106170706/http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|archivedate=2012-01-06}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010207205656/http://www.homeenvironmentcenter.com/10stage.htm Technical Information - HEC-3000 10-Step Water Purification System]</ref> are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.\n\nThe drinking of purified water as a replacement of drinking water has been both advocated and discouraged for health reasons. Purified water lacks minerals and ions such as calcium that play key roles in biological functions, such as in nervous system [[homeostasis]], and are normally found in potable water. The lack of naturally occurring minerals in distilled water has raised some concerns. The Journal of General Internal Medicine<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Azoulay A, Garzon P, Eisenberg MJ |year=2001|title=Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters|journal=J Gen Intern Med|volume=16 |issue=3|pages=168\u201375|pmid=11318912|pmc=1495189|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2001.04189.x}}</ref> published a study on the mineral contents of different waters available in the US. The study found that \"drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]] and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals\". It encouraged people to \"check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs\". Since distilled water is devoid of minerals, supplemental mineral intake through diet is needed to maintain proper health.\n\nThe consumption of [[hard water|\"hard\" water]] (water with minerals) is associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects. As noted in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the consumption of hard drinking water is negatively correlated with atherosclerotic [[heart disease]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Voors|first=A.

[[Distilled water]] has been the most common form of purified water, but, in recent years, water is more frequently purified by other processes including [[capacitive deionization]], [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtering]], [[microfiltration]], [[ultrafiltration]], [[ultraviolet]] [[oxidation]], or [[electrodeionization]]. Combinations of a number of these processes have come into use to produce [[ultrapure water]] of such high purity that its trace contaminants are measured in parts per billion (ppb) or parts per trillion (ppt). \n\nPurified water has many uses, largely in the production of medications, in science and engineering laboratories and industries, and is produced in a range of purities. It is also used in the commercial [[beverage industry]] as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain product consistency. It can be produced on site for immediate use or purchased in containers. Purified water in colloquial English can also refer to water which has been treated (\"rendered potable\") to neutralize, but not necessarily remove contaminants considered harmful to humans or animals.\n\n==Parameters of water purity==\n\nPurified water is usually produced by the purification of [[drinking water]] or [[ground water]]. The impurities that may need to be removed are:\n*inorganic ions (typically monitored as electrical conductivity or resistivity or specific tests)\n*organic compounds (typically monitored as TOC or by specific tests)\n*bacteria (monitored by total viable counts or [[epifluorescence]])\n*endotoxins and nucleases (monitored by [[limulus amebocyte lysate|LAL]] or specific enzyme tests)\n*particulates (typically controlled by filtration)\n*gases (typically managed by degassing when required)\n\n==Purification methods==\n\n===Distillation===\nDistilled water is produced by a process of [[distillation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/facts-faits/faqs_bottle_water-eau_embouteillee-eng.php|title= Frequently asked questions about bottled water|accessdate=2009-05-24|publisher= Health Canada}}</ref> Distillation involves [[boiling]] the water and then condensing the [[vapor]] into a clean container, leaving solid contaminants behind. Distillation produces very pure water. A white or yellowish mineral scale is left in the distillation apparatus, which requires regular cleaning. Distilled water, like all purified water, must be stored in a sterilized container to guarantee the absence of bacteria. For many procedures, more economical alternatives are available, such as deionized water, and are used in place of distilled water.\n\n===Double distillation===\nDouble-distilled water (abbreviated \"ddH<sub>2</sub>O\", \"Bidest. water\" or \"DDW\") is prepared by slow boiling the uncontaminated condensed water vapor from a prior slow boiling. Historically, it was the de facto standard for highly purified laboratory water for [[biochemistry]] and used in laboratory trace analysis until combination purification methods of water purification became widespread.\n\n===Deionization===\n[[File:Cation anion ion exchange.jpg|thumb|Large cation/anion [[ion exchange]]rs used in demineralization of [[boiler feedwater]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mischissin|first1=Stephen G.|title=University of Rochester - Investigation of Steam Turbine Extraction Line Failures|url=http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015|location=Arlington, VA|pages=25\u201326|date=7 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923215229/http://www.districtenergy.org/assets/pdfs/2012-Campus-Arlington/Presentations/Wednesday-A/9A2MISCHISSINUniv-Rochester-2012-IDEA-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>]]\nDeionized water (''DI water'', ''DIW'' or ''de-ionized water''), often synonymous with ''demineralized water / DM water'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.image2output.com/deionised-water-25l.html|title=Deionised Water 25L|publisher=Image2output.com|date=2008-12-21|accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> is [[water]] that has had almost all of its mineral ions removed, such as [[cation]]s like [[sodium]], [[calcium]], [[iron]], and [[copper]], and [[anion]]s such as [[chloride]] and [[sulfate]]. Deionization is a chemical process that uses specially manufactured [[ion-exchange resin]]s, which exchange hydrogen and hydroxide ions for dissolved minerals, and then recombine to form water. Because most non-particulate water impurities are dissolved salts, deionization produces highly pure water that is generally similar to distilled water, with the advantage that the process is quicker and does not build up scale. \n\nHowever, deionization does not significantly remove uncharged organic molecules, viruses or bacteria, except by incidental trapping in the resin. Specially made strong base anion resins can remove [[Gram-negative]] bacteria. Deionization can be done continuously and inexpensively using [[electrodeionization]].\n\nThree types of deionization exist: co-current, counter-current, and mixed bed.\n\n====Co-current deionization====\nCo-current deionization refers to the original downflow process where both input water and regeneration chemicals enter at the top of an ion exchange column and exit at the bottom. Co-current operating costs are comparatively higher than counter-current deionization because of the additional usage of regenerants. Because regenerant chemicals are dilute when they encounter the bottom or finishing resins in an ion exchange column, the product quality is lower than a similarly sized counter-flow column.\n\nThe process is still used, and can be maximized with the fine tuning of the flow of regenerants within the ion exchange column.\n\n====Counter-current deionization====\nCounter-current deionization comes in two forms, each requiring engineered internals:\n#Upflow columns where input water enters from the bottom and regenerants enter from the top of the ion exchange column.\n#Upflow regeneration where water enters from the top and regenerants enter from the bottom.\n\nIn both cases, separate distribution headers (input water, input regenerant, exit water, and exit regenerant) must be tuned to: the input water quality and flow, the time of operation between regenerations, and the desired product water analysis.\n\nCounter-current deionization is the more attractive method of ion exchange. Chemicals (regenerants) flow in the opposite direction to the service flow. Less time for regeneration is required when compared to cocurrent columns. The quality of the finished product can be as low as .5 parts per million. The main advantage of counter-current deionization is the low operating cost, due to a low usage of regenerants during the regeneration process.\n\n====Mixed bed deionization====\nMixed bed deionization is a 50/50 mixture of cation and anion resin combined in a single ion exchange column. With proper pretreatment, product water purified from a single pass through a mixed bed ion exchange column is the purest that can be made. Most commonly, mixed bed demineralizers are used for final water polishing to clean the last few ions within water prior to use. Small mixed bed deionization units have no regeneration capability. Commercial mixed bed deionization units have elaborate internal water and regenerant distribution systems for regeneration. A control system operates pumps and valves for the regenerants of spent anions and cations resins within the ion exchange column. Each is regenerated separately, then remixed during the regeneration process. Because of the high quality of product water achieved, and because of the expense and difficulty of regeneration, mixed bed demineralizers are used only when the highest purity water is required.\n\n===Demineralization===\nDemineralization is often a term used interchangeably with deionization. Demineralization is essentially removing all the minerals that can be found in natural water. This process is usually done when the water will be used for chemical processes and the minerals present may interfere with the other chemicals. All chemistic and beauty products have to be made with demineralized water for this reason. With the demineralization process, the water is \"softened\" replacing the undesired minerals with different salts. Demineralized water has a higher conductivity than deionized water.\n\n===Other processes===\nOther processes are also used to purify water, including [[reverse osmosis]], [[carbon filtration]], microporous filtration, [[ultrafiltration]], ultraviolet oxidation, or electrodialysis. These are used in place of, or in addition to, the processes listed above. Processes rendering water potable but not necessarily closer to being pure H<sub>2</sub>O / [[hydroxide]] + [[hydronium]] ions include the use of dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]], [[ozone]], mixed-oxidants (electro-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl), and [[iodine]]; See discussion regarding potable water treatments under \"Health effects\" below.\n\n==Uses==\nPurified water is suitable for many applications, including autoclaves, hand-pieces, laboratory testing, laser cutting, and automotive use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pureklenz.com|title=Purified Water and Clinical Products|publisher=Pure Klenz|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> Purification removes contaminants that may interfere with processes, or leave residues on evaporation. Although water is generally considered to be a good electrical conductor&mdash;for example domestic electrical systems are considered particularly hazardous to people if they may be in contact with wet surfaces&mdash;''pure'' water is a poor conductor. The conductivity of sea-water is typically 5 S/m,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenntech.com/water-conductivity.htm|title=Water conductivity|publisher=Lenntech|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref> drinking water is typically in the range of 5-50 mS/m, while highly purified water can be as low as 5.5 \u03bcS/m (0.055 \u03bcS/cm), a [[ratio]] of about 1,000,000:1,000:1.\n\nPurified water is used in the pharmaceutical industry. Water of this grade is widely used as a raw material, ingredient, and solvent in the processing, formulation, and manufacture of pharmaceutical products, active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates, compendial articles, and analytical reagents. The microbiological content of the water is of importance and the water must be regularly monitored and tested to show that it remains within microbiological control.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Sandle, T. |title=An approach for the reporting of microbiological results from water systems|journal=PDA J Pharm Sci Technol |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=231\u20137|date=July 2004|pmid=15368993}}</ref>\n\nPurified water is also used in the commercial beverage industry as the primary ingredient of any given trademarked bottling formula, in order to maintain critical consistency of taste, clarity, and color. This guarantees the consumer reliably safe and satisfying drinking. In the process prior to filling and sealing, individual bottles are always rinsed with deionised water to remove any particles that could cause a change in taste.\n\nDeionised and distilled water are used in lead-acid batteries to prevent erosion of the cells, although deionised water is the better choice as more impurities are removed from the water in the creation process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fortisbattery.com/latest/2015/12/what-is-deionised-water-fortis-battery-care/|title=What is Deionised Water? {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|website=Your Forklift Battery System Sorted {{!}} Fortis Battery Care|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-15}}</ref>\n\n===Laboratory use===\n[[Technical standard]]s on water quality have been established by a number of professional organizations, including the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS), [[ASTM International]], the U.S. National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) which is now [[Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute|CLSI]], and the [[United States Pharmacopeia|U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP)]]. The ASTM, NCCLS, and ISO 3696 or the [[International Organization for Standardization]] classify purified water into Grade 1\u20133 or Types I\u2013IV depending on the level of purity. These organizations have similar, although not identical, parameters for highly purified water.\n\nNote that the European Pharmacopeia uses Highly Purified Water (HPW) as a definition for water meeting the quality of Water For Injection, without however having undergone distillation. In the laboratory context, highly purified water is used to denominate various qualities of water having been \"highly\" purified.\n\nRegardless of which organization's water quality norm is used, even Type I water may require further purification depending on the specific laboratory application. For example, water that is being used for molecular-biology experiments needs to be [[DNase]] or [[RNase]]-free, which requires special additional treatment or functional testing. Water for microbiology experiments needs to be completely sterile, which is usually accomplished by autoclaving. Water used to analyze trace metals may require the elimination of trace metals to a standard beyond that of the Type I water norm.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Maximum contaminant levels in purified water<ref name=\"Elga Lab Water Specifications\">{{cite web|url=http://www.elgalabwater.com/water-quality-en.html|title=The Importance of Water Quality is Critical}}</ref>\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Contaminant\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Parameter\n! colspan=\"3\" | ISO 3696 (1987)\n! colspan=\"4\" | ASTM (D1193-91)\n! colspan=\"3\" | NCCLS (1988)\n! colspan=\"2\" | Pharmacopoeia\n|-\n!

Note that values in this paper are given in S/cm, not S/m, which differs by a factor of 100.</ref> The highest grades of ultrapure water should not be stored in glass or plastic containers because these container materials leach (release) contaminants at very low concentrations. Storage vessels made of [[silica]] are used for less-demanding applications and vessels of ultrapure [[tin]] are used for the highest-purity applications. It is worth noting that, although electrical conductivity only indicates the presence of ions, the majority of common contaminants found naturally in water ionize to some degree. This ionization is a good measure of the efficacy of a filtration system, and more expensive systems incorporate conductivity-based alarms to indicate when filters should be refreshed or replaced. For comparison,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100127024904/http://waterfacts.net/html/conductivity.html Conductivity]</ref> sea water has a conductivity of perhaps 5 S/m (53 mS/cm is quoted), while normal un-purified tap water may have conductivity of 5 mS/m (50 \u03bcS/cm) (to within an order of magnitude), which is still about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the output from a well-functioning demineralizing or distillation mechanism, so low levels of contamination or declining performance are easily detected.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Industrial uses===\nSome industrial processes, notably in the semiconductor and pharmaceutical industries, need large amounts of very pure water. In these situations, feedwater is first processed into purified water and then further processed to produce [[ultrapure water]].\n\nAnother class of ultrapure water used for pharmaceutical industries is called Water-For-Inject (WFI), typically generated by multiple distillation or compressed-vaporation process of DI water or RO-DI water. It has tighter bacteria requirement as 10 CFU per 100 mL, instead of the 100 CFU per mL per USP.\n\n===Other uses===\nDistilled or deionized water is commonly used to top up the [[lead-acid batteries]] used in cars and trucks and for other applications. The presence of foreign ions commonly found in tap water will drastically shorten the lifespan of a lead-acid battery.\n\nDistilled or deionized water is preferable to tap water for use in automotive cooling systems.\n\nUsing deionised or distilled water in appliances that evaporate water, such as [[steam iron]]s and humidifiers, can reduce the build-up of mineral [[Limescale|scale]], which shortens appliance life. Some appliance manufacturers say that deionised water is no longer necessary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumersearch.com/steam-irons/important-features|title=How to Buy a Steam Iron|publisher=Consumersearch.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.homeinstitute.com/steam-iron-buying-guide.htm|title=Steam Iron Buying Guide|publisher=Homeinstitute.com|date= |accessdate=2011-12-11}}</ref>\n\nPurified water is used in freshwater and marine [[aquarium]]s. Since it does not contain impurities such as copper and chlorine, it helps to keep fish free from diseases, and avoids the build-up of algae on aquarium plants due to its lack of phosphate and silicate. Deionized water should be re-mineralized before use in aquaria, since it lacks many macro- and micro-nutrients needed by plants and fish.\n\nWater (sometimes mixed with [[methanol]]) has been used to extend the performance of aircraft engines. In piston engines, it acts to delay the onset of [[engine knocking]]. In turbine engines, it allows more fuel flow for a given turbine temperature limit, and increases mass flow. As an example, it was used on early [[Boeing 707]] models.<ref>[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/ch7.htm SP-4221 The Space Shuttle Decision] Retrieved 25 April 2008</ref> Advanced materials and engineering have since rendered such systems obsolete for new designs; however, spray-cooling of incoming air-charge is still used to a limited extent with off-road turbo-charged engines (road-race track cars).\n\nDeionized water is very often used as an ingredient in many cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. \"Aqua\" is the standard name for water in the [[International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients]] standard, which is mandatory on product labels in some countries.\n\nBecause of its high relative [[dielectric constant]] (~80), deionized water is also used (for short durations, when the resistive losses are acceptable) as a high voltage dielectric in many [[pulsed power]] applications, such as the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z Machine]].\n\nDistilled water can be used in PC watercooling systems and Laser Marking Systems. The lack of impurity in the water means that the system stays clean and prevents a buildup of bacteria and algae. Also, the low conductance reduces the risk of electrical damage in the event of a leak. However, deionized water has been known to cause cracks in brass and copper fittings.\n\nWhen used as a rinse after washing cars, windows, and similar applications, purified water dries without leaving spots caused by dissolved solutes.\n\nDeionized water is used in water-fog fire-extinguishing systems used in sensitive environments, such as where high-voltage electrical and sensitive electronic equipment is used. The 'sprinkler' nozzles use much finer spray jets than other systems, and operate at up 35 MPa (350 bar; 5,000 psi) of pressure. The extremely fine mist produced takes the heat out of a fire rapidly, and the fine droplets of water are nonconducting (when deionized) and are less likely to damage sensitive equipment. Deionized water, however, is inherently acidic and contaminants (such as copper, dust, stainless and carbon steel, and many other common materials) rapidly supply ions, thus re-ionizing the water. It is not generally considered acceptable to spray water on electrical circuits that are powered, and it is generally considered undesirable to use water in electrical contexts.<ref>[http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306164147/http://www.tmasc.com/cleaning_chemicals.htm |date=March 6, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019233111/http://www.hghouston.com/Technical%20FAQs/TFAQ021.html |date=October 19, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208123903/http://www.safetymgmt.com/AIGRiskTools/Knowledge_Center/General_Industry/ELECTRICAL_SAFETY.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nDistilled or purified water is used in [[humidor]]s to prevent [[cigar]]s from collecting [[bacteria]], [[mold]], and contaminants, as well as to prevent residue from forming on the [[humidifier]] material.\n\nWindow cleaners using water-fed pole systems also use purified water because it enables the windows to dry by themselves leaving no stains or smears. The use of purified water from water-fed poles also prevents the need for using ladders and therefore ensure compliance with Work at Height Legislation in the UK.\n\n==Health effects of drinking purified water==\nDistillation removes all minerals from water, and the [[Membrane technology|membrane methods]] of reverse osmosis and nanofiltration remove most, or virtually all, minerals. This results in demineralized water, which has not been proven to be healthier than [[drinking water]]. The World Health Organization investigated the health effects of demineralized water in 1980, and its experiments in humans found that demineralized water increased [[diuresis]] and the elimination of [[electrolyte]]s, with decreased serum potassium concentration. Magnesium, calcium and other nutrients in water can help to protect against nutritional deficiency. Recommendations for magnesium have been put at a minimum of 10&nbsp;mg/L with 20\u201330&nbsp;mg/L optimum; for calcium a 20&nbsp;mg/L minimum and a 40\u201380&nbsp;mg/L optimum, and a total water hardness (adding magnesium and calcium) of 2\u20134&nbsp;[[mmol/L]]. At water hardness above 5&nbsp;mmol/L, higher incidences of gallstones, kidney stones, urinary stones, arthrosis, and arthropathies have been observed. For fluoride, the concentration recommended for dental health is 0.5\u20131.0&nbsp;mg/L, with a maximum guideline value of 1.5&nbsp;mg/L to avoid [[dental fluorosis]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Nutrients in Drinking Water|isbn=92-4-159398-9|publisher=World Health Organization|author=Kozisek F|chapter=Health risks from drinking demineralised water|year=2005|pages=148\u201363|chapterurl=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/nutrientschap12.pdf}}</ref>\n\nWater filtration devices are becoming increasingly common in households. Most of these devices do not distill water, though there continues to be an increase in consumer-oriented water distillers and [[reverse osmosis]] machines being sold and used. Municipal water supplies often add or have trace impurities at levels that are regulated to be safe for consumption. Much of these additional impurities, such as [[volatile organic compounds]], [[fluoride]], and an estimated 75,000+ other chemical compounds<ref>{{cite web|url=http://watersystems.walton.com/|title=Walton International - Home|publisher=Watersystems.walton.com|date=2010-11-05|accessdate=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904210320/http://watersystems.walton.com/|archivedate=2014-09-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|title=Our Technology - Purification Technology|publisher=Drinkmorewater.com|accessdate=2011-12-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106170706/http://www.drinkmorewater.com/technology/technology/|archivedate=2012-01-06}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010207205656/http://www.homeenvironmentcenter.com/10stage.htm Technical Information - HEC-3000 10-Step Water Purification System]</ref> are not removed through conventional filtration; however, distillation and reverse osmosis eliminate nearly all of these impurities.\n\nThe drinking of purified water as a replacement of drinking water has been both advocated and discouraged for health reasons. Purified water lacks minerals and ions such as calcium that play key roles in biological functions, such as in nervous system [[homeostasis]], and are normally found in potable water. The lack of naturally occurring minerals in distilled water has raised some concerns. The Journal of General Internal Medicine<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Azoulay A, Garzon P, Eisenberg MJ |year=2001|title=Comparison of the mineral content of tap water and bottled waters|journal=J Gen Intern Med|volume=16 |issue=3|pages=168\u201375|pmid=11318912|pmc=1495189|doi=10.1111/j.1525-1497.2001.04189.x}}</ref> published a study on the mineral contents of different waters available in the US. The study found that \"drinking water sources available to North Americans may contain high levels of [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]] and may provide clinically important portions of the recommended dietary intake of these minerals\". It encouraged people to \"check the mineral content of their drinking water, whether tap or bottled, and choose water most appropriate for their needs\". Since distilled water is devoid of minerals, supplemental mineral intake through diet is needed to maintain proper health.\n\nThe consumption of [[hard water|\"hard\" water]] (water with minerals) is associated with beneficial cardiovascular effects. As noted in the American Journal of Epidemiology, the consumption of hard drinking water is negatively correlated with atherosclerotic [[heart disease]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Voors|first=A.

However, many fungi reproduce only asexually, and cannot easily be classified based on sexual characteristics; some produce both asexual and sexual states. These problematic species are often members of the [[Ascomycota]], but a few of them belong to the [[Basidiomycota]]. Even among fungi that reproduce both sexually and asexually, often only one method of reproduction can be observed at a specific point in time or under specific conditions. Additionally, fungi typically grow in mixed colonies and [[spore|sporulate]] amongst each other.

Others retain the term \"deuteromycetes,\" but give it a lowercase \"d\" and no taxonomic rank.<ref name=\"guarro\">{{citation | pmc = 100249 | pmid = 10398676 |date=Jul 1999 |author1=Guarro, J |author2=Gen\u00e9j |author3=Stchigel, Am | title = Developments in fungal taxonomy | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 454\u2013500 | issn = 0893-8512 | journal = Clinical Microbiology Reviews | doi = 10.1128/CMR.12.3.454 }}</ref>\n\nHistorically, Article 59 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permitted mycologists to give asexually reproducing fungi (anamorphs) separate names from their sexual states (teleomorphs);<ref>[http://ibot.sav.sk/icbn/frameset/0064Ch6NoFa59.htm Article 59] of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]</ref> but this practice was discontinued as of 1 January 2013.<ref name=\"Hawksworth 2011\"/>\n\nThe dual naming system can be confusing for novices.

In the home, point-of-use humidifiers are commonly used to humidify a single room, while whole-house or furnace humidifiers, which connect to a home's [[HVAC]] system, provide humidity to the entire house. Medical [[ventilators]] often include humidifiers for increased patient comfort. Large humidifiers are used in commercial, institutional, or industrial contexts, often as part of a larger HVAC system.\n\n==Overview==\nLow humidity may occur in hot, dry [[desert climate]]s, or indoors in artificially heated spaces. In winter, especially when cold outside air is heated indoors, the humidity may drop to as low as 10\u201320%. This low humidity can cause adverse health effects, by drying out [[mucous membrane]]s such as the lining of the nose and throat, and can cause [[respiratory distress]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last2=Juvonen|first2=R.|last3=Jokelainen|first3=J.|last4=Harju|first4=T.

The water is usually supplied by manually filling the unit on a periodic basis.\n\n=== Evaporative humidifiers ===\nThe most common portable humidifier, an \"evaporative\", \"cool moisture\", or \"wick humidifier\", consists of just a few basic parts: a reservoir, wick and fan.\n\nThe [[wikt:wick|wick]] is made of a porous material that absorbs water from the reservoir and provides a larger [[surface area]] for it to evaporate from. The fan is adjacent to the wick and blows air onto the wick to aid in the evaporation of the water.  Evaporation from the wick is dependent on [[relative humidity]]. A room with low humidity will have a higher evaporation rate compared to a room with high humidity. Therefore, this type of humidifier is partially self-regulating; as the humidity of the room increases, the water vapor output naturally decreases.\n\nThese wicks become [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]y if they are not dried out completely between fillings, and become saturated with mineral deposits over time.  They regularly need rinsing or replacement; if this does not happen, air cannot pass through them, and humidifier stops humidifying the area it is in and the water in the tank remains at the same level.\n\n=== Natural humidifiers ===\n[[File:Japanese Humidifier steam type.JPG|thumb|Vaporizer (steam humidifier) (warm mist humidifier)]]\n[[File:Luftbefeuchter NW-5.jpg|thumb|Impeller humidifier NW-5 (Poland, 1977)]]\nOne type of evaporative humidifier makes use of just a reservoir and wick. Sometimes called a \"natural humidifier\", these are usually non-commercial devices that can be assembled at little or no cost. One version of a natural humidifier uses a stainless steel bowl, partially filled with water, covered by a towel. A waterproof weight is used to sink the towel in the center of the bowl. There is no need for a fan, because the water spreads through the towel by [[capillary action]] and the towel surface area is large enough to provide for rapid evaporation. The stainless steel bowl is much easier to clean than typical humidifier water tanks. This, in combination with daily or every other day replacement of the towel and periodic laundering, can control the problem of mold and bacteria.\n\n[[Houseplant]]s may also be used as natural humidifiers, since they evaporate water into the air through [[transpiration]]. Care must still be taken to prevent bacteria or mold in the soil from growing to excessive levels, or from dispersing into the air.\n\n=== Vaporizers ===\nA vaporizer (steam humidifier, warm mist humidifier) heats or boils water, releasing steam and moisture into the air. A medicated inhalant can also be added to the steam vapor to help reduce coughs.  Vaporizers may be healthier than cool mist types of humidifiers because steam is less likely to convey mineral impurities or microorganisms from the standing water in the reservoir.<ref name=\"epa\">{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/indoor-air-facts-no-8-use-and-care-home-humidifiers |title=Indoor Air Facts No. 8: Use and Care of Home Humidifiers |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|year=1991}}</ref> However, boiling water requires significantly more energy than other techniques.

The water supply must be kept scrupulously clean, or there is a risk of spreading bacteria or mold into the air.\nThese types of humidifiers are usually noisier than others.\n\n=== Ultrasonic humidifiers ===\n\n[[File:Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier.jpg|thumb|Ultrasonic Cool Mist Humidifier]]\nAn ultrasonic humidifier uses a ceramic diaphragm vibrating at an [[ultrasound|ultrasonic frequency]] to create water droplets that silently exit the humidifier in the form of cool fog. Usually the mist gets forced out by a tiny fan, while some ultra mini models have no fans. The models without fans are meant mainly for personal use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.Besthumidifier2020.com|title=10 Best Humidifiers|last=Robert|first=Watson|date=|website=All about Humidifiers|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Ultrasonic humidifiers use a [[piezoelectric transducer]] to create a high frequency mechanical oscillation in a film of water. This forms an extremely fine mist of droplets about one micron in diameter, that is quickly evaporated into the air flow.\n\nUnlike the humidifiers that boil water, these water droplets will contain any impurities that are in the reservoir, including minerals from [[hard water]] (which then forms a difficult-to-remove sticky white dust on nearby objects and furniture). Any pathogens growing in the stagnant tank will also be dispersed in the air. Ultrasonic humidifiers should be cleaned regularly to prevent bacterial contamination from being spread throughout the air.\n\nThe amount of minerals and other materials can be greatly reduced by using [[distilled water]]. Special disposable demineralization cartridges may also reduce the amount of airborne material, but the EPA warns, \"the ability of these devices to remove minerals may vary widely.\"<ref name=\"epa\" /> The mineral dust may have negative health effects{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}.  Wick humidifiers trap the mineral deposits in the wick; vaporizer types tend to collect minerals on or around the [[heating element]] and require regular cleaning with [[vinegar]] or [[citric acid]] to control buildup.\n\n== Fixed-installation humidifiers ==\nFor buildings with a [[forced-air]] [[furnace]], a humidifier may be installed into the furnace. They can also protect wooden objects, antiques and other furnishings which may be sensitive to damage from overly dry air. In colder months, they may provide modest energy savings, since as humidity increases, occupants may feel warm at a lower temperature.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nBypass humidifiers are connected between the heated and cold air return ducts, using the pressure difference between these ducts to cause some heated air to make a bypass through the humidifier and return to the furnace.\n\nAny humidifiers should usually be disabled during the summer months if air conditioning is used; air conditioners partially function to reducing indoor humidity, and having a humidifier continue to operate will waste significant amounts of energy.\n\n=== Drums ===\nDrum style (bypass) uses a pipe to bring water directly to a reservoir (a pan) attached to the furnace. The water level in the pan is controlled by a [[float valve]], similar to a small [[toilet]] tank float. The wick is typically a foam pad mounted on a drum and attached to a small motor; hot air enters the drum at one end and is forced to leave through the sides of the drum. When the [[hygrostat]] calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Low cost\n:* Inexpensive maintenance (drum-style pads are cheap and readily available){{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Requirement for frequent (approximately monthly) inspections of cleanliness and pad condition\n:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high [[velocity]] air stream)\n:* [[Mold (fungus)|Mold]] growth in the pan full of water (this problem is exacerbated by the large quantity of air, inevitably carrying mold spores, passing through the humidifier whether in use or not).\n\nFor the latter reason especially, drum-style humidifiers should always be turned off at the water supply during summer (air conditioning) months, and should always be used with high quality furnace [[air filter]]s ([[MERV]] ratings as high as possible to ensure small numbers of mold spores reaching the humidifier pan) when the water supply is turned on.\n\n=== Disc wheels ===\nA disc wheel style (bypass) is very similar in design to the drum style humidifiers; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming with a number of plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the disc wheel does not need regular replacement.\n\n:Advantages include:\n:* Very low maintenance (basin of humidifier should be cleaned out periodically, unless an automatic flushing device is installed)\n:* No regular replacement of parts necessary\n:* Higher output due to large evaporative surface area\n:* Can be installed in hard water situations\n:* Maintains efficiency throughout lifespans\n\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Higher price\n:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream)\n\n=== Bypass flow-through ===\nBypass flow-through style (bypass \u2013 also known as \"biscuit style\" or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve at the top of the humidifier. Air passes through an aluminum \"biscuit\" (often called a pad; the term \"biscuit\" emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse [[steel wool]]. The \"biscuit\" has a coating of a [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the \"biscuit\". Hot air is passed through the \"biscuit\", causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Reduced maintenance (new \"biscuit\" is needed only when clogged with dust or mineral deposits, typically once per year)\n:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier\n:* No incidental humidification caused by a constantly replenished pan of water in a high velocity air stream\n:* Reduced requirement for expensive air filters\n:* Uses little electricity\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* A somewhat higher purchase price\n:* Manufacturer and model-specific replacement biscuits (versus the relatively generic drum-style pads) may be more expensive and difficult to find\n:* For most models, a portion of the water supplied to the unit is not evaporated.  This can generate a considerable amount of waste water containing residual minerals, which does require connection to a drain. There is a limited selection of drain-less models that recirculate water, but mineral buildup must then be removed manually on a periodic basis.\n\n=== Spray mist ===\nSpray mist type uses a pipe, usually a small plastic one, to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve (atomizer-this forces the water through a tiny orifice causing it to break up into tiny particles) in the humidifier. Water mist is sprayed directly into the supply air, and the mist is carried into the premises by the air flow.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Simpler than bypass types to install, requiring a single cut hole for installation, no additional ducting.\n:* Uses little electricity.\n:* Small, compact unit which fits where other types cannot. (Approximately {{convert|6|in|cm}} square.)\n:* Because it does not require bypass ducting it does not undermine the pressure separation (and therefore, blower efficiency) of the return and supply ducts.\n:* Does not require use of moisture pads (on-going expense).\n:* Highly efficient usage of water.  Does not generate waste water, and does not require separate connection to a drain.\n:* Requires little maintenance.  Periodic cleaning of nozzle may be required in hard water environments.\n:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier.\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Spray nozzle can become clogged in hard water situations, necessitating the use of water filter, periodic cleaning of nozzle, or nozzle replacement.\n:* Disperses any minerals in the water into the airstream.\n\n=== Additional types ===\n{{expand section|date=July 2013}}\nAdditional types include non-bypass flow-through (fan augmented), steam, impeller or centrifugal atomizer, and under duct designs.\n\n== Problems ==\nThe [[USEPA]] provides detailed information about health risks as well as recommended maintenance procedures.<ref name=\"epa\" />  If the tap water contains a lot of minerals (also known as \"hard water\") then the ultrasonic or impeller humidifiers will produce a \"white DUST\" (calcium is the most common mineral in tap water), which usually spreads over furniture, and is attracted to [[static electricity]] generating devices such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. The white dust can be prevented by using distilled water or a demineralization cartridge in ultrasonic humidifiers.\n\nIn addition, a stuck or malfunctioning water supply valve can deliver large amounts of water, causing extensive water damage if undetected for any period of time.  A [[water alarm]], possibly with an automatic water shutoff, can help prevent this malfunction from causing major problems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Humidifiers}}\n* [[Air ionizer]]\n* [[Dehumidifier]]\n* [[Evaporative cooler]]\n* [[Hygrometer]], for measuring humidity\n* [[Ultrasonic nozzle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pdfs/humidifier_factsheet.pdf EPA.gov] Indoor Air Facts No. 8 Use and Care of Home Humidifiers\n\n{{HVAC}}\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=July 2013}}\n[[File:Augsburg Schaezlerpalais Mattes 2013-05-05 (23).JPG|thumb|Humidifier in an art museum in Augsburg, Germany]]\nA '''humidifier''' is a device, primarily an [[electrical appliance]], that increases [[humidity]] (moisture) in a single room or an entire building.

When the [[hygrostat]] calls for humidity, the motor is turned on causing the drum to rotate slowly through the pan of water and preventing the foam pad from drying out.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Low cost\n:* Inexpensive maintenance (drum-style pads are cheap and readily available){{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Requirement for frequent (approximately monthly) inspections of cleanliness and pad condition\n:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high [[velocity]] air stream)\n:* [[Mold]] growth in the pan full of water (this problem is exacerbated by the large quantity of air, inevitably carrying mold spores, passing through the humidifier whether in use or not).\n\nFor the latter reason especially, drum-style humidifiers should always be turned off at the water supply during summer (air conditioning) months, and should always be used with high quality furnace [[air filter]]s ([[MERV]] ratings as high as possible to ensure small numbers of mold spores reaching the humidifier pan) when the water supply is turned on.\n\n=== Disc wheels ===\nA disc wheel style (bypass) is very similar in design to the drum style humidifiers; this type of furnace humidifier replaces the foam drumming with a number of plastic discs with small grooves on both sides. This allows for a very large evaporative surface area, without requiring a great deal of space. Unlike the drum style humidifiers, the disc wheel does not need regular replacement.\n\n:Advantages include:\n:* Very low maintenance (basin of humidifier should be cleaned out periodically, unless an automatic flushing device is installed)\n:* No regular replacement of parts necessary\n:* Higher output due to large evaporative surface area\n:* Can be installed in hard water situations\n:* Maintains efficiency throughout lifespans\n\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Higher price\n:* Water evaporation even when humidification is not required (due to the pan of water which remains exposed to a high velocity air stream)\n\n=== Bypass flow-through ===\nBypass flow-through style (bypass \u2013 also known as \"biscuit style\" or many other, similar variant names) uses a pipe to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve at the top of the humidifier. Air passes through an aluminum \"biscuit\" (often called a pad; the term \"biscuit\" emphasizes the solid rather than foamy form) which is similar to a piece of extremely coarse [[steel wool]]. The \"biscuit\" has a coating of a [[Gloss (material appearance)|matte]] ceramic, resulting in an extremely large surface area within a small space. When the hygrostat calls for humidity, the valve is opened and causes a spray of water onto the \"biscuit\". Hot air is passed through the \"biscuit\", causing the water to evaporate from the pad and be carried into the building.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Reduced maintenance (new \"biscuit\" is needed only when clogged with dust or mineral deposits, typically once per year)\n:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier\n:* No incidental humidification caused by a constantly replenished pan of water in a high velocity air stream\n:* Reduced requirement for expensive air filters\n:* Uses little electricity\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* A somewhat higher purchase price\n:* Manufacturer and model-specific replacement biscuits (versus the relatively generic drum-style pads) may be more expensive and difficult to find\n:* For most models, a portion of the water supplied to the unit is not evaporated.  This can generate a considerable amount of waste water containing residual minerals, which does require connection to a drain. There is a limited selection of drain-less models that recirculate water, but mineral buildup must then be removed manually on a periodic basis.\n\n=== Spray mist ===\nSpray mist type uses a pipe, usually a small plastic one, to bring water directly to an electrically controlled valve (atomizer-this forces the water through a tiny orifice causing it to break up into tiny particles) in the humidifier. Water mist is sprayed directly into the supply air, and the mist is carried into the premises by the air flow.\n:Advantages include:\n:* Simpler than bypass types to install, requiring a single cut hole for installation, no additional ducting.\n:* Uses little electricity.\n:* Small, compact unit which fits where other types cannot. (Approximately {{convert|6|in|cm}} square.)\n:* Because it does not require bypass ducting it does not undermine the pressure separation (and therefore, blower efficiency) of the return and supply ducts.\n:* Does not require use of moisture pads (on-going expense).\n:* Highly efficient usage of water.  Does not generate waste water, and does not require separate connection to a drain.\n:* Requires little maintenance.  Periodic cleaning of nozzle may be required in hard water environments.\n:* Lack of a pan of potentially stagnant water to serve as a breeding ground for mold as with a drum-style humidifier.\n:Disadvantages include:\n:* Spray nozzle can become clogged in hard water situations, necessitating the use of water filter, periodic cleaning of nozzle, or nozzle replacement.\n:* Disperses any minerals in the water into the airstream.\n\n=== Additional types ===\n{{expand section|date=July 2013}}\nAdditional types include non-bypass flow-through (fan augmented), steam, impeller or centrifugal atomizer, and under duct designs.\n\n== Problems ==\nThe [[USEPA]] provides detailed information about health risks as well as recommended maintenance procedures.<ref name=\"epa\" />  If the tap water contains a lot of minerals (also known as \"hard water\") then the ultrasonic or impeller humidifiers will produce a \"white DUST\" (calcium is the most common mineral in tap water), which usually spreads over furniture, and is attracted to [[static electricity]] generating devices such as [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitors. The white dust can be prevented by using distilled water or a demineralization cartridge in ultrasonic humidifiers.\n\nIn addition, a stuck or malfunctioning water supply valve can deliver large amounts of water, causing extensive water damage if undetected for any period of time.  A [[water alarm]], possibly with an automatic water shutoff, can help prevent this malfunction from causing major problems.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Humidifiers}}\n* [[Air ionizer]]\n* [[Dehumidifier]]\n* [[Evaporative cooler]]\n* [[Hygrometer]], for measuring humidity\n* [[Ultrasonic nozzle]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pdfs/humidifier_factsheet.pdf EPA.gov] Indoor Air Facts No. 8 Use and Care of Home Humidifiers\n\n{{HVAC}}\n{{Home appliances}}\n\n[[Category:Home appliances]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus); link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidifier"}

Sorbic acid and sorbates therefore have a very low mammalian toxicity \u2013 hence their extensive use in food and beverage preservation. Sorbic acid occurs naturally in wild berries, is relatively unstable and  rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is considered environmentally friendly. In the body it is generally metabolized by the same oxidation pathway as the 5-carbon saturated fatty acid caproic acid. There is a general consensus that sorbic acid and sorbates are intrinsically devoid of carcinogenic activity. However they have been shown to have the potential to undergo conversion to potential mutagens either through oxidation, or through a chemical reaction with nitrites at pH of 2-4.2 \u2013 the latter conditions being ones that mimic the gastric environment. In living yeast cells sorbic acid enhances oxygen free radical formation by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to damage to the mitochondrial DNA.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sorbitol]]\n* [[Polysorbate]]\n* [[Acids in wine]]\n* [[Parasorbic acid]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/40abcj14.htm Sorbic inchem.org]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Enoic acids]]\n[[Category:Preservatives]]\n[[Category:E-number additives]]\n[[Category:Conjugated dienes]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Ascorbic acid}}\n{{chembox\n| Verifiedfields = changed\n| Watchedfields = changed\n| verifiedrevid = 439112841\n| Name = Sorbic acid\n| ImageFile = Sorbins\u00e4ure.svg\n| ImageSize = 200px\n| ImageName = Sorbic acid\n| ImageFile2 = Sorbic-acid-3D-balls-B.png\n| ImageSize2 = 200px\n| ImageName2 = Sorbic acid (ball-and-stick model)\n| IUPACName = (2''E'',4''E'')-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid\n| Section1 = {{Chembox Identifiers\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = 558605\n| PubChem = 643460\n| UNII_Ref = {{fdacite|correct|FDA}}\n| UNII = X045WJ989B\n| InChI = 1/C6H8O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6(7)8/h2-5H,1H3,(H,7,8)/b3-2+,5-4+\n| InChIKey = WSWCOQWTEOXDQX-MQQKCMAXBN\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/C6H8O2/c1-2-3-4-5-6(7)8/h2-5H,1H3,(H,7,8)/b3-2+,5-4+\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = WSWCOQWTEOXDQX-MQQKCMAXSA-N\n| CASNo_Ref = {{cascite|correct|CAS}}\n| CASNo = 110-44-1\n| ChEMBL_Ref = {{ebicite|changed|EBI}}\n| ChEMBL = 250212\n| ChEBI_Ref = {{ebicite|changed|EBI}}\n| ChEBI = 38358\n| SMILES = O=C(O)\\C=C\\C=C\\C\n}}\n| Section2 = {{Chembox Properties\n| C=6|H=8|O=2\n| MeltingPtC = 135\n| BoilingPtC = 228\n| pKa = 4.76 at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| Solubility = 1.6 g/L at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| Density = 1.204 g/cm<sup>3</sup>\n  }}\n|Section3= {{Chembox Hazards\n| NFPA-H = 2\n| NFPA-F = 1\n| NFPA-R = 0\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Sorbic acid''', or '''2,4-hexadienoic acid''', is a natural [[organic compound]] used as a food [[preservative]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Piper JD|first1=Piper PW|title=Benzoate and Sorbate Salts: A Systematic Review of the Potential Hazards of These Invaluable Preservatives and the Expanding Spectrum of Clinical Uses for Sodium Benzoate.|journal=Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety|date=2017|volume=16|issue=5|pages=868\u2013880|doi=10.1111/1541-4337.12284|doi-access=free}}\n</ref> It has the chemical formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH)<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H.

The pentadiene manifests as a typical odor of [[kerosene]] or [[petroleum]].<!-- The Soft Drinks Companion - A technical handbook for the beverage industry, chapter 10 --> Other detoxification reactions include reduction to 4-[[hexenol]] and 4-hexenoic acid.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kinderlerer JL, Hatton PV |title=Fungal metabolites of sorbic acid |journal=Food Addit Contam |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=657\u201369 |year=1990 |pmid=2253810 |doi=10.1080/02652039009373931}}</ref>\n\nSorbic acid can also be used as an [[Polymer additive|additive]] for [[cold rubber]], and as an intermediate in the manufacture of some [[plasticizers]] and [[lubricants]].<ref name=\"Patty's Toxicology\">{{cite book|vauthors=Bingham E, Cohrssen B|title=Patty's Toxicology|year=2012|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=547|url=http://app.knovel.com/hotlink/toc/id:kpPTEV0011/pattys-toxicology-6th}}</ref>\n\n==Safety==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2018}}\nThe {{LD50}} value of sorbic acid is estimated to be between 7.4 and 10 g/kg. Sorbic acid and sorbates therefore have a very low mammalian toxicity \u2013 hence their extensive use in food and beverage preservation. Sorbic acid occurs naturally in wild berries, is relatively unstable and  rapidly degraded in soil, hence it is considered environmentally friendly. In the body it is generally metabolized by the same oxidation pathway as the 5-carbon saturated fatty acid caproic acid. There is a general consensus that sorbic acid and sorbates are intrinsically devoid of carcinogenic activity. However they have been shown to have the potential to undergo conversion to potential mutagens either through oxidation, or through a chemical reaction with nitrites at pH of 2-4.2 \u2013 the latter conditions being ones that mimic the gastric environment. In living yeast cells sorbic acid enhances oxygen free radical formation by the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to damage to the mitochondrial DNA.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sorbitol]]\n* [[Polysorbate]]\n* [[Acids in wine]]\n* [[Parasorbic acid]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.inchem.org/documents/jecfa/jecmono/40abcj14.htm Sorbic inchem.org]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Enoic acids]]\n[[Category:Preservatives]]\n[[Category:E-number additives]]\n[[Category:Conjugated dienes]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbic_acid"}

The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river.
