In 1831, the library acquired its first painting, joining a developing book collection. According to the Minutes of the Apprentices' Library from January 31, 1835: \"[[Walter Whitman]] acting librarian presented a Report this evening, in which it is stated that there are now about 1200 volumes in the library in a proper \nstate for being drawn out; and that the number of Readers is 172.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Minutes of the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association, 1:84.|journal=Brooklyn Museum Archives}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1840s, the public demand for educational programs resulted in the reorganization of the library with the adoption by the association of a revised charter under the name of the Brooklyn Institute and the library was housed in a new building.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Evening classes were offered, the first exhibition of paintings was held and library acquisition funds became available. The library accession records document early institutional interest in the world at large. An early acquisition is currently in the museum's long term installation, ''Connecting Cultures''.\n\nOver the next forty years, the Brooklyn Institute grew and was reorganized into the Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences, which eventually became the parent organization of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]], the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]. During the late 1880s, plans were established to revitalize the institute in order \u2033to make the property of the Institute the nucleus of a broad and comprehensive institution for the advancement of science and art...\u2033<ref>{{cite book|title=Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.

Hutchinson (1900\u201335) and [[Stewart Culin]], the museum's first Curator of Ethnology (1903\u201329), laid the foundation of the research and object collections.

During his travels to Egypt, Wilbour visited temples and tombs and copied inscriptions found on monuments in the field. He built an important resource on Ancient Egypt by collecting books from fellow Egyptologists abroad, as well as from dealers and scholarly publishers, developing his personal library as a resource to educate himself. Wilbour's personal library was enriched with scholarly annotations containing corrections and additions to the published text which are of value today as they offer unique information. In 1916, Wilbour's children offered his antiquities and library collection to the Brooklyn Museum as a memorial to their father.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Compiled by|last2=Cook, Jr.|first2=William Burt|title=Catalogue of the Egyptological and Other Books From the Collection of the Late Edwin Wilbour|date=1924|publisher=Brooklyn Museum|location=Brooklyn, New York}}</ref> After this initial donation, Wilbour's heirs continued to donate objects to the museum.

In 1831, the library acquired its first painting, joining a developing book collection. According to the Minutes of the Apprentices' Library from January 31, 1835: \"[[Walter Whitman]] acting librarian presented a Report this evening, in which it is stated that there are now about 1200 volumes in the library in a proper \nstate for being drawn out; and that the number of Readers is 172.\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=Minutes of the Brooklyn Apprentices' Library Association, 1:84.|journal=Brooklyn Museum Archives}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1840s, the public demand for educational programs resulted in the reorganization of the library with the adoption by the association of a revised charter under the name of the Brooklyn Institute and the library was housed in a new building.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Deirdre|title=The Evolution of a Library: The Brooklyn Museum of Art Libraries and Archives|journal=Art Documentation|date=1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=10\u201313}}</ref> Evening classes were offered, the first exhibition of paintings was held and library acquisition funds became available. The library accession records document early institutional interest in the world at large. An early acquisition is currently in the museum's long term installation, ''Connecting Cultures''.\n\nOver the next forty years, the Brooklyn Institute grew and was reorganized into the Brooklyn Institute of Arts & Sciences, which eventually became the parent organization of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]], the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM) and the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]]. During the late 1880s, plans were established to revitalize the institute in order \u2033to make the property of the Institute the nucleus of a broad and comprehensive institution for the advancement of science and art...\u2033<ref>{{cite book|title=Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences.

For many readers, {{math|cis(''x''<sup>2</sup>)}} is the clearest, easiest to read of the three.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe {{math|cis}} notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another. The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas {{math|cis(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}} notations emphasize the parts. This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a [[mnemonic]] (for {{math|cos + ''i'' sin}}).\n\nThe {{math|cis}} notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding does not yet permit the notation {{math|''e<sup>ix</sup>''}}.  As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math for which they are not yet prepared: the usual proof that {{math|cis(''x'') {{=}} ''e<sup>ix</sup>''}} requires [[calculus]], which the student may not have studied before encountering the expression {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}}.\n\nIn 1942, inspired by the {{math|cis}} notation, [[Ralph V. L. Hartley]] introduced the {{math|[[cas (mathematics)|cas]]}} (for ''cosine-and-sine'') function for the real-valued [[Hartley kernel]], a meanwhile established shortcut in conjunction with [[Hartley transform]]s:<ref name=\"Hartley_1942\"/><ref name=\"Bracewell_1999\"/>\n\n{{math|cas(''x'') {{=}} cos(''x'') + sin(''x'')}}.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[De Moivre's formula]]\n* [[Euler's formula]]\n* [[Complex number]]\n* [[Ptolemy's theorem]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n* [[Versor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Byrnes_2004\">{{cite book |title=Computational Noncommutative Algebra and Applications |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Byrnes |chapter=Fast Color Wavelet-Haar-Hartley-Prometheus Transforms for Image Processing |pages=401\u2013411 |first1=Ekaterina |last1=L.-Rundblad |first2=Alexei |last2=Maidan |first3=Peter |last3=Novak |first4=Valeriy |last4=Labunets |doi=10.1007/1-4020-2307-3 |publisher=[[Springer Science + Business Media]] |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-4020-1982-1}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Simmons_2014_1\">{{cite web |title=Cis |author-first=Bruce |author-last=Simmons |date=2014-07-28 |orig-year=2004 |work=Mathwords: Terms and Formulas from Algebra I to Calculus |publisher=[[Clackamas Community College]], Mathematics Department |location=Oregon City, OR, US |url=http://www.mathwords.com/c/cis.htm |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Simmons_2014_2\">{{cite web |title=Polar Form of a Complex Number |author-first=Bruce |author-last=Simmons |date=2014-07-28 |orig-year=2004 |work=Mathwords: Terms and Formulas from Algebra I to Calculus |publisher=[[Clackamas Community College]], Mathematics Department |location=Oregon City, OR, US |url=http://www.mathwords.com/p/polar_form_of_a_complex_number.htm |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Kammler_2008\">{{cite book |title=A First Course in Fourier Analysis |author-first=David W. |author-last=Kammler |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2008-01-17 |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-13946903-6 |id={{ISBN|1-13946903-7}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znP-ADtE8ZQC |access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lorenzo-Hartley_2016\">{{cite book |title=The Fractional Trigonometry: With Applications to Fractional Differential Equations and Science |author-first1=Carl F. |author-last1=Lorenzo |author-first2=Tom T. |author-last2=Hartley |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |date=2016-11-14 |isbn=978-1-11913942-3 |id={{ISBN|1-11913942-2}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdyADQAAQBAJ |access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Pierce_2016\">{{cite web |author-first=Rod |author-last=Pierce |title=Complex Number Multiplication |work=Maths Is Fun |date=2016-01-04 |orig-year=2000 |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/complex-number-multiply.html |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hamilton_1866\">{{cite book |title=Elements of Quaternions |author-first=William Rowan |author-last=Hamilton |author-link=William Rowan Hamilton |date=1866-01-01 |edition=1 |editor-first=William Edwin |editor-last=Hamilton |editor-link=William Edwin Hamilton |publisher=[[Longmans, Green & Co.]] |publication-place=London |chapter=Chapter II.

For many readers, {{math|cis(''x''<sup>2</sup>)}} is the clearest, easiest to read of the three.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe {{math|cis}} notation is sometimes used to emphasize one method of viewing and dealing with a problem over another. The mathematics of trigonometry and exponentials are related but not exactly the same; exponential notation emphasizes the whole, whereas {{math|cis(''x'')}} and {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}} notations emphasize the parts. This can be rhetorically useful to mathematicians and engineers when discussing this function, and further serve as a [[mnemonic]] (for {{math|cos + ''i'' sin}}).\n\nThe {{math|cis}} notation is convenient for math students whose knowledge of trigonometry and complex numbers permit this notation, but whose conceptual understanding does not yet permit the notation {{math|''e<sup>ix</sup>''}}.  As students learn concepts that build on prior knowledge, it is important not to force them into levels of math for which they are not yet prepared: the usual proof that {{math|cis(''x'') {{=}} ''e<sup>ix</sup>''}} requires [[calculus]], which the student may not have studied before encountering the expression {{math|cos(''x'') + ''i'' sin(''x'')}}.\n\nIn 1942, inspired by the {{math|cis}} notation, [[Ralph V. L. Hartley]] introduced the {{math|[[cas (mathematics)|cas]]}} (for ''cosine-and-sine'') function for the real-valued [[Hartley kernel]], a meanwhile established shortcut in conjunction with [[Hartley transform]]s:<ref name=\"Hartley_1942\"/><ref name=\"Bracewell_1999\"/>\n\n{{math|cas(''x'') {{=}} cos(''x'') + sin(''x'')}}.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[De Moivre's formula]]\n* [[Euler's formula]]\n* [[Complex number]]\n* [[Ptolemy's theorem]]\n* [[Phasor]]\n* [[Versor]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Byrnes_2004\">{{cite book |title=Computational Noncommutative Algebra and Applications |editor-first=Jim |editor-last=Byrnes |chapter=Fast Color Wavelet-Haar-Hartley-Prometheus Transforms for Image Processing |pages=401\u2013411 |first1=Ekaterina |last1=L.-Rundblad |first2=Alexei |last2=Maidan |first3=Peter |last3=Novak |first4=Valeriy |last4=Labunets |doi=10.1007/1-4020-2307-3 |publisher=[[Springer Science + Business Media]] |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |date=2004 |isbn=978-1-4020-1982-1}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Simmons_2014_1\">{{cite web |title=Cis |author-first=Bruce |author-last=Simmons |date=2014-07-28 |orig-year=2004 |work=Mathwords: Terms and Formulas from Algebra I to Calculus |publisher=[[Clackamas Community College]], Mathematics Department |location=Oregon City, OR, US |url=http://www.mathwords.com/c/cis.htm |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Simmons_2014_2\">{{cite web |title=Polar Form of a Complex Number |author-first=Bruce |author-last=Simmons |date=2014-07-28 |orig-year=2004 |work=Mathwords: Terms and Formulas from Algebra I to Calculus |publisher=[[Clackamas Community College]], Mathematics Department |location=Oregon City, OR, US |url=http://www.mathwords.com/p/polar_form_of_a_complex_number.htm |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Kammler_2008\">{{cite book |title=A First Course in Fourier Analysis |author-first=David W. |author-last=Kammler |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=2008-01-17 |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-13946903-6 |id={{ISBN|1-13946903-7}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znP-ADtE8ZQC |access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Lorenzo-Hartley_2016\">{{cite book |title=The Fractional Trigonometry: With Applications to Fractional Differential Equations and Science |author-first1=Carl F. |author-last1=Lorenzo |author-first2=Tom T. |author-last2=Hartley |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |date=2016-11-14 |isbn=978-1-11913942-3 |id={{ISBN|1-11913942-2}} |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdyADQAAQBAJ |access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Pierce_2016\">{{cite web |author-first=Rod |author-last=Pierce |title=Complex Number Multiplication |work=Maths Is Fun |date=2016-01-04 |orig-year=2000 |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/complex-number-multiply.html |access-date=2016-01-15}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Hamilton_1866\">{{cite book |title=Elements of Quaternions |author-first=William Rowan |author-last=Hamilton |author-link=William Rowan Hamilton |date=1866-01-01 |edition=1 |editor-first=William Edwin |editor-last=Hamilton |editor-link=William Edwin Hamilton |publisher=[[Longmans, Green & Co.]] |publication-place=London |chapter=Chapter II.

In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.\n\nThe Nile has two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] \u2013 the [[White Nile]] and the [[Blue Nile]]. The White Nile is known to be the [[headwaters]] and primary stream of the Nile itself. The Blue Nile, however, is the source of most of the [[water]], containing 80% of the water and [[silt]]. The White Nile is longer and rises in the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] region of central Africa, with the most distant source still undetermined but located in either Rwanda or Burundi. It flows north through Tanzania, [[Lake Victoria]], Uganda, and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at [[Lake Tana]] in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast. The two rivers meet just north of the Sudanese capital of [[Khartoum]].\n\nThe northern section of the river flows north almost entirely through the Sudanese [[desert]] to Egypt, then ends in [[Nile Delta|a large delta]] and flows into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. [[History of Egypt|Egyptian civilization]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese kingdoms]] have depended on the river since ancient times. Most of the population and cities of Egypt lie along with those parts of the Nile [[valley]] north of [[Aswan]], and nearly all the cultural and historical sites of [[Ancient Egypt]] was along river banks.\n\n== Etymology and names  ==\nThe standard English names \"White Nile\" and \"Blue Nile\", to refer to the river's source, derive from [[Arabic]] names formerly applied only to the Sudanese stretches which meet at Khartoum.<ref>{{cite EB1911|ref=harv|wstitle=Nile|volume=19|pages=695}}</ref>\n\nIn the ancient [[Egyptian language]], the Nile is called ''[http://medu.ipetisut.com/index.php?og=nile \u1e24'p\u012b]'' (Hapy) or ''Iteru'', meaning \"river\".

The last part of the approximately {{convert|200|km|sigfig=2|sp=us}} river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of [[Masindi Port]], where the river turns north, then makes a great half circle to the east and north until [[Karuma Falls]]. For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the [[Murchison Falls]] until it reaches the very northern shores of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] where it forms a significant [[river delta]]. The lake itself is on the border of [[DR Congo]], but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]]. The average flow rate of the White Nile at the tails of the swamps is about {{convert|510|m3/s|sigfig=2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. From here it soon meets with the [[Sobat River]] at [[Malakal]]. On an annual basis, the White Nile upstream of Malakal contributes about fifteen percent of the total outflow of the Nile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ielrc.org/content/a0509.pdf |author=Hurst H.E. |year=2011 |title=The Nile Basins &#124;volume 1 The Hydrology of the Blue Nile and Akbara and the Main Nile to Aswan, with some Reference to the Projects Nile control Dept. paper 12 |publisher=Government Printing office |location=Cairo |display-authors=etal |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726172514/http://www.ielrc.org/content/a0509.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThe average flow of the White Nile at Lake Kawaki Malakal, just below the Sobat River, is {{convert|924|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}; the peak flow is approximately {{convert|1218|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} in October and minimum flow is about {{convert|609|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}} in April.

The Nile was much longer at that time, with its furthest headwaters in northern [[Zambia]].\n\n=== Integrated Nile ===\nThere are two theories about the age of the integrated Nile. One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

The White Nile Rift System, although shallower than the [[Bahr el Arab rift]], is about {{convert|9|km|mi|sp=us|sigfig=2}} deep. Geophysical exploration of the Blue Nile Rift System estimated the depth of the sediments to be {{convert|5|\u2013|9|km|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them. The Egyptian Nile connected to the Sudanese Nile, which captures the Ethiopian and Equatorial [[headwater]]s during the current stages of tectonic activity in the Eastern, Central and Sudanese Rift Systems.<ref name=Salama1997>Salama, R.B.

ElSevier, Amsterdam.</ref> The connection of the different Niles occurred during cyclic wet periods. The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughing\u2014or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

Telles also used his account.\n\nThe White Nile was even less understood. The ancients mistakenly believed that the [[Niger River]] represented the upper reaches of the White Nile. For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\n\n[[File:Village on the Nile, 1891.jpg|thumb|Village on the Nile, 1891]]\n\n=== Since 1950 ===\n[[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Kagera river|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu river|Ruvubu]] rivers near [[Rusumo Falls]], part of the Nile's upper reaches]]\n[[File:Nile03(js).jpg|thumb|[[Dhows]] on the Nile]] [[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.]]\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as [[felucca]]s. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at [[Edfu]] and [[Kom Ombo]] along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\n\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on [[hydrology transport model]]s, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in [[Lake Nasser]]. Drought has proven to be a major cause of fatality in the Nile river basin.

Credited with being the first European to view the source of the Blue Nile which he describes in this volume.\n* ''Voyage historique d'Abissinie'', [[Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo]] (aka Girolamo Lobo), Piero Matini, Firenze; 1693\n\n:One of the most important and earliest sources on Ethiopia and the Nile. Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo (1595\u20131687), a [[Jesuit]] priest, stayed in Ethiopia, mostly in [[Tigray Province|Tigre]], for 9 years and travelled to [[Lake Tana]] and the Blue Nile, reaching the province of [[Damot]]. When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters. After Pais, Lobo is the second European to describe the sources of the Blue Nile and he did so more exactly than Bruce\" (transl. from Henze).\n\n'''18th century'''\n* ''[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile|Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in the Years&nbsp;\u2013 1768, 1770, 1771, 1772, and 1773]]'', [[James Bruce]] of Kinnaird. J. Ruthven for G. GJ. and J. Robinson et al., Edinburgh, 1790 (5 Volumes)\n\n:With time on his hands and at the urging of a friend, Bruce composed this account of his travels on the African continent, including comments on the history and religion of Egypt, an account of Indian trade, a history of [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]], and other material. Although Bruce would not be confused with \"a great scholar or a judicious critic, few books of equal compass are equally entertaining; and few such monuments exist of the energy and enterprise of a single traveller\" (DNB). \"The result of his travels was a very great enrichment of the knowledge of geography and ethnography\" (Cox II, p. 389.) Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The account of his travels was written twelve years after his journey and without reference to his journals, which gave critics grounds for disbelief, but the substantial accuracy of the book has since been amply demonstrated.\n\n'''1800\u20131850'''\n* ''Egypt And Mohammed Ali, Or Travels in the Valley of The Nile'', [[James Augustus St. John]], Longman, London, 1834\n\n:St. John traveled extensively in Egypt and [[Nubia]] in 1832\u201333, mainly on foot.

Krapf, during his travels, collected information from the Arab traders operating inland from the coast. From the traders Krapf and his companions learned of great lakes and snow-capped mountains, which Krapf claimed to have seen for himself, much to the ridicule of English explorers who could not believe the idea of snow on the equator. However, Krapf was correct and had seen Mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenya, the first European to do so.\n* ''Egypt, Soudan and Central Africa: With Explorations From Khartoum on the White Nile to the Regions of the Equator, Being Sketches from Sixteen Years' Travel'', [[John Petherick]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh; 1861\n\n:Petherick was a well known Welsh traveler in East Central Africa where he had adopted the profession of mining engineer. This work describes sixteen years of his travel throughout Africa. In 1845, he entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the [[Red Sea]] coast and [[Kordofan]] in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1848, he left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid as a trader and was, at the same time made British Consul for the Sudan. In 1853, he removed to [[Khartoum]] and became an ivory trader. He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels. He got the idea to join Speke in his travels, and in this volume is an actual subscription and list of subscribers to raise money to send Petherick to join Speke. His subsequent adventures as a consul in Africa were published in a later work.\n* ''Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile'', [[John Hanning Speke]]. [[William Blackwood]], Edinburgh, 1863; Harper & Brothers, New York; 1864\n\n:Speke had previously made an expedition with Sir Richard Burton under the auspices of the Indian government, during which Speke was convinced that he had discovered the source of the Nile. Burton, however, disagreed and ridiculed Speke's account. Speke set off on another expedition, recounted here, in the company of Captain Grant. During the course of this expedition he not only produced further evidence for his discoveries but he also met (later Sir) [[Samuel Baker|Samuel]] and [[Florence Baker]].

The last part of the approximately {{convert|200|km|sigfig=2|sp=us}} river section starts from the western shores of the lake and flows at first to the west until just south of [[Masindi Port]], where the river turns north, then makes a great half circle to the east and north until [[Karuma Falls]]. For the remaining part it flows merely westerly through the [[Murchison Falls]] until it reaches the very northern shores of [[Lake Albert (Africa)|Lake Albert]] where it forms a significant [[river delta]]. The lake itself is on the border of [[DR Congo]], but the Nile is not a border river at this point. After leaving Lake Albert, the river continues north through Uganda and is known as the [[Albert Nile]].\n\n=== In South Sudan ===\nThe Nile river flows into [[South Sudan]] just south of [[Nimule]], where it is known as the [[White Nile|Bahr al Jabal]] (\"Mountain River\"{{refn|Arabic ''bahr'' can refer to either seas or large rivers.<ref name=\"EB-name\"/>}}). Just south of the town it has the [[confluence]] with the [[Achwa River]]. The [[Bahr el Ghazal River|Bahr al Ghazal]], itself {{convert|716|km|sp=us}} long, joins the Bahr al Jabal at a small lagoon called [[Lake No]], after which the Nile becomes known as the ''Bahr al Abyad'', or the [[White Nile]], from the whitish [[clay]] suspended in its waters. When the [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]] it leaves a rich silty deposit which fertilizes the soil. The Nile no longer floods in Egypt since the completion of the [[Aswan Dam]] in 1970. An [[anabranch]] river, the [[Bahr el Zeraf]], flows out of the Nile's Bahr al Jabal section and rejoins the White Nile.\n\nThe flow rate of the Bahr al Jabal at [[Mongalla, South Sudan]] is almost constant throughout the year and averages {{convert|1048|m3/s|abbr=on|sp=us}}. After Mongalla, the Bahr Al Jabal enters the enormous swamps of the [[Sudd]] region of South Sudan. More than half of the Nile's water is lost in this swamp to [[evaporation]] and [[transpiration]].

One is that the integrated drainage of the Nile is of young age and that the Nile basin was formerly broken into series of separate basins, only the most northerly of which fed a river following the present course of the Nile in Egypt and Sudan. Rushdi Said postulated that Egypt itself supplied most of the waters of the Nile during the early part of its history.<ref name=Said1981>Said, R. (1981). ''The geological evolution of the River Nile''. [[Springer Verlag]].</ref>\n\nThe other theory is that the drainage from Ethiopia via rivers equivalent to the Blue Nile, the Atbara and the [[Tekez\u00e9 River|Takazze]] flowed to the Mediterranean via the Egyptian Nile since well back into [[Tertiary]] times.<ref name=WW1980>Williams, M.A.J.; Williams, F.

These basins were not interconnected until their subsidence ceased, and the rate of sediment deposition was enough to fill and connect them.

The River Atbara overflowed its closed basin during the wet periods that occurred about 100,000 to 120,000 years ago. The Blue Nile connected to the main Nile during the 70,000\u201380,000 years B.P. wet period. The White Nile system in Bahr El Arab and White Nile Rifts remained a closed lake until the connection of the Victoria Nile to the main system some 12,500 years ago during the [[African humid period]].\n\n=== Role in the founding of Egyptian civilization ===\n[[File:Dhows on the Nile.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A [[felucca]] traversing the Nile near Aswan]]\n\nThe Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that \"Egypt was the gift of the Nile\". An unending source of sustenance, it played a crucial role in the development of Egyptian civilization. Because the river overflowed its banks annually and deposited new layers of silt, the surrounding land was very fertile. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ians cultivated and traded [[wheat]], [[flax]], [[papyrus]] and other crops around the Nile. Wheat was a crucial crop in the famine-plagued Middle East. This trading system secured Egypt's diplomatic relationships with other countries, and contributed to economic stability. Far-reaching trade has been carried on along the Nile since ancient times. A tune, [[Hymn to the Nile]], was created and sung by the ancient Egyptian peoples about the flooding of the Nile River and all of the miracles it brought to Ancient Egyptian civilization.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|title=Hymn to the Nile|date=23 March 2010|publisher=ARCJOHN|access-date=20 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123133714/https://arcjohn.wordpress.com/89-2/|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Domestic buffalo|Water buffalo]] were introduced from Asia and the Assyrians introduced [[camel]]s in the 7th century BC. These animals were killed for meat, and were domesticated and used for ploughing\u2014or in the camels' case, carriage. Water was vital to both people and livestock. The Nile was also a convenient and efficient means of transportation for people and goods.\n\nThe Nile was also an important part of ancient Egyptian spiritual life. [[Hapi (Nile god)|Hapi]] was the god of the annual floods, and both he and the [[pharaoh]] were thought to control the flooding. The Nile was considered to be a causeway from life to death and the afterlife. The east was thought of as a place of birth and growth, and the west was considered the place of death, as the god [[Ra]], the Sun, underwent birth, death, and resurrection each day as he crossed the sky. Thus, all tombs were west of the Nile, because the Egyptians believed that in order to enter the afterlife, they had to be buried on the side that symbolized death.\n\nAs the Nile was such an important factor in Egyptian life, the ancient calendar was even based on the three cycles of the Nile. These seasons, each consisting of four months of thirty days each, were called [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]], [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]], and [[Shemu]]. Akhet, which means inundation, was the time of the year when the Nile flooded, leaving several layers of fertile soil behind, aiding in agricultural growth.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\">{{cite book|last1=Springer|first1=Lisa|author2=Neil Morris|title=Art and Culture of Ancient Egypt|year=2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4358-3589-4|page=8}}</ref> Peret was the growing season, and Shemu, the last season, was the harvest season when there were no rains.<ref name=\"SpringerMorris2010\"/>\n\n=== Search for the source of the Nile ===\n[[File:JH Speke.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Hanning Speke|John&nbsp;Hanning&nbsp;Speke]]&nbsp;{{circa|lk=no|1863}}.

For example, [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that the Nile had its origins \"in a mountain of lower [[Mauretania]]\", flowed above ground for \"many days\" distance, then went underground, reappeared as a large lake in the territories of the [[Masaesyli]], then sank again below the desert to flow underground \"for a distance of 20 days' journey till it reaches the nearest Ethiopians.\"<ref>''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 5.10</ref> A merchant named Diogenes reported that the Nile's water attracted game such as buffalo.\n[[File:1911Nile.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|A map of the Nile {{circa|lk=no|1911}}, a time when its entire primary course ran through British occupations, condominiums, colonies, and protectorates{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=693}}]]\n[[Lake Victoria]] was first sighted by Europeans in 1858 when British explorer [[John Hanning Speke]] reached its southern shore while traveling with [[Richard Francis Burton]] to explore central Africa and locate the great lakes. Believing he had found the source of the Nile on seeing this \"vast expanse of open water\" for the first time, Speke named the lake after the then [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen of the United Kingdom]]. Burton, recovering from illness and resting further south on the shores of [[Lake Tanganyika]], was outraged that Speke claimed to have proved his discovery to be the true source of the Nile when Burton regarded this as still unsettled. A very public quarrel ensued, which sparked a great deal of intense debate within the scientific community and interest by other explorers keen to either confirm or refute Speke's discovery. British explorer and missionary [[David Livingstone]] pushed too far west and entered the [[Congo River]] system instead. It was ultimately Welsh-American explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]] who confirmed Speke's discovery, circumnavigating Lake Victoria and reporting the great outflow at [[Ripon Falls]] on the lake's northern shore.\n\nEuropean involvement in Egypt goes back to the time of [[Napoleon]].  [[Laird Shipyard]] of [[Liverpool]] sent an iron steamer to the Nile in the 1830s. With the completion of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|British takeover of Egypt]] in the 1882, more British river steamers followed.\n\nThe Nile is the area's natural navigation channel, giving access to Khartoum and Sudan by steamer. The [[Siege of Khartoum]] was broken with purpose-built [[sternwheelers]] shipped from England and steamed up the river to retake the city. After this came regular steam navigation of the river. With [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|British Forces in Egypt]] in the [[World War I|First World War]] and the inter-war years, river steamers provided both security and sightseeing to the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. Steam navigation remained integral to the two countries as late as 1962. Sudan steamer traffic was a lifeline as few railways or roads were built in that country. Most paddle steamers have been retired to shorefront service, but modern diesel tourist boats remain on the river.\n\n[[File:Village on the Nile, 1891.jpg|thumb|Village on the Nile, 1891]]\n\n=== Since 1950 ===\n[[File:KageraRuvubu.jpg|thumb|right|The confluence of the [[Kagera river|Kagera]] and [[Ruvubu river|Ruvubu]] rivers near [[Rusumo Falls]], part of the Nile's upper reaches]]\n[[File:Nile03(js).jpg|thumb|[[Dhows]] on the Nile]] [[File:View from Cairo Tower 31march2007.jpg|thumb|The Nile passes through Cairo, Egypt's capital city.]]\nThe Nile has long been used to transport goods along its length. Winter winds blow south, up river, so ships could sail up river, and down river using the flow of the river.\nWhile most Egyptians still live in the Nile valley, the 1970 completion of the [[Aswan High Dam]] ended the summer floods and their renewal of the fertile soil, fundamentally changing farming practices. The Nile supports much of the population living along its banks, enabling Egyptians to live in otherwise inhospitable regions of the Sahara. The rivers's flow is disturbed at several points by the [[Cataracts of the Nile]], which are sections of faster-flowing water with many small islands, shallow water, and rocks, which form an obstacle to navigation by boats. The [[Sudd]] wetlands in Sudan also forms a formidable navigation obstacle and impede water flow, to the extent that Sudan had once attempted to canalize (the [[Jonglei Canal]]) to bypass the swamps.<ref>{{cite book |last= Shahin |first= Mamdouh |title= Hydrology and Water Resources of Africa |year= 2002 |publisher= Springer |isbn= 1-4020-0866-X |pages= 286\u2013287 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |access-date= 25 July 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150905222900/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZmdYFTlcSgEC |archive-date= 5 September 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 \"Big Canal To Change Course of Nile River\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905230928/https://books.google.com/books?id=6CcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34 |date=5 September 2015 }}.

The first cataract, the closest to the mouth of the river, is at Aswan, north of the Aswan Dam. This part of the river is a regular tourist route, with cruise ships and traditional wooden sailing boats known as [[felucca]]s. Many cruise ships ply the route between Luxor and Aswan, stopping at [[Edfu]] and [[Kom Ombo]] along the way. Security concerns have limited cruising on the northernmost portion for many years.\n\nA computer simulation study to plan the economic development of the Nile was directed by H.A.W. Morrice and W.N.

M.P. Barnett directed the software development and computer operations. The calculations were enabled by accurate monthly inflow data collected for 50 years. The underlying principle was the use of over-year storage, to conserve water from rainy years for use in dry years. Irrigation, navigation and other needs were considered. Each computer run postulated a set of reservoirs and operating equations for the release of water as a function of the month and the levels upstream. The behavior that would have resulted given the inflow data was modeled. Over 600 models were run. Recommendations were made to the Sudanese authorities. The calculations were run on an IBM 650 computer. Simulation studies to design water resources are discussed further in the article on [[hydrology transport model]]s, that have been used since the 1980s to analyze water quality.\n\nDespite the development of many reservoirs, drought during the 1980s led to widespread starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan, but Egypt was nourished by water impounded in [[Lake Nasser]].

Jer\u00f3nimo Lobo (1595\u20131687), a [[Jesuit]] priest, stayed in Ethiopia, mostly in [[Tigray Province|Tigre]], for 9 years and travelled to [[Lake Tana]] and the Blue Nile, reaching the province of [[Damot]]. When the Jesuits were expelled from the country, he too had to leave and did so via [[Massaua]] and [[Suakin]]. \"He was the best expert on Ethiopian matters. After Pais, Lobo is the second European to describe the sources of the Blue Nile and he did so more exactly than Bruce\" (transl. from Henze).\n\n'''18th century'''\n* ''[[Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile|Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile in the Years&nbsp;\u2013 1768, 1770, 1771, 1772, and 1773]]'', [[James Bruce]] of Kinnaird.

Although Bruce would not be confused with \"a great scholar or a judicious critic, few books of equal compass are equally entertaining; and few such monuments exist of the energy and enterprise of a single traveller\" (DNB). \"The result of his travels was a very great enrichment of the knowledge of geography and ethnography\" (Cox II, p. 389.) Bruce was one of the earliest westerners to search for the source of the Nile. In November 1770 he reached the source of the Blue Nile, and though he acknowledged that the White Nile was the larger stream, he claimed that the Blue Nile was the Nile of the ancients and that he was thus the discoverer of its source. The account of his travels was written twelve years after his journey and without reference to his journals, which gave critics grounds for disbelief, but the substantial accuracy of the book has since been amply demonstrated.\n\n'''1800\u20131850'''\n* ''Egypt And Mohammed Ali, Or Travels in the Valley of The Nile'', [[James Augustus St. John]], Longman, London, 1834\n\n:St. John traveled extensively in Egypt and [[Nubia]] in 1832\u201333, mainly on foot.

This work describes sixteen years of his travel throughout Africa. In 1845, he entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the [[Red Sea]] coast and [[Kordofan]] in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1848, he left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid as a trader and was, at the same time made British Consul for the Sudan. In 1853, he removed to [[Khartoum]] and became an ivory trader. He traveled extensively in the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr-el-Ghazal]] region, then almost unknown, exploring the [[Jur River|Jur]], [[Yalo]] and other affluents of the [[Ghazal]] and in 1858 he penetrated the [[Zande people|Niam-Niam]] country. Petherick's additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable, being responsible for the discovery of a number of new species. In 1859, he returned to England where he became acquainted with [[John Speke]], then arranging for an expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England, Petherick married and published this account of his travels. He got the idea to join Speke in his travels, and in this volume is an actual subscription and list of subscribers to raise money to send Petherick to join Speke.

{"title_page": "British and Irish Association of Law Librarians", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{More citations needed|September 2010|date=September 2010}}\nThe '''British and Irish Association of Law Librarians''' ('''BIALL,''' http://www.biall.org.uk/) is a professional body which represents information professionals working with legal information. BIALL is a self-supporting association which draws its income primarily from membership subscriptions.\n\n== History ==\nBIALL was set up in 1969 following workshops on law librarianship held at [[Harrogate]] in 1968 and 1969. Two strands led to the formation of BIALL. Firstly, the law librarians in London, Oxford, Cambridge and Ireland had been in contact and working together since the late 1940s, reinforced by their membership of the International Association of Law Librarians (IALL).<ref>[http://www.iall.org/ International Association of Law Librarians]</ref> Secondly, the outreach programme of [[Leeds Polytechnic|Leeds Library School]] led to one of the School\u2019s staff, Don Daintree, organising Workshops on Law Librarianship in Harrogate in 1968 and 1969. They brought together the foremost law library figures as speakers and those few people who were working in law libraries as students of the Workshops.  The inspiration for the Workshops was the [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals|Library Association]]\u2019s List C papers on the bibliography and librarianship of subjects.\n\nThe 1st Harrogate Workshop in February was held at the Russell Hotel and a meeting at the end of the Workshop set up an ad hoc Committee to look into the possibility of establishing an association of law librarians. Committee members were [[Wallace Breem]], Don Daintree, [[Betty Moys]], Willi Steiner and Derek Way. The 2nd Harrogate Workshop in April concluded with a meeting which set up an Association of Law Librarians. This was the inaugural meeting and those who were present are BIALL\u2019s founder members. The first AGM was held in a basement room of the old IALS building in [[Russell Square]] on Monday 22 September. It was chaired by Willi Steiner, several hours were spent debating the minutiae of the draft Constitution. One of the decisions was to form a separate organisation, not affiliated to, or part of, the Library Association, resulting from strong arguments that organisations (especially law firms) who had no professional librarians, would be excluded from membership if the Association were part of the LA. The principle of welcoming professionally qualified and non-qualified law librarians into BIALL has prevailed ever since.\n\nThe first officers were Don Daintree (Chairman), [[Wallace Breem]] (Secretary and Treasurer) and Betty Moys (Editor). An Executive Committee was subsequently elected and in November it set up a Sub-Committee of Betty Moys, Allan Appleby of [[Sweet and Maxwell]], and [[Wallace Breem]] to produce a journal.\n\n== BIALL Conference ==\n\nBIALL organises an annual Conference<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biall.org.uk/annual-conference/|title=BIALL Conference|website=BIALL|access-date=10 April 2018}}</ref> every year which all BIALL members are invited to attend. The Conference is an opportunity to listen to talks delivered by Legal Information Professionals and Industry experts as well as network with colleagues.

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test \u2013 Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

During [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]] began using the Wonderlic Personnel Test to select candidates for [[aviator|pilot]] [[training]] and [[air navigation|navigation]]. During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test \u2013 Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes). The Wonderlic Personnel Test-Quicktest differs from the Wonderlic Personnel Test in that it is not proctored giving employers a general idea of the potential applicant's cognitive ability.

Wonderlic claims that using the Wonderlic Personality Test to select individuals whose traits are aligned with the demands of the position, employers can improve employee productivity, employee satisfaction and customer service while reducing recruitment costs and employee turnover.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wonderlic|url=http://www.wonderlic.com/assessments/personality|accessdate=July 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nAdded during the 1990s, the Wonderlic Personality Test contains two sections. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile and the Wonderlic Seven-Factor Personality Profile. The Wonderlic Five-Factor Personality Profile tests individuals on five primary dimensions of the individual's personality: [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]], [[neuroticism|emotional stability/neuroticism]], and [[openness to experience]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Description of Five Factor Model|url=http://www.personality-and-aptitude-career-tests.com/five-factor-model.html|accessdate=April 10, 2012}}</ref> These are essentially the same [[Construct (philosophy of science)|constructs]] as the [[Big Five personality traits]], also known as the Five Factor Model.\n\n===Motivation===\nAveraging 10\u201315 minutes, the 58-item assessment is based on leading workplace motivation model, Holland/RIASEC. It evaluates a candidate\u2019s interests, which helps predict how motivated they will be by the actual responsibilities of the job.

New London''===\nIn May 1997, Robert Jordan filed a lawsuit against the city of [[New London, Connecticut]], alleging violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the United States and Connecticut constitutions, in a case that was referred to by several media outlets as \"Too Smart To Be A Cop\",<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/too-smart-to-be-a-cop/</ref><ref>https://slate.com/business/2013/05/too-smart-to-be-a-cop.html</ref> based on the city's application of scores generated by the Wonderlic test.\n\nJordan was born and raised in New London, and had previous experience in law enforcement, working as a part-time officer in near-by [[Groton Long Point]], and as a seasonal officer for the [[Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection]]. In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity.  For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s.\n\n===Melting point===\nSalts characteristically have high melting points.  For example, [[sodium chloride]] melts at 801&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature.  These include [[molten salt]]s, which are usually mixtures of salts, and [[ionic liquid]]s, which usually contain organic cations.  These liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvents.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium'' or ''ammonium'') followed by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride'' or ''acetate''). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium salt'' or ''ammonium salt'') or by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride salt'' or ''acetate salt'').\n\nCommon salt-forming cations include:\n\n* [[Ammonium]] {{chem|NH|4|+}}\n* [[Calcium]] {{chem|Ca|2+}}\n* [[Iron]] {{chem|Fe|2+}} and {{chem|Fe|3+}}\n* [[Magnesium]] {{chem|Mg|2+}}\n* [[Potassium]] {{chem|K|+}}\n* [[Pyridinium]] {{chem|C|5|H|5|NH|+}}\n* [[Quaternary ammonium cation|Quaternary ammonium]] {{chem|NR|4|+}}, R being an [[alkyl]] group or an [[aryl]] group\n* [[Sodium]] {{chem|Na|+}}\n* [[Copper]] {{chem|Cu|2+}}\n\nCommon salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:\n\n* [[Acetate]] {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} ([[acetic acid]])\n* [[Carbonate]] {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} ([[carbonic acid]])\n* [[Chloride]] {{chem|Cl|\u2212}} ([[hydrochloric acid]])\n* [[Citrate]] {{chem|HOC(COO|\u2212|)(CH|2|COO|\u2212|)|2}} ([[citric acid]])\n* [[Cyanide]] {{chem|C\u2261N|\u2212}} ([[hydrocyanic acid]])\n* [[Fluoride]] {{chem|F|\u2212}} ([[hydrofluoric acid]])\n* [[Nitrate]] {{chem|NO|3|\u2212}} ([[nitric acid]])\n* [[Nitrite]] {{chem|NO|2|\u2212}} ([[nitrous acid]])\n* [[Oxide]] {{chem|O|2\u2212}}\n* [[Phosphate]] {{chem|PO|4|3\u2212}} ([[phosphoric acid]])\n* [[Sulfate]] {{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}} ([[sulfuric acid]])\n\nSalts with varying number of hydrogen atoms replaced by cations as compared to their parent acid can be referred to as ''monobasic'', ''dibasic'', or ''tribasic'', identifying that one, two, or three hydrogen atoms have been replaced; ''polybasic'' salts refer to those with more than one hydrogen atom replaced.

These [[ionic compound]]s dissociate completely in [[water]]. They are generally odorless and [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]].\n\nStrong salts start with Na__, K__, NH<sub>4</sub>__, or they end with __NO<sub>3</sub>, __ClO<sub>4</sub>, or __CH<sub>3</sub>COO. Most group 1 and 2 metals form strong salts. Strong salts are especially useful when creating conductive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conductivity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acid and Base Strength |url=http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |department=Home Bookshelves Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Supplemental Modules (Physical and Theoretical Chemistry) Acids and Bases Ionization Constants |publisher=MindTouch and Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project,  |date=5 June 2019 |access-date=6 November 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213034814/http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |archive-date=2016-12-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Weak salt==\nWeak salts or \"weak electrolyte salts\" are, as the name suggests, composed of weak [[electrolyte]]s.

Molten salts or solutions of salts conduct electricity.  For this reason, liquified (molten) salts and solutions containing dissolved salts (e.g., sodium chloride in water) are called [[electrolyte]]s.\n\n===Melting point===\nSalts characteristically have high melting points.  For example, [[sodium chloride]] melts at 801&nbsp;\u00b0C.  Some salts with low lattice energies are liquid at or near room temperature.  These include [[molten salt]]s, which are usually mixtures of salts, and [[ionic liquid]]s, which usually contain organic cations.  These liquids exhibit unusual properties as solvents.\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n\nThe name of a salt starts with the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium'' or ''ammonium'') followed by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride'' or ''acetate''). Salts are often referred to only by the name of the cation (e.g., ''sodium salt'' or ''ammonium salt'') or by the name of the anion (e.g., ''chloride salt'' or ''acetate salt'').\n\nCommon salt-forming cations include:\n\n* [[Ammonium]] {{chem|NH|4|+}}\n* [[Calcium]] {{chem|Ca|2+}}\n* [[Iron]] {{chem|Fe|2+}} and {{chem|Fe|3+}}\n* [[Magnesium]] {{chem|Mg|2+}}\n* [[Potassium]] {{chem|K|+}}\n* [[Pyridinium]] {{chem|C|5|H|5|NH|+}}\n* [[Quaternary ammonium cation|Quaternary ammonium]] {{chem|NR|4|+}}, R being an [[alkyl]] group or an [[aryl]] group\n* [[Sodium]] {{chem|Na|+}}\n* [[Copper]] {{chem|Cu|2+}}\n\nCommon salt-forming anions (parent acids in parentheses where available) include:\n\n* [[Acetate]] {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} ([[acetic acid]])\n* [[Carbonate]] {{chem|CO|3|2\u2212}} ([[carbonic acid]])\n* [[Chloride]] {{chem|Cl|\u2212}} ([[hydrochloric acid]])\n* [[Citrate]] {{chem|HOC(COO|\u2212|)(CH|2|COO|\u2212|)|2}} ([[citric acid]])\n* [[Cyanide]] {{chem|C\u2261N|\u2212}} ([[hydrocyanic acid]])\n* [[Fluoride]] {{chem|F|\u2212}} ([[hydrofluoric acid]])\n* [[Nitrate]] {{chem|NO|3|\u2212}} ([[nitric acid]])\n* [[Nitrite]] {{chem|NO|2|\u2212}} ([[nitrous acid]])\n* [[Oxide]] {{chem|O|2\u2212}}\n* [[Phosphate]] {{chem|PO|4|3\u2212}} ([[phosphoric acid]])\n* [[Sulfate]] {{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}} ([[sulfuric acid]])\n\nSalts with varying number of hydrogen atoms replaced by cations as compared to their parent acid can be referred to as ''monobasic'', ''dibasic'', or ''tribasic'', identifying that one, two, or three hydrogen atoms have been replaced; ''polybasic'' salts refer to those with more than one hydrogen atom replaced. Examples include:\n\n* [[Monosodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate monobasic]] (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Disodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate dibasic]] (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Trisodium phosphate|Sodium phosphate tribasic]] (Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n\n== Formation ==\n[[Image:Lead(II) sulfate.jpg|thumb|Solid lead(II) sulfate (PbSO<sub>4</sub>)]]\nSalts are formed by a [[chemical reaction]] between:\n\n* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[ammonia|NH<sub>3</sub>]] + [[hydrochloric acid|HCl]] \u2192 [[ammonium chloride|NH<sub>4</sub>Cl]]\n* A [[metal]] and an [[acid]], e.g., [[magnesium|Mg]] + [[sulfuric acid|H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>]] \u2192 [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO<sub>4</sub>]] + [[hydrogen|H<sub>2</sub>]]\n* A metal and a non-metal, e.g., [[calcium|Ca]] + [[chlorine|Cl<sub>2</sub>]] \u2192 [[calcium chloride|CaCl<sub>2</sub>]]\n* A [[base (chemistry)|base]] and an [[acid anhydride]], e.g., 2&nbsp;[[Sodium Hydroxide|NaOH]] + [[Dichlorine monoxide|Cl<sub>2</sub>O]] \u2192 2&nbsp;[[Sodium hypochlorite|NaClO]] + [[Water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]\n* An [[acid]] and a [[base anhydride]], e.g., 2&nbsp;[[nitric acid|HNO<sub>3</sub>]] + [[Sodium oxide|Na<sub>2</sub>O]] \u2192 2&nbsp;[[Sodium nitrate|NaNO<sub>3</sub>]] + [[Water|H<sub>2</sub>O]]\n* Salts can also form if solutions of different salts are mixed, their ions recombine, and the new salt is insoluble and precipitates (see: [[solubility equilibrium]]), for example:\n*: Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 PbSO<sub>4</sub>\u2193 + 2&nbsp;NaNO<sub>3</sub>\n\n==Strong salt==\nStrong salts or strong [[electrolyte]] salts are chemical salts composed of strong electrolytes. These [[ionic compound]]s dissociate completely in [[water]]. They are generally odorless and [[Volatility (chemistry)|nonvolatile]].\n\nStrong salts start with Na__, K__, NH<sub>4</sub>__, or they end with __NO<sub>3</sub>, __ClO<sub>4</sub>, or __CH<sub>3</sub>COO. Most group 1 and 2 metals form strong salts. Strong salts are especially useful when creating conductive compounds as their constituent ions allow for greater conductivity.<ref>{{cite web |title=Acid and Base Strength |url=http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |department=Home Bookshelves Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Supplemental Modules (Physical and Theoretical Chemistry) Acids and Bases Ionization Constants |publisher=MindTouch and Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project,  |date=5 June 2019 |access-date=6 November 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161213034814/http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry/Acids_and_Bases/Ionization_Constants/Acid_and_Base_Strength |archive-date=2016-12-13 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Weak salt==\nWeak salts or \"weak electrolyte salts\" are, as the name suggests, composed of weak [[electrolyte]]s.
