He is invited to an interview with Dr. [[Don Shirley]], a black pianist in need of a driver for his eight-week concert tour through the [[Midwest]] and [[Deep South]]. Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve. Don's [[record label]] gives Tony a copy of the ''[[The Negro Motorist Green Book|Green Book]]'', a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them.<ref name=\"book\">{{cite web|title=NYPL Digital Library|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=about|work=book|accessdate=January 20, 2019|date=January 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThey begin the tour in the Midwest before eventually heading farther south. Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and is increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment which Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men threatens Don's life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.\n\nThroughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements. In the south, Don is found in a gay encounter with a white man at a pool, and Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest. Later, the two are arrested after a police officer pulls them over late at night in a [[sundown town]]; Tony punches him after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, Don asks to call his lawyer and uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who pressures the governor to release them.  \n\nOn the night of the final performance on tour in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the [[country club]] where he has been hired to perform. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play since they refuse to serve him in the room with his audience. Tony and Don have dinner at a predominantly black blues club where Don rouses the crowd with his music. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve. Tony invites Don to have dinner with his family, but he declines and returns to his own home. Sitting alone in his home, Don decides to go back to Tony's home, where he is warmly greeted.\n\nThe end title cards show real life photos of the characters and states that Don continued to tour, compose and record songs, while Tony went back to his work at Copacabana. It also states that Tony and Don remained friends until they died, within months of each other, in 2013.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Tony Lip]]\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as Dr. [[Don Shirley]]\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Dolores: Tony's wife\n* [[Sebastian Maniscalco]] as Johnny Venere: Dolores' brother\n* [[Dimiter Marinov|Dimiter D.

Don hires Tony on the strength of his references. They embark with plans to return to New York City on Christmas Eve.

Tony and Don initially clash as Tony feels uncomfortable being asked to act with more refinement, while Don is disgusted by Tony's habits. As the tour progresses, Tony is impressed with Don's talent on the piano, and is increasingly appalled by the discriminatory treatment which Don receives from his hosts and the general public when he is not on stage. A group of white men threatens Don's life in a bar and Tony rescues him. He instructs Don not to go out without him for the rest of the tour.\n\nThroughout the journey, Don helps Tony write letters to his wife, which deeply move her. Tony encourages Don to get in touch with his own estranged brother, but Don is hesitant, observing that he has become isolated by his professional life and achievements. In the south, Don is found in a gay encounter with a white man at a pool, and Tony bribes the officers to prevent the musician's arrest. Later, the two are arrested after a police officer pulls them over late at night in a [[sundown town]]; Tony punches him after being insulted. While they are incarcerated, Don asks to call his lawyer and uses the opportunity to reach Attorney General [[Robert F. Kennedy]], who pressures the governor to release them.  \n\nOn the night of the final performance on tour in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], Don is refused entry into the whites-only dining room of the [[country club]] where he has been hired to perform. Tony threatens the owner, and Don refuses to play since they refuse to serve him in the room with his audience. Tony and Don have dinner at a predominantly black blues club where Don rouses the crowd with his music. Tony and Don head back north to try to make it home by Christmas Eve. Tony invites Don to have dinner with his family, but he declines and returns to his own home. Sitting alone in his home, Don decides to go back to Tony's home, where he is warmly greeted.\n\nThe end title cards show real life photos of the characters and states that Don continued to tour, compose and record songs, while Tony went back to his work at Copacabana. It also states that Tony and Don remained friends until they died, within months of each other, in 2013.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as [[Tony Lip]]\n* [[Mahershala Ali]] as Dr. [[Don Shirley]]\n* [[Linda Cardellini]] as Dolores: Tony's wife\n* [[Sebastian Maniscalco]] as Johnny Venere: Dolores' brother\n* [[Dimiter Marinov|Dimiter D.

The daycare staff and children spend their time outdoors, typically in a forest. A distinctive feature of forest kindergartens is the emphasis on play with objects that can be found in nature, rather than commercial toys. Despite these differences, forest kindergartens are meant to fulfill the same basic purpose as other nurseries, namely, to care for, stimulate, and educate young children.\n\nEach forest kindergarten is different, partly because the organisations are independently minded.

There should be a building where children can shelter from extreme weather. They may also spend a small part of each day indoors, although that is more likely to be for administrative and organisational reasons, such as to provide a known location where parents can deliver and collect their children. If the woodland is too far away to walk, a vehicle might reluctantly be used for transport.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nChildren are encouraged to dress for the weather, with waterproof clothes and warm layers, according to the climate.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n==History==\nIn rural areas, and historical times, access to nature has not been a problem. Over the last century, with increasing urbanisation and \"[[nature deficit disorder]]\", there have been many changes in stance on [[outdoor education]]. \n\nThe first forest Kindergarten was created by Ella Flautau in [[Denmark]] in the early 1950s. The idea formed gradually as a result of her often spending time with her own and neighbors' children in a nearby forest, a form of daycare which elicited great interest among the neighborhood parents. The parents formed a group and created an initiative to establish the first forest kindergarten. \n\nIn [[Sweden]] in 1957, an ex-military man, Goesta Frohm, created the idea of \"Skogsmulle\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020606150310/http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]</ref> \"Skog\" means wood in Swedish. \"Mulle\" is one of four fictional characters he created to teach children about nature, along with \"Laxe\" representing water, \"Fj\u00e4llfina\" representing mountains and \"Nova\" representing an unpolluted nature. [[Forest schools]] based on Frohm's model, called \"I Ur och Skur\" (Rain or Shine Schools) moved the idea from occasional activities to formal nursery schools, being set up by Siw Linde in 1985. Juliet Robertson's review of Skogsmulle is a valuable modern-day summary.<ref name=\"skogsmulle2008-1\">{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 1|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084834/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/rain%20or%20shine%20schools%20in%20sweden%20report.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06}}</ref><ref name=\"skogsmulle2008-2\">{{citation|url=http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|title=Swedish Forest Kindergartens, Part 2|publisher=Creative Star Learning Company|first=Juliet|last=Robertson|year=2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306084915/http://www.creativestarlearning.co.uk/Flexviews/core/assets/mulleborg%20skogsknattarna%20%20forest%20school%20report%2008.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-06}}</ref>\n\nNature kindergartens have existed in [[Germany]] since 1968 but the first Forest Kindergarten was first officially recognized as a form of daycare in 1993, enabling state subsidies to reduce the daycare fees of children who attended Forest Kindergarten.

He was a furious God-hater and a hypocrite, who wanted above all else to conquer the Gods. He went to the banks of the [[Ganges]] in the Himalayas and practiced a very strict penance to [[Brahma]], who believed him to be the protector of the demons. He held in his body the five v\u0101yus of [[Prana]] and began meditating, repeating the [[Gayatri Mantra]] and practicing austerities. For the first ten thousand years, he lived by ingesting only dry leaves; for the second, he lived by drinking only drops of water; and, for the third, he lived by inhaling air alone. For the fourth ten thousand years, he did not consume anything and thus practiced his penance. After the fourth ten thousand years, his belly had become dried up, his body had withered and the nerves of his body had become almost visible; only the life breath was lingering there. At this point a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of light emitted from his body and began to burn the whole world. With his eyes closed, he appeared to be blazing with fire, as if he were a fire himself.\n\nObserving his penance and resolve, Lord Brahma saw fit to bless Arunasur with protection from all two- or four-legged creatures. This blessing gave Arunasur the confidence to call on all the other demons living in the nether regions and fight a final battle with the Gods above. The demons came and saluted him as their king. By his command, they sent messengers to the Heavens to signal their intent. Upon hearing the news, [[Indra]] trembled with fear and went instantly with the Gods to the abode of Brahma. After discussing the situation with Brahma, they went to the [[Vaikunth]] to recruit Vishnu. There they all held a conference on how to kill the demon who sought to overthrow them.\n\nWhile the Gods conferred, Arunasur and his army went to the Heavens. The demon used the power of his penances to assume various forms and seized possession of the Moon, the Sun, [[Yamraj]], [[Agni]] and all the others. All the Gods, dislodged from their stations, then went to the region of [[Kailash]] and presented to Lord [[Shiva]] the dire nature of their situation. After conferring with Shiva, they turned to [[Parvati]], the complete incarnation of the [[Adi Parashakti]]. Parvati was aware of Arunasur's blessing, and devised a plan to kill the demon with the help of six-legged creatures.\n\nAfter taking control of all the celestial regions, Arunasur's next intention was to attack [[kailash]] directly. Shiva and his sons confronted him at the foot of the mountain. They tried to defeat him but were unsuccessful. Even Shiva was unable to defeat him. Arunasur then proceeded to attack Shiva. Shiva then called upon [[Parvati]] in the battlefield. Parvati then appeared behind Shiva and grew to a massive size, wielding a mace, trident, longsword and shield in her four hands. Her three eyes shone like  the sun, the moon, and the eternal fire [[agni]]. She closed her eyes in concentration, summoning forth countless bees, hornets, wasps, flies, termites, mosquitos and spiders from the skies. They crawled onto her body and clung onto her, merging with her to create the divine form of Bhramari Devi.\n\nIn the battle that ensued, the demons' swords were blocked by Bhramari Devi's shield, while her other arms inflicted damage on the massive army. She ran through the ranks, stabbing with the trident, chopping with the longsword and reducing demons to powder with powerful swings of her mace. The bees, hornets, wasps, flies, termites, mosquitos and spiders which clung to her emanated forth in a wave over the ranks. When Arunasur was the last demon remaining on battlefield, she retreated and sent out all of the insects to attack him. They crawled all over him and ripped open each part of his body: his chests, back and belly, arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet and toes were all torn apart. Soon after seeing Arunasur's great fall, the insects returned to Bhramari Devi and clung on her again. The Gods, who were in awe of this new form, gave her great praise.  On the successful decimation of the demonic forces, all of the gods were able to return to their celestial homes.\n\n==Pranayama==\n\nIn [[pranayama]], the name Bhramari is given to a type of breathing through the nose, making a smooth humming sound like a bee buzzing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Types of Pranayama |url=https://www.yogapoint.com/pranayama/types-of-pranayama.htm#bhramari-humming-bee-breath |publisher=YogaPoint |accessdate=13 May 2019 |date=2019}}</ref> [https://yog.dev/pranayama/bhramari.html Bhramari (\u092d\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0930\u0940) Pranayama] generates vibrations which pacify the brain and nervous system.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ah-Muzen-Cab]] -- [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] god of bees.\n* [[Aristaeus]] -- [[Ancient Greek]] god of bees.  \n* [[List of Lithuanian mythological figures#Jan \u0141asicki|Aust\u0117ja]] -- [[Lithuania]]n goddess of bees.  \n* [[List of Lithuanian mythological figures#Jan \u0141asicki|Bubilas]] -- [[Lithuania]]n god of bees.  \n* [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings#C|Colel Cab]] -- [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] goddess of bees.\n* [[Melissa]] -- [[Ancient Greek]]/[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] goddess of bees.\n* [[Mellona]] -- [[Roman mythology|Roman]] goddess of bees.\n* [[Bee (mythology)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{HinduMythology}}\n\n[[Category:Forms of Parvati]]\n[[Category:Hindu goddesses]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox deity<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Hindu mythology-->\n| type = Hindu\n|image=File:Bhramari devi goddess of the black bees shrimad wg32.jpg\n| caption = Goddess of Black Bees\n| name = Bhramari\n| affiliation = [[Avatar]] of [[Durga]], [[Shakti]], [[Parvati]]\n| god_of = Goddess of Bees\n| abode =\n| mantra =\n| weapon = Trident, Mace, Sword, Shield\n| consort = [[Shiva]]\n| mount =\n}}\n\n'''Bhramari''' is a Hindu Goddess.

The Victory Bell is the oldest current non-conference college football rivalry in the United States (though the teams were [[Mid-American Conference|conference rivals]] for a few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|title=Longest-running rivalries in college football|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312061840/https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats and RedHawks (formerly the Redskins) square off each fall for the famed Victory Bell. The first game in the series, played on December 8, 1888 in [[Oxford, Ohio]], was the first college football game played in the state of Ohio. The original bell hung in Miami's [[Harrison Hall (Miami University)|Harrison Hall]] (Old Main) near the site of the first game and was used to ring in Miami victories.  The traveling trophy tradition began in the 1890s when some Cincinnati fans \"borrowed\" the bell. The bell went to the winner of the annual game for the next forty years until it mysteriously disappeared in the 1930s. The original bell reappeared in 1946 and is on display in the lobby of Miami's Murstein Alumni Center. The current trophy is a replica of the original bell and is kept in the possession of the winning team each year. One side of the bell is painted black with white numbers showing Cincinnati's victories, while the other side is white with red numbers showing Miami's victories.  Ties are indicated on the top of the red yoke in white numbers.\n\nThe Miami\u2013Cincinnati series ranks fifth on the list of most-played rivalries in college football and is the oldest Division I rivalry west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|title=UC Football: Victory Bell Rivalry Is At Its End - Cincinnati vs. Everyone|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060049/http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the [[2010\u201312 NCAA conference realignment]] led to the end of several historic rivalries, it is now the most-played currently active rivalry involving schools from the same state, and also holds the same distinction among inter-conference rivalries. Of the more than thirty college football rivalries that include at least 89 games, none is older than Miami vs. Cincinnati.\n\n===Louisville===\n{{Main|The Keg of Nails}}\nThe [[Keg of Nails]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]. The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the Metro Conference to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is believed to be the oldest rivalry for the Louisville football team and the second oldest for Cincinnati, only behind [[Victory Bell (Miami\u2013Cincinnati)|the annual game]] with the [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami RedHawks]].\n\nThe trophy is a replica of a keg used to ship nails. The exchange is believed to have been initiated by fraternity chapters on the UC and U of L campuses, signifying that the winning players in the game were \"tough as nails.\"\n\nThe present keg is actually a replacement for the original award, which was misplaced by Louisville, lost during some construction of office facilities. It is adorned with the logos of both schools and the scores of the series games.\n\nThe rivalry went on hiatus following the 2013 season, as Louisville moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|title=ACC votes to add Louisville in 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312052203/http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{Main|River City Rivalry}}\nThe [[River City Rivalry]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. The rivalry itself was relatively brief, played annually from 2005, during which season the rivalry trophy was introduced. Before the rivalry was titled, the two teams played each other in 1921, 1922, 1979, and 1981. The rivalry went on hiatus, like many others throughout the country, in the aftermath of the [[2010\u201313 NCAA conference realignment]], which left the programs in separate leagues.  However, the two teams are scheduled to meet in a home-and-home series for the 2023 and 2024 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498|title=Pitt schedules home and home with Cincinnati; other notes - Pittsburgh Sporting News|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312204203/http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Paddlewheel Trophy is the rivalry trophy that was created in 2005 when the [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] joined the Big East Conference to which the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] already belonged. The trophy is designed and named in honor the historic link between the cities from the days in the 19th and early-20th centuries when [[Paddle wheel]]-powered [[Paddle steamer|boats]] traveled between the two cities along the [[Ohio River]]. \n\nThe 2009 match-up between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh was described by one national columnist as the most \"fascinating game I've ever seen.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | first=Gregg | last=Doyel | title=Cincy exits on high, Pitt crushed after fascinating game | date=2009-12-05 | publisher=CBSSports.com | accessdate=2009-12-07 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603133151/http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | archivedate=2012-06-03 }}</ref> The game functioned as a Big East championship game, with Cincinnati entering first in the conference, and Pittsburgh at second. Additionally, the Bearcats entered the game undefeated and trying to earn a spot in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], while the 9\u20132 Panthers were trying to secure their first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS bowl]] since the [[2005 Fiesta Bowl|2004]] season. The Panthers had an early 31\u201310 lead, however, the ensuing kickoff was returned for a touchdown by [[Mardy Gilyard]] to make it a 31\u201317 game at halftime. Cincinnati completed the comeback, tying the game at 38 late in the 4th quarter. Pittsburgh running back [[Dion Lewis]] scored a touchdown with 1:36 left in the game, but a mishandled snap by Andrew Janocko prevented the Panthers from converting the extra point. The Bearcats then drove down the field and scored on a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Tony Pike]] to [[Armon Binns]] with 33 seconds left. Bearcats kicker Jake Rodgers converted the extra point attempt, and Cincinnati held on to win 45\u201344. Following the game, Cincinnati rose to a #3 ranking in the final BCS standing while Pitt dropped to #17. The game has been described as \"one of the most crushing losses in the history of Pitt football.\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | title=Pitt's toughest loss in decades | first=Joe | last=Starkey | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2009-12-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209023332/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | archivedate=2009-12-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Xavier===\n{{Main|Cincinnati\u2013Xavier rivalry#Football}}\nCincinnati and [[Xavier Musketeers football|Xavier]] would first play in 1918, but the series would not become an annual event until 1946. The game would be played each year at Cincinnati's [[Nippert Stadium]] as the venue had a larger capacity to accommodate the cross city showdown compared to Xavier's [[Corcoran Stadium]]. The series, and Xavier's football program, would come to a close after the 1973 series.

The Victory Bell is the oldest current non-conference college football rivalry in the United States (though the teams were [[Mid-American Conference|conference rivals]] for a few years in the late 1940s and early 1950s).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|title=Longest-running rivalries in college football|date=23 March 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312061840/https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/oldest-rivalry-games-college-football/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Bearcats and RedHawks (formerly the Redskins) square off each fall for the famed Victory Bell. The first game in the series, played on December 8, 1888 in [[Oxford, Ohio]], was the first college football game played in the state of Ohio. The original bell hung in Miami's [[Harrison Hall (Miami University)|Harrison Hall]] (Old Main) near the site of the first game and was used to ring in Miami victories.  The traveling trophy tradition began in the 1890s when some Cincinnati fans \"borrowed\" the bell. The bell went to the winner of the annual game for the next forty years until it mysteriously disappeared in the 1930s. The original bell reappeared in 1946 and is on display in the lobby of Miami's Murstein Alumni Center. The current trophy is a replica of the original bell and is kept in the possession of the winning team each year. One side of the bell is painted black with white numbers showing Cincinnati's victories, while the other side is white with red numbers showing Miami's victories.  Ties are indicated on the top of the red yoke in white numbers.\n\nThe Miami\u2013Cincinnati series ranks fifth on the list of most-played rivalries in college football and is the oldest Division I rivalry west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|title=UC Football: Victory Bell Rivalry Is At Its End - Cincinnati vs. Everyone|date=20 September 2016|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312060049/http://www.cincinnativseveryone.com/uc-football-victory-bell-rivalry-is-at-its-end/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref> After the [[2010\u201312 NCAA conference realignment]] led to the end of several historic rivalries, it is now the most-played currently active rivalry involving schools from the same state, and also holds the same distinction among inter-conference rivalries. Of the more than thirty college football rivalries that include at least 89 games, none is older than Miami vs. Cincinnati.\n\n===Louisville===\n{{Main|The Keg of Nails}}\nThe [[Keg of Nails]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]]. The rivalry has stretched over the span of four conferences from the [[Missouri Valley Conference]], to the Metro Conference to [[Conference USA]], and more recently in the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]], which in 2013 was renamed to the [[American Athletic Conference]]. It is believed to be the oldest rivalry for the Louisville football team and the second oldest for Cincinnati, only behind [[Victory Bell (Miami\u2013Cincinnati)|the annual game]] with the [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami RedHawks]].\n\nThe trophy is a replica of a keg used to ship nails. The exchange is believed to have been initiated by fraternity chapters on the UC and U of L campuses, signifying that the winning players in the game were \"tough as nails.\"\n\nThe present keg is actually a replacement for the original award, which was misplaced by Louisville, lost during some construction of office facilities. It is adorned with the logos of both schools and the scores of the series games.\n\nThe rivalry went on hiatus following the 2013 season, as Louisville moved to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] on July 1, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|title=ACC votes to add Louisville in 2014|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312052203/http://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8685541/acc-votes-add-louisville-cardinals|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pittsburgh===\n{{Main|River City Rivalry}}\nThe [[River City Rivalry]] is the name of the rivalry between Cincinnati and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]]. The rivalry itself was relatively brief, played annually from 2005, during which season the rivalry trophy was introduced. Before the rivalry was titled, the two teams played each other in 1921, 1922, 1979, and 1981. The rivalry went on hiatus, like many others throughout the country, in the aftermath of the [[2010\u201313 NCAA conference realignment]], which left the programs in separate leagues.  However, the two teams are scheduled to meet in a home-and-home series for the 2023 and 2024 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498|title=Pitt schedules home and home with Cincinnati; other notes - Pittsburgh Sporting News|date=18 June 2015|accessdate=19 June 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312204203/http://www.pittsburghsportingnews.com/pitt-schedules-home-and-home-with-cincinnati-other-notes/23498/|archivedate=12 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Paddlewheel Trophy is the rivalry trophy that was created in 2005 when the [[Cincinnati Bearcats|Bearcats]] joined the Big East Conference to which the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh Panthers]] already belonged. The trophy is designed and named in honor the historic link between the cities from the days in the 19th and early-20th centuries when [[Paddle wheel]]-powered [[Paddle steamer|boats]] traveled between the two cities along the [[Ohio River]]. \n\nThe 2009 match-up between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh was described by one national columnist as the most \"fascinating game I've ever seen.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | first=Gregg | last=Doyel | title=Cincy exits on high, Pitt crushed after fascinating game | date=2009-12-05 | publisher=CBSSports.com | accessdate=2009-12-07 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603133151/http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/12619740/cincy-exits-on-high-pitt-crushed-after-fascinating-game | archivedate=2012-06-03 }}</ref> The game functioned as a Big East championship game, with Cincinnati entering first in the conference, and Pittsburgh at second. Additionally, the Bearcats entered the game undefeated and trying to earn a spot in the [[BCS National Championship Game]], while the 9\u20132 Panthers were trying to secure their first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS bowl]] since the [[2005 Fiesta Bowl|2004]] season. The Panthers had an early 31\u201310 lead, however, the ensuing kickoff was returned for a touchdown by [[Mardy Gilyard]] to make it a 31\u201317 game at halftime. Cincinnati completed the comeback, tying the game at 38 late in the 4th quarter. Pittsburgh running back [[Dion Lewis]] scored a touchdown with 1:36 left in the game, but a mishandled snap by Andrew Janocko prevented the Panthers from converting the extra point. The Bearcats then drove down the field and scored on a 29-yard touchdown pass from [[Tony Pike]] to [[Armon Binns]] with 33 seconds left. Bearcats kicker Jake Rodgers converted the extra point attempt, and Cincinnati held on to win 45\u201344. Following the game, Cincinnati rose to a #3 ranking in the final BCS standing while Pitt dropped to #17. The game has been described as \"one of the most crushing losses in the history of Pitt football.\"<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | title=Pitt's toughest loss in decades | first=Joe | last=Starkey | newspaper=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review | date=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2009-12-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209023332/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/sports/college/s_656492.html | archivedate=2009-12-09 }}</ref>\n\n===Xavier===\n{{Main|Cincinnati\u2013Xavier rivalry#Football}}\nCincinnati and [[Xavier Musketeers football|Xavier]] would first play in 1918, but the series would not become an annual event until 1946. The game would be played each year at Cincinnati's [[Nippert Stadium]] as the venue had a larger capacity to accommodate the cross city showdown compared to Xavier's [[Corcoran Stadium]]. The series, and Xavier's football program, would come to a close after the 1973 series.

One national columnist, visiting the sold-out [[Keg of Nails]] rivalry game in 2013, described Nippert Stadium as a \"quaint bowl of angry noise sitting under the gaze of remarkable architecture\" and went on to compare it to a \"baby Death Valley\" (referring to LSU's notoriously intimidating Tiger Stadium).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Keg of Nails, where getting out is half the battle|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/12/23/5232762/louisville-cincinnati-rivalry-keg-of-nails|date=December 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170530224156/http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/12/23/5232762/louisville-cincinnati-rivalry-keg-of-nails|archivedate=2017-05-30}}</ref> In 2012, USA Today called Nippert Stadium the best football venue in what was then the Big East Conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=USA Today Names Nippert Stadium Best in Big East|url=http://louisvillesportslive.net/usa-today-names-nippert-stadium-best-in-big-east-pjcs-3rd/|date=August 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105901/http://louisvillesportslive.net/usa-today-names-nippert-stadium-best-in-big-east-pjcs-3rd/|archivedate=2016-03-04}}</ref> UC boasted a 14-game home winning streak at Nippert, during a stretch dating from 2008-2010.

{"title_page": "List of British rugby league champions", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2013}}\nThe '''British men's rugby league champions''' are the winners of the highest league in British rugby league, which since [[Super League I|1996]] is the [[Super League]]. Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew\n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20\n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During an annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.

Although the league is based in Britain, teams from Europe and North Anerica can win the league due to teams from France and Canada competing in the [[British rugby league system]].\n\nFollowing the schism in 1895 that saw 22 Northern rugby clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]], the 22 clubs were organised into [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|one league]]. At the end of the [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396 season]], [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were the first club to be crowned champions, finishing one point ahead of [[Halifax RFC|Halifax]].<ref>{{cite news\n | last =Baker\n | first =Andrew\n | title =100 years of rugby league: From the great divide to the Super era\n | newspaper = [[The Independent]]\n | date =1995-08-20\n | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/100-years-of-rugby-league-from-the-great-divide-to-the-super-era-1597130.html\n | accessdate =2009-09-25 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the success of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Unions]] first season, more clubs defected from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to join the new league. After concerns around travel and costs were expressed, the decision was made that the competition should be split into two separate county championships: Lancashire and Yorkshire Leagues. County leagues were in place for the next five seasons until 1901\u201302 were the top seven sides from each league resigned to merge to form a new league. The only other times that there was no [[Rugby Football League Championship First Division|major championship]] was when there were outbrakes of war.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 90s, [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] became the only full time professional club and dominated in every competition. A new Super League began to be mooted during the [[Super League war]] in Australia as a way for [[Rupert Murdoch]] to gain a upper hand in broadcasting supremacy with the [[Australian Rugby League]]. British clubs were approached to form a Super League with a cash insentive. Part of the deal was switching the sport to summer and the merger of some clubs, the latter not taking place due to huge protest from fans. All four Super League champions; [[St Helens RFC|St Helens]], [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]], [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] have all previously won the old [[Rugby Football League Championship First Devision|First Division]].\n\nOnly three clubs to have been crowned champions are not in existence today. During the reclassification of the Championship in 1901, the league was split into two divisions. [[Manningham FC|Manningham]] were placed in the [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]], finishing 10th out of 18 teams. At the end of the season a series of meetings was held about establishing a [[Football League]] club in the city. During a annual meeting the committee voted to switch to association football, becoming [[Bradford City]]. A similar situation occurred at [[Bradford FC]] in 1907 when a narrow majority of members voted to withdraw from the Northern Union in favour of association football, forming [[Bradford Park Avenue]]. [[Broughton Rangers]] struggled post war and folded in 1955 after a failed name change to Belle Vue Rangers in 1946.\n\n[[Hunslet FC]] were the fourth former champions to fold after financial issues[http://www.wakefieldexpress.co.uk/news/local-news/rugby-league-star-was-most-expensive-player-1-6493832], player strikes and a stadium fire that led to the club selling the land to developers before being eventually wound up. Unlike the other three clubs who no longer exist, a pheonix club, [[Hunslet RLFC|New Hunslet]] were formed in 1973 and still exist now.<ref name=hawkhist>{{cite web|url=http://www.hunslethawks.co.uk/info/history |title=History |publisher=Hunslet RFLC |accessdate=27 November 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==List==\n===RFL Championship First Division (1895\u20131996)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%\"|Year\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Champions<br />(number of titles)\n! style=\"width:18%\"|Runners-up\n! style=\"width:27%\"|Leading tryscorer<br>(club)\n! style=\"width:1%\"|Trys\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1895\u201396 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1895\u201396]]\n| {{leagueicon|Brisbane|16}} '''[[Manningham F.C.|Manningham]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} [[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Jack Hurst]] ({{leagueicon|oldham|16}} [[Oldham RLFC|Oldham]])\n|28\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"text-align: center;\" | [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896]]\u2013[[1900\u201301 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901]] [[Rugby league county leagues|County Leagues]]\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1901\u201302 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1901\u201302]]\n|  {{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} '''[[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} [[Robert Wilson (rugby league)|Rob Wilson]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|38\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1902\u201303 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1902\u201303]]\n| {{leagueicon|Halifax|16}} '''[[Halifax R.L.F.C.|Halifax]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|ENG}} Evans ({{leagueicon|Leeds|16}} [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]])\n|27\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1903\u201304 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1903\u201304]]\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} '''[[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]'''\n|  {{leagueicon|salford city|16}} [[Salford Red Devils|Salford]]\n| {{flagicon|SCO}} [[Andrew Hogg (rugby league)|Andrew Hogg]] ({{leagueicon|Cronulla|16}} [[Broughton Rangers|Broughton]])\n|34\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1904\u201305 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1904\u201305]]\n| {{leagueicon|Oldham|16}} '''[[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|Bradford|16}} [[Bradford Park Avenue A.F.C.#Rugby football|Bradford F.C.]]\n| [[James Dechan]] ([[Bradford FC]])\n|31\n|- style=\"background:#f5faff;\"\n| [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306]]\n| {{leagueicon|Leigh|16}} '''[[Leigh Centurions|Leigh]]'''\n| {{leagueicon|hunslet|16}} [[Hunslet F.C.
