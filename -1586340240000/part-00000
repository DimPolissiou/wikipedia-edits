It lies between the hills that descend and reach the Ionian Sea.\nThe district of Saranda has a plain relief which is composed of southern seashore mountains that lie from Borsh to the bay of Ftelia, Vrina Fields and the hills of Saranda, L\u00ebkur\u00ebsi, [[Ksamil]], [[Butrint]] and Konispol. All these units make up the southern part of the [[Albanian Riviera]] where the eye catches the countless bays, beaches, the rocky coastline, hills with olives and citrus, mountains that surround the landscape. Saranda is traversed by Kalasa, Bistrica and Pavlla rivers which flow in the Ionian Sea. \nIn Saranda's hydrograph belongs even Butrinti Lake which is one of the biggest sea lakes in Albania. The Butrint Lake is very rich in sea species and in their waters now are being growing mussels. Its relief, geographical location and subtropical climate create favorable conditions for planting citrus trees and olives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandhotelsaranda.com/rreth_sarandes-en.html|title=Grand Hotel Saranda|author=|date=|work=grandhotelsaranda.com}}</ref>\n\nThe present municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities [[Ksamil]] and Sarand\u00eb, that became municipal units.

It lies between the hills that descend and reach the Ionian Sea.\nThe district of Saranda has a plain relief which is composed of southern seashore mountains that lie from Borsh to the bay of Ftelia, Vrina Fields and the hills of Saranda, L\u00ebkur\u00ebsi, [[Ksamil]], [[Butrint]] and Konispol. All these units make up the southern part of the [[Albanian Riviera]] where the eye catches the countless bays, beaches, the rocky coastline, hills with olives and citrus, mountains that surround the landscape. Saranda is traversed by Kalasa, Bistrica and Pavlla rivers which flow in the Ionian Sea. \nIn Saranda's hydrograph belongs even Butrinti Lake which is one of the biggest sea lakes in Albania. The Butrint Lake is very rich in sea species and in their waters now are being growing mussels. Its relief, geographical location and subtropical climate create favorable conditions for planting citrus trees and olives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grandhotelsaranda.com/rreth_sarandes-en.html|title=Grand Hotel Saranda|author=|date=|work=grandhotelsaranda.com}}</ref>\n\nThe present municipality was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities [[Ksamil]] and Sarand\u00eb, that became municipal units.

Newcastle marched out of York on 6 December, and split his force of 6,000 into two; he took 4,000 infantry down the main York\u2013Tadcaster road to attack the town from the east, while sending a deputy, the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]], with a further 1,500 to circle around and trap the Parliamentarians by attacking from the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's infantry engaged the town on the morning of 7 December, but after some initial minor incursions, the battle settled into an exchange of [[musket]] fire. Newport's detachment never joined the battle. Fairfax was nevertheless forced to retreat overnight, as he was running short of gunpowder, and Newcastle occupied the town the following day. He subsequently garrisoned a number of nearby towns, and cut Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced into Yorkshire with around 8,000 men, defeating the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Piercebridge]], and established himself in [[York]] on 3 December.{{sfn|Hulse|2011}} Lord Fairfax had himself been leading a Parliamentarian army towards York, but when he received news of the Royalist victory at Piercebridge he stopped at [[Tadcaster]], around {{convert|10|miles}} south-west of York. Newcastle's advance had split the Parliamentarian forces, and shifted the balance of power in the county. He soon took the opportunity to march on Tadcaster and attempt to [[Defeat in detail|defeat the Parliamentarians in detail]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=133}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:William Cavendish, First Duke of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] led the Royalist force which captured Tadcaster.]]\nOn 6 December,{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} Newcastle approached Tadcaster with two forces totalling around 6,000; he commanded the larger one himself, heading directly down the road from York to attack Tadcaster from the east. At the same time, he sent the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]] with 1,500 men to circle around through [[Wetherby]] and attack Fairfax from the north-west. In the mean time, Fairfax had been preparing Tadcaster's defences: he built a [[redoubt]] atop a hill by the [[River Wharfe]] overlooking the York road, and drew in additional troops, gathering between 900 and 1,500 soldiers in the town.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} In the face of the large Royalist army, Fairfax and his commanders held a [[council of war]], and decided to withdraw from the town. However, by the time they had gathered their men to leave, fighting had broken out on the edge of town. The Royalist infantry was attacking the east side of town, still defended by the Parliamentarian rearguard. The attack meant that retreat was no longer possible, and Fairfax sent his men back to join the town's defence.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe initial Royalist attack was thwarted, but more of Newcastle's infantry managed to break into the town and capture a house near the redoubt, isolating it from the bulk of the defensive garrison. A Parliamentarian counter-attack reclaimed the house, drove the Royalists back out of town, and set fire to some of the houses on the edge of the town to prevent the attackers occupying them. Both sides settled into their positions, and exchanged [[musket]] fire for the rest of the day. The planned second prong of Newcastle's attack, under Newport's command, never arrived. The historian David Cooke suggests that it was most likely due to his artillery slowing him down on the poor winter roads. The 18th-century historian [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] claimed that one of the Parliamentarian officers, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], forged a letter to Newport, purporting to be from Newcastle, ordering him to halt.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe Parliamentarians, despite holding a defensible position, were running short of gunpowder, and decided to withdraw from the town overnight.

Newcastle marched out of York on 6 December, and split his force of 6,000 into two; he took 4,000 infantry down the main York\u2013Tadcaster road to attack the town from the east, while sending a deputy, the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]], with a further 1,500 to circle around and trap the Parliamentarians by attacking from the north-west.\n\nNewcastle's infantry engaged the town on the morning of 7 December, but after some initial minor incursions, the battle settled into an exchange of [[musket]] fire. Newport's detachment never joined the battle. Fairfax was nevertheless forced to retreat overnight, as he was running short of gunpowder, and Newcastle occupied the town the following day. He subsequently garrisoned a number of nearby towns, and cut Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1642, the [[First English Civil War]] had been running for four months, since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] had raised his banner in Nottingham and declared the Earl of Essex, and by extension [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], traitors.{{sfn|Bennett|2005|p=xii}} That action had been the culmination of religious, fiscal and legislative tensions going back over fifty years.{{sfn|Bleiberg|Soergel|2005|p=344\u2013348}}\n\n===State of the war in Yorkshire===\nEven before the formal start of the war, [[Yorkshire]] became a key area in the conflict. After King Charles I attempted to [[Five Members|arrest five members of parliament]] in January 1642, members of the [[gentry]] started openly taking sides and preparing for battle. [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|Sir John Hotham]] seized [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] for parliament the same month, and after fleeing London, the King established himself at [[York]] in March. The King twice attempted to take Hull in 1642 without success. Although Charles subsequently returned south, his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] (formally known as Queen Mary) had travelled to the [[Low Countries]] to acquire weapons and the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] was charged with ensuring her safe travel through the northeast when she returned.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=128\u2013133}} On the other side, [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Ferdinando Fairfax, Lord Fairfax]], was appointed as the commander of parliament's forces in Yorkshire.<ref>{{cite odnb |id=9081 |title=Fairfax, Ferdinando, second Lord Fairfax of Cameron |last=Hopper |first=Andrew J. |year=2008 |origyear=2004}}</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nIn response to requests from Yorkshire Royalists, Newcastle advanced into Yorkshire with around 8,000 men, defeating the Parliamentarians at the [[Battle of Piercebridge]], and established himself in [[York]] on 3 December.{{sfn|Hulse|2011}} Lord Fairfax had himself been leading a Parliamentarian army towards York, but when he received news of the Royalist victory at Piercebridge he stopped at [[Tadcaster]], around {{convert|10|miles}} south-west of York. Newcastle's advance had split the Parliamentarian forces, and shifted the balance of power in the county. He soon took the opportunity to march on Tadcaster and attempt to [[Defeat in detail|defeat the Parliamentarians in detail]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=133}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:William Cavendish, First Duke of Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|The [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]] led the Royalist force which captured Tadcaster.]]\nOn 6 December, Newcastle approached Tadcaster with two forces totalling around 6,000; he commanded the larger one himself, heading directly down the road from York to attack Tadcaster from the east. At the same time, he sent the [[Mountjoy Blount, 1st Earl of Newport|Earl of Newport]] with 1,500 men to circle around through [[Wetherby]] and attack Fairfax from the north-west. In the mean time, Fairfax had been preparing Tadcaster's defences: he built a [[redoubt]] atop a hill by the [[River Wharfe]] overlooking the York road, and drew in additional troops, gathering between 900 and 1,500 soldiers in the town.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|pp=136\u2013137}}{{sfn|Manganiello|2004|p=524}} In the face of the large Royalist army, Fairfax and his commanders held a [[council of war]], and decided to withdraw from the town. However, by the time they had gathered their men to leave, fighting had broken out on the edge of town. The Royalist infantry was attacking the east side of town, still defended by the Parliamentarian rearguard. The attack meant that retreat was no longer possible, and Fairfax sent his men back to join the town's defence.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe initial Royalist attack was thwarted, but more of Newcastle's infantry managed to break into the town and capture a house near the redoubt, isolating it from the bulk of the defensive garrison. A Parliamentarian counter-attack reclaimed the house, drove the Royalists back out of town, and set fire to some of the houses on the edge of the town to prevent the attackers occupying them. Both sides settled into their positions, and exchanged [[musket]] fire for the rest of the day. The planned second prong of Newcastle's attack, under Newport's command, never arrived. The historian David Cooke suggests that it was most likely due to his artillery slowing him down on the poor winter roads. The 18th-century historian [[Francis Drake (antiquary)|Francis Drake]] claimed that one of the Parliamentarian officers, [[John Hotham, the younger|Captain John Hotham]], forged a letter to Newport, purporting to be from Newcastle, ordering him to halt.{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\nThe Parliamentarians, despite holding a defensible position, were running short of gunpowder, and decided to withdraw from the town overnight. They split their force; Fairfax took his men to [[Selby]], and Hotham to [[Cawood]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the town had been vacated by the Parliamentarians, Newcastle advanced his forces into it on the morning of 8 December, subsequently garrisoning [[Pontefract Castle]] and a number of other towns in the area, cutting Fairfax off from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].{{sfn|Cooke|2006|p=137}} He sent [[Sir William Savile, 3rd Baronet|Sir William Savile]] with a detachment of 2,000 men to secure the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]] towns of Leeds, [[Wakefield]] and [[Bradford]].{{sfn|Firth|Cavendish|1886|p=32}} Savile took Leeds and Wakefield without a fight, but had to split off a portion of his force to attempt to capture Bradford on 18 December, where he was repelled.{{sfn|Lamplough|2019|p=118}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hNSEAgAAQBAJ |title=The Civil Wars Experienced: Britain and Ireland, 1638\u20131661 |last=Bennett |first=Martyn |year=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=London |isbn=0-203-98180-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/artshumanitiesth00edwa |chapter=The English Civil Wars |title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras |volume=5: The Age of the Baroque and Enlightenment 1600\u20131800 |editor1-last=Bleiberg |editor1-first=Edward |editor2-last=Soergel |editor2-first=Philip |collaboration=true |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |year=2005 |location=Detroit |isbn=978-0-787-65697-3 |ref=harv |chapter-url-access=registration }}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Cooke |first=David |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ehvOAwAAQBAJ |title=Battlefield Yorkshire: From the Romans to the English Civil Wars |location=Barnsley |publisher=Pen & Sword Military |year=2006 |isbn=1-84415-424-6}}\n* {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hl4JAAAAQAAJ |title=The Life of William Cavendish, Duke of Newcastle |last1=Firth |first1=C.

The basement housed [[Village Barn#The Village Barn nightclub|The Village Barn nightclub]] from 1930 to 1967. Abstract expressionist artist [[Hans Hofmann]] began lecturing there in 1938, eventually retiring from teaching in 1958 to paint full-time.\n\nIn 1968, [[Jimi Hendrix]] and his manager Michael Jeffery bought a newly defunct nightclub called The Generation in New York's Greenwich Village\u2014a venue that Hendrix had frequented for impromptu performances and late-night jam sessions. The Generation had been known for live acts as diverse and legendary as [[Big Brother and the Holding Company|Big Brother & the Holding Company]], [[B.B. King]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], [[Sly & the Family Stone]], and [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]]. Instead of renaming the club and continuing with the live venue business model (Hendrix's original vision for the project), advisors [[Eddie Kramer]] and [[Bearsville Studios|Jim Marron]] convinced Hendrix to convert the space into a professional recording studio, as studio fees for the lengthy ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' sessions were astronomical, and Hendrix was constantly in search of a recording environment that suited him. Architect and [[acoustician]] [[John Storyk]] designed each structural detail, and from there Electric Lady Studios were born. It was the only artist-owned recording studio in existence at the time.\n\n[[File:ElectricLadyStudioA.jpg|thumb|right|Studio A in 2014]]\n\nConstruction of the studio took nearly double the amount of time and money planned: permits were delayed numerous times, the site flooded due to heavy rains during demolition, and [[sump pump]]s had to be installed (then soundproofed) after it was determined that the building sat on the tributary of an underground river, [[Minetta Creek]].<ref>Chris Potash, ''The Jimi Hendrix Companion: Three Decades of Commentary'' (New York: Schirmer Books, 1996), p. 94.</ref> A six-figure loan from [[Warner Brothers]] was required to save the project.\n\nThe studio was made specifically for Hendrix, with round windows and a machine capable of generating ambient lighting in myriad colors. It was designed to have a relaxing feel to encourage Hendrix's creativity, but at the same time provide a professional recording atmosphere. Engineer Kramer upheld this by refusing to allow any drug use during session work.

In 1832, White was given the title of General (possibly after services rendered during the [[War of 1812]]), which allowed him to explore the western Lake Erie region. In realizing the potential of some available land to the north of [[Maumee, Ohio]], a notable port city at the time, he acquired a title to the land and built a log cabin at what would eventually be the corner of Summit and Monroe streets near downtown Sylvania.<ref>Cosgrobe, pp. 10-11</ref><ref>Scribner, pp. 893-894</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofsylvania.com/visitors/sylvania-history/early-sylvania/|title=A Brief History of Sylvania|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Sylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403200951/https://www.cityofsylvania.com/visitors/sylvania-history/early-sylvania/|archive-date=2019-04-03|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n\nPrior to White's acquisition, the land was a part of Port Lawrence Township, Monroe County, Michigan. Over the course of several years, White, along with his associate, Judge William Wilson, purchased a total of 1,920 acres of Port Lawrence and surrounding land in what would eventually become Sylvania, and 1,720 acres of what would become [[Whiteford Township, Michigan]], where he also served as the first town supervisor. The relationship between White and Wilson did not last, and when the boundary dispute that lead to the largely bloodless [[Toledo War]] began in 1834, they began splitting the lands they had purchased, platting their own towns. That year, White established the first area school in Whiteford, and [[plat]]ted the township there one year later in 1835. Wilson presented the original plat for Sylvania in June 1836, with the town of Whiteford directly adjacent.<ref>Scribner, p. 185,893</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the 1830s and 1840s, rail transportation saw significant expansion throughout the [[Great Lakes region]].

This owing to the dense forests that once made up the region,  part of the [[Great Black Swamp]].<ref>Scribner, pp. 181</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sylvania Historical Village - Railroad Depot.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The original Sylvania railroad depot, along the Erie & Kalamazoo Railroad, now part of the Sylvania Historical Village]]\nGeneral David White is considered the founder of Sylvania as the first pioneer settler and town supervisor, originally from [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]]. In 1832, White was given the title of General (possibly after services rendered during the [[War of 1812]]), which allowed him to explore the western Lake Erie region. In realizing the potential of some available land to the north of [[Maumee, Ohio]], a notable port city at the time, he acquired a title to the land and built a log cabin at what would eventually be the corner of Summit and Monroe streets near downtown Sylvania.<ref>Cosgrobe, pp. 10-11</ref><ref>Scribner, pp. 893-894</ref><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cityofsylvania.com/visitors/sylvania-history/early-sylvania/|title=A Brief History of Sylvania|last=|first=|date=|website=City of Sylvania|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403200951/https://www.cityofsylvania.com/visitors/sylvania-history/early-sylvania/|archive-date=2019-04-03|access-date=2019-10-27}}</ref>\n\nPrior to White's acquisition, the land was a part of Port Lawrence Township, Monroe County, Michigan. Over the course of several years, White, along with his associate, Judge William Wilson, purchased a total of 1,920 acres of Port Lawrence and surrounding land in what would eventually become Sylvania, and 1,720 acres of what would become [[Whiteford Township, Michigan]], where he also served as the first town supervisor. The relationship between White and Wilson did not last, and when the boundary dispute that lead to the largely bloodless [[Toledo War]] began in 1834, they began splitting the lands they had purchased, platting their own towns. That year, White established the first area school in Whiteford, and [[plat]]ted the township there one year later in 1835. Wilson presented the original plat for Sylvania in June 1836, with the town of Whiteford directly adjacent.<ref>Scribner, p. 185,893</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThroughout the 1830s and 1840s, rail transportation saw significant expansion throughout the [[Great Lakes region]].

According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism\u2026 Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South\u2026 This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double \u201carchaeological miracle\u201d: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite news |title=Significance of Mayiladuthurai find |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |accessdate=2 April 2016 |work=The Hindu |date=1 May 2006 |language=en-IN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101032334/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=T|first1=Saravanan|title=How a recent archaeological discovery throws light on the history of Tamil script|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/10th-century-ce-oil-press-discovered-near-andipatti-with-a-tamil-script/article22814589.ece|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= the eternal harappan script |url= http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |access-date= 24 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190324134658/http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |archive-date= 24 March 2019 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sangam period (500 BCE \u2013 300 CE) ===\n{{Main|Sangam period|Tamilakam|Sangam landscape}}\n[[File:KeeladiExcavationCamp8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Keeladi excavation site|Keeladi]], a Sangam Era Excavation Site, [[Sangam period]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keezhadi-excavation-the-story-till-now/article18464920.ece|title=Keezhadi excavation leads to ancient civilisation on the banks of Vaigai|date=16 May 2017|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu|last2=Sundar|first2=S.|last3=Sundar|first3=S.|last4=Jesudasan|first4=Dennis S.|last5=Jesudasan|first5=Dennis S.|last6=Jesudasan|first6=Dennis S.|last7=Jesudasan|first7=Dennis S.|last8=Shrikumar|first8=A.|last9=Shrikumar|first9=A.|last10=S|first10=Mohamed Imranullah|last11=S|first11=Mohamed Imranullah|last14=b. a|first14=Pon Vasanth|last15=b. a|first15=Pon Vasanth|last16=Kolappan|first16=B.|last17=Kolappan|first17=B.|last18=Kolappan|first18=B.|last19=Kolappan|first19=B.|last20=Saravanan|first20=T.|last21=Saravanan|first21=T.|last22=Annamalai|first22=S.|last23=Annamalai|first23=S.|last24=Shrikumar|first24=A.|last25=Shrikumar|first25=A.|last26=Annamalai|first26=S.|last27=Annamalai|first27=S.|last28=Annamalai|first28=S.|last29=Annamalai|first29=S.|last1=Kavitha|first1=S.

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.\n\n[[File:Fort Dansborg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fort Dansborg]] at [[Tharangambadi]] built by the [[Danes|Danish]]]]\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions.

The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] which is the meeting point of the [[Arabian Sea]], the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe western, southern and the northwestern parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]] meet at the [[Nilgiri hills]]. The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state.

Chief Secretariat of the government of Tamil Nadu.]]\n\n=== Pre-Independence ===\nPrior to Indian independence Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the [[Madras Presidency]]. The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.\n\nThe Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was recommended by then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G. Ramachandran founded the new dravidan party [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) named after his political mentor C. N. Annadurai popularly called \"Anna\".\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n| align = right\n| region =collapsed\n| 1951| 30119000\n| 1961| 33687000\n| 1971| 41199000\n| 1981| 48408000\n| 1991| 55859000\n| 2001| 62406000\n| 2011| 72138958\n| footnote=Source:Census of India{{sfn|Census population|2011}}\n}}\n{{Main|Demographics of Tamil Nadu}}\nTamil Nadu is the seventh most populous state in India. 48.4 per cent of the state's population live in urban areas, the third highest percentage among large [[States and union territories of India|states in India]].

According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism\u2026 Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South\u2026 This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double \u201carchaeological miracle\u201d: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite news |title=Significance of Mayiladuthurai find |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |accessdate=2 April 2016 |work=The Hindu |date=1 May 2006 |language=en-IN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101032334/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=T|first1=Saravanan|title=How a recent archaeological discovery throws light on the history of Tamil script|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/10th-century-ce-oil-press-discovered-near-andipatti-with-a-tamil-script/article22814589.ece|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= the eternal harappan script |url= http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |access-date= 24 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190324134658/http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |archive-date= 24 March 2019 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sangam period (500 BCE \u2013 300 CE) ===\n{{Main|Sangam period|Tamilakam|Sangam landscape}}\n[[File:KeeladiExcavationCamp8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Keeladi excavation site|Keeladi]], a Sangam Era Excavation Site, [[Sangam period]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keezhadi-excavation-the-story-till-now/article18464920.ece|title=Keezhadi excavation leads to ancient civilisation on the banks of Vaigai|date=16 May 2017|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu|last2=Sundar|first2=S.|last3=Sundar|first3=S.|last4=Jesudasan|first4=Dennis S.|last5=Jesudasan|first5=Dennis S.|last6=Jesudasan|first6=Dennis S.|last7=Jesudasan|first7=Dennis S.|last8=Shrikumar|first8=A.|last9=Shrikumar|first9=A.|last10=S|first10=Mohamed Imranullah|last11=S|first11=Mohamed Imranullah|last14=b. a|first14=Pon Vasanth|last15=b. a|first15=Pon Vasanth|last16=Kolappan|first16=B.|last17=Kolappan|first17=B.|last18=Kolappan|first18=B.|last19=Kolappan|first19=B.|last20=Saravanan|first20=T.|last21=Saravanan|first21=T.|last22=Annamalai|first22=S.|last23=Annamalai|first23=S.|last24=Shrikumar|first24=A.|last25=Shrikumar|first25=A.|last26=Annamalai|first26=S.|last27=Annamalai|first27=S.|last28=Annamalai|first28=S.|last29=Annamalai|first29=S.|last1=Kavitha|first1=S.

These are the earliest specimen of Dravidian temples under the Cholas. His son Aditya I built several temples around the Kanchi and Kumbakonam regions. The Cholas went on to becoming a great power and built some of the most imposing religious structures in their lifetime and they also renovated temples and buildings of the [[Pallavas]], acknowledging their common socio-religious and cultural heritage. The celebrated [[Nataraja]] temple at [[Chidambaram]] and the [[Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam|Sri Ranganathaswami Temple]] at [[Srirangam]] held special significance for the Cholas which have been mentioned in their inscriptions as their tutelary deities. [[Rajaraja Chola I]] and his son [[Rajendra Chola]] built temples such as the [[Brihadeshvara Temple]] of Thanjavur and Brihadeshvara Temple of [[Gangaikonda Cholapuram]], the [[Airavatesvara Temple]] of [[Darasuram]] and the [[Sarabeswara]] (Shiva) Temple, also called the Kampahareswarar Temple at [[Thirubuvanam|Thirubhuvanam]], the last two temples being located near Kumbakonam.

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.\n\n[[File:Fort Dansborg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fort Dansborg]] at [[Tharangambadi]] built by the [[Danes|Danish]]]]\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions.

Chief Secretariat of the government of Tamil Nadu.]]\n\n=== Pre-Independence ===\nPrior to Indian independence Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the [[Madras Presidency]]. The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.\n\nThe Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was recommended by then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G. Ramachandran founded the new dravidan party [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) named after his political mentor C. N. Annadurai popularly called \"Anna\".\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Historical populations\n| align = right\n| region =collapsed\n| 1951| 30119000\n| 1961| 33687000\n| 1971| 41199000\n| 1981| 48408000\n| 1991| 55859000\n| 2001| 62406000\n| 2011| 72138958\n| footnote=Source:Census of India{{sfn|Census population|2011}}\n}}\n{{Main|Demographics of Tamil Nadu}}\nTamil Nadu is the seventh most populous state in India. 48.4 per cent of the state's population live in urban areas, the third highest percentage among large [[States and union territories of India|states in India]].

Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in [[mineral]]s and partly covered by the [[Central Canadian Shield forests|Central]] and [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]], studded with lakes and rivers. [[Northern Ontario]] is subdivided into two sub-regions: [[Northwestern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]].\n* The virtually unpopulated [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested.\n* [[Southern Ontario]] which is further sub-divided into four regions: [[Central Ontario]] (although not actually the province's geographic centre), [[Eastern Ontario]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[Southwestern Ontario]] (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario).\n\nDespite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the [[Niagara Escarpment]] which crosses the south. The highest point is [[Ishpatina Ridge]] at {{convert|693|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] in [[Temagami]], Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]] in [[Renfrew County]].\n\nThe [[Carolinian forest]] zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]] where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is [[Niagara Falls]], part of the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows navigation to and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as far inland as [[Thunder Bay]] in Northwestern Ontario. [[Northern Ontario]] covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population.\n\n[[Point Pelee National Park|Point Pelee]] is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland. [[Pelee, Ontario|Pelee Island]] and [[Middle Island (Lake Erie)|Middle Island]] in Lake Erie extend slightly farther.

Ontario had a record 29 tornadoes in both 2006 and 2009. [[Tropical cyclone|Tropical depression]] remnants occasionally bring heavy rains and winds in the south, but are rarely deadly.

The Mississaugas, displaced by European settlements, would later move to Six Nations also.\n\nThe population of Canada west of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence substantially increased during this period, a fact recognized by the [[Constitutional Act 1791|''Constitutional Act'' of 1791]], which split Quebec into [[the Canadas]]: [[Upper Canada]] southwest of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, and [[Lower Canada]] east of it.

[[Upper Canada]] was an active theatre of operation during the conflict.]]\nAmerican troops in the [[War of 1812]] invaded Upper Canada across the [[Niagara River]] and the [[Detroit River]], but were defeated and pushed back by the British, Canadian [[fencibles]] and militias, and [[First Nations]] warriors. However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 [[Battle of York]] saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of [[York, Upper Canada|York]]. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would [[Burning of Washington|burn]] the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied [[Hydropower|water power]] for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454|title=ARCHIVED \u2013 People \u2013 Virtual Vault \u2013 Library and Archives Canada|website=Collectionscanada.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321204831/http://collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?phpsessid=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454&q1=people|archivedate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Montgomery's Tavern.jpg|thumb|In 1837, an [[Upper Canada Rebellion|armed insurrection]] was fought in the colony, before being crushed by British authorities and Canadian volunteer units.]]\nUnrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic [[Family Compact]] who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early [[Canadian nationalism]]. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of [[responsible government]] rose in both regions; [[Louis-Joseph Papineau]] led the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] and [[William Lyon Mackenzie]], first [[Toronto]] [[mayor]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography \u2013 MACKENZIE, WILLIAM LYON \u2013 Volume IX (1861\u20131870) |website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mackenzie_william_lyon_9E.html }}</ref> led the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]].

In 1841, the two colonies were united to form the [[Province of Canada]].]]\nAlthough both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the causes. He recommended self-government be granted and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the [[French Canadians]]. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', with the capital at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], and Upper Canada becoming known as [[Province of Canada|Canada West]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada West \u2013 historical region, Canada |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada-West |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> Parliamentary [[Self-governance|self-government]] was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of [[Canada East]], tilting the representative balance of power.\n\nAn economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously.\n\nA political stalemate between the [[Canadian French|French]]- and [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the [[American Civil War]], led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all [[British North America]]n colonies. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the ''British North America Act'' to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of Protestant and the Catholic minority. Thus, separate Catholic schools and [[board of education|school boards]] were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.\n\n=== Provincehood ===\n[[File:Oliver Mowat.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Oliver Mowat]], [[Premier of Ontario]] from 1872 to 1896]]\nOnce constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer [[Oliver Mowat]] became [[Premier of Ontario]] and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly [[Decentralization|decentralized]] Canada, giving the provinces far more power than [[John A. Macdonald]] had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the [[District of Keewatin]]) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889''. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called ''Empire Ontario''.\n\nBeginning with Sir John A. Macdonald's [[National Policy]] (1879) and the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1875\u20131885) through Northern Ontario and the [[Canadian Prairies]] to [[British Columbia]], Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.\n\n[[Mineral]] exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Timmins]]. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later [[Ontario Hydro]]. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]] was established in 1904. [[General Motors Canada]] was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.\n\nIn July 1912, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of Sir [[James Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the \"Prussians of Ontario\". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927.\n[[File:Raid at elk lake.jpg|thumb|Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in [[James, Ontario|Elk Lake]] in an effort to enforce [[prohibition]]. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916, and were not repealed until 1927.]]\nInfluenced by events in the United States, the government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] introduced [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the ''[[Ontario Temperance Act]]''. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] under the government of [[Howard Ferguson]]. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament [[Kim Craitor]] suggested local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]].\n\nThe post-[[World War II]] period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal [[immigration law]], a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely [[ethnic group|ethnically]] British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse.\n[[File:Immigrant Family Toronto.jpg|left|thumb|A monument commemorating the immigrant family in [[Toronto]]. The province saw a large number of migrants settle in Ontario in the decades following [[World War II]].]]\nThe nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed [[Montreal]] as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. {{citation needed|reason=it's not clear that many businesses were driven away to Ontario, and it's not clear that this led to Toronto becoming the largest city.

[[Rupert's Land]], defined as the drainage basin of [[Hudson Bay]], was claimed by Britain, and included much of today's Northern Ontario. The British defeated the armies of the French colony and its indigenous allies in the [[French and Indian War]], part of the [[Seven Years' War]] global conflict. Concluding the war, the peace treaty between the European powers, known as the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]], assigned almost all of France's possessions in North America to Britain, including parts that would later become Ontario not already part of Rupert's Land. Britain established the first [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], encompassing contemporary Quebec and southern Ontario.\n\nAfter the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]] (1784), [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]] (1793) and [[Akwesasne]] (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 [[Jay Treaty]].\n\nIn 1788, while part of the Province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four [[District#Ontario|districts]]: [[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse]], [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburg]], [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg]], and [[Home District|Nassau]]. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.\n\nBy 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, [[Johnstown District, Upper Canada|Johnstown]], [[London District, Upper Canada|London]], Midland, [[Newcastle District|Newcastle]], [[Niagara District|Niagara]], and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: [[Bathurst District|Bathurst]], Eastern, [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore]], Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, [[Ottawa District|Ottawa]], and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, [[Dalhousie District|Dalhousie]], Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]], Talbot, Victoria, [[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]], and Western.\n\nIn 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the [[Province of Canada]], and [[county]] governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating ''districts'' in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of [[Algoma District]] and [[Nipissing District]] in 1858.\n[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|alt=When Canada was formed in 1867 its provinces were a relatively narrow strip in the southeast, with vast territories in the interior. It grew by adding British Columbia in 1871, P.E.I. in 1873, the British Arctic Islands in 1880, and Newfoundland in 1949; meanwhile, its provinces grew both in size and number at the expense of its territories.|Evolution of the borders of Ontario since the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867]]\nThe borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the [[51st parallel north]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Report on the Boundaries of the Province of Ontario |author=Mills, David |publisher=Hunter, Rose & Co. |location=Toronto |page=347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |year=1877 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107091048/http://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=November 7, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThe northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after [[Canadian Confederation]]. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1884 and confirmed by the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889'' of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Districts and Counties 1788\u20131899 |publisher=Archives of Ontario |date=September 5, 2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130162533/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |archivedate=January 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Ontario}}\n[[File:Canada Ontario Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of Ontario]]\n{{Graph:Chart\n | width = 200\n | height= 130\n | type = line\n | interpolate = \n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | yAxisTitle = Population\n | yGrid = yes\n | linewidth = 2\n | x = 1824, 1830, 1840, 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1975, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016\n | y = 150066, 213156, 432159, 952004, 1396091, 1620851, 1926922, 2114321, 2182947, 2527292, 2933662, 3431683, 3787655, 4597542, 5404933, 6236092, 6960870, 7703105, 8264465, 8625107, 9101695, 10084885, 10753573, 11410046, 12160282, 12851821, 13448494,\n | colors = #c8102e\n}}\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Historical populations\n|type = Canada\n|align = right\n|width =\n|state =\n|shading =\n|percentages =\n|footnote = Source: [[Statistics Canada]]\n|1851|952004\n|1861|1396091\n|1871|1620851\n|1881|1926922\n|1891|2114321\n|1901|2182947\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2527292\n|1921|2933662\n|1931|3431683\n|1941|3787655\n|1951|4597542\n|1956|5404933\n|1961|6236092\n|1966|6960870\n|1971|7703105\n|1976|8264465\n|1981|8625107\n|1986|9101695\n|1991|10084885\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|10753573\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|11410046\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|12160282\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|12851821\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|13448494\n}}\n\nIn the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Ontario had a population of 13,448,494 living in 5,169,174 of its 5,598,391 total dwellings, a 4.6 percent change from its 2011 population of 12,851,821.

The Progressive Conservatives, Liberals and New Democrats have each governed the province, while the Greens elected their first-ever member to the Legislative Assembly in 2018.\n\nThe [[2018 Ontario general election|2018 provincial election]] resulted in a Progressive Conservative majority under [[Doug Ford]], who was sworn in to office on June 29.\n\n=== Urban areas ===\n{{See also|Golden Horseshoe|National Capital Region (Canada)|Detroit\u2013Windsor}}\nStatistics Canada's measure of a \"metro area\", the [[Census Metropolitan Area]] (CMA), roughly bundles together population figures from the core municipality with those from \"commuter\" municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada, provinces and territories, census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2006 and 2001 censuses \u2013 100% data|publisher=Statistics Canada|date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=April 1, 2009|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=202&PR=35&S=0&O=A&RPP=50|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504145258/http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=202&PR=35&S=0&O=A&RPP=50|archivedate=May 4, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!CMA (largest other included municipalities in brackets)\n!2001\n!2006\n!2011\n!2016\n!% Change\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Greater Toronto Area|Toronto]] CMA ([[Mississauga]], [[Brampton]])\n|4,682,897&nbsp;\n|5,113,149&nbsp;\n|5,583,064&nbsp;\n|5,928,040\n|6.2\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[National Capital Region (Canada)|Ottawa]] CMA ([[Gatineau]], [[Clarence-Rockland]])\n|1,067,800&nbsp;\n|1,130,761&nbsp;\n|1,254,919 \n|1,323,783\n|4.4\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] CMA ([[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]], [[Grimsby, Ontario|Grimsby]])\n|662,401&nbsp;\n|692,911&nbsp;\n|721,053&nbsp;\n|747,545\n|3.7\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] CMA ([[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]])\n|414,284&nbsp;\n|451,235&nbsp;\n|496,383 \n|523,894\n|5.5\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[London, Ontario|London]] CMA ([[St. Thomas, Ontario|St. Thomas]], [[Strathroy-Caradoc]])\n|435,600&nbsp;\n|457,720&nbsp;\n|474,786&nbsp;\n|494,069\n|4.1\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[St. Catharines]] CMA ([[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]], [[Welland]])\n|377,009&nbsp;\n|390,317&nbsp;\n|392,184&nbsp;\n|406,074\n|3.5\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Oshawa]] CMA ([[Whitby, Ontario|Whitby]], [[Clarington]])\n|296,298&nbsp;\n|330,594&nbsp;\n|356,177&nbsp;\n|379,848\n|6.6\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] CMA ([[Lakeshore, Ontario|Lakeshore]], [[LaSalle, Ontario|LaSalle]])\n|307,877&nbsp;\n|323,342&nbsp;\n|319,246&nbsp;\n|329,144\n|3.1\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Barrie]] CMA ([[Innisfil]], [[Springwater, Ontario|Springwater]])\n|148,480&nbsp;\n|177,061&nbsp;\n|187,013&nbsp;\n|197,059\n|5.4\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] CMA ([[Whitefish Lake 6, Ontario|Whitefish Lake]], [[Wahnapitae First Nation|Wanapitei Reserve]])\n|155,601&nbsp;\n|158,258&nbsp;\n|160,770&nbsp;\n|164,689\n|1.0\n|- style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|style=\"text-align:left;\" |[[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] CMA\n|146,838&nbsp;\n|152,358&nbsp;\n|159,561&nbsp;\n|161,175\n|1.0\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Parts of Quebec (including [[Gatineau]]) are included in the Ottawa CMA.

While application services are centralized, admission and selection processes vary and are the purview of each institution.

Ontario has two major east\u2013west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was a major [[fur trade]] route, travels west from Montreal along the [[Ottawa River]], then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other European immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Belleville, Peterborough, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Kitchener-Waterloo]], Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century.\n\n=== Air travel ===\n[[File:Thunder Bay Airport 1.JPG|thumb|[[Thunder Bay International Airport]] is one of five [[international airport]]s operating in Ontario.]]\nImportant airports in the province include [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], which is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|busiest airport in Canada]],<ref name=\"move\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2014001/t002-eng.htm |title=Total aircraft movements by class of operation \u2013 NAV CANADA towers |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218021721/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2014001/t002-eng.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2014  }}</ref> handling nearly 50 million passengers in 2018.<ref name=15DecPax>{{cite web |title=Toronto Pearson (Enplaned + Deplaned) Passengers |url=http://www.torontopearson.com/uploadedFiles/GTAA/Content/About_GTAA/Statistics/PassengerTraffic_Dec2015.pdf |publisher=GTAA |date=February 8, 2016 |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216160722/http://www.torontopearson.com/uploadedFiles/GTAA/Content/About_GTAA/Statistics/PassengerTraffic_Dec2015.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2016 }}</ref> [[Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport]] is Ontario's second largest airport. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being [[Montr\u00e9al\u2013Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]). In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates three other international airports, the [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] in Hamilton, the [[Thunder Bay International Airport]] in Thunder Bay and the [[London International Airport]] in London. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport serves as cargo hub, reliever for Pearson, and a hub for ULCC [[Swoop (airline)|Swoop]].\n\nMost Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from [[Air Canada Jazz]] or smaller airlines and charter companies&nbsp;\u2013 flights from the mid-size cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. [[Bearskin Airlines]] also runs flights along the northerly east\u2013west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly.\n\nIsolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on [[airline|air service]] for travel, goods, and even [[air ambulance|ambulance]] services ([[Medical evacuation|MEDIVAC]]), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail.\n\n=== Railways ===\n[[Via Rail]] operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor]], along with ''[[Canadian (train)|The Canadian]]'', a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to [[Vancouver]], and the [[Sudbury\u2013White River train]]. Additionally, [[Amtrak]] rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[New York City]]. [[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] provides rail service to destinations as far north as [[Moosonee]] near [[James Bay]], connecting them with the south.\n\n[[Rail freight transport|Freight rail]] is dominated by the founding cross-country [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP Rail]] companies, which during the 1990s sold many [[Shortline railroad|short rail lines]] from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south.\n\nRegional [[commuter rail]] is limited to the provincially owned [[GO Transit]], and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in Toronto serving as the [[transport hub]].\n\nThere are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] operates province's only metro system, the [[Toronto subway|subway]], and one of the busiest [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] systems in North America. [[OC Transpo]] operates a  [[O-Train|light rail]] metro system in Ottawa. In addition, [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo region]] operates a surface [[light rail]] system. Plans to build a light rail line is also underway in the [[Regional Municipality of Peel]].\n{{wide image|Ontario Northland train crosses the Missinaibi River at Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9, Ontario.jpg|880px|alt=[[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] freight train crossing the [[Missinaibi River]] at [[Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9]] in [[Northern Ontario]]|[[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] freight train crossing the [[Missinaibi River]] at [[Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9]] in [[Northern Ontario]]}}\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Roads in Ontario}}\n[[File:Highway 400 Seguin.jpg|thumb|[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] in [[Seguin, Ontario|Seguin]].

Although this area mostly does not support agriculture, it is rich in [[mineral]]s and partly covered by the [[Central Canadian Shield forests|Central]] and [[Midwestern Canadian Shield forests]], studded with lakes and rivers. [[Northern Ontario]] is subdivided into two sub-regions: [[Northwestern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]].\n* The virtually unpopulated [[Hudson Bay Lowlands]] in the extreme north and northeast, mainly swampy and sparsely forested.\n* [[Southern Ontario]] which is further sub-divided into four regions: [[Central Ontario]] (although not actually the province's geographic centre), [[Eastern Ontario]], [[Golden Horseshoe]] and [[Southwestern Ontario]] (parts of which were formerly referred to as Western Ontario).\n\nDespite the absence of any mountainous terrain in the province, there are large areas of uplands, particularly within the Canadian Shield which traverses the province from northwest to southeast and also above the [[Niagara Escarpment]] which crosses the south. The highest point is [[Ishpatina Ridge]] at {{convert|693|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] in [[Temagami]], Northeastern Ontario. In the south, elevations of over {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} are surpassed near Collingwood, above the Blue Mountains in the Dundalk Highlands and in hilltops near the [[Madawaska River (Ontario)|Madawaska River]] in [[Renfrew County]].\n\nThe [[Carolinian forest]] zone covers most of the southwestern region of the province. The temperate and fertile Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence Valley in the south is part of the [[Eastern Great Lakes lowland forests]] [[ecoregion]] where the forest has now been largely replaced by agriculture, industrial and urban development. A well-known geographic feature is [[Niagara Falls]], part of the [[Niagara Escarpment]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] allows navigation to and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] as far inland as [[Thunder Bay]] in Northwestern Ontario. [[Northern Ontario]] covers approximately 87% of the province's surface area; conversely Southern Ontario contains 94% of the population.\n\n[[Point Pelee National Park|Point Pelee]] is a peninsula of Lake Erie in southwestern Ontario (near [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]) that is the southernmost extent of Canada's mainland.

However, the Americans eventually gained control of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. The 1813 [[Battle of York]] saw American troops defeat the garrison at the Upper Canada capital of [[York, Upper Canada|York]]. The Americans looted the town and burned the Upper Canada Parliament Buildings during their brief occupation. The British would [[Burning of Washington|burn]] the American capital of Washington, D.C. in 1814.\n\nAfter the War of 1812, relative stability allowed for increasing numbers of immigrants to arrive from Europe rather than from the United States. As was the case in the previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the following decades. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.\n\nMeanwhile, Ontario's numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied [[Hydropower|water power]] for development. As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation's leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts and communications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?q1=People&PHPSESSID=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454|title=ARCHIVED \u2013 People \u2013 Virtual Vault \u2013 Library and Archives Canada|website=Collectionscanada.ca|accessdate=June 7, 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321204831/http://collectionscanada.ca/virtual-vault/026018-119.01-e.php?phpsessid=709io6475tfesngi2m7226o454&q1=people|archivedate=March 21, 2016}}</ref>\n[[File:Montgomery's Tavern.jpg|thumb|In 1837, an [[Upper Canada Rebellion|armed insurrection]] was fought in the colony, before being crushed by British authorities and Canadian volunteer units.]]\nUnrest in the colony began to chafe against the aristocratic [[Family Compact]] who governed while benefiting economically from the region's resources, and who did not allow elected bodies power.

In 1841, the two colonies were united to form the [[Province of Canada]].]]\nAlthough both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent [[John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham|Lord Durham]] to investigate the causes. He recommended self-government be granted and Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the [[French Canadians]]. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the ''[[Act of Union 1840]]'', with the capital at [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], and Upper Canada becoming known as [[Province of Canada|Canada West]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada West \u2013 historical region, Canada |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada-West |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> Parliamentary [[Self-governance|self-government]] was granted in 1848. There were heavy waves of immigration in the 1840s, and the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time, the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of [[Canada East]], tilting the representative balance of power.\n\nAn economic boom in the 1850s coincided with railway expansion across the province, further increasing the economic strength of Central Canada. With the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] and a reciprocity agreement in place with the United States, various industries such as timber, mining, farming and alcohol distilling benefited tremendously.\n\nA political stalemate between the [[Canadian French|French]]- and [[Canadian English|English]]-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during and immediately after the [[American Civil War]], led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all [[British North America]]n colonies. The ''[[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act]]'' took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided into Ontario and Quebec so that each linguistic group would have its own province. Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the ''British North America Act'' to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of Protestant and the Catholic minority. Thus, separate Catholic schools and [[board of education|school boards]] were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario's provincial capital.\n\n=== Provincehood ===\n[[File:Oliver Mowat.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Oliver Mowat]], [[Premier of Ontario]] from 1872 to 1896]]\nOnce constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the lawyer [[Oliver Mowat]] became [[Premier of Ontario]] and remained as premier until 1896. He fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly [[Decentralization|decentralized]] Canada, giving the provinces far more power than [[John A. Macdonald]] had intended. He consolidated and expanded Ontario's educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the [[District of Keewatin]]) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889''. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called ''Empire Ontario''.\n\nBeginning with Sir John A. Macdonald's [[National Policy]] (1879) and the construction of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (1875\u20131885) through Northern Ontario and the [[Canadian Prairies]] to [[British Columbia]], Ontario manufacturing and industry flourished. However, population increase slowed after a large recession hit the province in 1893, thus slowing growth drastically but for only a few years. Many newly arrived immigrants and others moved west along the railway to the Prairie Provinces and British Columbia, sparsely settling Northern Ontario.\n\n[[Mineral]] exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast, such as [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Cobalt, Ontario|Cobalt]] and [[Timmins]]. The province harnessed its water power to generate hydro-electric power and created the state-controlled Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario, later [[Ontario Hydro]]. The availability of cheap electric power further facilitated the development of industry. The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]] was established in 1904. [[General Motors Canada]] was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry became the most lucrative industry for the Ontario economy during the 20th century.\n\nIn July 1912, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Conservative]] government of Sir [[James Whitney]] issued [[Regulation 17]] which severely limited the availability of French-language schooling to the province's French-speaking minority. French Canadians reacted with outrage, journalist [[Henri Bourassa]] denouncing the \"Prussians of Ontario\". The regulation was eventually repealed in 1927.\n[[File:Raid at elk lake.jpg|thumb|Law enforcement confiscate stores of alcohol in [[James, Ontario|Elk Lake]] in an effort to enforce [[prohibition]]. The prohibition measures were introduced in 1916, and were not repealed until 1927.]]\nInfluenced by events in the United States, the government of Sir [[William Howard Hearst|William Hearst]] introduced [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] of alcoholic drinks in 1916 with the passing of the ''[[Ontario Temperance Act]]''. However, residents could distill and retain their own personal supply, and liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, allowing this already sizeable industry to strengthen further. Ontario became a hotbed for the illegal smuggling of liquor and the biggest supplier into the United States, which was under complete [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Prohibition in Ontario came to an end in 1927 with the establishment of the [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] under the government of [[Howard Ferguson]]. The sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer are still controlled by some of the most extreme laws in North America to ensure strict community standards and revenue generation from the alcohol retail monopoly are upheld. In April 2007, Ontario Member of Provincial Parliament [[Kim Craitor]] suggested local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier [[Dalton McGuinty]].\n\nThe post-[[World War II]] period was one of exceptional prosperity and growth. Ontario has been the recipients of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from war-torn Europe in the 1950s and 1960s and following changes in federal [[immigration law]], a massive influx of non-Europeans since the 1970s. From a largely [[ethnic group|ethnically]] British province, Ontario has rapidly become culturally very diverse.\n[[File:Immigrant Family Toronto.jpg|left|thumb|A monument commemorating the immigrant family in [[Toronto]]. The province saw a large number of migrants settle in Ontario in the decades following [[World War II]].]]\nThe nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly after the election of the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' in 1976, contributed to driving many businesses and English-speaking people out of Quebec to Ontario, and as a result, Toronto surpassed [[Montreal]] as the largest city and economic centre of Canada. {{citation needed|reason=it's not clear that many businesses were driven away to Ontario, and it's not clear that this led to Toronto becoming the largest city.

[[Rupert's Land]], defined as the drainage basin of [[Hudson Bay]], was claimed by Britain, and included much of today's Northern Ontario. The British defeated the armies of the French colony and its indigenous allies in the [[French and Indian War]], part of the [[Seven Years' War]] global conflict. Concluding the war, the peace treaty between the European powers, known as the [[Treaty of Paris 1763]], assigned almost all of France's possessions in North America to Britain, including parts that would later become Ontario not already part of Rupert's Land. Britain established the first [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], encompassing contemporary Quebec and southern Ontario.\n\nAfter the American War of Independence, the first reserves for First Nations were established. These are situated at [[Six Nations of the Grand River|Six Nations]] (1784), [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory|Tyendinaga]] (1793) and [[Akwesasne]] (1795). Six Nations and Tyendinaga were established by the British for those indigenous groups who had fought on the side of the British, and were expelled from the new United States. Akwesasne was a pre-existing Mohawk community and its borders were formalized under the 1795 [[Jay Treaty]].\n\nIn 1788, while part of the Province of Quebec, southern Ontario was divided into four [[District#Ontario|districts]]: [[Western District, Upper Canada|Hesse]], [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Lunenburg]], [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Mecklenburg]], and [[Home District|Nassau]]. In 1792, the four districts were renamed: Hesse became the Western District, Lunenburg became the Eastern District, Mecklenburg became the Midland District, and Nassau became the Home District. Counties were created within the districts.\n\nBy 1798, there were eight districts: Eastern, Home, [[Johnstown District, Upper Canada|Johnstown]], [[London District, Upper Canada|London]], Midland, [[Newcastle District|Newcastle]], [[Niagara District|Niagara]], and Western. By 1826, there were eleven districts: [[Bathurst District|Bathurst]], Eastern, [[Gore District, Upper Canada|Gore]], Home, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, [[Ottawa District|Ottawa]], and Western. By 1838, there were twenty districts: Bathurst, Brock, Colbourne, [[Dalhousie District|Dalhousie]], Eastern, Gore, Home, Huron, Johnstown, London, Midland, Newcastle, Niagara, Ottawa, Prince Edward, [[Simcoe County|Simcoe]], Talbot, Victoria, [[Wellington District, Upper Canada|Wellington]], and Western.\n\nIn 1849, the districts of southern Ontario were abolished by the [[Province of Canada]], and [[county]] governments took over certain municipal responsibilities. The Province of Canada also began creating ''districts'' in sparsely populated Northern Ontario with the establishment of [[Algoma District]] and [[Nipissing District]] in 1858.\n[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|alt=When Canada was formed in 1867 its provinces were a relatively narrow strip in the southeast, with vast territories in the interior. It grew by adding British Columbia in 1871, P.E.I. in 1873, the British Arctic Islands in 1880, and Newfoundland in 1949; meanwhile, its provinces grew both in size and number at the expense of its territories.|Evolution of the borders of Ontario since the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1867]]\nThe borders of Ontario, its new name in 1867, were provisionally expanded north and west. When the Province of Canada was formed, its borders were not entirely clear, and Ontario claimed eventually to reach all the way to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]. With Canada's acquisition of Rupert's Land, Ontario was interested in clearly defining its borders, especially since some of the new areas in which it was interested were rapidly growing. After the federal government asked Ontario to pay for construction in the new disputed area, the province asked for an elaboration on its limits, and its boundary was moved north to the [[51st parallel north]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Report on the Boundaries of the Province of Ontario |author=Mills, David |publisher=Hunter, Rose & Co. |location=Toronto |page=347 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |year=1877 |accessdate=September 14, 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107091048/http://books.google.com/books?id=BlYCAAAAMAAJ |archivedate=November 7, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nThe northern and western boundaries of Ontario were in dispute after [[Canadian Confederation]]. Ontario's right to Northwestern Ontario was determined by the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] in 1884 and confirmed by the ''Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889'' of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. By 1899, there were seven northern districts: Algoma, Manitoulin, Muskoka, Nipissing, Parry Sound, Rainy River, and Thunder Bay. Four more northern districts were created between 1907 and 1912: Cochrane, Kenora, Sudbury and Timiskaming.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early Districts and Counties 1788\u20131899 |publisher=Archives of Ontario |date=September 5, 2006 |accessdate=November 29, 2006 |url=https://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130162533/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/on-line-exhibits/maps/ontario-districts.aspx |archivedate=January 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Ontario}}\n[[File:Canada Ontario Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of Ontario]]\n{{Graph:Chart\n | width = 200\n | height= 130\n | type = line\n | interpolate = \n | xType = date\n | xAxisAngle = -40\n | yAxisTitle = Population\n | yGrid = yes\n | linewidth = 2\n | x = 1824, 1830, 1840, 1851, 1861, 1871, 1881, 1891, 1901, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941, 1951, 1956, 1961, 1966, 1971, 1975, 1981, 1986, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016\n | y = 150066, 213156, 432159, 952004, 1396091, 1620851, 1926922, 2114321, 2182947, 2527292, 2933662, 3431683, 3787655, 4597542, 5404933, 6236092, 6960870, 7703105, 8264465, 8625107, 9101695, 10084885, 10753573, 11410046, 12160282, 12851821, 13448494,\n | colors = #c8102e\n}}\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Historical populations\n|type = Canada\n|align = right\n|width =\n|state =\n|shading =\n|percentages =\n|footnote = Source: [[Statistics Canada]]\n|1851|952004\n|1861|1396091\n|1871|1620851\n|1881|1926922\n|1891|2114321\n|1901|2182947\n|[[Canada 1911 Census|1911]]|2527292\n|1921|2933662\n|1931|3431683\n|1941|3787655\n|1951|4597542\n|1956|5404933\n|1961|6236092\n|1966|6960870\n|1971|7703105\n|1976|8264465\n|1981|8625107\n|1986|9101695\n|1991|10084885\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]|10753573\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]|11410046\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]|12160282\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]|12851821\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]|13448494\n}}\n\nIn the [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Ontario had a population of 13,448,494 living in 5,169,174 of its 5,598,391 total dwellings, a 4.6 percent change from its 2011 population of 12,851,821.

Ontario has two major east\u2013west routes, both starting from Montreal in the neighbouring province of Quebec. The northerly route, which was a major [[fur trade]] route, travels west from Montreal along the [[Ottawa River]], then continues northwestward towards Manitoba. Major cities on or near the route include Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]], and Thunder Bay. The southerly route, which was driven by growth in settlements originated by the United Empire Loyalists and later other European immigrants, travels southwest from Montreal along the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, and Lake Erie before entering the United States in Michigan. Major cities on or near the route include Kingston, Belleville, Peterborough, Oshawa, Toronto, Mississauga, [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Kitchener-Waterloo]], Hamilton, London, Sarnia, and Windsor. This route was also heavily used by immigrants to the Midwestern US particularly in the late 19th century.\n\n=== Air travel ===\n[[File:Thunder Bay Airport 1.JPG|thumb|[[Thunder Bay International Airport]] is one of five [[international airport]]s operating in Ontario.]]\nImportant airports in the province include [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]], which is the [[List of the busiest airports in Canada|busiest airport in Canada]],<ref name=\"move\">{{cite web |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2014001/t002-eng.htm |title=Total aircraft movements by class of operation \u2013 NAV CANADA towers |publisher=Statcan.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218021721/http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/51-209-x/2014001/t002-eng.htm |archivedate=December 18, 2014  }}</ref> handling nearly 50 million passengers in 2018.<ref name=15DecPax>{{cite web |title=Toronto Pearson (Enplaned + Deplaned) Passengers |url=http://www.torontopearson.com/uploadedFiles/GTAA/Content/About_GTAA/Statistics/PassengerTraffic_Dec2015.pdf |publisher=GTAA |date=February 8, 2016 |accessdate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216160722/http://www.torontopearson.com/uploadedFiles/GTAA/Content/About_GTAA/Statistics/PassengerTraffic_Dec2015.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2016 }}</ref> [[Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport]] is Ontario's second largest airport. Toronto/Pearson and Ottawa/Macdonald-Cartier form two of the three points in Canada's busiest set of air routes (the third point being [[Montr\u00e9al\u2013Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]). In addition to airports in Ottawa, and Toronto, the province also operates three other international airports, the [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] in Hamilton, the [[Thunder Bay International Airport]] in Thunder Bay and the [[London International Airport]] in London. John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport serves as cargo hub, reliever for Pearson, and a hub for ULCC [[Swoop (airline)|Swoop]].\n\nMost Ontario cities have regional airports, many of which have scheduled commuter flights from [[Air Canada Jazz]] or smaller airlines and charter companies&nbsp;\u2013 flights from the mid-size cities such as Thunder Bay, Sault Ste. Marie, Sudbury, North Bay, Timmins, Windsor, London, and Kingston feed directly into larger airports in Toronto and Ottawa. [[Bearskin Airlines]] also runs flights along the northerly east\u2013west route, connecting Ottawa, North Bay, Sudbury, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Thunder Bay directly.\n\nIsolated towns and settlements in the northern areas of the province rely partly or entirely on [[airline|air service]] for travel, goods, and even [[air ambulance|ambulance]] services ([[Medical evacuation|MEDIVAC]]), since much of the far northern area of the province cannot be reached by road or rail.\n\n=== Railways ===\n[[Via Rail]] operates the inter-regional passenger train service on the [[Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor]], along with ''[[Canadian (train)|The Canadian]]'', a transcontinental rail service from Southern Ontario to [[Vancouver]], and the [[Sudbury\u2013White River train]]. Additionally, [[Amtrak]] rail connects Ontario with key New York cities including [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[New York City]]. [[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] provides rail service to destinations as far north as [[Moosonee]] near [[James Bay]], connecting them with the south.\n\n[[Rail freight transport|Freight rail]] is dominated by the founding cross-country [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP Rail]] companies, which during the 1990s sold many [[Shortline railroad|short rail lines]] from their vast network to private companies operating mostly in the south.\n\nRegional [[commuter rail]] is limited to the provincially owned [[GO Transit]], and serves a train-bus network spanning the Golden Horseshoe region, with [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in Toronto serving as the [[transport hub]].\n\nThere are several city rail-transit systems in the Province. The [[Toronto Transit Commission]] operates province's only metro system, the [[Toronto subway|subway]], and one of the busiest [[Toronto streetcar system|streetcar]] systems in North America. [[OC Transpo]] operates a  [[O-Train|light rail]] metro system in Ottawa. In addition, [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo region]] operates a surface [[light rail]] system. Plans to build a light rail line is also underway in the [[Regional Municipality of Peel]].\n{{wide image|Ontario Northland train crosses the Missinaibi River at Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9, Ontario.jpg|880px|alt=[[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] freight train crossing the [[Missinaibi River]] at [[Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9]] in [[Northern Ontario]]|[[Ontario Northland Railway|Ontario Northland]] freight train crossing the [[Missinaibi River]] at [[Mattice-Val C\u00f4t\u00e9]] in [[Northern Ontario]]}}\n\n=== Roads ===\n{{Main|Roads in Ontario}}\n[[File:Highway 400 Seguin.jpg|thumb|[[Ontario Highway 400|Highway 400]] in [[Seguin, Ontario|Seguin]].

In the past, the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River were also a major passenger transportation route, but over the past half century passenger travel has been reduced to ferry services and sightseeing cruises.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<ref name=\"fordham1\" />\n\n{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\n\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}\n\n== Expansion ==\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" />\n\n== Regulation of the company's affairs ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=December 2011}}\n\n=== Writers ===\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|''The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor'', 1773|alt=Two ships in a harbour, one in the distance.

Several well-known British scholars and literary men had Company writerships, such as [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]] in India and [[Charles Lamb]] in England.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and [[Java island|Java]]. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag. Historical documents and paintings show variations from 9-to-13&nbsp;stripes, with some images showing the top stripe red and others showing it white.\n\nAt the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the [[Grand Union Flag]].

The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \"Sign of Four\" atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage<ref>East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.</ref> and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Ships ==\n{{See also|East Indiaman|List of ports of call of the British East India Company}}\n[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]], c. 1731]]\nShips of the East India Company were called [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] or simply \"Indiamen\".<ref>Sutton, Jean (1981) ''Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships''.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:<ref name=\"fordham1\" />\n\n{{quote|Upon which assurance of your royal love I have given my general command to all the kingdoms and ports of my dominions to receive all the merchants of the English nation as the subjects of my friend; that in what place soever they choose to live, they may have free liberty without any restraint; and at what port soever they shall arrive, that neither Portugal nor any other shall dare to molest their quiet; and in what city soever they shall have residence, I have commanded all my governors and captains to give them freedom answerable to their own desires; to sell, buy, and to transport into their country at their pleasure.\n\nFor confirmation of our love and friendship, I desire your Majesty to command your merchants to bring in their ships of all sorts of rarities and rich goods fit for my palace; and that you be pleased to send me your royal letters by every opportunity, that I may rejoice in your health and prosperous affairs; that our friendship may be interchanged and eternal.|Nuruddin Salim Jahangir|Letter to James I.}}\n\n== Expansion ==\nThe company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, [[indigo dye]], [[Potassium nitrate|saltpetre]], and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the [[Straits of Malacca]] by ousting the Portuguese in 1640\u20131641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new \"parallel\" East India Company (officially titled the ''English Company Trading to the East Indies'') was floated under a state-backed indemnity of \u00a32&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"Boggart\">{{cite journal |last1=Boggart |first1=Dan |editor1-last=Lamoreaux |editor1-first=Naomi R. |editor2-last=Wallis |editor2-first=John Joseph |title=East Indian Monopoly and Limited Access in England |journal=Organizations, Civil Society, and the Roots of Development |date=2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago}}</ref> The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of \u00a3315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market.

Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991).

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The company had at various stages extended its influence to China, the Philippines, and [[Java island|Java]]. It had solved its critical lack of cash needed to buy tea by exporting Indian-grown opium to China. China's efforts to end the trade led to the First Opium War (1839\u20131842).\n\n==== English Education Act 1835 ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n{{Main|English Education Act 1835}}\n[[File:Charles D'Oyly00.jpg|thumb|View of the Calcutta port in 1848]]\nThe English Education Act by the Council of India in 1835 reallocated funds from the East India Company to spend on education and literature in India.\n\n==== Government of India Act 1853 ====\nThis Act (16 & 17 Vict. c. 95) provided that British India would remain under the administration of the company in trust for the Crown until Parliament should decide otherwise.

This Act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock.<ref>East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict. 17) s. 36: \"On the First day of June One thousand eight hundred and seventy-four, and on payment by the East India Company of all unclaimed dividends on East India Stock to such accounts as are herein-before mentioned in pursuance of the directions herein-before contained, the powers of the East India Company shall cease, and the said Company shall be dissolved.\" Where possible, the stock was redeemed through commutation (i.e. exchanging the stock for other securities or money) on terms agreed with the stockholders (ss. 5\u20138), but stockholders who did not agree to commute their holdings had their stock compulsorily redeemed on 30 April 1874 by payment of \u00a3200 for every \u00a3100 of stock held (s. 13).</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' commented on 8 April 1873:<ref>{{cite news |title=Not many days ago the House of Commons passed |newspaper=Times |location=London |date=8 April 1873 |page=9}}</ref>\n{{quote|text=It accomplished a work such as in the whole history of the human race no other trading Company ever attempted, and such as none, surely, is likely to attempt in the years to come.}}\n\nIn the 1980s, a group of investors purchased the rights to the moribund corporate brand and founded a clothing company, which lasted until the 1990s.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

The East India Company's merchant mark consisted of a \"Sign of Four\" atop a heart within which was a [[saltire]] between the lower arms of which were the initials \"EIC\". This mark was a central motif of the East India Company's coinage<ref>East India Company coin 1791, half pice, as illustrated.</ref> and forms the central emblem displayed on the [[Scinde Dawk]] postage stamps.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027143019/http://www.geocities.com/mjshah.geo/scinde/scinde.html|title=Scinde District Dawks|date=27 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Ships ==\n{{See also|East Indiaman|List of ports of call of the British East India Company}}\n[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]], c. 1731]]\nShips of the East India Company were called [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] or simply \"Indiamen\".<ref>Sutton, Jean (1981) ''Lords of the East: The East India Company and Its Ships''. London: Conway Maritime</ref>\n\n[[File:Indiaman Royal George.jpg|thumb|right|{{ship||Royal George|East Indiaman|2}} was one of the five East Indiamen the Spanish fleet captured in 1780]]\n\nDuring the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], the East India Company arranged for [[Letter of marque|letters of marque]] for its vessels such as the ''Lord Nelson''. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''. Other examples include:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* {{HMS|Calcutta|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Glatton|1795|6}}\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1795|6}} (1795)\n* {{HMS|Hindostan|1804|6}} (1804)\n* {{HMS|Malabar|1804|6}}\n* {{HMS|Buffalo|1813|6}}\n{{div col end}}\n\nTheir design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.\n\n== Records ==\n{{Main|India Office Records}}\nUnlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the [[India Office]]) are not in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] at [[Kew]], London, but are held by the [[British Library]] in London as part of the [[Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections, British Library|Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections]].

Discovering that they both shared a deep interest in music, they made plans to form their own record label, which they subsequently called \"The Outfit Entertainment\". After Sha heard Bohemia reciting something he had written in Punjabi he asked him to rap it over one of his beats. Over the next few months, he wrote a library of lyrics. This would become the arsenal for his debut album ''Vich Pardesan De (In The Foreign Land)'' \u2013 an autobiographical story of his life as a Desi youngster adopting to the streets of America, which he and Sha One produced together. Their first single \"Sha Te Ra\" was released as a music video, but the song itself was not included on ''Vich Pardesan De''.\n\nThe following album, ''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' [Money, Intoxication, Love] became the first full-length Punjabi rap album released by a major label. It was recorded and produced by Sha One and Bohemia in their downtown Oakland studio. After nearly two years of perfecting their sound and style, a seamless fusion of Bohemia's Punjabi vocals, and Sha One's English hooks, the album was finally released. He subsequently signed a multi-record deal with music label [[Universal Music Group]].

Discovering that they both shared a deep interest in music, they made plans to form their own record label, which they subsequently called \"The Outfit Entertainment\". After Sha heard Bohemia reciting something he had written in Punjabi he asked him to rap it over one of his beats. Over the next few months, he wrote a library of lyrics. This would become the arsenal for his debut album ''Vich Pardesan De (In The Foreign Land)'' \u2013 an autobiographical story of his life as a Desi youngster adopting to the streets of America, which he and Sha One produced together. Their first single \"Sha Te Ra\" was released as a music video, but the song itself was not included on ''Vich Pardesan De''.\n\nThe following album, ''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' [Money, Intoxication, Love] became the first full-length Punjabi rap album released by a major label. It was recorded and produced by Sha One and Bohemia in their downtown Oakland studio. After nearly two years of perfecting their sound and style, a seamless fusion of Bohemia's Punjabi vocals, and Sha One's English hooks, the album was finally released. He subsequently signed a multi-record deal with music label [[Universal Music Group]].

[refuted] --> In any case, [[nDNA]] [[\u03b2-fibrinogen]] [[intron]] 7 sequence data agrees with the idea of the Raphinae as a [[subfamily]] of pigeons (and not an independent family, as was previously believed due to their bizarre [[apomorph]]ies) that was part of a diverse [[Indopacific]] [[evolutionary radiation|radiation]], to which the Nicobar pigeon also belongs.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Clayton|1y=2000|2a1=Shapiro et al.|2y=2002}}\n\nThe following [[cladogram]], from Shapiro and colleagues (2002), shows the Nicobar pigeon's closest relationships within Columbidae, a [[clade]] consisting of generally ground-dwelling island endemics.{{sfn|Shapiro et al.|2002}}\n\n{{clade | style = font-size: 90%;\n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1=''Goura victoria'' ([[Victoria crowned pigeon]])\n      |2={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1={{clade\n               |1=''Caloenas nicobarica'' (Nicobar pigeon)\n               |2={{clade\n                  |1=''Pezophaps solitaria'' ([[Rodrigues solitaire]])\n                  |2=''Raphus cucullatus'' ([[dodo]])\n                  }}\n               }}\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   |2=''Didunculus strigirostris'' ([[tooth-billed pigeon]])\n   }}\n}}\n\n[[File:CaloenasNicobaricaBaker.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Henrik Gr\u00f6nvold]]]]\nA similar cladogram was published in 2007, differing only in the inverted placement of ''Goura'' and ''Didunculus'', as well as in the inclusion of the [[pheasant pigeon]] and the [[thick-billed ground pigeon]] at the base of the clade.{{sfn|Pereira et al.|2007}}\n\n''C. nicobarica'' is a quite singular [[Columbiformes|columbiform]] (though less [[autapomorph]]ic than the [[flightless bird|flightless]] Raphinae), as are for example the [[tooth-billed pigeon]] (''Didunculus strigirostris'') and the [[crowned pigeon]]s (''Goura''), which are typically considered distinct subfamilies. Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-[[monotypic]] subfamily. And while any of the semi-[[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] pigeons of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Wallacea]] cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of [[imperial-pigeon]]s and [[fruit-dove]]s, which seems to be part of the same radiation.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Clayton|1y=2000|2a1=Shapiro et al.|2y=2002}}\n\nWhether it is possible to clarify such deep-time [[phylogenies]] without a comprehensive study of all major lineages of living [[Columbidae]] remains to be seen. The primitive [[molecular clock]] used to infer the date the ancestors of the Nicobar pigeon and the didines diverged has since turned out to be both unreliable and [[calibration|miscalibrated]]. But what little evidence is available still suggests that the Nicobar pigeon is distinct from all other living lifeforms since the [[Paleogene]]&nbsp;\u2013 most likely some time between 56-34 [[million years ago]] during the [[Eocene]], which makes up the bulk of the Paleogene [[Geologic period|period]].{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Clayton|1y=2000|2a1=Shapiro et al.|2y=2002|3a1=Slack|3a2=Jones|3a3=Ando|3a4=Harrison|3y=2006}}\n\nFrom [[subfossil]] bones found on [[New Caledonia]] and [[Tonga]], an [[extinct]] species of ''Caloenas'', the [[Kanaka pigeon]] (''[[Caloenas canacorum|C. canacorum]]'') was described.

Considering that it must have been a good source of food, it was most likely hunted to extinction by the first human settlers of its home islands. It probably was extinct by 500 BC. The [[Spotted green pigeon]] (''C. maculata'') is a more recently extinct species from an unknown [[Pacific]] locality; it probably disappeared in the 19th century and most likely succumbed to introduced [[Europe]]an [[rat]]s. It is placed in ''Caloenas'' as the least awkward possibility; its true affinities are presently indeterminate and it is perhaps more likely to represent a distinct genus of the Indopacific radiation of Columbidae.<ref>Fuller (2000): p. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Nicobar Pigeon.jpg|thumb|left|An adult at the [[Milwaukee County Zoological Gardens]] with iridescent scapulars]]\n\nIt is a large pigeon, measuring {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head is grey, like the upper neck plumage, which turns into green and copper hackles. The tail is very short and pure white. The rest of its plumage is metallic green. The [[cere]] of the dark bill forms a small blackish knob; the strong legs and feet are dull red. The [[Iris (anatomy)|irides]] are dark.<ref name=\"grimmettetal1999\">Grimmett et al. (2009).</ref>\n\nFemales are slightly smaller than males; they have a smaller bill knob, shorter hackles and browner underparts. Immature birds have a black tail and lack almost all [[iridescence]]. There is hardly any variation across the birds' wide range. Even the Palau [[subspecies]] ''C. n. pelewensis'' has merely shorter neck hackles, but is otherwise almost identical.<ref name=\"grimmettetal1999\" />\n\nIt is a very vocal species, giving a low-pitched repetitive call.<ref name=\"grimmettetal1999\" />\n==Distribution and habitat==\n[[File:Head of Nicobar Pigeon.jpg|thumb|Close up of the head]]\n\nOn the [[Nicobar Islands]] (which are referred to in its [[common name|common]] and [[scientific name]]s), the most significant colony in our time was found on [[Batti Malv]], a remote [[wildlife sanctuary]] between [[Car Nicobar]] and [[Teressa (Nicobar Islands)|Teressa]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] caused massive damage on the Nicobar Islands, and it is still not quite clear to what extent Batti Malv was affected.

An April 2007 survey by the [[Indian Coast Guard]] vessel [[ICGS Vikram|ICGS ''Vikram'']] found the lighthouse tower \"totally covered\" in [[vine]]s, indicating rampant regeneration of vegetation&nbsp;\u2013 but perhaps also that damage to the island's forest was severe, as a cover of creeping plants is typical of early [[Ecological succession|succession]] stages, while a photo of the lighthouse taken before the tsunami shows rather mature forest.<ref>Sankaran (1998), IHMDN (2005), ICG (2007), [[#{{sfnRef|Rowlett|2008}}|Rowlett (2008)]].</ref>\n\n===Found in Australia===\nA Nicobar pigeon was found by the [[Bardi Jawi]] [[Indigenous rangers]] on the [[Dampier Peninsula]] in the western Kimberley, [[Australia]] in May 2017.

Its food consists of [[seed]]s, [[fruit]] and buds, and it is attracted to areas where [[cereal|grain]] is available. A [[gizzard stone]] helps to grind up hard food items. Its flight is quick, with regular beats and an occasional sharp flick of the wings, as is characteristic of pigeons in general.

Hence, the Nicobar pigeon may well constitute another now-[[monotypic]] subfamily. And while any of the semi-[[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] pigeons of [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Wallacea]] cannot be excluded as possible closest living relative of the Raphinae, the Nicobar pigeon makes a more plausible candidate than for example the group of [[imperial-pigeon]]s and [[fruit-dove]]s, which seems to be part of the same radiation.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Clayton|1y=2000|2a1=Shapiro et al.|2y=2002}}\n\nWhether it is possible to clarify such deep-time [[phylogenies]] without a comprehensive study of all major lineages of living [[Columbidae]] remains to be seen.
