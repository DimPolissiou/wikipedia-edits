They move into Keyhouse, Rendell\u2019s ancestral home, with the help of Rendell's younger brother Duncan. Youngest Locke son Bode comes across the well house, where he hears the voice of a woman claiming to be his echo. As eldest son Tyler and daughter Kinsey start school, Bode explores Keyhouse and hears strange whispers that lead him to magical keys hidden throughout the house. He finds the Anywhere Key, which can be used on any door to travel to any place he has seen, and the Mirror Key, which opens a portal to a dimension within any mirror. The Locke children's mother, Nina, becomes trapped in the mirror dimension. Echo tells Bode she can save his mom if he gives her the Anywhere Key. He does so, but she uses the key to escape the well house. Tyler and Kinsey arrive in time to help Nina out from the mirror.

The next day, Tyler lets Kinsey use the Head Key to enter her mind, fashioned after a shopping mall, to find more memories of their father. The two are chased by a representation of Kinsey's fear before they escape. Meanwhile, Bode finds the Ghost Key, which frees his soul from his body and allows him to speak to the dead, including his great-great-grandfather Chamberlain Locke, who mentions Rendell and Duncan had visited him often when they were younger. Nina goes out for dinner with Ellie, Rendell's old friend, and when Nina mentions Bode searching the well house, Ellie becomes gravely concerned.

Kinsey claims it is buried outside, directing him to where she buried her fear monster. During Sam's absence, Tyler helps free Nina, and when Sam returns after overpowering Kinsey's fear, Tyler uses the Head Key on him. Sam's inner self is apologetic. Tyler realizes he did not cause his own father's death when Sam explains Rendell's murder was not planned and that he simply wanted to find the keys for Dodge. Sam removes the Head Key from his own neck just as Dodge appears. She stabs him and takes all of the keys before disappearing.

However, years later, still longing for Lucas, Ellie used the Echo Key at the well house to try to bring him back, only to bring back the entity that had possessed him instead. Ellie had called Mark about Rendell's murder so that he would use the Matchstick Key to immolate himself and keep the mapped locations of the other keys from Dodge. Once Dodge escaped the well house, she took Lucas's form to live with Ellie and Rufus, coercing Ellie to steal the Crown of Shadows from Keyhouse.

Three months later, The Locke family relocates to Matheson, Massachusetts, after family patriarch Rendell's murder. They move into Keyhouse, Rendell\u2019s ancestral home, with the help of Rendell's younger brother Duncan. Youngest Locke son Bode comes across the well house, where he hears the voice of a woman claiming to be his echo. As eldest son Tyler and daughter Kinsey start school, Bode explores Keyhouse and hears strange whispers that lead him to magical keys hidden throughout the house. He finds the Anywhere Key, which can be used on any door to travel to any place he has seen, and the Mirror Key, which opens a portal to a dimension within any mirror. The Locke children's mother, Nina, becomes trapped in the mirror dimension. Echo tells Bode she can save his mom if he gives her the Anywhere Key. He does so, but she uses the key to escape the well house. Tyler and Kinsey arrive in time to help Nina out from the mirror.

With help from Rufus, Bode tries to set a trap for Echo, but when she returns after using the Anywhere Key to travel the world, she sees right through it and warns Bode not to disappoint her.

The next day, Tyler lets Kinsey use the Head Key to enter her mind, fashioned after a shopping mall, to find more memories of their father. The two are chased by a representation of Kinsey's fear before they escape. Meanwhile, Bode finds the Ghost Key, which frees his soul from his body and allows him to speak to the dead, including his great-great-grandfather Chamberlain Locke, who mentions Rendell and Duncan had visited him often when they were younger. Nina goes out for dinner with Ellie, Rendell's old friend, and when Nina mentions Bode searching the well house, Ellie becomes gravely concerned.

Ellie helps Nina tear down a wall put up in the house's basement to block a recreation room, where Nina finds an old cabinet.

Kinsey claims it is buried outside, directing him to where she buried her fear monster. During Sam's absence, Tyler helps free Nina, and when Sam returns after overpowering Kinsey's fear, Tyler uses the Head Key on him. Sam's inner self is apologetic. Tyler realizes he did not cause his own father's death when Sam explains Rendell's murder was not planned and that he simply wanted to find the keys for Dodge. Sam removes the Head Key from his own neck just as Dodge appears. She stabs him and takes all of the keys before disappearing.

Ellie and her friends hid all evidence of this, including removing Duncan's memories, and split up and hid the keys to prevent anyone from using them again. However, years later, still longing for Lucas, Ellie used the Echo Key at the well house to try to bring him back, only to bring back the entity that had possessed him instead. Ellie had called Mark about Rendell's murder so that he would use the Matchstick Key to immolate himself and keep the mapped locations of the other keys from Dodge. Once Dodge escaped the well house, she took Lucas's form to live with Ellie and Rufus, coercing Ellie to steal the Crown of Shadows from Keyhouse.

The Lockes decide to stay in Matheson, and Kinsey starts dating Gabe, unaware he is another form of Dodge; Dodge had used the Identity Key to change Ellie's form into Dodge, and it was Ellie the friends had thrown through the Omega Door.

These types of rocks are visible in [[cliff]]s at the south extremity of West Falkland, Cape Meredith, and correspond to the crystalline rocks that made up the interior of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent. They also have a great geological similarity to rocks currently found in [[South Africa]] and in [[Queen Maud Land]] in [[Antarctica]]. On top of the gneiss and granite lie layers of [[quartzite]], [[sandstone]], and [[shale]]s or [[mudstone]] in West Falkland and adjacent areas including Weddell Island. [[Cross-bedding]] and ripple marks identify the zone where these rocks were deposited as the shallow waters of a delta environment where currents transported submarine sediments. In the case of the Falklands these [[paleocurrent]] directions mostly run northward, and are very similar to those in formations in South Africa that run southward. Comparison of the two provides evidence that the block of sandstone sediments that contains the islands has rotated. Rocks in the central part of West Falkland contain [[fossil]]s of marine organisms that lived in shallow water.<ref>[http://www.fig.gov.fk/minerals/index.php/geology/onshore-geology Onshore Geology.] FIG Department of Mineral Resources, 2016</ref>\n\n===Stone runs===\nThe modern Falklands landscape owes some of its most remarkable aspects to the polar climate of the last [[Ice Age]]. The islands have largely remained free of glaciers, with the exception of a few small ones on the highest hills. Nevertheless, they were repeatedly deep-frozen and battered by icy winds. The [[erosion]] of particular rock varieties caused by myriad freezing-thawing cycles taking place in [[periglacial]] conditions during the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]] produced the dramatic stone runs,<ref>P.

The blocks are not waterworn, their angles being only a little blunted; they vary in size from one or two feet in diameter to ten, or even more than twenty times as much. They are not thrown together into irregular piles, but are spread out into level sheets or great streams. \u2026 In a valley south of [[Berkeley Sound]], which some of our party called the \u2018great valley of fragments,\u2019 it was necessary to cross an uninterrupted band half a mile wide, by jumping from one pointed stone to another. So large were the fragments, that being overtaken by a shower of rain, I readily found shelter beneath one of them.<ref name=\"Darwin\"/>}}\n\nThe Falkland Islands and [[Vitosha|Vitosha Mountain]] in Europe feature probably the most exceptional stone runs in terms of diversity, size and abundance. The highly specific combination of particular climatic conditions and rock varieties that existed there during the [[Quaternary]] explains both the formation of stone runs in certain areas of those two territories, and their absence in areas with otherwise comparable nature conditions. On the Falklands, stone runs form on outcrops of the Port Stanley and the Port Stephens Formations, and occur on East Falkland, West Falkland, and Weddell, Saunders and [[Keppel Island|Keppel]] Islands. They appear in several varieties as stone patches, streams, terraces, fans, stripes and rivers, and are most widespread and voluminous in the [[Wickham Heights]] area of East Falkland,<ref name=\"Geology\"/> where the largest of them extend over {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

These types of rocks are visible in [[cliff]]s at the south extremity of West Falkland, Cape Meredith, and correspond to the crystalline rocks that made up the interior of the [[Gondwana]] supercontinent. They also have a great geological similarity to rocks currently found in [[South Africa]] and in [[Queen Maud Land]] in [[Antarctica]]. On top of the gneiss and granite lie layers of [[quartzite]], [[sandstone]], and [[shale]]s or [[mudstone]] in West Falkland and adjacent areas including Weddell Island. [[Cross-bedding]] and ripple marks identify the zone where these rocks were deposited as the shallow waters of a delta environment where currents transported submarine sediments. In the case of the Falklands these [[paleocurrent]] directions mostly run northward, and are very similar to those in formations in South Africa that run southward. Comparison of the two provides evidence that the block of sandstone sediments that contains the islands has rotated. Rocks in the central part of West Falkland contain [[fossil]]s of marine organisms that lived in shallow water.<ref>[http://www.fig.gov.fk/minerals/index.php/geology/onshore-geology Onshore Geology.] FIG Department of Mineral Resources, 2016</ref>\n\n===Stone runs===\nThe modern Falklands landscape owes some of its most remarkable aspects to the polar climate of the last [[Ice Age]]. The islands have largely remained free of glaciers, with the exception of a few small ones on the highest hills. Nevertheless, they were repeatedly deep-frozen and battered by icy winds. The [[erosion]] of particular rock varieties caused by myriad freezing-thawing cycles taking place in [[periglacial]] conditions during the [[last glacial period|last Ice Age]] produced the dramatic stone runs,<ref>P.

The blocks are not waterworn, their angles being only a little blunted; they vary in size from one or two feet in diameter to ten, or even more than twenty times as much. They are not thrown together into irregular piles, but are spread out into level sheets or great streams. \u2026 In a valley south of [[Berkeley Sound]], which some of our party called the \u2018great valley of fragments,\u2019 it was necessary to cross an uninterrupted band half a mile wide, by jumping from one pointed stone to another. So large were the fragments, that being overtaken by a shower of rain, I readily found shelter beneath one of them.<ref name=\"Darwin\"/>}}\n\nThe Falkland Islands and [[Vitosha|Vitosha Mountain]] in Europe feature probably the most exceptional stone runs in terms of diversity, size and abundance. The highly specific combination of particular climatic conditions and rock varieties that existed there during the [[Quaternary]] explains both the formation of stone runs in certain areas of those two territories, and their absence in areas with otherwise comparable nature conditions. On the Falklands, stone runs form on outcrops of the Port Stanley and the Port Stephens Formations, and occur on East Falkland, West Falkland, and Weddell, Saunders and [[Keppel Island|Keppel]] Islands. They appear in several varieties as stone patches, streams, terraces, fans, stripes and rivers, and are most widespread and voluminous in the [[Wickham Heights]] area of East Falkland,<ref name=\"Geology\"/> where the largest of them extend over {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The ship was sold in 1929 to John Hamilton, brought to the island and renamed ''Penelope'' after his daughter, remaining based at Weddell until the 1950s and again in 1989\u20131993.<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2004/09/24/penguin-news-update Falklands farmer sails the Atlantic.] MercoPress, 24 September 2004</ref> The ship sailed for many decades and for various shipowners between the islands of the Falklands (including a brief confiscation and use by the [[Argentine Navy]] during the Falklands War), until 2006 when she was transported back to her native Germany and listed as a historic cultural monument.<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2006/04/06/feuerland-a-piece-of-falklands-history-returns-to-germany \"Feuerland\", a piece of Falklands' history returns to Germany.] MercoPress, 6 April 2006</ref>\n\nOverland travel is accomplished by foot, horse, and mechanized [[Off-road vehicle|off-road]] capable transport. There are two unpaved [[Dirt road|earth roads]] on the island, both leaving Weddell Settlement. One of them, {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, runs towards the airfield and further north to Loop Head Shanty and the headland ending up in Loop Head and [[Swan Point, Weddell Island|Swan Point]].  The other one leads {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} in westerly direction, skirting the head of Chatham Harbour and turning north at Kelp Creek House to reach Chatham House at the west corner of the bay.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Private island]]\n* [[Stone run]]\n* [[Wildlife of the Falkland Islands]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* B.
