Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Earless seal (Puerto Madryn, Argentina).jpg|thumb|left|Southern elephant seals in Argentina|alt=Photo of seven adult and juvenile southern elephant seals packed closely on beach]]\n\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\n\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must [[fasting|fast]] while [[lactation|lactating]]. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the [[humpback whale]]s' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\n\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the [[monk seal]] to just three to five days in the [[hooded seal]]. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\n\n===Growth and maturation===\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories, it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The energetics of lactation in the Northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris|journal = Journal of Zoology|date = 1986-03-01|issn = 1469-7998|pages = 21\u201333|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x|first = D.

L.|last4 = Ortiz}}</ref> The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\n\n=== Feeding strategy ===\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip, and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by a specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization, most phocids are opportunistic and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey. For example, the leopard seal, ''Hydrurga leptonyx'', uses grip and tear feeding to prey on penguins, suction feeding to consume small fish, and filter feeding to catch krill.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kienle|first=Sarah S.|last2=Berta|first2=Annalisa|date=2016|title=The better to eat you with: the comparative feeding morphology of phocid seals (Pinnipedia, Phocidae)|journal=Journal of Anatomy|volume=228|issue=3|pages=396\u2013413|doi=10.1111/joa.12410|issn=1469-7580|pmc=5341551|pmid=26646351}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mammals|Animals|Marine life}}\n* [[Eared seal]]\n* [[Marine mammals as food]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Phocidae}}\n{{Commons and category|Phocidae|Phocidae}}\n\n{{Crowned and Stemmed Genera of Pinnipeds}}\n{{Carnivora|C1.}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q25587}}\n\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Pinnipeds]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by John Edward Gray]]\n", "text_old": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| name = Earless seals<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft | pages = | id = 14001028}}</ref>\n| image = Seehund.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Harbor seal]], ''Phoca vitulina''\n| fossil_range = {{Fossil range|earliest=Chattian|Aquitanian|present}}<small>Early [[Miocene]] \u2013 [[Holocene]], possible late [[Oligocene]] record<ref name=Noriphoca>{{Cite journal|author1=Leonard Dewaele |author2=Olivier Lambert |author3=Stephen Louwye |year=2018 |title=A critical revision of the fossil record, stratigraphy and diversity of the Neogene seal genus ''Monotherium'' (Carnivora, Phocidae) |journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=171669 |doi=10.1098/rsos.171669 |pmid=29892365 |pmc=5990722 |bibcode=2018RSOS....571669D }}</ref></small>\n| taxon = Phocidae\n| authority = [[John Edward Gray|Gray]], 1821\n| subdivision_ranks = Subfamilies\n| subdivision = \n*\u2020[[Devinophoca|Devinophocinae]]\n*[[Monachinae]]\n*[[Phocinae]]\n\nRefer to the article's text about the interrelationships among the phocid subfamilies.\n}}\n[[File:Harbor seal with skeleton GS.jpg|thumb|Skeletal anatomy of a harbor seal. 1.

Instead, they communicate by slapping the water and grunting.\n\n===Reproduction===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n[[File:Earless seal (Puerto Madryn, Argentina).jpg|thumb|left|Southern elephant seals in Argentina|alt=Photo of seven adult and juvenile southern elephant seals packed closely on beach]]\n\nPhocids spend most of their time at sea, although they return to land or pack ice to breed and give birth. Pregnant females spend long periods foraging at sea, building up fat reserves, and then return to the breeding site to use their stored energy to nurse pups. However, the common seal displays a reproductive strategy similar to that used by otariids, in which the mother makes short foraging trips between nursing bouts.\n\nBecause a phocid mother's feeding grounds are often hundreds of kilometers from the breeding site, she must [[fasting|fast]] while [[lactation|lactating]]. This combination of fasting with lactation requires the mother to provide large amounts of energy to her pup at a time when she is not eating (and often, not drinking). Mothers must supply their own metabolic needs while nursing. This is a miniature version of the [[humpback whale]]s' strategy, which involves fasting during their months-long migration from arctic feeding areas to tropical breeding/nursing areas and back.\n\nPhocids produce thick, fat-rich milk that allows them to provide their pups with large amounts of energy in a short period. This allows the mother to return to the sea in time to replenish her reserves. Lactation ranges from five to seven weeks in the [[monk seal]] to just three to five days in the [[hooded seal]]. The mother ends nursing by leaving her pup at the breeding site to search for food (pups continue to nurse if given the opportunity). \"Milk stealers\" that suckle from unrelated, sleeping females are not uncommon; this often results in the death of the mother's pup, since a female can only feed one pup.\n\n===Growth and maturation===\nThe pup's diet is so high in calories, it builds up a fat store. Before the pup is ready to forage, the mother abandons it, and the pup consumes its own fat for weeks or even  months while it matures. Seals, like all marine mammals, need time to develop the oxygen stores, swimming muscles, and neural pathways necessary for effective diving and foraging. Seal pups typically eat no food and drink no water during the period, although some polar species eat snow. The postweaning fast ranges from two weeks in the hooded seal to 9\u201312 weeks in the northern elephant seal.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The energetics of lactation in the Northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris|journal = Journal of Zoology|date = 1986-03-01|issn = 1469-7998|pages = 21\u201333|volume = 209|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7998.1986.tb03563.x|first = D.

L.|last4 = Ortiz}}</ref> The physiological and behavioral adaptations that allow phocid pups to endure these remarkable fasts, which are among the longest for any mammal, remain an area of active study and research.\n\n=== Feeding strategy ===\nPhocids make use of at least four different feeding strategies: suction feeding, grip and tear feeding, filter feeding, and pierce feeding. Each of these feeding strategies is aided by specialized skull, mandible, and tooth morphology. However, despite morphological specialization most phocids are opportunistic, and employ multiple strategies to capture and eat prey.

He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<ref name=\"tsteslatower\">{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham, Suffolk County (Long Island), 1901\u201317) meant to be the \"World Wireless\" Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.

The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating [[magnetic field]]. This [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=181\u2013185}}<ref>Reciprocating Engine, {{US patent|514169}}, 6 February 1894.</ref>\n\n===Consulting on Niagara===\n\nIn 1893, [[Edward Dean Adams]], who headed up the [[Niagara Falls]] [[Cataract Construction Company]], sought Tesla's opinion on what system would be best to transmit power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=167\u2013173}}\n\n===The Nikola Tesla Company===\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205\u2013206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.\n\n===Lab fire===\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I am in too much grief to talk.

In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will&nbsp;... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".<ref>N. Tesla, [http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1898-11-17.htm \"High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-Therapeutic and Other Purposes\"], in ''Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association'', American Electro-Therapeutic Association. p.&nbsp;25.</ref>\n\nTesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasmas]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.<ref>Griffiths, David J.

It was an expansion of his idea of using coils to transmit power that he had been demonstrating in wireless lighting. He saw this as not only a way to transmit large amounts of power around the world but also, as he had pointed out in his earlier lectures, a way to transmit worldwide communications.\n\nAt the time Tesla was formulating his ideas, there was no feasible way to wirelessly transmit communication signals over long distances, let alone large amounts of power.

During his early life, Tesla was repeatedly stricken with illness. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light appeared before his eyes, often accompanied by visions.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they provided the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he could envision it in realistic detail.{{sfn|Cheney|2001|p=33}} Tesla visualized an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage, a technique sometimes known as [[picture thinking]]. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory.

His opinion had started to sway in later years when he felt that women were trying to outdo men and make themselves more dominant. This \"new woman\" was met with much indignation from Tesla, who felt that women were losing their femininity by trying to be in power. In an interview with the ''Galveston Daily News'' on 10 August 1924 he stated, \"In place of the soft voiced, gentle woman of my reverent worship, has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies in making herself as much as possible like man\u2014in dress, voice and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind&nbsp;...

He emigrated in 1884 to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the [[Edison Machine Works]] in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His [[alternating current]] (AC) [[induction motor]] and related [[polyphase system|polyphase]] AC patents, licensed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse Electric]] in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.\n\nAttempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of [[wireless communication]] with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.<ref name=\"tsteslatower\">{{cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham, Suffolk County (Long Island), 1901\u201317) meant to be the \"World Wireless\" Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success.

The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating [[magnetic field]].

Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams asked Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=167\u2013173}}\n\n===The Nikola Tesla Company===\nIn 1895, Edward Dean Adams, impressed with what he saw when he toured Tesla's lab, agreed to help found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions as well as new ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney.{{sfn|Carlson|2013|pp=205\u2013206}} It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company handled Tesla's patents for decades to come.\n\n===Lab fire===\n\nIn the early morning hours of 13 March 1895, the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition. Tesla told ''[[The New York Times]]'' \"I am in too much grief to talk.

In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the \"instrument will&nbsp;... enable one to generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus\".<ref>N.

In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasmas]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.<ref>Griffiths, David J.

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>\n\nRodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).\n\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\", \"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\", \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\", \"[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", \"[[Bali Hai]]\", \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\", \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\", \"[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]\", \"[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]\", \"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]\", Hammerstein's last song.\n[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Rodgers conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in excerpts from ''Victory at Sea'', ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' and the ''[[Carousel Waltz]]'' for a special LP released by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musicals earned a total of 37 [[Tony Award]]s, 15 [[Academy Awards]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n====After Hammerstein====\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962, which earned two Tony Awards). The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!''

With 43 Broadway musicals and over 900 songs to his credit, Rodgers was one of the most significant American composers of the 20th century, and his compositions had a significant impact on popular music.  \n\nHe is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists [[Lorenz Hart]], with whom he wrote several musicals throughout the 1920s and 1930s, including ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'', ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'', ''[[On Your Toes]]'' and ''[[Babes in Arms]],'' and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he wrote musicals through the 1940s and 1950s such as ''[[Oklahoma!]]'', ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[The King and I]]'', and ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. His collaborations with Hammerstein, in particular, are celebrated for bringing the Broadway musical to a new maturity by telling stories that were focused around characters and drama rather than the light-hearted entertainment that the genre was known for beforehand. \n\nRodgers was the first person to win what is considered the top American entertainment awards in television, recording, movies, and Broadway \u2013 an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]], a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]], and a [[Tony Award]] \u2014 now known collectively as an [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards|EGOT]]. In addition, he was awarded a [[Pulitzer Prize]], making him one of only two people to receive all five awards ([[Marvin Hamlisch]] is the other). \n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\nBorn into a prosperous German Jewish family in [[Arverne, Queens]], New York City, Rodgers was the son of Mamie (Levy) and Dr. William Abrahams Rodgers, a prominent physician who had changed the family name from Rogazinsky. Richard began playing the piano at the age of six. He attended P.S. 166, Townsend Harris Hall and [[DeWitt Clinton High School]]. Rodgers spent his early teenage summers in Camp Wigwam ([[Waterford, Maine]]) where he composed some of his first songs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hyland-rodgers.html Hyland, William G: ''Richard Rodgers''] ''The New York Times'', Chapter 1. Yale University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07115-9}}</ref>\n\nRodgers, [[Lorenz Hart]], and later collaborator [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] all attended [[Columbia University]]. At Columbia, Rodgers joined the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] fraternity. In 1921, Rodgers shifted his studies to the Institute of Musical Art (now the [[Juilliard School]]).<ref>Richard Rodgers, ''Musical Stages: An Autobiography'' (2002 Reissue),  pp. 12,20\u201321,44, DaCapo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-81134-0}}</ref> Rodgers was influenced by composers such as [[Victor Herbert]] and [[Jerome Kern]], as well as by the [[operetta]]s his parents took him to see on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] when he was a child.\n\n===Career===\n\n====Rodgers and Hart====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hart}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hart NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Rodgers (seated) with [[Lorenz Hart]] in 1936.]]\nIn 1919, Richard met [[Lorenz Hart]], thanks to Phillip Levitt, a friend of Richard's older brother. [[Rodgers and Hart]] struggled for years in the field of musical comedy, writing several amateur shows. They made their professional debut with the song \"Any Old Place With You\", featured in the 1919 Broadway musical comedy ''A Lonely Romeo''. Their first professional production was the 1920 ''[[Poor Little Ritz Girl]]'', which also had music by [[Sigmund Romberg]]. Their next professional show, ''The Melody Man'', did not premiere until 1924.\n\nWhen he was just out of college Rodgers worked as musical director for [[Lew Fields]]. Among the stars he accompanied were [[Nora Bayes]] and [[Fred Allen]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VVpeiKxbHk Rodgers & Hammerstein as mystery guests on What's My Line?], Feb 19, 1956, video on YouTube</ref> Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, when he and Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious [[Theatre Guild]], called ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit \u2014 the song that Rodgers believed \"made\" Rodgers and Hart \u2014 was \"[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]\". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.\n\nThroughout the rest of the decade, the duo wrote several hit shows for both Broadway and London, including ''[[Dearest Enemy]]'' (1925), ''[[The Girl Friend]]'' (1926), ''[[Peggy-Ann]]'' (1926), ''[[A Connecticut Yankee (musical)|A Connecticut Yankee]]'' (1927), and ''[[Present Arms (musical)|Present Arms]]'' (1928).  Their 1920s shows produced standards such as \"[[Here in My Arms]]\", \"[[Mountain Greenery]]\", \"[[Blue Room (1926 song)|Blue Room]]\", \"[[My Heart Stood Still]]\" and \"[[You Took Advantage of Me]]\".\n\nWith the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in full swing during the first half of the 1930s, the team sought greener pastures in Hollywood. The hardworking Rodgers later regretted these relatively fallow years, but he and Hart did write some classic songs and film scores while out west, including ''[[Love Me Tonight]]'' (1932) (directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]], who would later direct Rodgers's ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' on Broadway), which introduced three standards: \"[[Lover (Rodgers and Hart song)|Lover]]\", \"[[Mimi (song)|Mimi]]\", and \"[[Isn't It Romantic?]]\". Rodgers also wrote a melody for which Hart wrote three consecutive lyrics which either were cut, not recorded or not a hit. The fourth lyric resulted in one of their most famous songs, \"[[Blue Moon (song)|Blue Moon]]\". Other film work includes the scores to ''[[The Phantom President]]'' (1932), starring [[George M. Cohan]], ''Hallelujah, I'm a Bum'' (1933), starring [[Al Jolson]], and, in a quick return after having left Hollywood, ''Mississippi'' (1935), starring [[Bing Crosby]] and [[W. C. Fields]].\n\nIn 1935, they returned to Broadway and wrote an almost unbroken string of hit shows that ended only with Hart's death in 1943. Among the most notable are ''[[Jumbo (musical)|Jumbo]]'' (1935), ''[[On Your Toes]]'' (1936, which included the ballet \"[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]\", choreographed by George Balanchine), ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[I Married an Angel]]'' (1938), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938), ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940), and their last original work, ''[[By Jupiter]]'' (1942). Rodgers also contributed to the book on several of these shows.\n\nMany of the songs from these shows are still sung and remembered, including \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl in the World (1935 song)|The Most Beautiful Girl in the World]]\", \"[[My Romance (song)|My Romance]]\", \"[[Little Girl Blue (song)|Little Girl Blue]]\", \"[[I'll Tell the Man in the Street]]\", \"[[There's a Small Hotel]]\", \"[[Where or When]]\", \"[[My Funny Valentine]]\", \"[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]\", \"[[Falling in Love with Love]]\", \"[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]\", and \"[[Wait till You See Her]]\".\n\nIn 1939, he wrote the ballet ''Ghost Town'' for the [[Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo]], with choreography by [[Marc Platt (dancer)|Marc Platoff]].<ref>Anna Kisselgoff, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E1D9173CF930A15753C1A9649C8B63 \"DANCE REVIEW; Rodgers As Ideal Dance Partner\"], ''The New York Times'', October 23, 2002.</ref>\n\n====Rodgers and Hammerstein====\n{{Main|Rodgers and Hammerstein}}\n[[File:Rodgers and Hammerstein at piano-original.jpg|thumb|Rodgers (seated) with Hammerstein, 1945]]\nRodgers' partnership with Hart began having problems because of the lyricist's unreliability and declining health. Rodgers began working with [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], with whom he had previously written songs (before ever working with Lorenz Hart). Their first musical, the groundbreaking hit ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' (1943), marked the beginning of the most successful partnership in American musical theatre history. Their work revolutionized the musical form. What was once a collection of songs, dances and comic turns held together by a tenuous plot became a fully integrated piece.\n\nThe team went on to create four more hits that are among the most popular in musical history. Each was made into a successful film: ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' (1945), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949, winner of the 1950 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama), ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951), and ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' (1959). Other shows include the minor hit ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' (1958), as well as relative failures ''[[Allegro (musical)|Allegro]]'' (1947), ''[[Me and Juliet]]'' (1953), and ''[[Pipe Dream (musical)|Pipe Dream]]'' (1955). They also wrote the score to the film ''[[State Fair (1945 film)|State Fair]]'' (1945) (which was remade in 1962 with [[Pat Boone]]) and a special TV musical of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]'' (1957).\n\nTheir collaboration produced many well-known songs, including \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\", \"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\", \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (which also became the state song of Oklahoma), \"It's A Grand Night For Singing\", \"[[If I Loved You]]\", \"[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]\", \"[[It Might as Well Be Spring]]\", \"[[Some Enchanted Evening]]\", \"[[Younger Than Springtime]]\", \"[[Bali Hai]]\", \"[[Getting to Know You (song)|Getting to Know You]]\", \"[[My Favorite Things (song)|My Favorite Things]]\", \"[[The Sound of Music (song)|The Sound of Music]]\", \"[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]\", \"[[Climb Ev'ry Mountain]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"[[Edelweiss (song)|Edelweiss]]\", Hammerstein's last song.\n[[File:Richard Rodgers Ed Sullivan 1952.JPG|thumb|Rodgers was the subject of a two-part special on [[Ed Sullivan]]'s ''Toast of the Town'' television show in 1952.]]\nMuch of Rodgers' work with both Hart and Hammerstein was orchestrated by [[Robert Russell Bennett]]. Rodgers composed twelve themes, which Bennett used in preparing the orchestra score for the 26-episode [[World War II]] television documentary ''[[Victory at Sea]]'' (1952\u201353). This [[NBC]] production pioneered the \"compilation documentary\"\u2014programming based on pre-existing footage \u2014 and was eventually broadcast in dozens of countries. The melody of the popular song \"[[No Other Love (1953 song)|No Other Love]]\"was later taken from the ''Victory at Sea'' theme entitled \"Beneath the Southern Cross\".  Rodgers won an [[Emmy]] for the music for the ABC documentary ''[[The Valiant Years|Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years]]'', scored by [[Eddie Sauter]], [[Hershy Kay]], and [[Robert Emmett Dolan]]. Rodgers composed the theme music, \"[[March of the Clowns]]\", for the 1963\u201364 television series ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', which ran for 30 episodes. He also contributed the main-title theme for the 1963\u201364 historical anthology television series [[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|''The Great Adventure'']].\n\nIn 1950, [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal Award \"in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York.\" Rodgers, Hammerstein, and [[Joshua Logan]] won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama]] for ''South Pacific''.<ref>[http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Drama \"Drama\"].

Retrieved December 3, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Rodgers conducted the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] in excerpts from ''Victory at Sea'', ''[[Slaughter on Tenth Avenue]]'' and the ''[[Carousel Waltz]]'' for a special LP released by [[Columbia Records]].\n\n[[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musicals earned a total of 37 [[Tony Award]]s, 15 [[Academy Awards]], two [[Pulitzer Prize]]s, two [[Grammy Award]]s, and two [[Emmy Award]]s.\n\n====After Hammerstein====\nAfter Hammerstein's death in 1960, Rodgers wrote both words and music for his first new Broadway project ''[[No Strings]]'' (1962, which earned two Tony Awards). The show was a minor hit and featured the song, \"[[The Sweetest Sounds (song)|The Sweetest Sounds]]\".\n\nRodgers also wrote both the words and music for two new songs used in the film version of [[The Sound of Music (film)|''The Sound of Music'']]. (Other songs in that film were from Rodgers and Hammerstein.)\n\nRodgers went on to work with lyricists: [[Stephen Sondheim]] (''[[Do I Hear a Waltz?]]'') who was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Hammerstein, [[Martin Charnin]] (''[[Two by Two (musical)|Two by Two]],'' ''[[I Remember Mama (musical)|I Remember Mama]]'') and [[Sheldon Harnick]] (''[[Rex (musical)|Rex]]'').\n\nAt its 1978 commencement ceremonies, [[Barnard College]] awarded Rodgers its highest honor, the [[List of Barnard College people#Recipients of the Medal of Distinction|Barnard Medal of Distinction]].\n\nRodgers was an honoree at the first [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1978.\n\nAt the 1979 Tony Awards ceremony\u2014six months before his death\u2014Rodgers was presented the Lawrence Langner Memorial Award for Distinguished Lifetime Achievement in the American Theatre.\n\n====Death and legacy====\nRodgers died in 1979, aged 77, after surviving cancer of the jaw, a heart attack, and a [[laryngectomy]]. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at sea.\n\nIn 1990, the 46th Street Theatre was renamed the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in his memory. In 1999, Rodgers and Hart were each commemorated on United States postage stamps. In 2002, the centennial year of Rodgers' birth was celebrated worldwide with books, retrospectives, performances, new recordings of his music, and a Broadway revival of ''Oklahoma!''. The [[BBC Proms]] that year devoted an entire evening to Rodgers' music, including a concert performance of ''Oklahoma!'' The [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] released a new CD that year in tribute to Rodgers, entitled ''My Favorite Things: A Richard Rodgers Celebration''.\n\n[[Alec Wilder]] wrote the following about Rodgers:\n\n{{quote|Of all the writers whose songs are considered and examined in this book, those of Rodgers show the highest degree of consistent excellence, inventiveness, and sophistication ... [A]fter spending weeks playing his songs, I am more than impressed and respectful: I am astonished.<ref>Wilder, Alec, 1973.
