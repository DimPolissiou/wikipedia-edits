Originally part of the [[Lordship of Meath]], it was then constituted as part of the historic [[County Dublin]]. Today, it lies in the modern [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[Fingal]]. The barony was original also a feudal title, which became one of the subsidiary titles of the Viscounts Gormanston.\n\n==History==\nThe barony was created by [[Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath]] as his own feudal barony, to be held directly from himself ''[[in capite]]'' (his vassals were commonly called \"De Lacy's Barons\".)<ref>Vicissitudes of Families by Sir Bernard Burke, Ulster King of Arms, Longman Green Longman and Roberts, Paternoster Row, London, 1861 (pages 363-364)</ref> The first vassal was [[Hugh Tyrrel]] in [[1177 in Ireland|1177]]. It was held for three and a half knight's fees, owed to the superior Lord of [[Fingal]]. The title and lands of Castleknock were held by the Tyrell family until 1370 when Hugh Tyrell and his wife died of the [[Plague (disease)|plague]]. It later passed to the [[Viscount Gormanston]].\n\n\n==Location==\nAt the heart of the barony is the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]] of the same name - [[Castleknock (civil parish)|Castleknock]] - which is one of eight civil parishes in the barony. In the [[townland]] of Castleknock itself is the location of the eponymous \"Cnucha's Castle\" - [[Castleknock Castle]]. The town with the biggest population in the barony is [[Blanchardstown]].  It is one of seven and a half baronies that used to comprise the old [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of Dublin.<ref>According to the \"Local Government Act, 2001\", section 10(2): \"The State continues to stand divided into local government areas to be known as counties and cities which are the areas set out in Parts 1 and 2, respectively, of Schedule 5.\" It is clear from SCHEDULE 5, Local Government Areas (Counties and Cities, PART 1, that \"Dublin\" is defined only as a city (as distinct from a county).</ref> It stretches from [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]] to [[Blanchardstown]] (from east to west) and from [[Finglas]] to [[Chapelizod]] (from north to south). \n\nThe Castleknock barony is located between the baronies of [[Coolock (barony)|Coolock]] to the east, [[Nethercross]] to the north and [[Dublin (barony)|Dublin]] to the southwest. The [[River Liffey]] separates it from the remaining baronies of County Dublin. With the exception of the parish of Chapelizod, the remainder of the barony is contained within the modern [[Counties of Ireland|county]] of [[Fingal]] and it is subject to [[Fingal County Council]].\n\n==Legal context==\nBaronies were created after the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] as subdivisions of counties and were used for administration. At the time of its creation, Castleknock was part of the [[Lordship of Meath]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. While they have been administratively obsolete since 1898, they continue to be used in land registration, and specification such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier [[Gaels|Gaelic]] t\u00faath which had submitted to the Crown. This is probably true in the case of  Castleknock.\n\n==Civil parishes==\n\n===Civil parish of Castleknock===\nWhat is now the parish of [[Castleknock (civil parish)|Castleknock]] was granted by the Lord of Meath to Hugh Tyrrell. Copies of the grant were discovered in the London Public Records Office in 1933 by Eric St. John Brooks.<ref>''The Barony of Castleknock'', A History\", Lacey, Jim; The History Press Ireland, 2015, pg 98</ref> In English, the grant reads:<blockquote>\"Henry, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Aquitaine and Normandy and Count of Anjou to the Archbishops, Bishops, Ministers and all Earls, Barons, Justices, Sheriffs, Ministers and all his faithful French, English and Irish, greeting. Know that I have conceded, given, and by present Charter confirmed to Hugh Tirel, the man of Hugh de Lacy, Thwothyn and Thwothrom.\"<ref>''The grant of Castleknock to Hugh Tyrel.'', The journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland. 7th series; ROYAL SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES OF IRELAND; Dublin Hodges, Figgis; 3v.; English; Holdings: Vol. 1-vol. 3; 1931-1933.; Also numbered vol. 61-63 of consecutive series. Continues 6th series; University of Liverpool Libraries</ref></blockquote>\n\nBrooks deduces that \"Thwo\" is an Anglicisation of the Gaelic word ''tuath'' and that \"throm\" is an Anglicisation of the word ''droma'' which means ridge or hill - a possible reference to the hill of Castleknock where Tyrrell was to build his castle.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nTownlands in the civil parish of Castleknock:<ref group=\"l\">[http://www.logainm.ie/835.aspx Castleknock civil parish]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
