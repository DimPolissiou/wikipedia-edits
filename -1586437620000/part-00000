The title of the album is a [[portmanteau]] of the English words \"[[whore]]\" and \"[[oracle]]\". \n\nApart from \"[[Everything Counts]]\", which is a cover of a [[Depeche Mode]] song, all songs were composed and arranged by [[In Flames]]. The lyrics were translated by [[Dark Tranquillity]] guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], after [[Anders Frid\u00e9n]] had written them in Swedish. \n\n''Whoracle'' is the final album to feature [[Johan Larsson (musician)|Johan Larsson]] & [[Glenn Ljungstr\u00f6m]]. It is also the last ''In Flames'' release with [[Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte]] playing drums, as he permanently switched to lead guitar in future releases.

{"title_page": "List of Soyuz missions", "text_new": "This is a list of crewed and uncrewed flights of [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz series spacecraft]].\n\nThe [[Soyuz programme]] is an ongoing [[human spaceflight]] programme which was initiated by the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, originally part of a [[Moon landing]] project intended to put a Soviet [[cosmonaut]] on the Moon. It is the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] programmes. Since the 1990s, as the successor state to the Soviet Union, [[Russia]] has continued and expanded the programme, which became part of a multinational collaboration to ensure a permanent human presence in [[low Earth orbit]] on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Since the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] in 2011, Soyuz spacecraft are the exclusive vessels ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\n==Crewed mission numbers and spacecraft generations==\n\nBeginning in 1967, the Soyuz programme has sent humans into space on a regular basis for over fifty years.  Due to its length, the program has a complex history, which may lead to confusion about its ''mission numbers''.  The mission numbering scheme for crewed Soyuz flights is closely related to the generations of ''Soyuz spacecraft''.  Understanding the former is made significantly easier by understanding the latter.\n\nThe first era of the Soyuz programme's crewed missions (Soyuz 1-40) used the ''7K series'' of Soyuz craft, which included the first-generation (1.0) [[Soyuz 7K-OK]], a variant (1.5) [[Soyuz 7K-OKS]], the second-generation (2.0) [[Soyuz 7K-T]], and the (2.5) [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] variant.  Following this first era, successive eras of crewed missions have had mission numbers which were directly tied to the names of craft used:\n\n* The second era of [[Soyuz T]] flights used the third-generation (3.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz T-#\".\n* The third era of [[Soyuz TM]] flights used the fourth-generation (4.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz TM-#\".\n* The fourth era of [[Soyuz TMA]] flights used the fifth-generation (5.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz TMA-#\".\n* The fifth era of [[Soyuz TMA-M]] flights used the fifth-generation variant (5.5) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form \"Soyuz TMA-##M\".\n* The sixth and current era of [[Soyuz MS]] flights uses the sixth-generation (6.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers are of the form: \"Soyuz MS-##\".\n\nWithin each given era, a mission number generally reflects the mission's chronological launch order, e.g. [[Soyuz TMA-12M]] was the twelfth mission of the TMA-M era, immediately preceded by [[Soyuz TMA-11M]] and immediately followed by [[Soyuz TMA-13M]].  Although there are exceptions to this (detailed below in the first table), the mission numbering scheme is usually consistent with chronological launch orders.  This is in contrast with the [[List of Space Shuttle missions|mission numbers]] of the [[Space Shuttle]] program, which were tied to specific mission objectives and did not reflect chronological launch orders, e.g. [[STS-50]], the forty-eighth Shuttle mission, was immediately followed by [[STS-46]], the forty-ninth Shuttle mission.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

It is the third Soviet human spaceflight programme after the [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] and [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] programmes. Since the 1990s, as the successor state to the Soviet Union, [[Russia]] has continued and expanded the programme, which became part of a multinational collaboration to ensure a permanent human presence in [[low Earth orbit]] on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). Since the retirement of the [[Space Shuttle]] in 2011, Soyuz spacecraft are the exclusive vessels ferrying astronauts to and from the ISS.\n\n==Crewed mission numbers and spacecraft generations==\n\nBeginning in 1967, the Soyuz programme has sent humans into space on a regular basis for over fifty years.  Due to its length, the program has a complex history, which may lead to confusion about its ''mission numbers''.  The mission numbering scheme for crewed Soyuz flights is closely related to the generations of ''Soyuz spacecraft''.  Understanding the former is made significantly easier by understanding the latter.\n\nThe first era of the Soyuz programme's crewed missions (Soyuz 1-40) used the ''7K series'' of Soyuz craft, which included the first-generation (1.0) [[Soyuz 7K-OK]], a variant (1.5) [[Soyuz 7K-OKS]], the second-generation (2.0) [[Soyuz 7K-T]], and the (2.5) [[Soyuz 7K-TM]] variant.  Following this first era, successive eras of crewed missions have had mission numbers which were directly tied to the names of craft used:\n\n* The second era of [[Soyuz T]] flights used the third-generation (3.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz T-#\".\n* The third era of [[Soyuz TM]] flights used the fourth-generation (4.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz TM-#\".\n* The fourth era of [[Soyuz TMA]] flights used the fifth-generation (5.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form: \"Soyuz TMA-#\".\n* The fifth era of [[Soyuz TMA-M]] flights used the fifth-generation variant (5.5) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers were of the form \"Soyuz TMA-##M\".\n* The sixth and current era of [[Soyuz MS]] flights uses the sixth-generation (6.0) craft of the same name.  Mission numbers are of the form: \"Soyuz MS-##\".\n\nWithin each given era, a mission number generally reflects the mission's chronological launch order, e.g. [[Soyuz TMA-12M]] was the twelfth mission of the TMA-M era, immediately preceded by [[Soyuz TMA-11M]] and immediately followed by [[Soyuz TMA-13M]].  Although there are exceptions to this (detailed below in the first table), the mission numbering scheme is usually consistent with chronological launch orders.  This is in contrast with the [[List of Space Shuttle missions|mission numbers]] of the [[Space Shuttle]] program, which were tied to specific mission objectives and did not reflect chronological launch orders, e.g. [[STS-50]], the forty-eighth Shuttle mission, was immediately followed by [[STS-46]], the forty-ninth Shuttle mission.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

Thank you.-->\n\n'''Blond''' or '''fair hair''' is a [[Human hair color|hair color]] characterized by low levels of the dark [[pigment]] [[eumelanin]]. The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.''

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders. The two forms, however, are pronounced identically. [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'s ''Book of English Usage'' propounds that, insofar as \"a blonde\" can be used to describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term is an example of a \"[[sexism|sexist]] stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.\"<ref name=\"AHBEU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/002.html |title=5.

The ''OED'' gives \"brunet\" as meaning \"dark-complexioned\" or a \"dark-complexioned person\", citing a comparative usage of ''brunet'' and ''blond'' to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in saying, \"The present contrast of blonds and brunets existed among them.\"<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50028357 \"brunet, a. and n.\"] ''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

For example, the ''OED'' records its use in 19th-century [[poetic diction]] to describe flowers, \"a variety of clay ironstone of the coal measures\", \"the colour of raw silk\",<ref name=OED1992/> a breed of [[Batoidea|ray]], [[lager]] [[beer]], and pale wood.<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50023771 \"blonde, blond, a. and n.\"] ''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

Although the position of the French in regard to hair pigmentation is intermediate between blond and black, the diagonal line from [[Mont St. Michel]] to [[Orleans]], [[Lyons]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] border divides the country into a northeastern quadrant, in which the hair is somewhat lighter than medium, and a southwestern, in which it is somewhat darker. High ratios of black and very dark brown hair are found not in the typically Alpine country, but along the slope of the Pyrenees, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking country, and on the Mediterranean seacoast. Blond hair is commonest along the [[English Channel|Channel]], in regions settled by [[Saxons]] and [[Normans]], in [[Burgundy]] and the country bordering [[Switzerland]], and down the course of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]]. In northern France it seems to follow upstream the rivers which empty into the Channel.

The resultant visible hue depends on various factors, but always has some [[yellow]]ish color. The color can be from the very pale blond (caused by a patchy, scarce distribution of pigment) to reddish \"strawberry\" blond or golden-brownish (\"sandy\") blond colors (the latter with more eumelanin). \n\nBecause hair color tends to darken with age, natural blond hair is significantly less common in adulthood. Naturally-occurring blond hair is primarily found in populations of [[northern Europe]]an descent and may have evolved to enable more efficient synthesis of [[vitamin D]], due to northern Europe's lower levels of sunlight. Blond hair has also developed in other populations, although it is usually not as common, and can be found among natives of the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]], among the [[Berbers]] of North Africa, and among some Asians.\n\nIn [[Western culture]], blond hair has long been associated with female beauty. [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of love and beauty, was described as having blond hair. In [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]], blond hair was frequently associated with prostitutes, who dyed their hair using [[saffron]] dyes in order to attract customers. The Greeks stereotyped [[Thracians]] and [[Slavery in ancient Greece|slaves]] as blond and the Romans associated blondness with the [[Celts]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Germans]] to the north. In western Europe during the [[Middle Ages]], long, blond hair was idealized as the paragon of female beauty. The [[Norse mythology|Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] and the medieval heroine [[Iseult]] were both significantly portrayed as blond and, in [[medieval art]]work, [[Eve]], [[Mary Magdalene]], and the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] are often shown with blond hair. In contemporary western culture, blond women [[Blonde stereotype|are often negatively stereotyped]] as sexually attractive, but unintelligent. \n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, [[Scientific racism|scientific racists]] categorized blond hair and blue eyes as characteristics of the supreme [[Nordic race]].\n==Etymology, spelling, and grammar==\n[[File:Anonymous Ferdinand of Austria in Hungarian costume (detail).jpg|upright|thumb|Detail of a portrait of Crown Prince of Poland [[Sigismund Casimir|Sigismund Casimir Vasa]] ({{circa}} 1644), with characteristic blond hair which darkened with time as confirmed by his later effigies.]]\n\n===Origins and meanings===\nThe word \"blond\" is first documented in English in 1481<ref>\"blonde|blond, adj. and n.\". ''OED Online.'' March 2012. ''Oxford University Press.''

This earlier use of \"fair\" survives in the proper name [[wikt:Special:Search/fairfax|Fairfax]], from Old English ''f\u00e6\u0121er-feahs'' meaning \"blond hair\".\n\nThe word \"blond\" has two possible origins. Some linguists{{who|date=August 2018}} say it comes from [[Medieval Latin]] ''blundus'', meaning \"yellow\", from [[Old Frankish]] ''blund'' which would relate it to Old English ''blonden-feax'' meaning \"grey-haired\", from ''blondan/blandan'' meaning \"to mix\" (Cf. ''blend'').{{citation needed |date=December 2011}} Also, Old English ''beblonden'' meant \"dyed\", as ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] warriors were noted for dyeing their hair. However, linguists who favor a Latin origin for the word say that Medieval Latin ''blundus'' was a vulgar pronunciation of Latin ''[[wikt:flavus|flavus]]'', also meaning \"yellow\". Most authorities, especially French, attest to the Frankish origin. The word was reintroduced into English in the 17th century from French, and was for some time considered French; in French, \"blonde\" is a feminine ''adjective''; it describes a woman with blond hair.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none Origin of \"blonde\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009133722/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=blonde&searchmode=none |date=2008-10-09 }}, from [[Online Etymology Dictionary]].</ref>\n.\n===Usage===\n[[File:Pedro II of Brazil 1846 by Rugendas.png|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]] ([[House of Braganza]]) with blond hair, c. 1846]]\n\n\"Blond\", with its continued gender-varied usage, is one of few adjectives in written English to retain separate lexical genders. The two forms, however, are pronounced identically. [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage]]'s ''Book of English Usage'' propounds that, insofar as \"a blonde\" can be used to describe a woman but not a man who is merely said to possess blond(e) hair, the term is an example of a \"[[sexism|sexist]] stereotype [whereby] women are primarily defined by their physical characteristics.\"<ref name=\"AHBEU\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/64/C005/002.html |title=5.

The ''OED'' gives \"brunet\" as meaning \"dark-complexioned\" or a \"dark-complexioned person\", citing a comparative usage of ''brunet'' and ''blond'' to [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] in saying, \"The present contrast of blonds and brunets existed among them.\"<ref>[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50028357 \"brunet, a. and n.\"] ''The [[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

''Biological Perspectives on Human Pigmentation.'' Cambridge University Press, 1991, pp. 195\u2013208.</ref> Lighter skin is due to a low concentration in pigmentation, thus allowing more sunlight to trigger the production of vitamin D. In this way, high frequencies of light hair in northern latitudes are a result of the light skin adaptation to lower levels of solar radiation, which reduces the prevalence of [[rickets]] caused by vitamin D deficiency. The darker pigmentation at higher latitudes in certain ethnic groups such as the [[Inuit]] is explained by a greater proportion of seafood in their diet and by the climate which they live in, because in the polar climate there results in more ice or snow on the ground and reflects the solar radiation onto the skin, making this environment lack the conditions for the person to have blond, [[Brown hair|brown]] or red hair, light skin and blue, grey or green eyes.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis was presented by Canadian anthropologist Peter Frost, who claims blond hair evolved very quickly in a specific area at the end of the last ice age by means of [[sexual selection]].<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ehbonline.org/article/PIIS1090513805000590/abstract Abstract: \"European hair and eye colour: A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection?\"] from ''Evolution and Human Behavior'', Volume 27, Issue 2, pp. 85\u2013103 (March 2006)</ref> According to Frost, the appearance of blond hair and blue eyes in some northern European women made them stand out from their rivals, and more sexually appealing to men, at a time of fierce competition for scarce males.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |title=Frost: Why Do Europeans Have So Many Hair and Eye Colors? |website=cogweb.ucla.edu |access-date=2016-08-21 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825190147/http://cogweb.ucla.edu/ep/Frost_06.html |archivedate=2016-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nThe derived allele of [[KITLG]] associated with  blond hair in modern Europeans is present in several individuals of the [[Ancient North Eurasian]] (ANE) lineage, and is recorded in Mesolithic Eastern Europe as associated with the Eastern European Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) lineage derived from ANE.

Although the position of the French in regard to hair pigmentation is intermediate between blond and black, the diagonal line from [[Mont St. Michel]] to [[Orleans]], [[Lyons]], and the [[Italy|Italian]] border divides the country into a northeastern quadrant, in which the hair is somewhat lighter than medium, and a southwestern, in which it is somewhat darker. High ratios of black and very dark brown hair are found not in the typically Alpine country, but along the slope of the Pyrenees, in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-speaking country, and on the Mediterranean seacoast. Blond hair is commonest along the [[English Channel|Channel]], in regions settled by [[Saxons]] and [[Normans]], in [[Burgundy]] and the country bordering [[Switzerland]], and down the course of the [[Rh\u00f4ne]]. In northern France it seems to follow upstream the rivers which empty into the Channel. The hair color of the departments occupied by [[Flemish]] speakers, and of others directly across the Channel from England in Normandy, seems to be nearly as light as that in the southern English counties; the coastal cantons of [[Brittany]] are lighter than the inland ones, and approximate a [[Cornish people|Cornish]] condition.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China. Both Manchester United and Barcelona achieved less in their subsequent tour matches in the country in the same year.<ref name=\"Stockport County scores in China's business league\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/1462568/Stockport-County-scores-in-Chinas-business-league.html| title=Stockport County scores in China's business league| work=Telegraph|date=22 May 2004 |last=Spencer|first=Richard|accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref> Stockport were watched by 22,000 in Yingkou against their then sister side Stockport Tiger Star whom they beat 4\u20130.

During the 2005\u201306 season, home attendances (that is, given attendances minus away support) increased slightly on the season before,<ref name=Programmes>Stockport County Official Match Programmes, 2004\u20132015</ref> helped by a 10,006 crowd against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle]] on the final day of the season. That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]]. If Stockport had lost that particular game, they would have been relegated for the second successive season, and more significantly, would have been relegated from [[the Football League]] for the first time, an embarrassment as the team had competed continuously in [[the Football League]] since 1900. Stockport eventually drew the game with Carlisle and survived the drop, while Carlisle themselves gained the league championship.<ref name=\"Stockport 0-0 Carlisle\">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_3/4957616.stm| title=Stockport 0\u20130 Carlisle| publisher= BBC Sport | accessdate=9 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season saw the club average the fourth highest average attendance in [[League Two]], and was the highest average since the club's last season in the First Division.<ref name=\"HISTORY OF ENGLISH FOOTBALL\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attnclub/stpc.htm| title=History of English Football \u2013 Stockport County FC| publisher= European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012}}</ref> The 2007\u201308 season saw a further increase in attendance.

During these games Stockport's away support outnumbering home supporters on a number of occasions. Stockport County had an average away attendance of over 900, the highest in the league.

This was abandoned after the outbreak of the [[Falklands War]],<ref name=\"Background\" /> and the club returned to blue and white striped tops with blue shorts in the 1980s.

It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield. The [[Stockport County Supporters' Co - Operative]] used the blue on white cross symbol from the 1978 badge as the main identifier in their company logo. County's kit was supplied by local manufacturer [[Umbro]] who supplied all three of County's kit for the 2013\u201314 season, replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], thus making County the only senior club in

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the film's action takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. \n\nEach story in chronological order, not the order as presented in the movie:\n\n'''1923''' -- Virginia Woolf has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. Virginia, who has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children are coming over for an afternoon visit. When Vanessa arrives, she and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. During the visit Vanessa's children find a dead bird. While Vanessa and her two sons are preparing the bird's grave, Virginia and Vanessa's daughter, Angelica, prepare the bird's funeral. After the funeral is done, Virginia lays down just like the bird and sees herself in the dead bird. Before Vanessa and her children leave, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. Vanessa's visit as well as the dead bird causes Virginia to think about her life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London. Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.\n\n'''1951''' -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure.

Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty acts as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and ''Mrs. Dalloway'' from her purse and begins to read it. She drifts off to sleep and dreams the hotel room is flooded. She awakens with a change of heart and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie, who fearfully tells his mother he loves her, and they return home to celebrate Dan's birthday.\n\n'''2001''' -- New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan is the embodiment of the novel's title character. She spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard, a poet and author living with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] who is to receive a major literary award. Clarissa, who is bisexual and has been living with Sally Lester for 10 years, was in a relationship with Richard during their college years. She meets with Richard's ex-lover Louis Waters, who has returned for the festivities. Clarissa's daughter, Julia, comes home to help her prepare. Clarissa visits Richard and he tells Clarissa that he has stayed alive for her sake and that the award is meaningless because he didn't get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tries reassuring him. Richard often refers to Clarissa as \"Mrs. Dalloway\" \u2013 her namesake \u2013 because she distracts herself from her own life the way that the Woolf character does. Richard tells Clarissa that she is the most beautiful thing that he ever had in life, before he commits suicide in front of her. Later that night, Richard's mother, Laura Brown, arrives at Clarissa's apartment. Laura is aware that her abandonment of her family was deeply traumatic for Richard, but Laura reveals that it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter than to commit suicide. She does not apologize for the hurt that she caused to her family and suggests that it's not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but she offers an explanation: \"It was death.

Supporting roles are played by [[Ed Harris]], [[John C. Reilly]], [[Stephen Dillane]], [[Jeff Daniels]], [[Miranda Richardson]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Claire Danes]], and [[Eileen Atkins]]. The screenplay by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] is based on [[Michael Cunningham]]'s 1998 [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning [[The Hours (novel)|novel of the same title]].\n\nThe plot focuses on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' by [[Virginia Woolf]]. These are Clarissa Vaughan (Streep), a New Yorker preparing an award party for her [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]-stricken long-time friend and poet, Richard (Harris) in 2001; Laura Brown (Moore), a pregnant 1950s California housewife in an unhappy marriage with a young son; and Virginia Woolf (Kidman) herself in 1920s England, who is struggling with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel.\n\nThe film was released in Los Angeles and New York City on [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] 2002, and was given a [[limited release]] in the United States and Canada two days later on December 27, 2002. It did not receive a [[wide release]] in North America until January 2003, and was then released in British cinemas on [[Valentine's Day]] that year. Critical reaction to the film was largely positive, with nine [[Academy Award]] nominations for ''The Hours'' including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], and a win for [[Nicole Kidman]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\n==Plot==\nWith the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 [[suicide]] by drowning of [[Virginia Woolf]] in the [[River Ouse, Sussex|River Ouse]], the film's action takes place within the span of a single day in three different decades and alternates between them throughout the film. \n\nEach story in chronological order, not the order as presented in the movie:\n\n'''1923''' -- Virginia Woolf has begun writing the book ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' in her home in the town of [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] outside [[London]]. Virginia, who has experienced several [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]]s and suffers from depression, feels trapped in her home. She is intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband, [[Leonard Woolf|Leonard]], who has begun a publishing business at home, [[Hogarth Press]], to stay close to her. Virginia's sister, [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]], and her children are coming over for an afternoon visit. When Vanessa arrives, she and Virginia talk about Vanessa's life in London and Virginia's mental condition. During the visit Vanessa's children find a dead bird. While Vanessa and her two sons are preparing the bird's grave, Virginia and Vanessa's daughter, Angelica, prepare the bird's funeral. After the funeral is done, Virginia lays down just like the bird and sees herself in the dead bird. Before Vanessa and her children leave, Virginia passionately kisses her sister. Vanessa's visit as well as the dead bird causes Virginia to think about her life. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station, where she is awaiting a train to central London. Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also but argues that if she is to live, she has the right to decide how and where.\n\n'''1951''' -- Pregnant with her second child, Laura Brown spends her days in her [[Tract housing|tract home]] with her young son, Richie, and escapes from her conventional life by reading ''Mrs Dalloway''. She married her husband, Dan, soon after [[World War II]]. On the surface they are living the [[American Dream]], but she is nonetheless deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan's birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbor Kitty drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she's in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty reveals that the procedure is related to the fact that she has been unable to conceive, and may portend permanent infertility, and that she really feels that a woman is not complete until she is a mother. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her sadness and fear and boldly kisses her on the lips; Kitty acts as if it didn't happen. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with a babysitter, Mrs. Latch. Richie runs after his mother as she leaves, fearing that she will never come back. Laura checks into a hotel, where she intends to commit suicide.

Formed in 2002 by schoolmates [[Isaac Slade]] and [[Joe King (guitarist)|Joe King]], they achieved success with the release of their debut album, ''[[How to Save a Life (album)|How to Save a Life]]'' in 2005, which was certified [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and platinum in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]], [[Canadian Albums Chart|Canada]], [[RIANZ|New Zealand]] and the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]. The Fray achieved national success with their first single, \"[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]\", which became a top ten hit in the United States. The release of their second single, \"[[How to Save a Life]]\", brought the band worldwide fame. The song charted in the top three of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was a top 5 single in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]], [[Canadian Singles Chart|Canada]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]], [[Italian Singles Chart|Italy]], [[Spanish Singles Chart|Spain]], [[Swedish Singles Chart|Sweden]], and the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]].\n\nThe group's [[The Fray (album)|self-titled]], second album, released in 2009, debuted at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' charts]]<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|last=Kreps |first=Daniel |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/11/on-the-charts-springsteen-slips-to-second-as-the-fray-lock-up-number-one/ |title=On the Charts: Springsteen Slips to Second as the Fray Lock Up Number One : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily |work=RollingStone.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> and was certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in the United States, Australia and Canada.

Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King were several years ahead of drummer Ben Wysocki at Faith Christian Academy. Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh played in the same worship band. In the spring of 2002, former schoolmates Isaac Slade and Joe King reconnected and began regular two-man jam sessions that led to writing songs. Isaac and Joe later added Mike Ayars on guitar, Zach Johnson on drums, and Slade's younger brother Caleb on bass, though Caleb was later asked to leave. Caleb's departure from the band caused a rift in his relationship with Isaac and this rift later became the inspiration for the song \"[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]\", which is about the brothers' waning relationship.<ref name=\"Gitlin\">{{cite magazine|last=Gitlin|first=Lauren|magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Enter the Fray|date=August 10, 2006}}</ref> Following this Johnson left the band as well to attend an art school in New York.\n\nBen Wysocki, a former bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band was named the Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece of paper from which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name suitable because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Sarah|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/02/24/life_less_ordinary/|newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=Life less ordinary|date=February 24, 2006|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.\n\nThe band released its first record, ''[[Movement EP]]'' in 2002.

Formed in 2002 by schoolmates [[Isaac Slade]] and [[Joe King (guitarist)|Joe King]], they achieved success with the release of their debut album, ''[[How to Save a Life (album)|How to Save a Life]]'' in 2005, which was certified [[music recording sales certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] and platinum in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]], [[Canadian Albums Chart|Canada]], [[RIANZ|New Zealand]] and the [[UK Albums Chart|UK]]. The Fray achieved national success with their first single, \"[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]\", which became a top ten hit in the United States. The release of their second single, \"[[How to Save a Life]]\", brought the band worldwide fame. The song charted in the top three of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and was a top 5 single in [[ARIA Charts|Australia]], [[Canadian Singles Chart|Canada]], [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]], [[Italian Singles Chart|Italy]], [[Spanish Singles Chart|Spain]], [[Swedish Singles Chart|Sweden]], and the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]].\n\nThe group's [[The Fray (album)|self-titled]], second album, released in 2009, debuted at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' charts]]<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|last=Kreps |first=Daniel |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/02/11/on-the-charts-springsteen-slips-to-second-as-the-fray-lock-up-number-one/ |title=On the Charts: Springsteen Slips to Second as the Fray Lock Up Number One : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily |work=RollingStone.com |date= |accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> and was certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]] in the United States, Australia and Canada.

The album again received mixed reviews from critics. The band's fourth album, ''[[Helios (album)|Helios]]'', was released in February 2014. The band's compilation album, ''[[Through the Years: The Best of the Fray]]'', was released in November 2016.\n\nThe Fray's use of the piano as the lead instrument in their music has led critics to compare the band with English piano-driven bands such as [[Coldplay]] and [[Keane (band)|Keane]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thefray/albums/album/25463415/review/25524327/the_fray|title=The Fray|last=Hoard|first=Christian|magazine=RollingStone.com|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r790859|pure_url=yes}}|title=How to Save a Life|last=Sendra|first=Tim|work=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/fray_0209.htm|title=The Fray \u2013 The Fray|last=Oliver|first=Nic|work=MusicOMH.com|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> However, the band lists its influences as [[the Wallflowers]], [[Counting Crows]], [[Better Than Ezra]] and [[U2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetabworld.com/The_Fray_biography.html|title=The Fray Biography|work=TheTabWorld.com|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2002\u20132004)===\nThe band members' lives were largely formed in Denver churches where they helped lead worship, and in the Christian school three of them attended. Isaac Slade and guitarist Joe King were several years ahead of drummer Ben Wysocki at Faith Christian Academy. Wysocki and guitarist David Welsh played in the same worship band. In the spring of 2002, former schoolmates Isaac Slade and Joe King reconnected and began regular two-man jam sessions that led to writing songs. Isaac and Joe later added Mike Ayars on guitar, Zach Johnson on drums, and Slade's younger brother Caleb on bass, though Caleb was later asked to leave. Caleb's departure from the band caused a rift in his relationship with Isaac and this rift later became the inspiration for the song \"[[Over My Head (Cable Car)]]\", which is about the brothers' waning relationship.<ref name=\"Gitlin\">{{cite magazine|last=Gitlin|first=Lauren|magazine=Rolling Stone|title=Enter the Fray|date=August 10, 2006}}</ref> Following this Johnson left the band as well to attend an art school in New York.\n\nBen Wysocki, a former bandmate of Isaac Slade, joined as drummer and later, Dave Welsh, who was another former bandmate of Slade and Wysocki, was added as lead guitarist to the band. The newly formed band was named the Fray. The band members decided on a name after asking people to put band names on a piece of paper from which they picked randomly. The members of the band first claimed that they found the name suitable because they frequently quarreled about the composition of the lyrics in their songs, but they have since stated they are usually on good terms while composing music and acknowledges contributions from all of its members.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tomlinson|first=Sarah|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/02/24/life_less_ordinary/|newspaper=The Boston Globe |title=Life less ordinary|date=February 24, 2006|accessdate=February 13, 2010}}</ref> The band has had no permanent bassist since Caleb, instead employing touring bassists on a temporary basis. The current bassist is Jason Hardin, who has been touring with the band since 2014.\n\nThe band released its first record, ''[[Movement EP]]'' in 2002.

Then the cry went up, \"May Our Lord and God protect and keep the queen\", and the queen moved to a throne placed higher on the stage between the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] and [[John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Hamilton|Lord Hamilton]].

They curtsied, and sang, but did not speak; instead another schoolboy spoke for them in verse, explaining to Anne that the muses served the king and she would be their refuge and mother.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 111, 145.</ref> \n[[File:Netherbow E.jpg|thumb|right|The Netherbow or East Port gate of Edinburgh]]\n\n===The Virtues===\nOutside [[St Giles Kirk]] there was a large stage, on which stood the mother Virtue or Piety crowned with her four daughters dressed in black silk with chaplets of flowers on their head. Virtue took off her crown and gave it to the queen. Virtue's speech exhorted Anne to welcome her daughters, [[Prudentia|Prudence]], [[Justitia|Justice]], [[Courage|Fortitude]] and [[Temperantia|Temperance]] into her home where they would watch over her. Each daughter then came forward, Prudence with an [[astrolabe]] in her hand, who counselled against the laziness that brings misfortune; Justice, with her sword and scales, explained that strong castles are built on the principle of equity; Fortitude, with the club of [[Hercules]] and a shield, advised humility in success and patience in failure to disregard sorrow. Temperance, with her hourglass and bridle, counselled self-control. Mother Virtue concluded that the Word of God was the greatest wealth. Then [[Psalm 120]] was sung.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 112-114.</ref>\n\nThe five actors were young men dressed as women. Another account of the event says they held the usual traditional attributes, Prudence a serpent and dove, Fortitude a broken pillar, and Temperance a cup of wine. This discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that the performance involved the virtues picking up these alternative objects.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 146.</ref>\n\n===Banquet of Bacchus and Ceres===\nAnne of Denmark got out of her coach and walked into St Giles under the red velvet canopy or \"paill\" flanked by Peder Munk and Lord Hamilton, while a choir sang [[Psalm 19]]. Robert Bruce preached on the subject of [[Psalm 107]], a reflection of thanksgiving for the safe return of mariners; then [[Psalm 23]] was sung. Outside the church, where the [[Mercat Cross]] is now situated, the next pageant showed the ancestry of the kings of Denmark and the arms of previous Scottish queen consorts. Nearby were [[Bacchus]] and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], played by schoolboys, offering a banquet referring to the abundance of the lands of the queen's \"morning gift\". A big older actor, who had been seated on a wine barrel, got up and threw food gifts into the crowd of spectators.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 114-5, 146.</ref>\n\n===The Family Tree===\nAt the place where salt was weighed, the \"Salt Tron\", where the [[Tron Kirk]] is now, an artificial tree had five stages or branches with boys representing kings and queens with the arms of the monarchs of Denmark and Scotland. At the base of the tree a king in armour resting on a couch was [[Christian I of Denmark]], a common ancestor of James VI and Anne, from whom these monarchs descended, as the Biblical kings [[Tree of Jesse|sprang from Jesse]]. For Anne's benefit, a boy rehearsed her family tree.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 115-7, 146.</ref>\n\n===Solomon and the Queen of Sheba===\nThe final pageant of the Entry took place at the East Port or Netherbow, the gate on the Royal Mile to the Canongate that leads to Holyroodhouse. A dialogue between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was dramatised. The queen said she had come to Solomon to study his unequalled wisdom. She brought him the balsam that does not grow in Scotland, and thanked him for his company which was like drinking at Pallas Athena's breast. Solomon replied that she should always remain in his respect and honour, and so good-night. Then another schoolboy explained to Anne of Denmark that as the Queen of Sheba had desired to meet Solomon, so James had travelled to meet her, and now all Scotland would serve her. He gave Anne of Denmark the town's gift of a jewel, which was lowered from the Netherbow with a length of silk ribbon.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 117-120, 148.</ref> \n\nAnne returned down the Canongate to Holyroodhouse, according to John Burrell, still accompanied by the 40 or 50 young men in costume as \"moors\". Adrian Damman explains that at Holyrood they tied bronze bells to the white buskins or shanks they wore on their lower legs, and began to dance, in contrast to their slow processional walk, as if they were [[Korybantes|Corybants]] followers of the goddess [[Cybele]].<ref>Adriam Damman, 'De Introitu Reg. Annae in Edinburgam' (Edinburgh, 1590).</ref>\n\n===The Jewel===\nThe town had obtained a jewel in security for a loan of \u00a34000 [[Pounds Scots|Scots]] to the king, a locket with a diamond and emerald, and decided to have the goldsmith David Gilbert remake and enlarge it as a gift for the queen.

The child said this rain would fall into her lap, proving the truth of his prediction, alluding to the legend of [[Dana\u00eb]].<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 110, 145.</ref> The 12 boxes of sweets, described as \"scrotcherts and confects\", cost \u00a33-2s-8d [[Pounds Scots|Scots]].<ref>Marguerite Wood, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454498&view=1up&seq=363 ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 331.]</ref>\n\n===The Muses===\nAt the top of the street on the [[Royal Mile]] there was a weigh house for butter, called the \"Butter Tron\".<ref>Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 114.</ref> There nine young women from Edinburgh were dressed as the [[Muses]]. They had elaborate costumes, and held gilt books. John Burrell described the costume in verse. They curtsied, and sang, but did not speak; instead another schoolboy spoke for them in verse, explaining to Anne that the muses served the king and she would be their refuge and mother.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 111, 145.</ref> \n[[File:Netherbow E.jpg|thumb|right|The Netherbow or East Port gate of Edinburgh]]\n\n===The Virtues===\nOutside [[St Giles Kirk]] there was a large stage, on which stood the mother Virtue or Piety crowned with her four daughters dressed in black silk with chaplets of flowers on their head. Virtue took off her crown and gave it to the queen. Virtue's speech exhorted Anne to welcome her daughters, [[Prudentia|Prudence]], [[Justitia|Justice]], [[Courage|Fortitude]] and [[Temperantia|Temperance]] into her home where they would watch over her. Each daughter then came forward, Prudence with an [[astrolabe]] in her hand, who counselled against the laziness that brings misfortune; Justice, with her sword and scales, explained that strong castles are built on the principle of equity; Fortitude, with the club of [[Hercules]] and a shield, advised humility in success and patience in failure to disregard sorrow. Temperance, with her hourglass and bridle, counselled self-control. Mother Virtue concluded that the Word of God was the greatest wealth. Then [[Psalm 120]] was sung.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 112-114.</ref>\n\nThe five actors were young men dressed as women. Another account of the event says they held the usual traditional attributes, Prudence a serpent and dove, Fortitude a broken pillar, and Temperance a cup of wine. This discrepancy could be resolved by assuming that the performance involved the virtues picking up these alternative objects.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), p. 146.</ref>\n\n===Banquet of Bacchus and Ceres===\nAnne of Denmark got out of her coach and walked into St Giles under the red velvet canopy or \"paill\" flanked by Peder Munk and Lord Hamilton, while a choir sang [[Psalm 19]]. Robert Bruce preached on the subject of [[Psalm 107]], a reflection of thanksgiving for the safe return of mariners; then [[Psalm 23]] was sung. Outside the church, where the [[Mercat Cross]] is now situated, the next pageant showed the ancestry of the kings of Denmark and the arms of previous Scottish queen consorts. Nearby were [[Bacchus]] and [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]], played by schoolboys, offering a banquet referring to the abundance of the lands of the queen's \"morning gift\". A big older actor, who had been seated on a wine barrel, got up and threw food gifts into the crowd of spectators.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 114-5, 146.</ref>\n\n===The Family Tree===\nAt the place where salt was weighed, the \"Salt Tron\", where the [[Tron Kirk]] is now, an artificial tree had five stages or branches with boys representing kings and queens with the arms of the monarchs of Denmark and Scotland. At the base of the tree a king in armour resting on a couch was [[Christian I of Denmark]], a common ancestor of James VI and Anne, from whom these monarchs descended, as the Biblical kings [[Tree of Jesse|sprang from Jesse]]. For Anne's benefit, a boy rehearsed her family tree.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 115-7, 146.</ref>\n\n===Solomon and the Queen of Sheba===\nThe final pageant of the Entry took place at the East Port or Netherbow, the gate on the Royal Mile to the Canongate that leads to Holyroodhouse. A dialogue between Solomon and the Queen of Sheba was dramatised. The queen said she had come to Solomon to study his unequalled wisdom. She brought him the balsam that does not grow in Scotland, and thanked him for his company which was like drinking at Pallas Athena's breast. Solomon replied that she should always remain in his respect and honour, and so good-night. Then another schoolboy explained to Anne of Denmark that as the Queen of Sheba had desired to meet Solomon, so James had travelled to meet her, and now all Scotland would serve her. He gave Anne of Denmark the town's gift of a jewel, which was lowered from the Netherbow with a length of silk ribbon.<ref>David Stevenson, ''Scotland's Last Royal Wedding'' (Edinburgh, 1997), pp. 117-120, 148.</ref> \n\nAnne returned down the Canongate to Holyroodhouse, according to John Burrell, still accompanied by the 40 or 50 young men in costume as \"moors\". Adrian Damman explains that at Holyrood they tied bronze bells to the white buskins or shanks they wore on their lower legs, and began to dance, in contrast to their slow processional walk, as if they were [[Korybantes|Corybants]] followers of the goddess [[Cybele]].<ref>Adriam Damman, 'De Introitu Reg. Annae in Edinburgam' (Edinburgh, 1590).</ref>\n\n===The Jewel===\nThe town had obtained a jewel in security for a loan of \u00a34000 [[Pounds Scots|Scots]] to the king, a locket with a diamond and emerald, and decided to have the goldsmith David Gilbert remake and enlarge it as a gift for the queen. The purpose of the loan had to been to finance ambassadors sent to England to plead for the life of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref>Marguerite Wood, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454498&view=1up&seq=36 ''Extracts from the Burgh Records of Edinburgh: 1589-1603'', vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1927), pp. 4, 20.]: Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 113.</ref> David Calderwood said the jewel was called the \"A\", probably referring to the crowned initial or cipher of \"A\" on its case.<ref>Daniel Wilson, ''Memorials of Edinburgh in the Olden Time'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1891), p. 115: David Calderwood, ''History of the Kirk'', vol. 5, p. 97: Maureen M.

The Institute at Bangalore was consequently set up next year, designed to cater exclusively to the needs of public sector enterprises.<ref name=\"IIMReviewCommitteeReport\">{{cite web |url=http://www.education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |title=Report of IIM Review Committee |author1=RC Bhargava |author2=Ajit Balakrishnan |author3=Anusua Basu |author4=Ram S Tarneja |author5=Ashok Thakur |access-date=19 March 2010 |publisher=Ministry of HRD, Government of India |date=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221200750/http://education.nic.in/tech/IIM-Reviewcommittee.pdf |archivedate=21 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> For the proposed institute, the [[Government of Karnataka]] offered {{convert|100|acre}} of land free of cost and a contribution of {{INRconvert|3|m}}.
