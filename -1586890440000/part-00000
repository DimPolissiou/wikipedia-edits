He studied [[fencing]] and designed the [[Model 1913 Cavalry Saber|M1913 Cavalry Saber]], more commonly known as the \"Patton Saber\", and competed in [[modern pentathlon]] in the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].\n\nPatton first saw combat during 1916's [[Pancho Villa Expedition]], America's first military action using motor vehicles. He saw action in [[World War I]] as part of the new [[Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Force|United States Tank Corps]] of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]: he commanded the U.S. tank school in France, then led tanks into combat and was wounded near the end of the war. In the interwar period, Patton became a central figure in the development of the Army's [[armored warfare]] doctrine, serving in numerous staff positions throughout the country. At the American entry into World War II, he commanded the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]].\n\nPatton led U.S. troops into the Mediterranean theater with an invasion of [[Casablanca]] during [[Operation Torch]] in 1942, and soon established himself as an effective commander by rapidly rehabilitating the demoralized [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]]. He commanded the U.S. Seventh Army during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], where he was the first Allied commander to reach [[Messina]]. There he was embroiled in controversy after he [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|slapped two shell-shocked soldiers]], and was temporarily removed from battlefield command. He then was assigned a key role in [[Operation Fortitude]], the Allies' [[disinformation]] campaign for [[Operation Overlord]]. At the start of the [[Western Allied invasion of France]], Patton was given command of the Third Army, which conducted a highly successful rapid armored [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|drive across France]]. Under his decisive leadership, the Third Army took the lead in relieving beleaguered American troops at [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], after which his forces drove deep into [[Nazi Germany]] by the end of the war.\n\nDuring the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation of Germany]], Patton was named [[military governor]] of [[Bavaria]], but was relieved for making aggressive statements towards the Soviet Union and trivializing [[denazification]]. He commanded the [[Fifteenth United States Army|United States Fifteenth Army]] for slightly more than two months. Severely injured in an auto accident, he died in Germany twelve days later, on December 21, 1945.\n\nPatton's colorful image, hard-driving personality and success as a commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front, and his ability to inspire troops with attention-getting, vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as his [[George S. Patton's speech to the Third Army|famous address to the Third Army]], was met favorably by his troops, but much less so by a sharply divided Allied high command. His emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective, and he was regarded highly by his opponents in the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]]. An award-winning biographical film released in 1970, ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', helped solidify his image as an American [[folk hero]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Nita Patton (Sister of General George S.

Patton was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read on classical [[military history]], particularly the exploits of [[Hannibal]], [[Scipio Africanus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Joan of Arc]], and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], as well as those of family friend [[John Singleton Mosby]], who frequently stopped by the Patton family home when George was a child.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}} He was also a devoted [[horseback rider]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}}\n\nPatton married Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist [[Frederick Ayer]], on May 26, 1910, in [[Beverly Farms, Massachusetts]]. They had three children, Beatrice Smith (born March 1911), Ruth Ellen (born February 1915), and [[George Patton IV]] (born December 1923).{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=28, 35, 65\u201366}} Beatrice Patton died in 1954 when she was thrown from her horse.{{sfn|Farago|1981|p=310}}\n\nPatton never seriously considered a career other than the military.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}} At the age of seventeen he sought an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, New York. He applied to several universities with [[Reserve Officer's Training Corps]] programs, and was accepted to Princeton College, but eventually decided on [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=14\u201315}} He attended the school from 1903 to 1904 and, though he struggled with reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection as well as military drill. While he was at VMI, a senator from California nominated him for West Point.{{sfn|Blumenson|1972|p=92}} He was an initiate of the Beta Commission of [[Kappa Alpha Order]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kappaalphaorder.org/award/distinguished-achievement-award/george-s-patton-jr|title=distinguished-achievement-award/george-s-patton-jr|publisher=kappaalphaorder.org|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn his plebe (first) year at West Point, Patton adjusted easily to the routine. However, his academic performance was so poor that he was forced to repeat his first year after failing [[mathematics]].{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=7}} He excelled at military drills though his academic performance remained average. He was cadet sergeant major during his junior year, and the cadet adjutant his senior year. He also joined the football team, but he injured his arm and stopped playing on several occasions. Instead he tried out for the sword team and [[track and field]] and specialized in the [[modern pentathlon]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=20\u201323}} He competed in this sport in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], and he finished in fifth place \u2013 right behind four [[Sweden|Swedes]].{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=19}}\n\nPatton graduated number 46 out of 103 cadets at West Point on June 11, 1909, and received a [[officer (armed forces)|commission]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry branch]] of the [[United States Army]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=24}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=58, 131}}\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nThe Patton family was of [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[French people|French]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. His great-grandmother came from an aristocratic Welsh family, descended from many Welsh lords of [[Glamorgan]],{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}} which had an extensive military background.

Patton also descended from [[Hugh Mercer]], who had been killed in the [[Battle of Princeton]] during the [[American Revolution]].

Befriending [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L.

He claimed that the holes in the paper from his early shots were so large that some of his later bullets passed through them, but the judges decided he missed the target completely once. Modern competitions on this level frequently now employ a moving backdrop to specifically track multiple shots through the same hole.{{sfn|Blumenson|1972|pp=231\u2013234}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=132\u2013133}} If his assertion was correct, Patton would likely have won an [[Olympic medal]] in the event.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=134}} The judges' ruling was upheld. Patton's only comment on the matter was:\n[[File:Wooltex and George S Patton.jpg|thumb|LEFT|Patton on his steeplechase horse, Wooltex, in 1914]]\n\n{{quote|The high spirit of sportsmanship and generosity manifested throughout speaks volumes for the character of the officers of the present day. There was not a single incident of a protest or any unsportsman-like quibbling or fighting for points which I may say, marred some of the other civilian competitions at the Olympic Games. Each man did his best and took what fortune sent them like a true soldier, and at the end we all felt more like good friends and comrades than rivals in a severe competition, yet this spirit of friendship in no manner detracted from the zeal with which all strove for success.{{sfn|Blumenson|1972|pp=231\u2013234}} |author=|title=|source=}}\n\n=== Sword design ===\nFollowing the 1912 Olympics, Patton travelled to [[Saumur]], France, where he learned fencing techniques from Adjutant Charles Cl\u00e9ry, a French \"master of arms\" and instructor of fencing at the cavalry school there.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=140\u2013142}} Bringing these lessons back to Fort Myer, Patton redesigned saber combat doctrine for the U.S. cavalry, favoring thrusting attacks over the standard slashing maneuver and designing a new sword for such attacks. He was temporarily assigned to the Office of the [[U.S. Army Chief of Staff|Army Chief of Staff]], and in 1913, the first 20,000 of the [[Model 1913 Cavalry Saber]]\u2014popularly known as the \"Patton saber\"\u2014were ordered. Patton then returned to Saumur to learn advanced techniques before bringing his skills to the [[Mounted Service School]] at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor. He was the first Army officer to be designated \"Master of the Sword\",{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=145}} a title denoting the school's top instructor in swordsmanship.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=21}} Arriving in September 1913, he taught fencing to other cavalry officers, many of whom were senior to him in rank.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=33\u201334}} Patton graduated from this school in June 1915. He was originally intended to return to the 15th Cavalry,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=153}} which was bound for the Philippines. Fearing this assignment would dead-end his career, Patton travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] during 11 days of leave and convinced influential friends to arrange a reassignment for him to the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] at [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, anticipating that instability in Mexico might boil over into a full-scale civil war.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=35}} In the meantime, Patton was selected to participate in the [[1916 Summer Olympics]], but that olympiad was cancelled due to [[World War I]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=148}}\n\n== Pancho Villa Expedition ==\n{{Main|Pancho Villa Expedition}}\n\nIn 1915 Patton was assigned to border patrol duty with A Troop of the 8th Cavalry, based in [[Sierra Blanca, Texas|Sierra Blanca]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=36}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=158\u2013159}} During his time in the town, Patton took to wearing his M1911 [[M1911|Colt .45]] in his belt rather than a holster. His firearm [[Unintentional discharge (firearms)|discharged accidentally]] one night in a [[Western saloon|saloon]], so he swapped it for an ivory-handled [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver, a weapon that would later become an icon of Patton's image.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=9}}\n\nIn March 1916 Mexican forces loyal to [[Pancho Villa]] crossed into [[New Mexico]] and [[Battle of Columbus (1916)|raided the border town of Columbus]]. The violence in [[Columbus, New Mexico|Columbus]] killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] into Mexico. Chagrined to discover that his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander [[John J. Pershing]], and was named his personal [[Aide-de-camp|aide]] for the expedition. This meant that Patton would have some role in organizing the effort, and his eagerness and dedication to the task impressed Pershing.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=10}} Patton modeled much of his leadership style after Pershing, who favored strong, decisive actions and commanding from the front.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=165}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=31}} As an aide, Patton oversaw the logistics of Pershing's transportation and acted as his personal courier.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=38\u201339}}\n\n[[File:1915-dodge-archives.jpg|thumb|The durability of the 1915 Dodge Brothers Model 30-35 touring car won renown for the new automaker following its use in the 1916 [[Pancho Villa Expedition]]{{sfn|Jowett|de Quesada|2006|p=25}}]]\nIn mid-April, Patton asked Pershing for the opportunity to command troops, and was assigned to Troop C of the [[U.S. 13th Cavalry Regiment|13th Cavalry]] to assist in the manhunt for Villa and his subordinates.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=40}} His initial combat experience came on May 14, 1916 in what would become the first motorized attack in the history of U.S. warfare. A force under his command of ten soldiers and two civilian guides with the [[U.S. 6th Infantry Regiment|6th Infantry]] in three [[Dodge]] touring cars surprised three of Villa's men during a foraging expedition, killing [[Julio C\u00e1rdenas]] and two of his guards.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=10}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=41\u201342}} It was not clear if Patton personally killed any of the men, but he was known to have wounded all three.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=172\u2013175}} The incident garnered Patton both Pershing's good favor and widespread media attention as a \"bandit killer\".{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=10}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=32}} Shortly after, he was promoted to [[first lieutenant]] while a part of the 10th Cavalry on May 23, 1916.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=36}} Patton remained in Mexico until the end of the year. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] forbade the expedition from conducting aggressive patrols deeper into Mexico, so it remained encamped in the Mexican border states for much of that time. In October Patton briefly retired to California after being burned by an exploding gas lamp.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=43}} He returned from the expedition permanently in February 1917.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=46}}\n\n== World War I ==\n[[File:George S.

Patton was dissatisfied with the post and began to take an interest in [[tank]]s, as Pershing sought to give him command of an infantry battalion.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=47\u201348}} While in a hospital for [[jaundice]], Patton met [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Fox Conner]], who encouraged him to work with tanks instead of infantry.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=49}}\n\nOn November 10, 1917 Patton was assigned to establish the AEF Light Tank School.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=10}} He left Paris and reported to the [[French Army in World War I|French Army]]'s tank training school at Champlieu near [[Orrouy]], where he drove a [[Renault FT]] [[light tank]]. On November 20, the [[British Army during World War I|British]] [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|launched an offensive]] towards the important rail center of [[Cambrai]], using an unprecedented number of tanks.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=204\u2013208}} At the conclusion of his tour on December 1, Patton went to [[Albert, Somme|Albert]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} from Cambrai, to be briefed on the results of this attack by the chief of staff of the British [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]], [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] [[J. F. C. Fuller]].{{sfn|Blumenson|1972|pp=480\u2013483}} On the way back to Paris, he visited the [[Renault]] factory to observe the tanks being manufactured.

Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 tank design created by [[J.

A short-lived experiment to merge infantry, cavalry and artillery into a [[combined arms]] force was cancelled after [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]] removed funding.

Patton was dissatisfied with MacArthur's conduct, as he recognized the legitimacy of the veterans' complaints and had himself earlier refused to issue the order to employ armed force to disperse the veterans. Patton later stated that, though he found the duty \"most distasteful\", he also felt that putting the marchers down prevented an insurrection and saved lives and property.

In response to a question on whether the Third Army's [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|rapid offensive across France]] should be slowed to reduce the number of U.S. casualties, Patton replied, \"Whenever you slow anything down, you waste human lives.\"{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=542}} It was around this time that a reporter, after hearing a speech where Patton said that it took \"blood and brains\" to win in combat, began calling him \"blood and guts\".

While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive and less prone to making mistakes.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=348}} On January 26, 1944, Patton was formally given command of the [[U.S. Third Army]] in England, a newly formed field Army, and he was assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=407}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=124}} This duty kept Patton busy during the first half of 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=423}}\n\n=== Phantom Army ===\n{{Main|Invasion of Normandy}}\nThe [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] had more respect for Patton than for any other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] commander and considered him to be central to any plan to invade Europe from England.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} Because of this, Patton was made a prominent figure in the deception operation, [[Operation Fortitude|Fortitude]], during the first half of 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=409}} Through the British [[Double-Cross System|network of double-agents]], the Allies fed German intelligence a steady stream of false reports about troops sightings and that Patton had been named commander of the [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG), all designed to convince the Germans that Patton was preparing this massive command for an invasion at [[Pas de Calais]]. FUSAG was in reality an intricately constructed fictitious army of decoys, props, and fake [[radio signal]] traffic based around [[Dover]] to mislead German [[reconnaissance plane]]s and to make Axis leaders believe that a large force was massing there. This helped to mask the real location of the invasion in [[Normandy]]. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking that he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} As a result of Operation Fortitude, the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 15th Army]] remained at the Pas de Calais to defend against Patton's supposed attack.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=128}} So strong was their conviction that this was the main landing area that the German army held its position there even after the [[invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944. Patton flew to France a month later, and then returned to combat command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=132}}\n\n=== Normandy breakout offensive ===\n{{Main|Invasion of Normandy}}\nSailing to Normandy throughout July, Patton's Third Army formed on the extreme right (west) of the Allied land forces,{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=132}}{{refn|Patton's friend [[Gilbert R.

The Third Army simultaneously [[Battle for Brest|attacked west into Brittany]], south, east toward the [[Seine]], and north, assisting in trapping several hundred thousand German soldiers in the [[Falaise Pocket]] between [[Falaise, Calvados, France|Falaise]] and [[Argentan]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nPatton's strategy with his army favored speed and aggressive offensive action, though his forces saw less opposition than did the other three Allied field armies in the initial weeks of its advance.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=137}} The Third Army typically employed forward scout units to determine enemy strength and positions. [[Self-propelled artillery]] moved with the [[Military spearhead|spearhead]] units and was sited well forward, ready to engage protected German positions with [[indirect fire]]. Light aircraft such as the [[Piper J-3 Cub|Piper L-4 Cub]] served as artillery spotters and provided airborne reconnaissance. Once located, the armored infantry would attack using tanks as infantry support. Other armored units would then break through enemy lines and exploit any subsequent breach, constantly pressuring withdrawing German forces to prevent them from regrouping and reforming a cohesive defensive line.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=215\u2013216}} The U.S. armor advanced using [[reconnaissance by fire]], and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine gun proved effective in this role, often flushing out and killing German [[panzerfaust]] teams waiting in ambush as well as breaking up German infantry assaults against the armored infantry.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=212}}\n\nThe speed of the advance forced Patton's units to rely heavily on air reconnaissance and tactical air support.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=215\u2013216}} The Third Army had by far more [[military intelligence]] (G-2) officers at headquarters specifically designated to coordinate air strikes than any other army.{{sfn|Gooderson|1998|p=44}} Its attached close air support group was [[XIX Tactical Air Command]], commanded by Brigadier General [[Otto P. Weyland]]. Developed originally by General [[Elwood Quesada]] of [[IX Tactical Air Command]] for the First Army in [[Operation Cobra]], the technique of \"armored column cover\", in which close air support was directed by an air traffic controller in one of the attacking tanks, was used extensively by the Third Army. Each column was protected by a standing patrol of three to four [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] fighter-bombers as a [[combat air patrol]] (CAP).{{sfn|Gooderson|1998|p=85}}\n\nIn its advance from [[Avranches]] to Argentan, the Third Army traversed {{convert|60|mi}} in just two weeks. Patton's force was supplemented by [[Ultra]] intelligence for which he was briefed daily by his G-2, Colonel [[Oscar W. Koch]], who apprised him of German counterattacks, and where to concentrate his forces.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=138}} Equally important to the advance of Third Army columns in northern France was the rapid advance of the supply echelons. Third Army logistics were overseen by Colonel Walter J. Muller, Patton's [[Military staff#Logistics (4)|G-4]], who emphasized flexibility, improvisation, and adaptation for Third Army supply echelons so forward units could rapidly exploit a breakthrough. Patton's rapid drive to [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] demonstrated his keen appreciation for the technological advantages of the U.S. Army. The major U.S. and Allied advantages were in mobility and air superiority. The U.S. Army had more trucks, more reliable tanks, and better radio communications, all of which contributed to a superior ability to operate at a rapid offensive pace.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|p=217}}\n\n=== Lorraine Campaign ===\n{{Main|Lorraine Campaign}}\n[[File:\"Lt.

Jenkins, a soldier under his command, October 1944]]\nPatton's offensive came to a halt on August 31, 1944, as the Third Army ran out of fuel near the [[Moselle River]], just outside [[Metz]]. Patton expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support successful advances, but Eisenhower favored a \"broad front\" approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would have to drop off flank protection, and would quickly lose its punch. Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, Eisenhower gave Montgomery and his [[Twenty First Army Group]] a higher priority for supplies for [[Operation Market Garden]].{{sfn|Ambrose|2007|pp=162\u2013164}} Combined with other demands on the limited resource pool, this resulted in the Third Army exhausting its fuel supplies.{{sfn|Zaloga|2008|pp=184\u2013193}} Patton believed his forces were close enough to the [[Siegfried Line]] that he remarked to Bradley that with 400,000&nbsp;gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany within two days.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=141}} In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army was defeated by the [[U.S. 4th Armored Division]] at the [[Battle of Arracourt]]. Despite the victory, the Third Army stayed in place as a result of Eisenhower's order.

In October and November, the Third Army was mired in a near-stalemate with the Germans during the [[Battle of Metz]], both sides suffering heavy casualties. An [[Battle of Fort Driant|attempt]] by Patton to seize Fort Driant just south of Metz was defeated, but by mid-November Metz had fallen to the Americans.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=142}} Patton's decisions in taking this city were criticized.

On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during the early stages of the ensuing [[Battle of the Bulge]], made significant headway towards the [[Meuse River]] during a severe winter. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front at a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=675\u2013678}}\n\nAt the time, Patton's Third Army was engaged in heavy fighting near [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. Guessing the intent of the Allied command meeting, Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of the Third Army from its present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives in the area of the bulge occupied by German forces.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} At the Supreme Command conference, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by Patton, Bradley, General [[Jacob L. Devers|Jacob Devers]], Major General [[Kenneth Strong]], Deputy Supreme Commander [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]], and several staff officers.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=599}} When Eisenhower asked Patton how long it would take him to disengage six divisions of his Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at [[Bastogne]], Patton replied, \"As soon as you're through with me.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=75}} Patton then clarified that he had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on December 21, then only 48 hours away.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=75}} Eisenhower was incredulous: \"Don't be fatuous, George. If you try to go that early you won't have all three divisions ready and you'll go piecemeal.\" Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered Patton to attack the morning of December 22, using at least three divisions.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nPatton left the conference room, phoned his command, and uttered two words: \"Play ball.\" This code phrase initiated a prearranged operational order with Patton's staff, mobilizing three divisions\u2014the 4th Armored Division, the [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 80th Infantry Division]], and the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 26th Infantry Division]]\u2014from the Third Army and moving them north toward Bastogne.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} In all, Patton would reposition six full divisions, [[U.S. III Corps]] and [[U.S. XII Corps]], from their positions on the [[Saar River]] front along a line stretching from Bastogne to [[Diekirch]] and to [[Echternach]], the town in Luxembourg that had been at [[Battle of the Bulge#Planning|the southern end of the initial \"Bulge\" front line]] on December 16.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}} Within a few days, more than 133,000 Third Army vehicles were rerouted into an offensive that covered an average distance of over {{convert|11|mi}} per vehicle, followed by support echelons carrying {{convert|62,000|t}} of supplies.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=79}}\n\nOn December 21, Patton met with Bradley to review the impending advance, starting the meeting by remarking, \"Brad, this time the Kraut's stuck his head in the meat grinder, and I've got hold of the handle.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward [[Koblenz]], cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed it, since he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=148\u2013149}} Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army [[military chaplain|chaplain]], Colonel [[James Hugh O'Neill]], to compose a suitable prayer. He responded with:\n{{quote|Almighty and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech Thee, of Thy great goodness, to restrain these immoderate rains with which we have had to contend. Grant us fair weather for Battle. Graciously hearken to us as soldiers who call upon Thee that, armed with Thy power, we may advance from victory to victory and crush the oppression and wickedness of our enemies, and establish Thy justice among men and nations. Amen.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}}}\nWhen the weather cleared soon after, Patton awarded O'Neill a [[Bronze Star Medal]] on the spot.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nOn December 26, 1944, the first spearhead units of the Third Army's 4th Armored Division reached Bastogne, opening a corridor for relief and resupply of the besieged forces. Patton's ability to disengage six divisions from front line combat during the middle of winter, then wheel north to relieve Bastogne was one of his most remarkable achievements during the war.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=152\u2013153}} He later wrote that the relief of Bastogne was \"the most brilliant operation we have thus far performed, and it is in my opinion the outstanding achievement of the war. This is my biggest battle.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=79}}\n\n=== Advance into Germany ===\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the [[94th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 94th Infantry Division]] crossed the [[Saar River]] and established a vital bridgehead at [[Serrig]], through which Patton pushed units into the [[Saarland]]. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against the advice of his officers. Historians such as [[Charles Whiting]] have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.{{sfn|Le Tissier|2007|pp=147\u2013155}}\n\nOnce again, Patton found other commands given priority on gasoline and supplies.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=156}} To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel and in one incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump.{{sfn|Rickard|2004|p=85}} Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took [[Trier]], [[Coblenz]], [[Bingen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof|Bingen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], [[Kaiserslautern]], and [[Ludwigshafen]], killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented virtually all of the remnants of the [[German 1st Army|German First]] and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to bypass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: \"Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want me to give it back?\"{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=53}}\n\nThe Third Army began crossing the [[Rhine River]] after constructing a [[pontoon bridge]] on March 22, two weeks after the First Army [[Battle_of_Remagen|crossed it at Remagen]], and Patton slipped a division across the river that evening.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=157}} Patton later boasted he had urinated into the river as he crossed.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=322}}\n\n[[File:Ohrdruf Corpses Eisenhower.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect a cremation pyre at the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]] on April 12, 1945, after liberation.]]\nOn March 26, 1945, Patton sent [[Task Force Baum]], consisting of 314 men, 16 tanks, and assorted other vehicles, {{convert|50|mi}} behind German lines to liberate the [[prisoner of war]] camp [[OFLAG XIII-B]], near [[Hammelburg]]. Patton knew that one of the inmates was his son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel [[John K. Waters]].

Third Army was ordered toward [[Bavaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], anticipating a [[last stand]] by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn that the [[Red Army]] would take [[Berlin]], feeling that the [[Soviet Union]] was a threat to the U.S. Army's advance to [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]], but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching [[Prague, Czechoslovakia]], before [[V-E Day]] on May 8 and the end of the war in Europe.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=160\u2013162}}\n\nIn its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, Patton's Third Army, which numbered between 250,000 and 300,000 men at any given time, captured {{convert|32763|sqmi}} of German territory.

On June 7, he arrived in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]], for extended leave with his family, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. Patton then drove to [[Hatch Memorial Shell]] and spoke to some 20,000, including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans. In this speech he aroused some controversy among the [[American Gold Star Mothers|Gold Star Mothers]] when he stated that a man who dies in battle is \"frequently a fool\",{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=721}} adding that the wounded are heroes. Patton spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in [[Denver]] and visiting [[Los Angeles]], where he spoke to a crowd of 100,000 at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Memorial Coliseum]]. Patton made a final stop in [[Washington, D.C.]] before returning to Europe in July to serve in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation forces]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nOn June 14, 1945, Secretary of War [[Henry L.

Various explanations beyond his disappointments have been proposed for Patton's behavior at this point. Carlo D'Este wrote that \"it seems virtually inevitable&nbsp;... that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries\" from a lifetime of numerous auto- and horse-related accidents, especially one suffered while playing [[polo]] in 1936.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nPatton's niece [[Jean Gordon (Red Cross)|Jean Gordon]] appeared again; they spent some time together in London in 1944, and again in Bavaria in 1945. Gordon actually loved a young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=744}} Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with Gordon, but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson said that the relationship was casual.{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=535}} Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility.{{sfn|Showalter|2006|pp=412\u201313}} D'Este agrees, saying, \"His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [in Hawaii] and 1944\u201345, the presence of the young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=743}}\n\nPatton attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former [[Nazi Party]] members continued to hold political posts in the region.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] in noting that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=16}} On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, \"All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nPatton's final assignment was to command the [[U.S. 15th Army]], based in [[Bad Nauheim]]. The 15th Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff working to compile a history of the war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest. He began traveling, visiting Paris, [[Rennes]], [[Chartres]], [[Brussels]], [[Metz]], [[Reims]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Verdun]]. Then he went to{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}} [[Stockholm]], where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided that he would leave his post at the 15th Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for [[Christmas]] leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire from the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}\n\n=== Accident and death ===\n[[File:General Patton's grave 300806.jpg|thumb|Patton's grave in [[Luxembourg City]]]]\nOn December 8, 1945, Patton's chief of staff, Major General [[Hobart R. Gay|Hobart Gay]], invited him on a [[pheasant]] hunting trip near [[Speyer]] to lift his spirits. Observing derelict cars along the side of the road, Patton said, \"How awful war is. Think of the waste.\" Moments later his car collided with an American army truck at low speed.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826\u2013827}}\n\nGay and others were only slightly injured, but Patton hit his head on the glass partition in the back seat. He began bleeding from a gash to the head, and complained that he was paralyzed and having trouble breathing. Taken to a hospital in [[Heidelberg]], Patton was discovered to have a [[compression fracture]] and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth [[vertebra]]e, resulting in a broken neck and [[cervical spinal cord]] injury that rendered him [[quadriplegia|paralyzed from the neck down]].{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826\u2013827}}\n\nPatton spent most of the next 12 days in [[traction (orthopedics)#Spinal decompression|spinal traction]] to decrease the pressure on his spine. All nonmedical visitors, except for Patton's wife, who had flown from the U.S., were forbidden. Patton, who had been told he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life, at one point commented, \"This is a hell of a way to die.\" He died in his sleep of [[pulmonary edema]] and [[congestive heart failure]] at about 18:00 on December 21, 1945.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nPatton was buried at the [[Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial]] in the [[Hamm, Luxembourg|Hamm district]] of [[Luxembourg City]], alongside some wartime casualties of the Third Army, in accordance with his request to \"be buried with [his] men\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials |publisher=[[American Battle Monuments Commission]] |title=Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Service summary of George S.

Patton}}\n\n[[File:General Patton 3c 1953 issue U.S. stamp.jpg|thumb|right|General Patton U.S. commemorative stamp, issued in 1953]]\nPatton's colorful personality, hard-driving leadership style, and success as a commander, combined with his frequent political missteps, produced a mixed and often contradictory image. Patton's great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=ix}} Historian [[Terry Brighton]] concluded that Patton was \"arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but&nbsp;... among the greatest generals of the war\".{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xv}} Patton's impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial, with the [[U.S. Army]]'s adopting many of Patton's aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death. Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy. The first American tank designed after the war became the [[M46 Patton]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=viii}}\n\nSeveral actors have portrayed Patton on screen, the most famous being [[George C. Scott]] in the 1970 film ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]''. Scott's iconic depiction of Patton earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and it was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture as a [[folk hero]].{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=1}} He would reprise the role in 1986 in the made-for-television film ''[[The Last Days of Patton]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Other actors who have portrayed Patton include [[Stephen McNally]] in the 1957 episode \"The Patton Prayer\" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] religion [[anthology series]], ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', [[John Larch]] in the 1963 film ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]'', [[Kirk Douglas]] in the 1966 film ''[[Is Paris Burning?

Patton's speech to the Third Army}}\n\nPatton cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that this would inspire his troops. He carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, silver-plated [[Colt Single Action Army]] .45 caliber revolver on his right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped [[Smith & Wesson Model 27]] .357 Magnum on his left hip.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvi}} He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots.{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=478}} Patton also cultivated a stern expression he called his \"war face\".{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=110}} He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white and blue. His [[jeep]] bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps, featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; the proposal was derided in the media as \"the Green Hornet\", and it was rejected by the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77\u201379}}\n\nThe historian [[Alan Axelrod]] wrote that \"for Patton, leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders, it was about transforming oneself into a symbol\".{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80\u201382}} Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. He was an admirer of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] for his actions in leading the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in a full dress uniform.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80\u201382}} Patton had a preoccupation with bravery,{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=14\u201315}} wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat, and at one point during World War II, he rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nPatton was a staunch [[fatalist]],{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} and he believed in [[reincarnation]]. He believed that he might have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army or a [[Roman legionary]] in a previous life.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nPatton developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=67\u201368}} He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command, but it offended other generals, including Bradley.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=578}} The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=130\u2013131}} When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, \"The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored [[halftrack]] and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers. \"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}} During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should \"let the sons-of-bitches [Germans] go all the way to Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up.\"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}} He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could \"drive the British back into the sea for another [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].\"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}}\n\nAs media scrutiny on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that he was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=111}} His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=113}} Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at [[Knutsford]] in England, and said, in part, \"since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do.\" The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p= 114}}\n\nOn a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them \"the real heroes\" of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said \"[d]enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time.\" This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Patton's .357 revolver.jpg|thumb|left|Patton's well-known custom ivory-handled revolver]]\nAs a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77\u201379}} Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, [[Orlando Ward]], and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=467\u2013468}} Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded.{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.{{sfn|Wallace|1946|p=97}}\n\nPatton's views on race were complicated and controversial. This may have resulted from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the [[Confederate States of America|southern United States]].{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=18}} Privately he wrote of black soldiers: \"Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor.\"{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=60}} He also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation: \"I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a Nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him.\"{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=864}}\n\nAddressing the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st Tank Battalion]] Patton also said, \"Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=726}} Likewise, Patton called heavily on the Black troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into the same rifle companies.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p= 726}}\n\nAfter reading the [[Koran]] and observing [[North Africa]]ns, he wrote to his wife, \"Just finished reading the Koran\u2014a good book and interesting.\" Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture; he once rated the progress of word-of-mouth rumor in [[Arab]] country at {{convert|40|\u2013|60|mi}} a day. In spite of his regard for the Koran, he concluded, \"To me it seems certain that the [[fatalistic]] teachings of [[Mohammad]] and the utter degradation of women is the outstanding cause for the arrested development of the Arab&nbsp;... Here, I think, is a text for some eloquent sermon on the virtues of [[Christianity]].\"{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=49}}\n\nPatton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of [[Russians]], saying \"I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=739}} Later in life he also began to express growing feelings of antisemitism and [[anticommunism]], as a result of his frequent controversies in the press.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\n=== As viewed by Allied and Axis leaders ===\n[[File:Patton Monument West Point in new location 2009 upright.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Patton at the US Military Academy at [[West Point]]]]\nOn February 1, 1945, Eisenhower wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of his subordinate American generals in Europe. General Bradley and the [[Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Spaatz]] shared the number one position, [[Walter Bedell Smith]] was ranked number three, and Patton number four.{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=801}} Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book ''Patton and His Third Army'': \"George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an Army in the open field that our or any other service produced. But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign.\" {{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}} Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely \"a brilliant executor\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}\n\nNotwithstanding Eisenhower's estimation of Patton's abilities as a strategic planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe is revealed in his refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, \"Patton is indispensable to the war effort\u2014one of the guarantors of our victory.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=536}} As [[Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] told Eisenhower: \"[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s remark after they got after [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] comes to mind when I think of Patton\u2014'I can't spare this man, he fights'.\"{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=442}} After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: \"He was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader&nbsp;... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}\n\n[[Carlo D'Este]] insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=466\u2013467}}{{sfn|D'Este|2002|pp=403\u2013404}} but Bradley's biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise.{{sfn|DeFelice|2011|p=402}} President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities, stating \"he is our greatest fighting general, and sheer joy\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}} On the other hand, Roosevelt's successor, [[Harry S. Truman]], appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton, at one point comparing both him and [[Douglas MacArthur]] to [[George Armstrong Custer]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}}\n\nFor the most part, British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014noted in January 1943 that \"I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild, and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push, but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=451}}\n\nOne possible exception was [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] who appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=549}} Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the [[Free France|Free French]] in particular. General [[Henri Giraud]] was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|French President]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=801}} Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was apparently an admirer, stating that the [[Red Army]] could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France.{{Sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=562}}\n\n[[File:2011-01-6 Baugnez laarzen van George Patton 6-01-2012 14-09-34.JPG|thumb|Patton's boots at a museum in [[Malmedy]]]]\n\nWhile Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted to have more respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} [[Adolf Hitler]] reportedly called him \"that crazy cowboy general\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war,{{refn|Among the opinions of Patton's abilities, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' Horst Freiherr von Wangenheim, operations officer of the [[277th Volksgrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|277th Volksgrenadier Division]], stated that \"General Patton is the most feared general on all fronts. [His] tactics are daring and unpredictable\u2026. He is the most modern general and the best commander of [combined] armored and infantry forces.\"{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|pp=480\u2013483}} ''General der Panzertruppen'' [[Hasso von Manteuffel]], who had fought both Soviet and Anglo-American tank commanders, agreed: \"Patton! No doubt about this. He was a brilliant Panzer army commander.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}}|group=Note}} and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. [[Erwin Rommel]] credited Patton with executing \"the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare\".{{Sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvii}} ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alfred Jodl]], chief of staff of the German Army, stated that Patton \"was the American [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]]. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]] said that \"Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]], [[Fritz Bayerlein]] opined that \"I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} In an interview conducted for ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' just after his capture, Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] stated simply of Patton, \"He is your best.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=1}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Service summary of George S.

He studied [[fencing]] and designed the [[Model 1913 Cavalry Saber|M1913 Cavalry Saber]], more commonly known as the \"Patton Saber\", and competed in [[modern pentathlon]] in the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].\n\nPatton first saw combat during 1916's [[Pancho Villa Expedition]], America's first military action using motor vehicles. He saw action in [[World War I]] as part of the new [[Tank Corps of the American Expeditionary Force|United States Tank Corps]] of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]: he commanded the U.S. tank school in France, then led tanks into combat and was wounded near the end of the war. In the interwar period, Patton became a central figure in the development of the Army's [[armored warfare]] doctrine, serving in numerous staff positions throughout the country. At the American entry into World War II, he commanded the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]].\n\nPatton led U.S. troops into the Mediterranean theater with an invasion of [[Casablanca]] during [[Operation Torch]] in 1942, and soon established himself as an effective commander by rapidly rehabilitating the demoralized [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]]. He commanded the U.S. Seventh Army during the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], where he was the first Allied commander to reach [[Messina]]. There he was embroiled in controversy after he [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|slapped two shell-shocked soldiers]], and was temporarily removed from battlefield command. He then was assigned a key role in [[Operation Fortitude]], the Allies' [[disinformation]] campaign for [[Operation Overlord]]. At the start of the [[Western Allied invasion of France]], Patton was given command of the Third Army, which conducted a highly successful rapid armored [[Allied advance from Paris to the Rhine|drive across France]]. Under his decisive leadership, the Third Army took the lead in relieving beleaguered American troops at [[Siege of Bastogne|Bastogne]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]], after which his forces drove deep into [[Nazi Germany]] by the end of the war.\n\nDuring the [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation of Germany]], Patton was named [[military governor]] of [[Bavaria]], but was relieved for making aggressive statements towards the Soviet Union and trivializing [[denazification]]. He commanded the [[Fifteenth United States Army|United States Fifteenth Army]] for slightly more than two months. Severely injured in an auto accident, he died in Germany twelve days later, on December 21, 1945.\n\nPatton's colorful image, hard-driving personality and success as a commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. His philosophy of leading from the front, and his ability to inspire troops with attention-getting, vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as his [[George S. Patton's speech to the Third Army|famous address to the Third Army]], was met favorably by his troops, but much less so by a sharply divided Allied high command. His emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective, and he was regarded highly by his opponents in the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]]. An award-winning biographical film released in 1970, ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', helped solidify his image as an American [[folk hero]].\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Nita Patton (Sister of General George S. Patton).jpg|thumb|upright|Anne Wilson \"Nita\" Patton, Patton's sister. She was engaged to [[John J.

Patton (1856\u20131927)|George Smith Patton Sr.]] and his wife Ruth Wilson, the daughter of [[Benjamin Davis Wilson]]. Patton had a younger sister, Anne, who was nicknamed \"Nita.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}}\n\n[[File:Patton at VMI 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Patton at the [[Virginia Military Institute]], 1907]]\nAs a child, Patton had difficulty learning to read and write, but eventually overcame this and was known in his adult life to be an avid reader.{{refn|Historians [[Carlo D'Este]] and [[Alan Axelrod]] note in their biographies of Patton that these difficulties were likely the result of undiagnosed [[dyslexia]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}}|group=Note}} He was tutored from home until the age of eleven, when he was enrolled in Stephen Clark's School for Boys, a private school in Pasadena, for six years. Patton was described as an intelligent boy and was widely read on classical [[military history]], particularly the exploits of [[Hannibal]], [[Scipio Africanus]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Joan of Arc]], and [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], as well as those of family friend [[John Singleton Mosby]], who frequently stopped by the Patton family home when George was a child.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}} He was also a devoted [[horseback rider]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}}\n\nPatton married Beatrice Banning Ayer, the daughter of Boston industrialist [[Frederick Ayer]], on May 26, 1910, in [[Beverly Farms, Massachusetts]]. They had three children, Beatrice Smith (born March 1911), Ruth Ellen (born February 1915), and [[George Patton IV]] (born December 1923).{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=28, 35, 65\u201366}} Beatrice Patton died in 1954 when she was thrown from her horse.{{sfn|Farago|1981|p=310}}\n\nPatton never seriously considered a career other than the military.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}} At the age of seventeen he sought an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, New York. He applied to several universities with [[Reserve Officer's Training Corps]] programs, and was accepted to Princeton College, but eventually decided on [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI), which his father and grandfather had attended.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=14\u201315}} He attended the school from 1903 to 1904 and, though he struggled with reading and writing, performed exceptionally in uniform and appearance inspection as well as military drill. While he was at VMI, a senator from California nominated him for West Point.{{sfn|Blumenson|1972|p=92}} He was an initiate of the Beta Commission of [[Kappa Alpha Order]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kappaalphaorder.org/award/distinguished-achievement-award/george-s-patton-jr|title=distinguished-achievement-award/george-s-patton-jr|publisher=kappaalphaorder.org|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn his plebe (first) year at West Point, Patton adjusted easily to the routine. However, his academic performance was so poor that he was forced to repeat his first year after failing [[mathematics]].{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=7}} He excelled at military drills though his academic performance remained average. He was cadet sergeant major during his junior year, and the cadet adjutant his senior year. He also joined the football team, but he injured his arm and stopped playing on several occasions. Instead he tried out for the sword team and [[track and field]] and specialized in the [[modern pentathlon]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=20\u201323}} He competed in this sport in the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]], and he finished in fifth place \u2013 right behind four [[Sweden|Swedes]].{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=19}}\n\nPatton graduated number 46 out of 103 cadets at West Point on June 11, 1909, and received a [[officer (armed forces)|commission]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[United States Cavalry|Cavalry branch]] of the [[United States Army]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=24}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=58, 131}}\n\n=== Ancestry ===\nThe Patton family was of [[Irish Americans|Irish]], [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[French people|French]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] ancestry. His great-grandmother came from an aristocratic Welsh family, descended from many Welsh lords of [[Glamorgan]],{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=13}} which had an extensive military background.

Patton then returned to Saumur to learn advanced techniques before bringing his skills to the [[Mounted Service School]] at [[Fort Riley]], Kansas, where he would be both a student and a fencing instructor. He was the first Army officer to be designated \"Master of the Sword\",{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=145}} a title denoting the school's top instructor in swordsmanship.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=21}} Arriving in September 1913, he taught fencing to other cavalry officers, many of whom were senior to him in rank.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=33\u201334}} Patton graduated from this school in June 1915. He was originally intended to return to the 15th Cavalry,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=153}} which was bound for the Philippines. Fearing this assignment would dead-end his career, Patton travelled to [[Washington, D.C.]] during 11 days of leave and convinced influential friends to arrange a reassignment for him to the [[8th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|8th Cavalry]] at [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, anticipating that instability in Mexico might boil over into a full-scale civil war.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=35}} In the meantime, Patton was selected to participate in the [[1916 Summer Olympics]], but that olympiad was cancelled due to [[World War I]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=148}}\n\n== Pancho Villa Expedition ==\n{{Main|Pancho Villa Expedition}}\n\nIn 1915 Patton was assigned to border patrol duty with A Troop of the 8th Cavalry, based in [[Sierra Blanca, Texas|Sierra Blanca]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=36}}{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=158\u2013159}} During his time in the town, Patton took to wearing his M1911 [[M1911|Colt .45]] in his belt rather than a holster.

The violence in [[Columbus, New Mexico|Columbus]] killed several Americans. In response, the U.S. launched the [[Pancho Villa Expedition]] into Mexico. Chagrined to discover that his unit would not participate, Patton appealed to expedition commander [[John J. Pershing]], and was named his personal [[Aide-de-camp|aide]] for the expedition.

Casablanca fell on November 11 and Patton negotiated an [[armistice]] with French General [[Charles Nogu\u00e8s]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=91\u201393}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|pp=165\u2013166}} The [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Sultan of Morocco]] was so impressed that he presented Patton with the [[Order of Ouissam Alaouite]], with the citation \"''Les Lions dans leurs tani\u00e8res tremblent en le voyant approcher''\" (The lions in their dens tremble at his approach).{{sfn|Edey|1968|p=60}} Patton oversaw the conversion of Casablanca into a military port and hosted the [[Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=94}}\n\nOn March 6, 1943, following the defeat of the [[II Corps (United States)|U.S. II Corps]] by the German [[Afrika Korps]], commanded by ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erwin Rommel]], at the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]], Patton replaced Major General [[Lloyd Fredendall]] as Commanding General of the II Corps and was promoted to lieutenant general. Soon thereafter, he had Major General [[Omar Bradley]] reassigned to his corps as its deputy commander.{{sfn|Blumenson|1985|p=182}} With orders to take the battered and demoralized formation into action in 10 days' time, Patton immediately introduced sweeping changes, ordering all soldiers to wear clean, pressed and complete uniforms, establishing rigorous schedules, and requiring strict adherence to military protocol. He continuously moved throughout the command talking with men, seeking to shape them into effective soldiers. He pushed them hard, and sought to reward them well for their accomplishments.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=96\u201397}} His uncompromising leadership style is evidenced by his orders for an attack on a hill position near [[Gafsa]] which are reported to have ended \"I expect to see such casualties among officers, particularly staff officers, as will convince me that a serious effort has been made to capture this objective.\"{{sfn|Hunt|1990|p=169}}\n\nPatton's training was effective, and on March 17, the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 1st Infantry Division]] took Gafsa, winning the [[Battle of El Guettar]], and pushing a German and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] armored force back twice. In the meantime, on April 5, he removed Major General [[Orlando Ward]], commanding the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], after its lackluster performance at Maknassy against numerically inferior German forces. Advancing on [[Gab\u00e8s]], Patton's corps pressured the [[Mareth Line]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=96\u201397}} During this time, he reported to British [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Harold Alexander, 1st Earl Alexander of Tunis|Sir Harold Alexander]], commander of the [[18th Army Group]], and came into conflict with [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[Arthur Coningham (RAF officer)|Sir Arthur Coningham]] about the lack of [[close air support]] being provided for his troops. When Coningham dispatched three officers to Patton's headquarters to persuade him that the British were providing ample air support, they came under German air attack mid-meeting, and part of the ceiling of Patton's office collapsed around them. Speaking later of the German pilots who had struck, Patton remarked, \"if I could find the sons of bitches who flew those planes, I'd mail each of them a medal.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=98\u201399}} By the time his force reached Gab\u00e8s, the Germans had abandoned it. He then relinquished command of II Corps to Bradley, and returned to the I Armored Corps in Casablanca to help plan Operation Husky, the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]. Fearing U.S. troops would be sidelined, he convinced British commanders to allow them to continue fighting through to the end of the [[Tunisia Campaign]] before leaving on this new assignment.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=98\u201399}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=188}}\n\n=== Sicily Campaign ===\n{{See also|Allied invasion of Sicily}}\nFor Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, Patton was to command the [[Seventh United States Army]], dubbed the Western Task Force, in landings at [[Gela]], [[Scoglitti]] and [[Licata]] to support landings by [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]]'s [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]. Patton's I Armored Corps was officially redesignated the Seventh Army just before his force of 90,000 landed before dawn on D-Day, July 10, 1943, on beaches near the town of Licata.

As part of a provisional corps under Major General [[Geoffrey Keyes]], the 3rd Infantry Division under Major General [[Lucian Truscott]] covered {{convert|100|mi}} in 72 hours, arriving at Palermo on July 21. Patton then set his sights on Messina.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=105\u2013107}} He sought an [[amphibious assault]], but it was delayed by lack of landing craft, and his troops did not land at [[Santo Stefano di Camastra|Santo Stefano]] until August 8, by which time the Germans and Italians had already evacuated the bulk of their troops to mainland [[Italy]]. He ordered more landings on August 10 by the 3rd Infantry Division, which took heavy casualties but pushed the German forces back, and hastened the advance on Messina.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=108\u2013109}} A third landing was completed on August 16, and by 22:00 that day Messina fell to his forces. By the end of the battle, the 200,000-man Seventh Army had suffered 7,500 casualties, and killed or captured 113,000 Axis troops and destroyed 3,500 vehicles.

The cart was blocking the way of the column. When their Sicilian owner protested, Patton attacked him with a walking stick and had his troops push the two mule carcasses off the bridge.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=105\u2013107}}\n\nWhen informed of the [[Biscari massacre]] of prisoners, which was by troops under his command, Patton wrote in his diary, \"I told Bradley that it was probably an exaggeration, but in any case to tell the officer to certify that the dead men were snipers or had attempted to escape or something, as it would make a stink in the press and also would make the civilians mad. Anyhow, they are dead, so nothing can be done about it.\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=119}} Bradley refused Patton's suggestions. Patton later changed his mind.

While Eisenhower and Marshall both considered Patton to be a skilled combat commander, they felt Bradley was less impulsive and less prone to making mistakes.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=348}} On January 26, 1944, Patton was formally given command of the [[U.S. Third Army]] in England, a newly formed field Army, and he was assigned to prepare its inexperienced soldiers for combat in Europe.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=407}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=124}} This duty kept Patton busy during the first half of 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=423}}\n\n=== Phantom Army ===\n{{Main|Invasion of Normandy}}\nThe [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] had more respect for Patton than for any other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] commander and considered him to be central to any plan to invade Europe from England.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} Because of this, Patton was made a prominent figure in the deception operation, [[Operation Fortitude|Fortitude]], during the first half of 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=409}} Through the British [[Double-Cross System|network of double-agents]], the Allies fed German intelligence a steady stream of false reports about troops sightings and that Patton had been named commander of the [[First United States Army Group]] (FUSAG), all designed to convince the Germans that Patton was preparing this massive command for an invasion at [[Pas de Calais]]. FUSAG was in reality an intricately constructed fictitious army of decoys, props, and fake [[radio signal]] traffic based around [[Dover]] to mislead German [[reconnaissance plane]]s and to make Axis leaders believe that a large force was massing there. This helped to mask the real location of the invasion in [[Normandy]]. Patton was ordered to keep a low profile to deceive the Germans into thinking that he was in Dover throughout early 1944, when he was actually training the Third Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} As a result of Operation Fortitude, the [[15th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 15th Army]] remained at the Pas de Calais to defend against Patton's supposed attack.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=128}} So strong was their conviction that this was the main landing area that the German army held its position there even after the [[invasion of Normandy]] on June 6, 1944.

The Third Army simultaneously [[Battle for Brest|attacked west into Brittany]], south, east toward the [[Seine]], and north, assisting in trapping several hundred thousand German soldiers in the [[Falaise Pocket]] between [[Falaise, Calvados, France|Falaise]] and [[Argentan]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=139\u2013140}}\n\nPatton's strategy with his army favored speed and aggressive offensive action, though his forces saw less opposition than did the other three Allied field armies in the initial weeks of its advance.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=137}} The Third Army typically employed forward scout units to determine enemy strength and positions. [[Self-propelled artillery]] moved with the [[Military spearhead|spearhead]] units and was sited well forward, ready to engage protected German positions with [[indirect fire]]. Light aircraft such as the [[Piper J-3 Cub|Piper L-4 Cub]] served as artillery spotters and provided airborne reconnaissance. Once located, the armored infantry would attack using tanks as infantry support. Other armored units would then break through enemy lines and exploit any subsequent breach, constantly pressuring withdrawing German forces to prevent them from regrouping and reforming a cohesive defensive line.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=215\u2013216}} The U.S. armor advanced using [[reconnaissance by fire]], and the .50 caliber [[M2 Browning]] heavy machine gun proved effective in this role, often flushing out and killing German [[panzerfaust]] teams waiting in ambush as well as breaking up German infantry assaults against the armored infantry.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=212}}\n\nThe speed of the advance forced Patton's units to rely heavily on air reconnaissance and tactical air support.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|pp=215\u2013216}} The Third Army had by far more [[military intelligence]] (G-2) officers at headquarters specifically designated to coordinate air strikes than any other army.{{sfn|Gooderson|1998|p=44}} Its attached close air support group was [[XIX Tactical Air Command]], commanded by Brigadier General [[Otto P. Weyland]]. Developed originally by General [[Elwood Quesada]] of [[IX Tactical Air Command]] for the First Army in [[Operation Cobra]], the technique of \"armored column cover\", in which close air support was directed by an air traffic controller in one of the attacking tanks, was used extensively by the Third Army. Each column was protected by a standing patrol of three to four [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]] and [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] fighter-bombers as a [[combat air patrol]] (CAP).{{sfn|Gooderson|1998|p=85}}\n\nIn its advance from [[Avranches]] to Argentan, the Third Army traversed {{convert|60|mi}} in just two weeks. Patton's force was supplemented by [[Ultra]] intelligence for which he was briefed daily by his G-2, Colonel [[Oscar W. Koch]], who apprised him of German counterattacks, and where to concentrate his forces.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=138}} Equally important to the advance of Third Army columns in northern France was the rapid advance of the supply echelons. Third Army logistics were overseen by Colonel Walter J. Muller, Patton's [[Military staff#Logistics (4)|G-4]], who emphasized flexibility, improvisation, and adaptation for Third Army supply echelons so forward units could rapidly exploit a breakthrough. Patton's rapid drive to [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] demonstrated his keen appreciation for the technological advantages of the U.S. Army. The major U.S. and Allied advantages were in mobility and air superiority. The U.S. Army had more trucks, more reliable tanks, and better radio communications, all of which contributed to a superior ability to operate at a rapid offensive pace.{{sfn|Jarymowycz|2001|p=217}}\n\n=== Lorraine Campaign ===\n{{Main|Lorraine Campaign}}\n[[File:\"Lt.

Patton expected that the theater commander would keep fuel and supplies flowing to support successful advances, but Eisenhower favored a \"broad front\" approach to the ground-war effort, believing that a single thrust would have to drop off flank protection, and would quickly lose its punch. Still within the constraints of a very large effort overall, Eisenhower gave Montgomery and his [[Twenty First Army Group]] a higher priority for supplies for [[Operation Market Garden]].{{sfn|Ambrose|2007|pp=162\u2013164}} Combined with other demands on the limited resource pool, this resulted in the Third Army exhausting its fuel supplies.{{sfn|Zaloga|2008|pp=184\u2013193}} Patton believed his forces were close enough to the [[Siegfried Line]] that he remarked to Bradley that with 400,000&nbsp;gallons of gasoline he could be in Germany within two days.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=141}} In late September, a large German Panzer counterattack sent expressly to stop the advance of Patton's Third Army was defeated by the [[U.S. 4th Armored Division]] at the [[Battle of Arracourt]].

On December 16, 1944, it massed 29 divisions totaling 250,000 men at a weak point in the Allied lines, and during the early stages of the ensuing [[Battle of the Bulge]], made significant headway towards the [[Meuse River]] during a severe winter. Eisenhower called a meeting of all senior Allied commanders on the Western Front at a headquarters near Verdun on the morning of December 19 to plan strategy and a response to the German assault.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=675\u2013678}}\n\nAt the time, Patton's Third Army was engaged in heavy fighting near [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]. Guessing the intent of the Allied command meeting, Patton ordered his staff to make three separate operational contingency orders to disengage elements of the Third Army from its present position and begin offensive operations toward several objectives in the area of the bulge occupied by German forces.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} At the Supreme Command conference, Eisenhower led the meeting, which was attended by Patton, Bradley, General [[Jacob L. Devers|Jacob Devers]], Major General [[Kenneth Strong]], Deputy Supreme Commander [[Air Chief Marshal]] [[Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder|Arthur Tedder]], and several staff officers.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=599}} When Eisenhower asked Patton how long it would take him to disengage six divisions of his Third Army and commence a counterattack north to relieve the [[U.S. 101st Airborne Division]] which had been trapped at [[Bastogne]], Patton replied, \"As soon as you're through with me.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=75}} Patton then clarified that he had already worked up an operational order for a counterattack by three full divisions on December 21, then only 48 hours away.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=75}} Eisenhower was incredulous: \"Don't be fatuous, George. If you try to go that early you won't have all three divisions ready and you'll go piecemeal.\" Patton replied that his staff already had a contingency operations order ready to go. Still unconvinced, Eisenhower ordered Patton to attack the morning of December 22, using at least three divisions.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=148\u2013149}}\n\nPatton left the conference room, phoned his command, and uttered two words: \"Play ball.\" This code phrase initiated a prearranged operational order with Patton's staff, mobilizing three divisions\u2014the 4th Armored Division, the [[80th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 80th Infantry Division]], and the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 26th Infantry Division]]\u2014from the Third Army and moving them north toward Bastogne.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} In all, Patton would reposition six full divisions, [[U.S. III Corps]] and [[U.S. XII Corps]], from their positions on the [[Saar River]] front along a line stretching from Bastogne to [[Diekirch]] and to [[Echternach]], the town in Luxembourg that had been at [[Battle of the Bulge#Planning|the southern end of the initial \"Bulge\" front line]] on December 16.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}} Within a few days, more than 133,000 Third Army vehicles were rerouted into an offensive that covered an average distance of over {{convert|11|mi}} per vehicle, followed by support echelons carrying {{convert|62,000|t}} of supplies.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=79}}\n\nOn December 21, Patton met with Bradley to review the impending advance, starting the meeting by remarking, \"Brad, this time the Kraut's stuck his head in the meat grinder, and I've got hold of the handle.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=77}} Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward [[Koblenz]], cutting off the bulge at the base and trap the entirety of the German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed it, since he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=148\u2013149}} Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army [[military chaplain|chaplain]], Colonel [[James Hugh O'Neill]], to compose a suitable prayer. He responded with:\n{{quote|Almighty and most merciful Father, we humbly beseech Thee, of Thy great goodness, to restrain these immoderate rains with which we have had to contend. Grant us fair weather for Battle. Graciously hearken to us as soldiers who call upon Thee that, armed with Thy power, we may advance from victory to victory and crush the oppression and wickedness of our enemies, and establish Thy justice among men and nations. Amen.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}}}\nWhen the weather cleared soon after, Patton awarded O'Neill a [[Bronze Star Medal]] on the spot.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nOn December 26, 1944, the first spearhead units of the Third Army's 4th Armored Division reached Bastogne, opening a corridor for relief and resupply of the besieged forces. Patton's ability to disengage six divisions from front line combat during the middle of winter, then wheel north to relieve Bastogne was one of his most remarkable achievements during the war.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=152\u2013153}} He later wrote that the relief of Bastogne was \"the most brilliant operation we have thus far performed, and it is in my opinion the outstanding achievement of the war. This is my biggest battle.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=79}}\n\n=== Advance into Germany ===\nBy February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the [[94th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 94th Infantry Division]] crossed the [[Saar River]] and established a vital bridgehead at [[Serrig]], through which Patton pushed units into the [[Saarland]]. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River against the advice of his officers. Historians such as [[Charles Whiting]] have criticized this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.{{sfn|Le Tissier|2007|pp=147\u2013155}}\n\nOnce again, Patton found other commands given priority on gasoline and supplies.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=156}} To obtain these, Third Army ordnance units passed themselves off as First Army personnel and in one incident they secured thousands of gallons of gasoline from a First Army dump.{{sfn|Rickard|2004|p=85}} Between January 29 and March 22, the Third Army took [[Trier]], [[Coblenz]], [[Bingen (Rhein) Hauptbahnhof|Bingen]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], [[Kaiserslautern]], and [[Ludwigshafen]], killing or wounding 99,000 and capturing 140,112 German soldiers, which represented virtually all of the remnants of the [[German 1st Army|German First]] and Seventh Armies. An example of Patton's sarcastic wit was broadcast when he received orders to bypass Trier, as it had been decided that four divisions would be needed to capture it. When the message arrived, Trier had already fallen. Patton rather caustically replied: \"Have taken Trier with two divisions. Do you want me to give it back?\"{{sfn|Regan|1992|p=53}}\n\nThe Third Army began crossing the [[Rhine River]] after constructing a [[pontoon bridge]] on March 22, two weeks after the First Army [[Battle_of_Remagen|crossed it at Remagen]], and Patton slipped a division across the river that evening.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=157}} Patton later boasted he had urinated into the river as he crossed.{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=322}}\n\n[[File:Ohrdruf Corpses Eisenhower.jpg|thumb|left|Eisenhower, Bradley and Patton inspect a cremation pyre at the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]] on April 12, 1945, after liberation.]]\nOn March 26, 1945, Patton sent [[Task Force Baum]], consisting of 314 men, 16 tanks, and assorted other vehicles, {{convert|50|mi}} behind German lines to liberate the [[prisoner of war]] camp [[OFLAG XIII-B]], near [[Hammelburg]]. Patton knew that one of the inmates was his son-in-law, Lieutenant Colonel [[John K. Waters]]. The raid was a failure, and only 35 men made it back; the rest were either killed or captured, and all 57 vehicles were lost. Patton reported this attempt to liberate Oflag XIII-B as the only mistake he made during World War II.{{sfn|Farago|1964|p=790}} When Eisenhower learned of the secret mission, he was furious.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=158\u2013159}} Patton later said he felt the correct decision would have been to send a [[Combat Command]], which is a force about three times larger.{{sfn|Farago|1964|p=790}}\n\nBy April, resistance against the Third Army was tapering off, and the forces' main efforts turned to managing some 400,000 German prisoners of war.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=158\u2013159}} On April 14, 1945, Patton was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]], a promotion long advocated by Stimson in recognition of Patton's battle accomplishments during 1944.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=655}} Later that month, Patton, Bradley, and Eisenhower toured the [[Merkers-Kieselbach|Merkers salt mine]] as well as the [[Ohrdruf concentration camp]], and seeing the conditions of the camp firsthand caused Patton great disgust. Third Army was ordered toward [[Bavaria]] and [[Czechoslovakia]], anticipating a [[last stand]] by Nazi German forces there. He was reportedly appalled to learn that the [[Red Army]] would take [[Berlin]], feeling that the [[Soviet Union]] was a threat to the U.S. Army's advance to [[Plze\u0148|Pilsen]], but was stopped by Eisenhower from reaching [[Prague, Czechoslovakia]], before [[V-E Day]] on May 8 and the end of the war in Europe.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=160\u2013162}}\n\nIn its advance from the Rhine to the Elbe, Patton's Third Army, which numbered between 250,000 and 300,000 men at any given time, captured {{convert|32763|sqmi}} of German territory. Its losses were 2,102 killed, 7,954 wounded, and 1,591 missing.

On June 7, he arrived in [[Bedford, Massachusetts]], for extended leave with his family, and was greeted by thousands of spectators. Patton then drove to [[Hatch Memorial Shell]] and spoke to some 20,000, including a crowd of 400 wounded Third Army veterans. In this speech he aroused some controversy among the [[American Gold Star Mothers|Gold Star Mothers]] when he stated that a man who dies in battle is \"frequently a fool\",{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=721}} adding that the wounded are heroes. Patton spent time in Boston before visiting and speaking in [[Denver]] and visiting [[Los Angeles]], where he spoke to a crowd of 100,000 at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum|Memorial Coliseum]]. Patton made a final stop in [[Washington, D.C.]] before returning to Europe in July to serve in the [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation forces]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}}\n\nOn June 14, 1945, Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]] announced that Patton would not be sent to the Pacific but would return to Europe in an occupation army assignment.<ref>Associated Press, \"Patton Fails To Get Task in Orient\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', San Bernardino, California, Friday June 15, 1945, Volume 51, page 2.</ref>\n\nPatton was appointed as military [[governor]] of Bavaria, where he led the Third Army in [[denazification]] efforts.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} Patton was particularly upset when learning of the end of the war against Japan, writing in his diary, \"Yet another war has come to an end, and with it my usefulness to the world.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} Unhappy with his position and depressed by his belief that he would never fight in another war, Patton's behavior and statements became increasingly erratic. Various explanations beyond his disappointments have been proposed for Patton's behavior at this point. Carlo D'Este wrote that \"it seems virtually inevitable&nbsp;... that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries\" from a lifetime of numerous auto- and horse-related accidents, especially one suffered while playing [[polo]] in 1936.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nPatton's niece [[Jean Gordon (Red Cross)|Jean Gordon]] appeared again; they spent some time together in London in 1944, and again in Bavaria in 1945. Gordon actually loved a young married captain who left her despondent when he went home to his wife in September 1945.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=744}} Patton repeatedly boasted of his sexual success with Gordon, but his biographers are skeptical. Hirshson said that the relationship was casual.{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=535}} Showalter believes that Patton, under severe physical and psychological stress, made up claims of sexual conquest to prove his virility.{{sfn|Showalter|2006|pp=412\u201313}} D'Este agrees, saying, \"His behavior suggests that in both 1936 [in Hawaii] and 1944\u201345, the presence of the young and attractive Jean was a means of assuaging the anxieties of a middle-aged man troubled over his virility and a fear of aging.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=743}}\n\nPatton attracted controversy as military governor when it was noted that several former [[Nazi Party]] members continued to hold political posts in the region.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democrats]] and [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] in noting that most of the people with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=16}} On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, \"All good things must come to an end. The best thing that has ever happened to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\nPatton's final assignment was to command the [[U.S. 15th Army]], based in [[Bad Nauheim]]. The 15th Army at this point consisted only of a small headquarters staff working to compile a history of the war in Europe. Patton had accepted the post because of his love of history, but quickly lost interest. He began traveling, visiting Paris, [[Rennes]], [[Chartres]], [[Brussels]], [[Metz]], [[Reims]], [[Luxembourg]], and [[Verdun]]. Then he went to{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}} [[Stockholm]], where he reunited with other athletes from the 1912 Olympics. Patton decided that he would leave his post at the 15th Army and not return to Europe once he left on December 10 for [[Christmas]] leave. He intended to discuss with his wife whether he would continue in a stateside post or retire from the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}\n\n=== Accident and death ===\n[[File:General Patton's grave 300806.jpg|thumb|Patton's grave in [[Luxembourg City]]]]\nOn December 8, 1945, Patton's chief of staff, Major General [[Hobart R. Gay|Hobart Gay]], invited him on a [[pheasant]] hunting trip near [[Speyer]] to lift his spirits. Observing derelict cars along the side of the road, Patton said, \"How awful war is. Think of the waste.\" Moments later his car collided with an American army truck at low speed.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=167}}{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826\u2013827}}\n\nGay and others were only slightly injured, but Patton hit his head on the glass partition in the back seat. He began bleeding from a gash to the head, and complained that he was paralyzed and having trouble breathing. Taken to a hospital in [[Heidelberg]], Patton was discovered to have a [[compression fracture]] and dislocation of the cervical third and fourth [[vertebra]]e, resulting in a broken neck and [[cervical spinal cord]] injury that rendered him [[quadriplegia|paralyzed from the neck down]].{{sfn|Farago|1964|pp=826\u2013827}}\n\nPatton spent most of the next 12 days in [[traction (orthopedics)#Spinal decompression|spinal traction]] to decrease the pressure on his spine. All nonmedical visitors, except for Patton's wife, who had flown from the U.S., were forbidden. Patton, who had been told he had no chance to ever again ride a horse or resume normal life, at one point commented, \"This is a hell of a way to die.\" He died in his sleep of [[pulmonary edema]] and [[congestive heart failure]] at about 18:00 on December 21, 1945.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=168\u2013169}}\n\nPatton was buried at the [[Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial]] in the [[Hamm, Luxembourg|Hamm district]] of [[Luxembourg City]], alongside some wartime casualties of the Third Army, in accordance with his request to \"be buried with [his] men\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries-memorials |publisher=[[American Battle Monuments Commission]] |title=Luxembourg American Cemetery and Memorial |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Main|Service summary of George S.

Patton's great oratory skill is seen as integral to his ability to inspire troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=ix}} Historian [[Terry Brighton]] concluded that Patton was \"arrogant, publicity-seeking and personally flawed, but&nbsp;... among the greatest generals of the war\".{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xv}} Patton's impact on armored warfare and leadership were substantial, with the [[U.S. Army]]'s adopting many of Patton's aggressive strategies for its training programs following his death. Many military officers claim inspiration from his legacy. The first American tank designed after the war became the [[M46 Patton]].{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=viii}}\n\nSeveral actors have portrayed Patton on screen, the most famous being [[George C.

Scott's iconic depiction of Patton earned him an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]], and it was instrumental in bringing Patton into popular culture as a [[folk hero]].{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=1}} He would reprise the role in 1986 in the made-for-television film ''[[The Last Days of Patton]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\"/> Other actors who have portrayed Patton include [[Stephen McNally]] in the 1957 episode \"The Patton Prayer\" of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] religion [[anthology series]], ''[[Crossroads (1955 TV series)|Crossroads]]'', [[John Larch]] in the 1963 film ''[[Miracle of the White Stallions]]'', [[Kirk Douglas]] in the 1966 film ''[[Is Paris Burning?

Patton's speech to the Third Army}}\n\nPatton cultivated a flashy, distinctive image in the belief that this would inspire his troops. He carried an ivory-gripped, engraved, silver-plated [[Colt Single Action Army]] .45 caliber revolver on his right hip, and frequently wore an ivory-gripped [[Smith & Wesson Model 27]] .357 Magnum on his left hip.{{sfn|Zaloga|2010|p=9}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvi}} He was usually seen wearing a highly polished helmet, riding pants, and high cavalry boots.{{Sfn|D'Este|1995|p=478}} Patton also cultivated a stern expression he called his \"war face\".{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=110}} He was known to oversee training maneuvers from atop a tank painted red, white and blue. His [[jeep]] bore oversized rank placards on the front and back, as well as a klaxon horn which would loudly announce his approach from afar. He proposed a new uniform for the emerging Tank Corps, featuring polished buttons, a gold helmet, and thick, dark padded suits; the proposal was derided in the media as \"the Green Hornet\", and it was rejected by the Army.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77\u201379}}\n\nThe historian [[Alan Axelrod]] wrote that \"for Patton, leadership was never simply about making plans and giving orders, it was about transforming oneself into a symbol\".{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80\u201382}} Patton intentionally expressed a conspicuous desire for glory, atypical of the officer corps of the day which emphasized blending in with troops on the battlefield. He was an admirer of Admiral [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] for his actions in leading the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in a full dress uniform.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=80\u201382}} Patton had a preoccupation with bravery,{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=14\u201315}} wearing his rank insignia conspicuously in combat, and at one point during World War II, he rode atop a tank into a German-controlled village seeking to inspire courage in his men.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=54\u201355}}\n\nPatton was a staunch [[fatalist]],{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} and he believed in [[reincarnation]]. He believed that he might have been a military leader killed in action in Napoleon's army or a [[Roman legionary]] in a previous life.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=11\u201312}}{{sfn|Brighton|2009|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nPatton developed an ability to deliver charismatic speeches.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=67\u201368}} He used profanity heavily in his speech, which generally was enjoyed by troops under his command, but it offended other generals, including Bradley.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=578}} The most famous of his speeches were a series he delivered to the Third Army prior to Operation Overlord.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=130\u2013131}} When speaking, he was known for his bluntness and witticism; he once said, \"The two most dangerous weapons the Germans have are our own armored [[halftrack]] and jeep. The halftrack because the boys in it go all heroic, thinking they are in a tank. The jeep because we have so many God-awful drivers. \"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}} During the Battle of the Bulge, he famously remarked that the Allies should \"let the sons-of-bitches [Germans] go all the way to Paris, then we'll cut them off and round them up.\"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}} He also suggested facetiously that his Third Army could \"drive the British back into the sea for another [[Battle of Dunkirk|Dunkirk]].\"{{sfn|Evans|2001|pp=151\u2013168}}\n\nAs media scrutiny on Patton increased, his bluntness stirred controversy. These began in North Africa when some reporters worried that he was becoming too close to former Vichy officials with Axis sympathies.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=111}} His public image was more seriously damaged after word of the slapping incidents broke.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=113}} Another controversy occurred prior to Operation Overlord when Patton spoke at a British welcoming club at [[Knutsford]] in England, and said, in part, \"since it is the evident destiny of the British and Americans, and of course, the Russians, to rule the world, the better we know each other, the better job we will do.\" The next day news accounts misquoted Patton by leaving off the Russians.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p= 114}}\n\nOn a visit home after the war he again made headlines when he attempted to honor several wounded veterans in a speech by calling them \"the real heroes\" of the war, unintentionally offending the families of soldiers who had been killed in action.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=163\u2013164}} His final media blowup occurred in September 1945, when goaded by reporters about denazification, he said \"[d]enazification would be like removing all the Republicans and all the Democrats who were in office, who had held office or were quasi-Democrats or Republicans and that would take some time.\" This caused Eisenhower to relieve Patton from command of the Third Army.{{sfn|Lovelace|2014|p=117}}\n\n[[File:Patton's .357 revolver.jpg|thumb|left|Patton's well-known custom ivory-handled revolver]]\nAs a leader, Patton was known to be highly critical, correcting subordinates mercilessly for the slightest infractions, but also being quick to praise their accomplishments.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=77\u201379}} Although he garnered a reputation as a general who was both impatient and impulsive and had little tolerance for officers who had failed to succeed, he fired only one general during World War II, [[Orlando Ward]], and only after two warnings, whereas Bradley sacked several generals during the war.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=467\u2013468}} Patton reportedly had the utmost respect for the men serving in his command, particularly the wounded.{{sfn|Atkinson|2007|p=147}} Many of his directives showed special trouble to care for the enlisted men under his command, and he was well known for arranging extra supplies for battlefield soldiers, including blankets and extra socks, galoshes, and other items normally in short supply at the front.{{sfn|Wallace|1946|p=97}}\n\nPatton's views on race were complicated and controversial. This may have resulted from his privileged upbringing and family roots in the [[Confederate States of America|southern United States]].{{sfn|Brighton|2009|p=18}} Privately he wrote of black soldiers: \"Individually they were good soldiers, but I expressed my belief at the time, and have never found the necessity of changing it, that a colored soldier cannot think fast enough to fight in armor.\"{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=60}} He also stated that performance was more important than race or religious affiliation: \"I don't give a damn who the man is. He can be a Nigger or a Jew, but if he has the stuff and does his duty, he can have anything I've got. By God! I love him.\"{{sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=864}}\n\nAddressing the [[761st Tank Battalion (United States)|761st Tank Battalion]] Patton also said, \"Men, you are the first Negro tankers ever to fight in the American Army. I would never have asked for you if you weren't good. I have nothing but the best in my army. I don't care what color you are, so long as you go up there and kill those Kraut sonsabitches! Everyone has their eyes on you and is expecting great things from you. Most of all, your race is looking forward to you. Don't let them down and, damn you, don't let me down!\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=726}} Likewise, Patton called heavily on the Black troops under his command.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=4}} Historian Hugh Cole notes that Patton was the first to integrate black and white soldiers into the same rifle companies.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p= 726}}\n\nAfter reading the [[Koran]] and observing [[North Africa]]ns, he wrote to his wife, \"Just finished reading the Koran\u2014a good book and interesting.\" Patton had a keen eye for native customs and methods and wrote knowingly of local architecture; he once rated the progress of word-of-mouth rumor in [[Arab]] country at {{convert|40|\u2013|60|mi}} a day. In spite of his regard for the Koran, he concluded, \"To me it seems certain that the [[fatalistic]] teachings of [[Mohammad]] and the utter degradation of women is the outstanding cause for the arrested development of the Arab&nbsp;... Here, I think, is a text for some eloquent sermon on the virtues of [[Christianity]].\"{{sfn|Patton|1947|p=49}}\n\nPatton was impressed with the Soviet Union but was disdainful of [[Russians]], saying \"I have no particular desire to understand them, except to ascertain how much lead or iron it takes to kill them. In addition to his other Asiatic characteristics, the Russian has no regard for human life and is an all out son of bitch, barbarian, and chronic drunk.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=739}} Later in life he also began to express growing feelings of antisemitism and [[anticommunism]], as a result of his frequent controversies in the press.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|pp=165\u2013166}}\n\n=== As viewed by Allied and Axis leaders ===\n[[File:Patton Monument West Point in new location 2009 upright.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Patton at the US Military Academy at [[West Point]]]]\nOn February 1, 1945, Eisenhower wrote a memo ranking the military capabilities of his subordinate American generals in Europe. General Bradley and the [[Army Air Forces]] General [[Carl Spaatz]] shared the number one position, [[Walter Bedell Smith]] was ranked number three, and Patton number four.{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=801}} Eisenhower revealed his reasoning in a 1946 review of the book ''Patton and His Third Army'': \"George Patton was the most brilliant commander of an Army in the open field that our or any other service produced. But his army was part of a whole organization and his operations part of a great campaign.\" {{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}} Eisenhower believed that other generals such as Bradley should be given the credit for planning the successful Allied campaigns across Europe in which Patton was merely \"a brilliant executor\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}\n\nNotwithstanding Eisenhower's estimation of Patton's abilities as a strategic planner, his overall view of Patton's military value in achieving Allied victory in Europe is revealed in his refusal to even consider sending Patton home after the slapping incidents of 1943, after which he privately remarked, \"Patton is indispensable to the war effort\u2014one of the guarantors of our victory.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=536}} As [[Assistant Secretary of War]] [[John J. McCloy]] told Eisenhower: \"[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]'s remark after they got after [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] comes to mind when I think of Patton\u2014'I can't spare this man, he fights'.\"{{sfn|D'Este|2002|p=442}} After Patton's death, Eisenhower would write his own tribute: \"He was one of those men born to be a soldier, an ideal combat leader&nbsp;... It is no exaggeration to say that Patton's name struck terror at the hearts of the enemy.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=818}}\n\n[[Carlo D'Este]] insisted that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally,{{sfn|D'Este|1995|pp=466\u2013467}}{{sfn|D'Este|2002|pp=403\u2013404}} but Bradley's biographer Jim DeFelice noted that the evidence indicates otherwise.{{sfn|DeFelice|2011|p=402}} President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] appeared to greatly esteem Patton and his abilities, stating \"he is our greatest fighting general, and sheer joy\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}} On the other hand, Roosevelt's successor, [[Harry S. Truman]], appears to have taken an instant dislike to Patton, at one point comparing both him and [[Douglas MacArthur]] to [[George Armstrong Custer]].{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=755}}\n\nFor the most part, British commanders did not hold Patton in high regard. [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS)\u2014the professional head of the British Army\u2014noted in January 1943 that \"I had heard of him, but I must confess that his swashbuckling personality exceeded my expectation. I did not form any high opinion of him, nor had I any reason to alter this view at any later date. A dashing, courageous, wild, and unbalanced leader, good for operations requiring thrust and push, but at a loss in any operation requiring skill and judgment.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=451}}\n\nOne possible exception was [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] who appears to have admired Patton's ability to command troops in the field, if not his strategic judgment.{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=549}} Other Allied commanders were more impressed, the [[Free France|Free French]] in particular. General [[Henri Giraud]] was incredulous when he heard of Patton's dismissal by Eisenhower in late 1945, and invited him to Paris to be decorated by [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|French President]], [[Charles de Gaulle]], at a state banquet. At the banquet, President de Gaulle gave a speech placing Patton's achievements alongside those of Napoleon.{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|p=801}} Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] was apparently an admirer, stating that the [[Red Army]] could neither have planned nor executed Patton's rapid armored advance across France.{{Sfn|Hirshson|2003|p=562}}\n\n[[File:2011-01-6 Baugnez laarzen van George Patton 6-01-2012 14-09-34.JPG|thumb|Patton's boots at a museum in [[Malmedy]]]]\n\nWhile Allied leaders expressed mixed feelings on Patton's capabilities, the German High Command was noted to have more respect for him than for any other Allied commander after 1943.{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=127}} [[Adolf Hitler]] reportedly called him \"that crazy cowboy general\".{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} Many German field commanders were generous in their praise of Patton's leadership following the war,{{refn|Among the opinions of Patton's abilities, ''[[Oberstleutnant]]'' Horst Freiherr von Wangenheim, operations officer of the [[277th Volksgrenadier Division (Wehrmacht)|277th Volksgrenadier Division]], stated that \"General Patton is the most feared general on all fronts. [His] tactics are daring and unpredictable\u2026. He is the most modern general and the best commander of [combined] armored and infantry forces.\"{{sfn|Blumenson|1974|pp=480\u2013483}} ''General der Panzertruppen'' [[Hasso von Manteuffel]], who had fought both Soviet and Anglo-American tank commanders, agreed: \"Patton! No doubt about this. He was a brilliant Panzer army commander.\"{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=78}}|group=Note}} and many of its highest commanders also held his abilities in high regard. [[Erwin Rommel]] credited Patton with executing \"the most astonishing achievement in mobile warfare\".{{Sfn|Brighton|2009|p=xvii}} ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Alfred Jodl]], chief of staff of the German Army, stated that Patton \"was the American [[Heinz Guderian|Guderian]]. He was very bold and preferred large movements. He took big risks and won big successes.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Albert Kesselring]] said that \"Patton had developed tank warfare into an art, and understood how to handle tanks brilliantly in the field. I feel compelled, therefore, to compare him with ''Generalfeldmarschall'' Rommel, who likewise had mastered the art of tank warfare. Both of them had a kind of second sight in regard to this type of warfare.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} Referring to the escape of the Afrika Korps after the [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Battle of El Alamein]], [[Fritz Bayerlein]] opined that \"I do not think that General Patton would let us get away so easily.\"{{sfn|D'Este|1995|p=815}} In an interview conducted for ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' just after his capture, Field Marshal [[Gerd von Rundstedt]] stated simply of Patton, \"He is your best.\"{{sfn|Axelrod|2006|p=1}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Service summary of George S.

2013, ''British Lion'' holds a score of 56 at the aggregate review site [[Metacritic]], indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> ''[[Record Collector]]'' awarded the album 3/5 and

''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref

I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial. There's all kinds of stuff going on, with nods to [[the Who]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting.\"<ref

as letting his strings \"go dead\".<ref>{{cite episode | title = Iron Maiden | series = [[That Metal Show]] | serieslink =  | credits = [[Eddie Trunk]], [[Jim Florentine]], [[Don Jamieson

He was hired throughout his life to complete many important works in government and religious buildings around Italy. Duccio is considered one of the greatest Italian painters of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"eb\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Duccio Encyclopedia Britannica: Duccio]</ref>, and is credited with creating the painting styles of [[Trecento]] and the [[Sienese school]]. He also contributed significantly to the Sienese [[Gothic art|Gothic style]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlthough much is still unconfirmed about Duccio and his life, there is more documentation of him and his life than of other Italian painters of his time. It is known that he was born and died in the city of [[Siena]], and was also mostly active in the surrounding region of [[Tuscany]]. Other details of his early life and family are as uncertain, as much else in his history.\n\nOne avenue to reconstructing Duccio's biography are the traces of him in archives that list when he ran up debts or incurred fines. Some records say he was married with seven children. The relative abundance of archival mentions has led historians to believe that he had difficulties managing his life and his money. Due to his debts, Duccio's family dissociated themselves from him after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eimerl |first=Sarel |others=et al |title=The World of Giotto: c. 1267\u20131337 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc100eime |url-access=registration |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1967 |isbn=0-900658-15-0 |p=[https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc100eime/page/62 62]}}</ref>\n\nAnother route to filling in Duccio's biography are by analyzing the works that can be attributed to him with certainty. Information can be obtained by analyzing his style, the date and location of the works, and more. Due to gaps where Duccio's name goes unmentioned in the Sienese records for years at a time, scholars speculate he may have traveled to Paris, Assisi and Rome.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023857?q=duccio&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#T023873 |title= Duccio (di Buoninsegna) |last=Gordon |first=Dillian |date=28 July 2014 |website= Oxford Art Online |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023857?q%3Dduccio%26search%3Dquick%26pos%3D1%26_start%3D1#T023873 |archive-date= 2016-12-30 |url-status= dead |access-date= 10 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, his artistic talents were enough to overshadow his lack of organization as a citizen, and he became famous in his own lifetime. In the 14th century Duccio became one of the most favored and radical painters in Siena.\n\n==Artistic career==\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 036.jpg|thumb|240px|''The Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew'' (from the ''Maest\u00e0'') c. 1308\u20131311.]]\nWhere Duccio studied, and with whom, is still a matter of great debate, but by analyzing his style and technique art historians have been able to limit the field.{{sfn|Smart|1978|page=39}} Many believe that he studied under [[Cimabue]], while others think that maybe he had actually traveled to [[Constantinople]] himself and learned directly from a Byzantine master.\n\nLittle is known of his painting career prior to 1278, when at the age of 23 he is recorded as having painted twelve account book cases.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdeIF0rQFDUC&lpg=PA289&dq=duccio%20twelve%20panels%20the%20nine&pg=PA289#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Art and Architecture in Italy 1250\u20131400| isbn=0300055854| last1=White| first1=John| year=1993}}</ref> Although Duccio was active from 1268 to about 1311 only approximately 13 of his works survive today.<ref>smarthistory.khanacademy.org/duccio-madonna.html</ref>\n\nOf Duccio's surviving works, only two can be definitively dated. Both were major public commissions:<ref name=meta>{{cite web |title= Madonna and Child Duccio di Buoninsegna (Italian, active by 1278\u2013died 1318 Siena) |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003462 |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> the \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" ([[Galleria degli Uffizi]]), commissioned in April 1285 by the Compagnia del Laudesi di Maria Vergine for a chapel in [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]; and the [[Maest\u00e0 (Duccio)|Maest\u00e0]] commissioned for the high altar of [[Siena Cathedral]] in 1308, which Duccio completed by June 1311.{{sfn|Smart|1978|p=40}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Duccio di buoninsegna, madonna col bambino, 1300 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Madonna with child, the child touching the virgin's veil]]\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, 1308-1311, NGA 10.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel'', 1308\u20131311, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\nDuccio's known works are on [[panel paintings|wood panel]], painted in [[egg tempera]] and embellished with [[gold leaf]]. Differently from his contemporaries and artists before him, Duccio was a master of tempera and managed to conquer the medium with delicacy and precision. There is no clear evidence that Duccio painted [[fresco]]es.{{sfn|Smart|1978 |page=39}}\n\nDuccio's style was similar to Byzantine art in some ways, with its gold backgrounds and familiar religious scenes, however it was also different and more experimental. Duccio began to break down the sharp lines of Byzantine art, and soften the figures. He used modeling (playing with light and dark colors) to reveal the figures underneath the heavy drapery; hands, faces, and feet became more rounded and three-dimensional. Duccio's paintings are inviting and warm with color. His pieces consisted of many delicate details and were sometimes inlaid with jewels or ornamental fabrics. Duccio was also noted for his complex organization of space. He organized his characters specifically and purposefully. In his \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" (c. 1285) the viewer can see all of these qualities at play.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Polzer |first=Joseph |title= A Question of Method: Quantitative Aspects of Art Historical Analysis in the Classification of Early Trecento Italian Painting Based on Ornamental Practice |journal=Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florenz |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=33\u2013100 |jstor= 27655375}}</ref>\n\nDuccio was also one of the first painters to put figures in architectural settings, as he began to explore and investigate depth and space. He also had a refined attention to emotion not seen in other painters at this time. The characters interact tenderly with each other; it is no longer Christ and the Virgin, it is mother and child. He flirts with naturalism, but his paintings are still awe inspiring. Duccio's figures seem to be otherworldly or heavenly, consisting of beautiful colors, soft hair, gracefulness and fabrics not available to mere humans.\n\nHe influenced many other painters, most notably [[Simone Martini]], and the brothers [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti|Ambrogio]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]].\n\n==Followers of Duccio==\nIn the course of his life, Duccio had many pupils, even if it is not known if these were true pupils, formed and matured artistically within his workshop, or simply painters who imitated his style. Many of these artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, whom we can refer to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], the [[Master of Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the ''Collazioni dei Santi Padri'' and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.\n\nAnother group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include [[Segna di Bonaventura]], [[Ugolino di Nerio]], the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should however be said that [[Segna di Bonaventura]] was already active prior to 1300, so that he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.\n\nA third group followed Duccio only at a distance of several years after his death, a fact which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include [[Segna di Bonaventura]]'s sons, that is, [[Niccol\u00f2 di Segna]] and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of [[Ugolino di Nerio]], namely, the Master of Chianciano.\n\nSome of these artists were influenced by Duccio alone, to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among these the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], and [[Ugolino di Nerio]], along with [[Segna di Bonaventura]] and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of [[Giotto]]), and the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0 (who shows the influence also of [[Simone Martini]]).\n\nThe case of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]] is somewhat different. These two artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for [[Simone Martini|Simone]] from about 1305, and [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in [[Simone Martini|Simone's]] Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305\u20131310) and in [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro's]] ''Orsini Triptych'', painted at [[Assisi]] (about 1310\u20131315).

He was hired throughout his life to complete many important works in government and religious buildings around Italy. Duccio is considered one of the greatest Italian painters of the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=\"eb\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Duccio Encyclopedia Britannica: Duccio]</ref>, and is credited with creating the painting styles of [[Trecento]] and the [[Sienese school]]. He also contributed significantly to the Sienese [[Gothic art|Gothic style]].\n\n==Biography==\nAlthough much is still unconfirmed about Duccio and his life, there is more documentation of him and his life than of other Italian painters of his time. It is known that he was born and died in the city of [[Siena]], and was also mostly active in the surrounding region of [[Tuscany]]. Other details of his early life and family are as uncertain, as much else in his history.\n\nOne avenue to reconstructing Duccio's biography are the traces of him in archives that list when he ran up debts or incurred fines. Some records say he was married with seven children. The relative abundance of archival mentions has led historians to believe that he had difficulties managing his life and his money. Due to his debts, Duccio's family dissociated themselves from him after his death.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eimerl |first=Sarel |others=et al |title=The World of Giotto: c. 1267\u20131337 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc100eime |url-access=registration |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1967 |isbn=0-900658-15-0 |p=[https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc100eime/page/62 62]}}</ref>\n\nAnother route to filling in Duccio's biography are by analyzing the works that can be attributed to him with certainty. Information can be obtained by analyzing his style, the date and location of the works, and more. Due to gaps where Duccio's name goes unmentioned in the Sienese records for years at a time, scholars speculate he may have traveled to Paris, Assisi and Rome.<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023857?q=duccio&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#T023873 |title= Duccio (di Buoninsegna) |last=Gordon |first=Dillian |date=28 July 2014 |website= Oxford Art Online |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161230000000/http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023857?q%3Dduccio%26search%3Dquick%26pos%3D1%26_start%3D1#T023873 |archive-date= 2016-12-30 |url-status= dead |access-date= 10 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, his artistic talents were enough to overshadow his lack of organization as a citizen, and he became famous in his own lifetime. In the 14th century Duccio became one of the most favored and radical painters in Siena.\n\n==Artistic career==\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 036.jpg|thumb|240px|''The Calling of the Apostles Peter and Andrew'' (from the ''Maest\u00e0'') c. 1308\u20131311.]]\nWhere Duccio studied, and with whom, is still a matter of great debate, but by analyzing his style and technique art historians have been able to limit the field.{{sfn|Smart|1978|page=39}} Many believe that he studied under [[Cimabue]], while others think that maybe he had actually traveled to [[Constantinople]] himself and learned directly from a Byzantine master.\n\nLittle is known of his painting career prior to 1278, when at the age of 23 he is recorded as having painted twelve account book cases.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=LdeIF0rQFDUC&lpg=PA289&dq=duccio%20twelve%20panels%20the%20nine&pg=PA289#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Art and Architecture in Italy 1250\u20131400| isbn=0300055854| last1=White| first1=John| year=1993}}</ref> Although Duccio was active from 1268 to about 1311 only approximately 13 of his works survive today.<ref>smarthistory.khanacademy.org/duccio-madonna.html</ref>\n\nOf Duccio's surviving works, only two can be definitively dated. Both were major public commissions:<ref name=meta>{{cite web |title= Madonna and Child Duccio di Buoninsegna (Italian, active by 1278\u2013died 1318 Siena) |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110003462 |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref> the \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" ([[Galleria degli Uffizi]]), commissioned in April 1285 by the Compagnia del Laudesi di Maria Vergine for a chapel in [[Santa Maria Novella]] in [[Florence]]; and the [[Maest\u00e0 (Duccio)|Maest\u00e0]] commissioned for the high altar of [[Siena Cathedral]] in 1308, which Duccio completed by June 1311.{{sfn|Smart|1978|p=40}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Duccio di buoninsegna, madonna col bambino, 1300 ca..JPG|thumb|200px|Madonna with child, the child touching the virgin's veil]]\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna, The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel, 1308-1311, NGA 10.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nativity with the Prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel'', 1308\u20131311, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\nDuccio's known works are on [[panel paintings|wood panel]], painted in [[egg tempera]] and embellished with [[gold leaf]]. Differently from his contemporaries and artists before him, Duccio was a master of tempera and managed to conquer the medium with delicacy and precision. There is no clear evidence that Duccio painted [[fresco]]es.{{sfn|Smart|1978 |page=39}}\n\nDuccio's style was similar to Byzantine art in some ways, with its gold backgrounds and familiar religious scenes, however it was also different and more experimental. Duccio began to break down the sharp lines of Byzantine art, and soften the figures. He used modeling (playing with light and dark colors) to reveal the figures underneath the heavy drapery; hands, faces, and feet became more rounded and three-dimensional. Duccio's paintings are inviting and warm with color. His pieces consisted of many delicate details and were sometimes inlaid with jewels or ornamental fabrics. Duccio was also noted for his complex organization of space. He organized his characters specifically and purposefully. In his \"[[Rucellai Madonna]]\" (c. 1285) the viewer can see all of these qualities at play.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Polzer |first=Joseph |title= A Question of Method: Quantitative Aspects of Art Historical Analysis in the Classification of Early Trecento Italian Painting Based on Ornamental Practice |journal=Mitteilungen des Kunsthistorisches Institutes in Florenz |year=2005 |volume=49 |issue=1/2 |pages=33\u2013100 |jstor= 27655375}}</ref>\n\nDuccio was also one of the first painters to put figures in architectural settings, as he began to explore and investigate depth and space. He also had a refined attention to emotion not seen in other painters at this time. The characters interact tenderly with each other; it is no longer Christ and the Virgin, it is mother and child. He flirts with naturalism, but his paintings are still awe inspiring. Duccio's figures seem to be otherworldly or heavenly, consisting of beautiful colors, soft hair, gracefulness and fabrics not available to mere humans.\n\nHe influenced many other painters, most notably [[Simone Martini]], and the brothers [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti|Ambrogio]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]].\n\n==Followers of Duccio==\nIn the course of his life, Duccio had many pupils, even if it is not known if these were true pupils, formed and matured artistically within his workshop, or simply painters who imitated his style. Many of these artists are anonymous, and their connection to Duccio has emerged only from analysis of a body of work with common stylistic traits. The first pupils, whom we can refer to as a group as first-generation followers, were active between about 1290 and 1320 and include the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], the [[Master of Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], the Aringhieri Master, the Master of the ''Collazioni dei Santi Padri'' and the Master of San Polo in Rosso.\n\nAnother group of followers, who could be termed followers of the second generation, were active between about 1300 and 1335 and include [[Segna di Bonaventura]], [[Ugolino di Nerio]], the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0, the Master of Monte Oliveto and the Master of Monterotondo. It should however be said that [[Segna di Bonaventura]] was already active prior to 1300, so that he overlaps as to period both the first and second generation of followers.\n\nA third group followed Duccio only at a distance of several years after his death, a fact which shows the impact his painting had on Siena and on Tuscany as a whole. The artists of this third group, active between about 1330 and 1350, include [[Segna di Bonaventura]]'s sons, that is, [[Niccol\u00f2 di Segna]] and Francesco di Segna, and a pupil of [[Ugolino di Nerio]], namely, the Master of Chianciano.\n\nSome of these artists were influenced by Duccio alone, to the point of creating a decided affinity or kinship between their works and his. Among these the [[Master of Badia a Isola]], and [[Ugolino di Nerio]], along with [[Segna di Bonaventura]] and their sons. Other artists were influenced also by other schools, and these include the Aringhieri Master (think of the massive volumes of [[Giotto]]), and the Master of the Gondi Maest\u00e0 (who shows the influence also of [[Simone Martini]]).\n\nThe case of [[Simone Martini]] and [[Pietro Lorenzetti]] is somewhat different. These two artists painted works that have affinities with Duccio: for [[Simone Martini|Simone]] from about 1305, and [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro]] from about 1310 onwards. However, from the outset their work showed distinctive individual features, as can be seen in [[Simone Martini|Simone's]] Madonna and Child no. 583 (1305\u20131310) and in [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Pietro's]] ''Orsini Triptych'', painted at [[Assisi]] (about 1310\u20131315). Later the two developed styles with completely independent characteristics such that they acquired an artistic standing that elevates them well beyond being labelled simply as followers of Duccio.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Annunciation - WGA06752.jpg|Annunciation\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Transfiguration - WGA06780.jpg|Transfiguration\nFile:Duccio - Triptych- Crucifixion and other Scenes - Google Art Project.jpg|Crucifixion Triptych\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Flight into Egypt - WGA06766.jpg|Flight into Egypt\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Disputation with the Doctors - WGA06768.jpg|[[Christ Among the Doctors|Disputation with the Doctors]]\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - The Raising of Lazarus - Google Art Project.jpg|The Raising of Lazarus\nFile:Duccio di Buoninsegna - Christ and the Samaritan Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|Christ and the Samaritan Woman\nFile:MadonnaInTrono41.jpg|Maest\u00e0, detail\nFile:Madonna em Majestade dita Rucellai - Duccio.jpg|[[Rucellai Madonna]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Known surviving works==\n{{Category see also|Paintings by Duccio}}\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna cat01.jpg|thumb|200px|''Madonna with Child'', c. 1300\u20131305.]]\n* ''Madonna with Child'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Museo d'Arte Sacra della Val d'Arbia]], [[Buonconvento]], near Siena</small>\n* ''[[Gualino Madonna]]'' <small>\u2013 Tempera and gold on wood, [[Galleria Sabauda]], Turin </small>\n* ''Madonna with Child and two Angels'' (Also known as the ''Crevole Madonna'';
