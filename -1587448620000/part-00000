Rai does not approve of Shekhar and wants his daughter to marry a wealthy Calcutta-based businessman named Chowdhry. Rita asks Shekhar to get a better position, but Shekhar is quite satisfied with his singing career. So Rita and her father relocate to Calcutta, and Shekhar follows them. An enraged Rai complains to the police, who arrest Shekhar and hold him for questioning. However, the police notice his resemblance to a [[Chinatown, Kolkata|China Town]] gangster named Mike (also played by [[Shammi Kapoor]]), who they are holding in custody. Because Mike refuses to talk, the police convince Shekhar to impersonate him in order to infiltrate the Chinatown criminal ring. Meanwhile, Shekhar's mother reveals to him that Mike may be his long-lost brother, kidnapped by gangsters as a boy. Shekhar accordingly takes over Mike's life, but there is one thing he and the police overlooked&nbsp;\u2013 namely Mike&nbsp;\u2013 who escapes from police custody with the help of Rita, who mistakes him for Shekhar. Mike's girlfriend Suzie ([[Helen (actress)|Helen]]) finds out Shekhar's true identity, but spares him when he reveals that Mike is alive and captured by the police, and sympathizes with him after learning that Mike was his long-lost brother. The gangsters overhear this and capture Shekhar, his life is only spared after he tells Mike his true background and the two brothers capture the gang's leader. As a result, Shekhar gets a permanent police job that allows him to marry Rita and Mike receives a reduced sentence of three years.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shammi Kapoor]] as Shekhar / (Shankar)Mike (Double Role)\n* [[Shakila (actress)|Shakila]] as Rita D.

He suggested the building be named after the first speaker of Ghana's fourth parliament, [[Daniel Francis Annan|Justice D. F. Annan]], to honour the contribution he made towards the development of parliamentary affairs and democracy in Ghana.<ref name=CHANGE>{{cite web|title=Name \u2018Job 600\u2019 building after Justice Annan|url=http://www.ghananewslink.com/indexxxxxx.php?id=10911|publisher=www.ghananewslink.com|accessdate=5 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name=RENAME/> He also proposed that one of the two new blocks that were built behind the main Job 600 be named after [[Peter Ala Adjetey]] who succeeded Justice Annan.
