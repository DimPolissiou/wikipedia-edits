British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\n===Spanish preparations===\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to  [[Edward Vernon|Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on  [[Battle of Porto Bello|Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n\nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, [[Charles III of Spain]] made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling some 1,000 men. However, [[yellow fever]] quickly reduced the defending forces for the whole island, and by the time of the siege, they had been reduced to 3,850 soldiers, 5,000 sailors and marines and 2,800 militia. The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]]. It could easily accommodate up to 100 ships of the line. A 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel gave access to the harbour, and Havana housed important shipyards capable of building [[first-rate]] man-of-war ships.\n\nTwo strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref>\n\n===British preparations===\nWhen war broke out with Spain, plans were made in Great Britain for an amphibious attack on Havana. The expedition was under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]] as naval commander. This plan also called for [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] to embark 4,000 men from America to join Keppel and to assemble another force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]].\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section,if more than 200 [[mile]]s would take a large squadron at least a week, probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>     \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day. They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights. Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>   With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-7\">Bradley pp. 226-7</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]],<ref name=\"Bradley227\">Bradley p. 227</ref> on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro. Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead. He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock p. 230</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']]. The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June. Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro. Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro. Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived. During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch. At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion. Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort. Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay. Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana. A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August. Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Perspective view of his majesty's land forces going in flat boats to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle... LCCN2003653272.jpg|thumb|British land forces going in [[flatboats]] to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle on 14 August]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command,  [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival.

Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule.

British forces besieged and captured the city of [[Havana]], which at the time was an important [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] naval base in the [[Caribbean]], and dealt a serious blow to the [[Spanish Navy]]. Havana was subsequently returned to Spain under the 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that formally ended the war.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Anglo-Spanish War (1762\u20131763)}}\n===Spanish preparations===\nHavana in the late 18th century was a major port and naval base, and also the strongest fortress in Spanish America. Its royal shipyard with access to abundant supplies of resistant hardwoods had been developed by the Bourbon monarchy as the most important of its three naval shipyards.<ref name=\"Roger50\">Roger p. 50</ref><ref name=\"Schneider72-73\">Schneider pp. 72-73</ref> There had been several previous plans to attack Havana, including one proposed to [[Edward Vernon| Vernon]] in 1739, which he rejected in favour of an attack on [[Battle of Porto Bello| Portobello]],<ref name=\"Bradley201\">Bradley p. 201</ref> but no successful attack since it was comprehensively fortified,<ref name=\"Schneider21\">Schneider p. 21</ref> and the strength of its fortifications and difficulty that large sailing warships would have in making an undetected approach from the north convinced the Spanish commanders it would be virtually impossible to capture, if its fortifications were in good order and it was properly garrisoned. Its wealth and ability to feed its population also suggested that it could resist being starved into surrender.<ref name=\"Roger50-51\">Roger pp. 50-51</ref><ref name=\"Schneider61,106\">Schneider pp. 61,106</ref>\n   \nBefore involving his country in the conflict raging in Europe and across the world, [[Charles III of Spain]] made provisions to defend the [[Spanish colonies]] against the [[British Royal Navy]]. For the defence of Cuba, he appointed [[Juan de Prado Mayera Portocarrero y Luna|Juan de Prado]] as commander-in-chief.  De Prado arrived at [[Havana]] in February 1761 and began work to improve the fortifications of the city.<ref name=\"Schneider82\">Schneider p. 82</ref>\n\nIn June 1761, a flotilla of seven [[ships of the line]] under the command of Admiral [[Gutierre de Hevia]] arrived at Havana, transporting two regular infantry regiments (Espa\u00f1a and Arag\u00f3n) totalling some 1,000 men. However, [[yellow fever]] quickly reduced the defending forces for the whole island, and by the time of the siege, they had been reduced to 3,850 soldiers, 5,000 sailors and marines and 2,800 militia. The main garrison consisted of:\n[[File:A plan of the Havana and its environs, with the several posts and attacks by Thomas Kitchin.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A plan of Havana and its environs in 1762, by [[Thomas Kitchen]]]]\n* Espa\u00f1a Infantry Regiment (481)\n* Arag\u00f3n Infantry Regiment (265)\n* Havana Infantry Regiment (856)\n* Edinburgh's Dragoons (150)\n* Army's gunners (104)\n* Navy's gunners and marines (750)\n\nHavana had one of the finest natural harbours in the [[West Indies]]. It could easily accommodate up to 100 ships of the line. A 180&nbsp;m wide and 800&nbsp;m long entrance channel gave access to the harbour, and Havana housed important shipyards capable of building [[first-rate]] man-of-war ships.\n\nTwo strong [[fortress]]es defended the entrance channel; on the north side of the channel stood the very strong ''Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro'' (known in English as [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Morro Castle]]) on the rocky Cavannos Ridge. It had 64 heavy guns and was garrisoned by 700 men. The south side was defended by the older ''[[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Castillo de San Salvador de la Punta]]''.<ref name=\"Schneider68\">Schneider p. 68</ref> The channel could also be blocked by a [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]] extending from El Morro to La Punta. Havana itself lay on the south side along the channel and was surrounded by a wall {{convert|5|km|mi}} long.<ref name=\"Schneider54\">Schneider p. 54</ref> \n\n===British preparations===\nWhen war broke out with Spain, plans were made in Great Britain for an amphibious attack on Havana. The expedition was under the command of [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle]], with Vice-Admiral Sir [[George Pocock]] as naval commander. This plan also called for [[Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffrey Amherst]] to embark 4,000 men from America to join Keppel and to assemble another force of 8,000 men for an attack on [[French Louisiana|Louisiana]].\n\nDuring the month of February, British troops embarked; they consisted of:\n* [[Cheshire regiment|22nd Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[34th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[56th Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[72nd Richmond's Regiment of Foot]]\n\nOn 5 March the British expedition sailed from [[Spithead]], England, with 7 ships of the line and 4,365 men aboard 64 transports, and arrived in [[Barbados]] on 20 April.  Five days later the expedition reached [[Fort-de-France|Fort Royal]] on the recently conquered island of [[Martinique]] where it picked up the remainder of Major-General [[Robert Monckton]]'s expedition, still numbering 8,461 men. Rear Admiral [[George Rodney]]'s squadron, amounting to 8 ships of the line also joined the expedition bringing the total number of ships of the line to 15.\n\nOn 23 May the expedition, now off the northwest corner of Saint-Domingue (present-day [[Haiti]]), was further reinforced by [[Sir James Douglas, 1st Baronet|Sir James Douglas]]' squadron from [[Port Royal, Jamaica]]. The force under Albemarle now amounted to 21 ships of the line, 24 lesser warships, and 168 other vessels, carrying some 14,000 seamen and marines plus another 3,000 hired sailors and 12,826 regulars.\n{{wide image|L'escadre anglaise pour attaquer La Havane en 1762.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|General view of the English squadron}}\n\n==Siege==\nThe  normal approach to Havana, on the north coast of Cuba, was to sail west parallel to the south coast of the island on the prevailing south-easterly wind, then to round its western tip and sail east towards Havana, against the wind. This last section,if more than 200 [[mile]]s would take a large squadron at least a week, probably several, giving ample warning for Havana to prepare. To the north of Havana, as far as [[the Bahamas]] is a wide expanse of shallow water, [[reef]]s and small islands or [[cay]s], accessible only to small boats except for one deep water channel, the [[Old Bahama Channel]] which is only some 10 miles wide at its narrowest. Although the Spanish navigators that charted it thought too dangerous for large warships, it was surveyed by a British frigate, whose captain left parties of his men in the cays to mark the extremities of the channel, allowing the whole fleet to pass through it, safely and undetected.<ref name=\"Bradley225\">Bradley p. 225</ref><ref name=\"Roger50-52\">Roger pp. 50-52</ref>      \n\nOn 6 June the British force came into sight of Havana. Immediately, 12 British ships of the line were sent to the mouth of the entrance channel to block in the Spanish fleet. The British planned to begin the operations by the reduction of the Morro fortress, on the north side of the channel, through a formal [[Vauban]]-style siege. The commanding position of this fort over the city would then force the Spanish commander to surrender. However, this plan did not take into account the fact that the fortress was located on a rocky promontory where it was impossible to dig approach trenches and that a large ditch cut into the rock protected the fort on the land side.\n[[File:Standard guide to Cuba - a new and complete guide to the island of Cuba, with maps, illustrations, routes of travel, history, and an English-Spanish phrase book (1909) (14801359763).jpg|thumb|Map of the Siege]]\n\nThe Spanish force under Prado and Admiral Hevia, surprised by the size of the attacking force, adopted a delaying defensive strategy. It had several advantages besides the hope of a relief force. Firstly, the [[hurricane]] season would begin in late August, putting the British fleet in danger: the wet weather starting earlier in that month would probably also initiate an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] among the besiegers.<ref name=\"Schneider126-127\">Schneider pp. 126-127</ref> Secondly, despite some losses from tropical diseases Prado had 1,500 Spanish regular soldiers and some 2,300 colonial [[militiamen]], as well as sailors from the fleet. The ships of the Spanish fleet was kept in the harbour while its sailors, gunners and marines were sent to garrison the fortresses of Morro and Punta which were placed under the command of naval officers.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref> Most of the shot and powder of the fleet as well as its best guns were also transferred to these two fortresses. Meanwhile, regular troops were assigned to the defence of the city. Prado also ordered all women, children and the old and infirm to leave the city, leaving only men able to bear arms.<ref name=\"Schneider135\">Schneider p. 135</ref>\n\nThe channel entrance was immediately closed with the [[boom (navigational barrier)|boom chain]]. Furthermore, 3 ships of the line (''Asia'' (64), ''Europa'' (64) and ''Neptuno'' (74)) were selected among the fleet for their poor condition and sunk behind the boom chain. Realising the importance of the Morro, the Spanish commanders gave it top priority.<ref name=\"Schneider122\">Schneider p. 122</ref>\n\nThe following day British troops were landed northeast of Havana, and began advancing west the next day. They met a militia party that was easily pushed back. By the end of the day, British infantry had reached the vicinity of Havana.<ref>Pockock p. 221</ref>  The defence of the Morro was assigned to [[Luis Vicente de Velasco e Isla]], a naval officer, who immediately took measures to prepare and provision the fortress for a siege.<ref name=\"Schneider121\">Schneider p. 121</ref>\n\n===Siege of El Morro===\n[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|left|Bombardment of the Morro Castle, Havana, 1 July 1762 by [[Richard Paton]]]]\nOn 11 June a British party stormed a detached redoubt on the Cavannos heights. Only then did the British command realise how strong the Morro was, surrounded by brushwood and protected by a large ditch.<ref>Pockock p. 226</ref>   With the arrival of their siege train the next day, the British began erecting batteries among the trees on La Cabana hill overlooking the Morro (some {{convert|7|m|ft}} higher) as well as the city and the bay. Surprisingly, this hill had been left undefended by the Spanish army despite its well-known strategic importance.<ref>Pockock p. 227</ref>  The king of Spain had even instructed Prado to fortify this hill, a task that he considered the most urgent among those confided to his commander.<ref name=\"Bradley226-7\">Bradley pp. 226-7</ref>\n\nTwo days later a British detachment landed at [[Torre\u00f3n de la Chorrera]],<ref name=\"Bradley227\">Bradley p. 227</ref> on the west side of the harbour. Meanwhile, Colonel [[Patrick Mackellar]], an engineer, was overseeing the construction of the siege works against the Morro. Since digging trenches was impossible, he resolved to erect breastworks instead. He planned to mine towards a bastion of the Morro once his siege works would have reached the ditch and to create a runway across this ditch with the rubble produced by his mining activities.\n\nBy 22 June, four British batteries totalling twelve heavy guns and 38 mortars opened fire on the Morro from La Cabana. Mackellar gradually advanced his breastworks towards the ditch under cover of these batteries so by the end of the month the British had increased their daily direct hits on the Morro to 500.  Velasco was losing as many as 30 men each day, and the workload of repairing the fortress every night was so exhausting that men had to be rotated into the fort from the city every three days. Velasco finally managed to convince Prado that a raid was necessary against the British batteries. At dawn on 29 June 988 men (a mixed company of grenadiers, marines, engineers, and slaves) attacked the siege works. They reached the British batteries from the rear and started to spike guns, but British reaction was swift, and the attackers were repulsed before they caused any serious damage.<ref>Pockock p. 230</ref>\n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, the English Battery before Morro Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|right|British siege guns before Morro Castle, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nOn 1 July, the British launched a combined land and naval attack on the Morro. The fleet detached four ships of the line for this purpose: [[HMS Stirling Castle (1742)|HMS ''Stirling Castle'']], [[HMS Dragon (1760)|HMS ''Dragon'']], [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] and [[HMS Cambridge (1755)|HMS ''Cambridge'']]. The naval and land artillery simultaneously opened fire on the Morro. However, naval guns were ineffective, the fort being located too high.<ref>Pockock pp. 231-232</ref>  Counter-fire from thirty guns of the Morro inflicted 192 casualties and seriously damaged the ships, one of which was later scuttled, forcing them to withdraw. Meanwhile, the bombardment by the land artillery was far more effective. By the end of the day, only three Spanish guns were still effective on the side of the Morro facing the British batteries. The next day however British breastworks around the Morro caught fire and the batteries were burned down, destroying the product of much of the work undertaken since mid June. Velasco immediately capitalised on this event, remounting many guns and repairing breaches in the fortifications of the Morro.\n\nSince its arrival at Havana, the British army had heavily suffered from [[yellow fever]] and was now at half strength. Since the [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] was approaching, Albemarle was now engaged in a race against time. He ordered the batteries to be rebuilt with the help of men of the fleet. Many [[32-pounder gun]]s were taken from the lower deck of several ships to equip these new batteries.\n\nBy 17 July the new British batteries had progressively silenced most of Velasco's guns, leaving only two of them operational. With the absence of artillery cover, it now became impossible for the Spanish troops to repair the damage being inflicted on the Morro. Mackellar was also able to resume construction of siege works to approach the fortress. With the army in such a bad condition, work progressed rather slowly. All hope of the British army now resided in the expected arrival of reinforcements from North America.\n\nThe progress of siege works over the next few days allowed the British to begin the mining towards the right bastion of the Morro. Meanwhile, the now unopposed British artillery was daily hitting the Morro up to 600 times, causing some sixty casualties. Velasco had now no hope but to destroy British siege works and so on 22 July 1,300 regulars, seamen and militia sallied from Havana in three columns and attacked the siege works surrounding the Morro. The British repelled the Spanish sortie who thus withdrew to their lines and the siege works were left relatively intact.\n[[File:Joshua reynolds, ritratto del general maggiore william keppel, 1762-65 ca.jpg|thumb|left|General [[William Keppel (British Army officer, born 1727)|William Keppel]], ''Storming the Morro Castle'', by [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]\n\nOn 24 July Albemarle offered Velasco the opportunity to surrender, allowing him to write his own terms of capitulation. Velasco answered that the issue would rather be settled by force of arms. Three days later the reinforcements from North America led by Colonel Burton finally arrived. During their journey, they had been attacked by the French, who captured some 500 men. These reinforcements consisted of:\n* [[46th (South Devonshire) Regiment of Foot|46th Thomas Murray's Regiment of Foot]]\n* [[58th (Rutlandshire) Regiment of Foot|58th Anstruther's Regiment of Foot]]\n* American provincials (3,000 men)\n* [[Gorham's Rangers|Gorham's]] and [[Danks' Rangers]] - which were combined into a 253-man ranger corps.\n\nOn 29 July the mine near the right bastion of the Morro fort was completed and ready to explode.<ref name=\"Schneider151\">Schneider p. 151</ref> Albemarle vainly feigned an assault, hoping that Velasco would finally decide to surrender. On the contrary, Velasco decided to launched a desperate attack from the sea upon the British miners in the ditch. At 2:00 am the next day two Spanish schooners attacked the miners from the sea. Their attack was unsuccessful and they had to withdraw. At 1:00 pm the British finally detonated the mine. The debris of the explosion partly filled the ditch but Albemarle judged it passable,<ref name=\"Schneider155\">Schneider p. 155</ref> and launched an assault, sending 699 picked men against the right bastion. Before the Spanish could react, sixteen men gained a foothold on the bastion. Velasco rushed to the breach with his troops, and was mortally wounded during the ensuing hand-to-hand fighting. The Spanish troops fell back, leaving the British in control of the Morro fort. Velasco was transported back to Havana, but by 31 July had died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Schneider151,225\">Schneider pp. 151, 225</ref>\n\nThe British then occupied a position commanding the city of Havana as well as the bay. Artillery batteries were brought up along the north side of the entrance channel from the Morro fort to La Cabana hill, where they could be trained directly on the town.\n[[File:Spanish flag RMG RP-76-19.jpg|thumb|300px|Parts of a patched Spanish flag captured during the assault on Moro Castle, showing arms of [[Castille and Leon]] with [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon arms]] in centre surrounded by [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (from [[Royal Museums Greenwich]])]]\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 11 August, after Prado had rejected the demand for surrender sent to him by Albemarle, the British batteries opened fire on Havana. A total of 47 guns (15 \u00d7 32-pdrs, 32 \u00d7 24-pdrs), 10 mortars and 5 howitzers pounded the city from a distance of 500\u2013800 m. By the end of the day [[San Salvador de la Punta Fortress|Fort la Punta]] was silenced. Prado had no other choice left but to surrender.\n\nThe next day negotiations of the articles of capitulation went on, and Prado and his army obtained the honours of war on 13 August. Hevia neglected to burn his fleet which fell intact in the hands of the British.\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Perspective view of his majesty's land forces going in flat boats to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle... LCCN2003653272.jpg|thumb|British land forces going in [[flatboats]] to take possession of the north gate of the city and Punto Castle on 14 August]]\nOn 14 August the British entered the city. They had obtained possession of the most important harbour in the [[Spanish West Indies]] along with military equipment, 1,828,116 Spanish pesos and merchandise valued around 1,000,000 Spanish pesos. Furthermore, they had seized 20% of the ships of the line of the Spanish Navy, namely ''Aquil\u00f3n'' (74), ''Conquistador'' (74), ''Reina'' (70), ''San Antonio'' (64), ''Tigre'' (70), ''San Jenaro'' (60), ''\u00c1frica'' (70), ''Am\u00e9rica'' (60), ''Infante'' (74) and ''Soberano'' (74), together with 3 frigates, 9 smaller vessels including the ''Marte'' (18) commanded by [[Domingo de Bonechea]] and some armed vessels belonging to trading companies (Compa\u00f1\u00eda de La Habana and Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Caracas). Furthermore, two new almost-completed ships of the line were seized in the dockyards \u2013 ''San Carlos'' (80) and ''Santiago'' (60 or 80). [[Prize money payments]] of \u00a3122,697 each were made to Pocock as naval commander and to Albemarle as military commander, with \u00a324,539 paid to  [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Commodore Keppel]], the naval second-in-command who was Albemarle's younger brother. Each of the 42 naval captains present received \u00a31,600 as prize money.<ref>Roger p. 257</ref> The military second-in-command, [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield| Lieutenant-General Eliott]], received the same amount as Commodore Keppel, as the two shared a fifteenth part of the prize pool, as against the third shared by their commanders.<ref>Pockock p. 216</ref> \n[[File:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August-September 1762.jpg|thumb|left|The Captured Spanish Fleet at Havana, August\u2013September 1762, by Dominic Serres]]\n\nDuring the siege the British had lost 2,764 killed, wounded, captured or deserted,<ref name=\"Marley291\"/> but by 18 October also had lost 4,708 dead from sickness.<ref name=\"Diefendorf\">Diefendorf p. 202</ref> One of the most depleted brigades was transferred to North America where it lost a further 360 men within a month of arrival. Three ships of the line were lost either as a direct result of Spanish gunfire or severe damage received which would cause their demise later. Shortly after the siege {{HMS|Stirling Castle|1742|6}} was declared unserviceable and was stripped and scuttled.<ref>Winfield p. 49</ref> [[HMS St Michael (1669)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] sank in the Atlantic due to extensive damage received during the siege, and {{HMS|Temple|1758|6}} was lost while returning to Britain for repairs.<ref>Lavery p. 177</ref>\n\nOn their return to Spain Prado and Hevia were court-martialed and convicted.\n\nThe loss of Havana and Western Cuba was a serious blow to Spain. Not only were the financial losses considerable, the loss in prestige was even greater. This defeat, together with the [[Battle of Manila (1762)|conquest of Manila by the British]] one and a half months later, meant the loss of Spain's 'Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies' as well as its colonial capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref name=\"Schneider6\">Schneider p. 6</ref> This confirmed British [[naval supremacy]], and showed the fragility of the [[Spanish Empire]]. Just as the earlier [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] had forced the British government into a thorough review of its military, this war forced the Spanish government into undertaking a similar process. The invasions of Navana and Manilla were the catalyst for profound political and military reforms in the Spanish overseas empire.<ref name=\"Schneider222\">Schneider p. 222</ref>\n\nHavana and Manila were returned to Spain as a result of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] signed in February 1763, but the British occupation lasted until April 1763, when a newly appointed  [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Captain General of Cuba]] arrived to re-establish Spanish rule. Spain was required to cede [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] and [[Menorca]] to Great Britain and pay the [[Manila Ransom]].<ref name=\"Schneider219, 224\">Schneider pp. 219, 224</ref> Spain received [[French Louisiana]] as a payment for intervening in the war on the side of the French and as compensation for having lost Florida.<ref name=\"Schneider225\">Schneider p. 225</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\nNumerous paintings and drawings of the battle were made, notably by [[Dominic Serres]]:\n<gallery widths=\"145\" heights=\"115\">\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- The Morro Castle and the Boom Defence Before the Attack.jpg|The Morro Castle and the [[boom (navigational barrier)|Boom Defence]] Before the Attack\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762- the Landing, 7th June.jpg|The Landing, 7 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762, Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June.jpg|Landing Cannon and Stores, 30 June\nFile:Dominic Serres the Elder - The Capture of Havana, 1762.jpg|Approach of British forces before Morro Castle\nFile:The Capture of Havana, 1762- Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July RMG L6229.tiff|Storming of Morro Castle, 30 July\nFile:British ships in the Seven Years War before Havana.jpg|Bombardment of the Morro Castle ([[Rafael Monle\u00f3n]])\nFile:El Morro.jpg|[[Castillo de los Tres Reyes Magos del Morro|El Morro fortress]] in Havana, built in 1589\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Peter|title=British Maritime Enterprise in the New World: From the Late Fifteenth to the Mid-eighteenth Century|date=1999|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press Ltd|isbn=9780773478664}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Brumwell|first1=Stephen|title=Redcoats: The British Soldier and War in the Americas, 1755\u20131763|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521807832}}\n* Diefendorf, Jeffry M./Dorsey, Kurkpatrick (2006).

Art by [[Yuji Uekawa]].]]\nThe ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[video game franchise]] began in 1991 with the game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], which pitted a blue [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] against a rotund male human villain named [[Doctor Eggman]] (or Doctor Ivo Robotnik). The sequel, ''[[Sonic 2]]'', gave Sonic a fox friend named [[Tails (character)|Tails]]. ''[[Sonic CD]]'' introduced [[Amy Rose]], a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. ''[[Sonic 3]]'' introduced [[Knuckles the Echidna]], Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games.\n\nThe series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like [[Metal Sonic]] and [[E-123 Omega]], as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]. The series features two fictional species: [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], which have usually functioned as [[digital pet]]s and minor gameplay and plot elements, [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisps]], which have been used as [[power-up]]s.\n\nThe ''Sonic'' games keep a separate continuity from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics]] published by [[Archie Comics]] and other ''Sonic'' media and, as a result, feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters.<!-- PLEASE READ: Please place future new characters at the bottom of the list. -->\n\n==Characters==\n===Sonic the Hedgehog===\n{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)}}\n\n{{nihongo foot|Sonic Ogilvie Maurice Wentworth the Hedgehog, known as just Sonic the Hedgehog in the videogame series,|\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30b8\u30db\u30c3\u30b0|Sonikku Za Hejjihoggu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} trademarked ''Sonic The Hedgehog'',<ref name=\"sonic's middle name\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven L.

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in ''Sonic Heroes'' in which he was voiced by [[Jun'ichi Kanemaru]] in Japanese and [[Ryan Drummond]] in English.\n\n[[GameDaily]] placed Metal Sonic 13th on their \"Top 25 Video Game Robots\" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's \"greatest creation\" and praising the strength of his abilities.<ref>Buffa, Chris (2009-02-06).

Art by [[Yuji Uekawa]].]]\nThe ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' [[video game franchise]] began in 1991 with the game ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]], which pitted a blue [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] against a rotund male human villain named [[Doctor Eggman]] (or Doctor Ivo Robotnik). The sequel, ''[[Sonic 2]]'', gave Sonic a fox friend named [[Tails (character)|Tails]]. ''[[Sonic CD]]'' introduced [[Amy Rose]], a female hedgehog with a persistent crush on Sonic. ''[[Sonic 3]]'' introduced [[Knuckles the Echidna]], Sonic's rival and, later, friend. All five of these have remained major characters and appeared in dozens of games.\n\nThe series has introduced dozens of additional recurring characters over the years. These have ranged from anthropomorphic animal characters like [[Shadow the Hedgehog]] and Cream the Rabbit to robots created by Eggman like [[Metal Sonic]] and [[E-123 Omega]], as well as human characters like Eggman's grandfather [[Gerald Robotnik]]. The series features two fictional species: [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], which have usually functioned as [[digital pet]]s and minor gameplay and plot elements, [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisps]], which have been used as [[power-up]]s.\n\nThe ''Sonic'' games keep a separate continuity from the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' comics]] published by [[Archie Comics]] and other ''Sonic'' media and, as a result, feature a distinct yet overlapping array of characters.<!-- PLEASE READ: Please place future new characters at the bottom of the list. -->\n\n==Characters==\n===Sonic the Hedgehog===\n{{Main|Sonic the Hedgehog (character)}}\n\n{{nihongo foot|Sonic the Hedgehog,|\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30b6\u30fb\u30d8\u30c3\u30b8\u30db\u30c3\u30b0|Sonikku Za Hejjihoggu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} trademarked ''Sonic The Hedgehog'',<ref name=\"sonic's middle name\">{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Steven|authorlink=Steven L.

He first appears in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog CD]]''. He is given orders to go back in time and change the past so that Dr. Eggman can rule the future. Sonic must race him in Stardust Speedway to free Amy Rose. He is severely wounded when he crashes and falls, but is rejuvenated by Robotnik in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II]]'', only to be defeated again in a similar style. He returns in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'', where he attempts to obtain the Chaos Rings, but he is stopped by the Chaotix. Metal Sonic notably acted as the main antagonist in ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', appearing in a new form as Neo Metal Sonic before transforming into the game's final boss, the Metal Overlord. Upon being defeated by Super Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, he reverts to his traditional appearance. He appears as the main antagonist in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (OVA)]]'', where Eggman records Sonic's abilities and uploads them to Metal Sonic, who proceeds in attempting to destroy the world before being tossed into lava by Sonic. Metal Sonic appears as a bonus playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals]]'', reprogrammed to aid Eggman Nega in his attempt to take over the world. He returns as a playable character in ''[[Sonic Rivals 2]]'', under orders from Eggman to aid Shadow in stopping Eggman Nega's plans. In ''[[Sonic Free Riders]]'', Metal Sonic is a playable character and the final opponent in the game's story mode. In ''[[Sonic Generations]]'', he appears in his classic form as a rival boss, battling Classic Sonic in Stardust Speedway before ultimately being destroyed. Metal Sonic returns as a boss character in ''[[Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal]]''. He appears in the ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' episode, \"It Wasn't Me, It Was the One-Armed Hedgehog\". Metal Sonic appears as a boss in the Sonic story mode of ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''.\n\nMetal Sonic appeared as a playable character in the multiplayer mode of ''[[Sonic Adventure 2: Battle]]'', as well as ''[[Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing]]'', ''[[Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed]]'', and all the ''[[Mario & Sonic]]'' titles beginning with ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Winter Games]]''. Collecting all the emblems in ''[[Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut]]'' unlocks Metal Sonic as a bonus playable character in Sonic's stages, and purchasing both episodes of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode I|Sonic the Hedgehog 4]]'' unlocks bonus levels in which Metal Sonic is playable.\n\nHe possesses great strength, including a [[Raygun|laser cannon]], a [[jet engine]] and a [[force shield|force field device]] he can use to protect himself from projectiles and certain attacks. He usually only communicates with a series of electronic noises. The only notable time Metal Sonic was able to talk was in ''Sonic Heroes'' in which he was voiced by [[Jun'ichi Kanemaru]] in Japanese and [[Ryan Drummond]] in English.\n\n[[GameDaily]] placed Metal Sonic 13th on their \"Top 25 Video Game Robots\" list, describing him as Dr. Robotnik's \"greatest creation\" and praising the strength of his abilities.<ref>Buffa, Chris (2009-02-06).

After skirmishes with the French forces of {{Interlanguage link multi|Gabriel Barbou des Couri\u00e8res|fr}}  at [[Springe]], Cathcart was forced to withdraw after the Franco-Prussian agreement of 27 January 1806 handing over Hanover to Prussia, and re-embarked for the United Kingdom on 7 February 1806.\n\nAfter the recall of this expedition Cathcart [[Commander-in-Chief, Scotland|commanded the forces in Scotland]] until 1807, when he was placed in charge of the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|expedition to Copenhagen]], which surrendered to him on 6 September. Four weeks later he was created '''Viscount Cathcart of Cathcart''' and '''Baron Greenock of Greenock''' in the [[peerage of the United Kingdom]], resuming the Scottish command on his return from the front.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn 1 January 1812 he was promoted to the full rank of general, and a few months later he proceeded to [[Russia]] as ambassador and military commissioner. In the latter capacity he served with the headquarters of the allies throughout the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|War of Liberation]] (1812\u20131814); his success in the delicate and difficult task of maintaining harmony and devotion to the common cause amongst the generals of many nationalities was recognized after the war by his elevation to the earldom (July 1814). He then went to [[St. Petersburg]], and continued to hold the post of ambassador until 1820, when he returned to the United Kingdom.\n\nHe died at his estate near [[Glasgow]] on 16 June 1843.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He is buried in [[Paisley Abbey]] with a monument by [[William Mossman]] erected in 1848.<ref>Dictionary of British Sculptors: 1660\u20131851, Rupert Gunnis</ref>\n\n==Family==\nCathcart married Elizabeth Elliot, the daughter of the [[List of colonial governors of New York|lieutenant-governor]] of [[Province of New York|New York]] [[Andrew Elliot]], on 10 April 1779. The couple had ten children, the first five being born in the 1780s. Their first child, Louisa, was born in New York on 25 January 1780, but died soon after her birth. Other children included the army officers [[George Cathcart|Sir George Cathcart]] and [[Charles Cathcart, 2nd Earl Cathcart|Sir Charles Cathcart]], both of whom became generals, the latter inheriting the peerage on his father's death.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> William's first-born son, [[William Cathcart (Royal Navy officer)|William Cathcart]], entered the [[Royal Navy]] but died of yellow fever in 1804 while in command of his ship [[French frigate Clorinde (1801)|HMS ''Clorinde'']].<ref>{{cite book|volume = 20| publisher = Naval Record Society| title = Naval Miscellany Volume 1| year = 1902| editor =  John Knox Laughton}}</ref> Cathcart took two of his sons with him during his appointment as ambassador to Russia, Captain Frederick Macadam Cathcart served as his private secretary and Lieutenant George Cathcart functioned as his aide-de-camp.
