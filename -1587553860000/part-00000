The series is produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer Television]], [[DC Entertainment]] and [[Warner Bros. Television]].\n\nThe series revolves around Lucifer Morningstar ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), the [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Devil]], who abandons Hell for [[Los Angeles]] where he runs his own nightclub and becomes a consultant to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. The ensemble and supporting cast include [[Lauren German]] as Detective Chloe Decker, [[Kevin Alejandro]] as Detective Daniel \"Dan\" Espinoza, [[D. B. Woodside]] as [[List of Lucifer characters#Amenadiel|Amenadiel]], [[Lesley-Ann Brandt]] as [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]], and [[Rachael Harris]] as Dr. Linda Martin. Filming took place primarily in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] before production was relocated entirely to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] beginning with the third season.\n\nThe first season received mixed reviews from critics, though subsequent seasons were better rated. The fourth season also received high ratings and critical acclaim. Many critics particularly praised Ellis' performance. Despite initially high viewership for its debut, ratings remained consistently low throughout the series' run on Fox. On May 11, 2018, Fox cancelled ''Lucifer'' after three seasons. A month later, [[Netflix]] picked up the series for a fourth season of ten episodes, which was released on May 8, 2019. On June 6, 2019, Netflix renewed the series for the fifth season and expected to be 16 episodes. However, in March 2020, Tom Ellis and other stars of the show were reported to have signed up for a sixth season to be produced by Netflix and Warner Bros. <ref>https://tvline.com/2020/03/04/tom-ellis-lucifer-season-6-contract-renewal-netflix/</ref> Official confirmation is yet to be received.  It was later reported that production has stopped near to the end of Season 5 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2020 COVID-19 pandemic]] and studio closures.<ref>https://tvline.com/2020/03/13/the-flash-coronavirus-season-6-shut-down-production/</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe series focuses on [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]] ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), a beautiful and powerful angel who was cast out of [[Heaven]] for betrayal. As the [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Devil]], he gets bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell for millennia. He resigns to his throne in defiance to his father ([[Presence (DC Comics)|God]]) and abandons his kingdom for [[Los Angeles]], where he ends up running his own nightclub called \"Lux\". He becomes involved in a murder case with Detective Chloe Decker ([[Lauren German]]), and is subsequently invited to be a consultant to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. Throughout the series, several celestial and demonic threats come to Los Angeles; at the same time, Lucifer and Chloe end up appreciating and being happy with each other.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Lucifer characters}}\n* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]]: The Lord of Hell, who is bored with his life, abandons his throne and becomes a civilian consultant for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] while running his own high-end nightclub called \"Lux\".<ref name=\"newsarama.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23659-lucifer-cast-for-new-fox-pilot.html|title=LUCIFER Cast For New FOX Pilot|publisher=Newsarama.com|last=Chris|first=Arrant|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n*[[Lauren German]] as Detective Chloe Decker: Her late father was a [[LAPD]] officer, and she is a [[homicide detective]].

The series is produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer Television]], [[DC Entertainment]] and [[Warner Bros. Television]].\n\nThe series revolves around Lucifer Morningstar ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), the [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Devil]], who abandons Hell for [[Los Angeles]] where he runs his own nightclub and becomes a consultant to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. The ensemble and supporting cast include [[Lauren German]] as Detective Chloe Decker, [[Kevin Alejandro]] as Detective Daniel \"Dan\" Espinoza, [[D. B. Woodside]] as [[List of Lucifer characters#Amenadiel|Amenadiel]], [[Lesley-Ann Brandt]] as [[Mazikeen (comics)|Mazikeen]], and [[Rachael Harris]] as Dr. Linda Martin. Filming took place primarily in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]] before production was relocated entirely to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] beginning with the third season.\n\nThe first season received mixed reviews from critics, though subsequent seasons were better rated. The fourth season also received high ratings and critical acclaim. Many critics particularly praised Ellis' performance. Despite initially high viewership for its debut, ratings remained consistently low throughout the series' run on Fox. On May 11, 2018, Fox cancelled ''Lucifer'' after three seasons. A month later, [[Netflix]] picked up the series for a fourth season of ten episodes, which was released on May 8, 2019. On June 6, 2019, Netflix renewed the series for the fifth and expected to be final season of 16 episodes. However, in March 2020, Tom Ellis and other stars of the show were reported to have signed up for a sixth season to be produced by Netflix and Warner Bros. <ref>https://tvline.com/2020/03/04/tom-ellis-lucifer-season-6-contract-renewal-netflix/</ref> Official confirmation is yet to be received.  It was later reported that production has stopped near to the end of Season 5 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2020 COVID-19 pandemic]] and studio closures.<ref>https://tvline.com/2020/03/13/the-flash-coronavirus-season-6-shut-down-production/</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe series focuses on [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]] ([[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]), a beautiful and powerful angel who was cast out of [[Heaven]] for betrayal. As the [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Devil]], he gets bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell for millennia. He resigns to his throne in defiance to his father ([[Presence (DC Comics)|God]]) and abandons his kingdom for [[Los Angeles]], where he ends up running his own nightclub called \"Lux\". He becomes involved in a murder case with Detective Chloe Decker ([[Lauren German]]), and is subsequently invited to be a consultant to the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]]. Throughout the series, several celestial and demonic threats come to Los Angeles; at the same time, Lucifer and Chloe end up appreciating and being happy with each other.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Lucifer characters}}\n* [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]] as [[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer Morningstar]]: The Lord of Hell, who is bored with his life, abandons his throne and becomes a civilian consultant for the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] while running his own high-end nightclub called \"Lux\".<ref name=\"newsarama.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23659-lucifer-cast-for-new-fox-pilot.html|title=LUCIFER Cast For New FOX Pilot|publisher=Newsarama.com|last=Chris|first=Arrant|date=February 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n*[[Lauren German]] as Detective Chloe Decker: Her late father was a [[LAPD]] officer, and she is a [[homicide detective]].

In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite news|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|newspaper=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall .

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

In addition to the eight urban reconstructions, buyers were found for seven of the nine optional reconstructions. Only the builders of the H\u00fchnermarkt 18 plots (Schildknecht house) and Braubachstra\u00dfe 27 opted for new buildings. In total, 15 reconstructions and 20 new buildings were to be built. The chicken market as the central square of the new old town was reconstructed on three sides.

It is used for the barrier-free access to the Golden Libra, which does not have its own staircase, and is also used by the Stoltze Museum. The predecessor building, first mentioned in 1467, was a three-storey, gabled, half-timbered house with two attics, which had been rebuilt in the 18th and late 19th centuries. The three-storey new building has a simple sandstone facade with six windows per floor, as with the predecessor.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GMBH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral. At the western edge of the ''courtyard'' , the reconstruction ''Hof zum Rebstock'' (Braubachstrasse 15, formerly Im Rebstock 1) was built by Jourdan & M\u00fcller.)<ref>{{cite web|title=Hof zum Rebstock|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GMBH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/braubachstra\u00dfe-15|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> The building was built in the middle of the 18th century, using older components from the Gothic predecessor, first mentioned in 1392. Instead of the usual overhangs, the two half-timbered upper floors were given wooden arcades in front, also on the back to the inner courtyard on Neugasse. The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows. The non-profit Frankfurt association runs a senior caf\u00e9 on the ground floor of the courtyard facing the vine . The northern neighboring building Braubachstrasse 21 (formerly Im Rebstock 3) already belongs to Braubachstrasse.<ref name=\"Braubach-21\" />\n\nThe famous Frankfurt writer and local poet Friedrich Stoltze was born on November 21, 1816 in the Rebstock ensemble .\n\n=== H\u00fchnermarkt ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Huehnermarkt-06-2018-Ffm-Altstadt-10008-9.jpg|thumb|The Stoltze fountain on the resurrected chicken market]]\nThe chicken market is the center of the new old town.

The Haus zum Esslinger is one of the Goethe sites in Frankfurt: it belonged to Goethe's aunt Johanna Melber and her husband, the dealer ''Georg Adolf Melber''. The poet lived with his aunt in 1755/56 and put her in From my life. Poetry and truth a literary monument .

The new building is used by the Evangelical Regional Association Frankfurt am Main as the parish hall of the Paulsgemeinde and the Indonesian community.\n\nThe only reconstruction on the south side of the alley is the house ''Goldene Schere'' (Markt 22, side entrance, formerly Hinter dem L\u00e4mmchen 1) by the architects ''Hans Kollhoff'' , Berlin and ''Jourdan & M\u00fcller'' , Frankfurt am Main.<ref name=\"domroemer.de\"/> The four-story building in classicist forms was created in the 18th century by conversion from two older predecessor buildings.

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\".

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt .

On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

Frankfurt as a possibility of total idyll.\" He then sits down First of all, basically with architectural reconstructions, using the example of the Dresden Zwinger , the Knochenhaueramtshaus and the Warsaw Old Townwho kept the memory of their destruction in different ways. He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: \u201cValuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the ManufactumCatalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top. \u201dIn addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the ''Sch\u00f6nau'' house (Market 10) -\u201c a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep\u2026 and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front.

The areas marked in dark red were torn down in 1927.]]\n[[File:Frankfurt 1945 June destructions after bombing raids old town aerial.JPG|thumb|The destroyed old town in June 1945]]\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] old town of Frankfurt am Main , until then one of the best preserved in Central Europe, was almost completely destroyed by bombing. Only a few historical buildings remained, and in the [[History of Germany (1945\u20131990)|post-war]] period, other damaged buildings were also demolished, mostly in favour of \"car-friendly\" traffic planning. There were very few external reconstructions of buildings and the majority of the former old town was rebuilt in the style of the 1950s, largely leaving the historic street network behind.\n\nOnly the area between R\u00f6merberg and the cathedral remained after the rubble clearance wasteland, over whose development has long been debated. In the meantime, from 1953, archaeologists were able to uncover the remains of a Roman settlement, but also recent traces, especially from the Carolingian period, beneath the area of the high medieval layers . A centuries-long search for the origin of the city was therefore over, although the Royal Palatinate Frankfurt, which had previously only been handed down through documents, was not built by the legendary founder of Frankfurt, Charlemagne, but, according to findings, only by his son, Ludwig the Pious .\n\nIn 1966 construction began on the B section of the Frankfurt subway between the main train station and the Konstablerwache. The line of the new underground also led through the old town, with a station under the previously undeveloped area used as a parking lot between the cathedral and the Roman. When the Dom/R\u00f6mer underground station was built in 1970/71, due to the open construction method, it was accepted to destroy a large part of the oldest settlement floor in Frankfurt, which had not yet been archaeologically examined.\n\nSubsequently, after years of discussion on the site, the Technical City Hall was created in 1972\u20131974 as the seat of the technical offices of the city administration. Five old town houses on Braubachstrasse that had survived the war were demolished to excavate the construction pit. The building, built in the brutalist architectural style, represented with its enormous dimensions, dominated the former old town, not taking into account of the small-scale buildings in the area. The construction costs totalled DM 93 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wortprotokoll \u00fcber die 19. Plenarsitzung der Stadtverordnetenversammlung am Donnerstag, dem 15.

After the construction work was completed, the ceiling of the underground car park formed the new level, which was now about two meters above the historical floor level. The archaeological finds of the old town excavation from 1953, dating from the early days of Frankfurt, also initially removed, were preserved and made accessible to the public as an archaeological garden .\n\nIn 1994 the city of Frankfurt sold the Technical City Hall for DM 148 million to Deutsche Immobilien Leasing (DIL), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. At the same time, the building was leased back to the city with the option that the city could buy back the town hall for DM 135 million after the lease expired in 2006, a so-called sale-lease-back agreement.<ref name=\"faz.net-20041108\">{{cite news|title=Stadtplanung \u2013 Umbau statt Abri\u00df \u2013 neue Pl\u00e4ne f\u00fcr Technisches Rathaus in Frankfurt|newspaper=faz.net|publisher=|url=http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/frankfurt/stadtplanung-umbau-statt-abriss-neue-plaene-fuer-technisches-rathaus-in-frankfurt-1194573.html|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-05-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=2004-11-08|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Planning History ==\n\n=== 2004\u20132006 ===\n[[File:Technischesrathaus-ffm001.jpg|thumb|Technical City Hall, 2007]]\nIn 2004, the project developers ''Max Baum Immobilien'' and ''Gro\u00df & Partner,'' on behalf of the owner DIL, presented plans for a renovation of the 30-year-old technical town hall . According to plans by the Frankfurt office of ''Stefan Forster Architects'', the building complex was to be divided into two houses by an alley from Braubachstrasse to the roundel of the Schirn Kunsthallebe to be created. For the concrete facades, a completely new design with a perforated facade made of natural stone was planned, for future use in the four-story base the city library as well as shops and restaurants. In addition, around 160 apartments were to be created in the three towers.

The following requirements were then set for the urban planning competition: small-scale buildings with facades and roofs that fit harmoniously into the old town, housing 20,000 m\u00b2 of gross floor space within the property boundaries of the Technical City Hall, overbuilding of the archaeological garden with 7,000 m\u00b2, continued use of the archaeological site Garden with the remains of the Royal Palatinate and the restoration of the old \"coronation path\" between the cathedral and the Roman. The name \"Coronation Trail\", an alternative name for the alley ''market''(also known as the ''Old Market'' ), which existed until 1945, arose from the fact that a total of 16 coronation ceremonies for Roman-German kings were held in Frankfurt from the 14th to the 18th century. 20 offices took part in the urban planning competition.<ref name=\"faz.net\">[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/architektur-abriss-des-technischen-rathauses-gesichert-1256606.html ''Abri\u00df des Technischen Rathauses gesichert.''] In: ''faz.net'', 25.

These provided that the city would not buy back the property, but that the leasing model would continue.<ref name=\"faz.net\" />\n\nIn August 2005, the Free Voters in the R\u00f6mer submitted an application for the planned Dom-R\u00f6mer area to approach the historic streets and squares and to reconstruct some important buildings in terms of urban planning, such as the ''Haus zur Goldenen Waage'' or the ''Haus zum Esslinger'' ( also known as ''Young Esslinger'' or ''Aunt Melber's house'' ). However, the winning design chosen by the Frankfurt office KSP Engel and Zimmermann in September 2005 met only a few of these requirements. The \"Coronation Trail\" was not laid out along the course of the market, which was even largely respected by the construction of the Technical Town Hall in 1972, but in a straight diagonal fromStone house to the cathedral tower. The overplanned areas of the technical town hall and the archaeological garden were once again occupied by large buildings; a residential complex with three courtyards was to be built on Braubachstrasse. In addition to a narrow building, a trapezoidal square was planned at the level of the archaeological garden, which, like the diagonal to the cathedral tower, had never existed in a similar form in Frankfurt's urban history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neue Altstadt \u2013 KSP gewinnen Wettbewerb f\u00fcr Zentrum von Frankfurt (19.

The New Red House, first mentioned in 1322, probably dates back to the 14th century, the neighbor from the 16th century. The two houses were previously connected to each other inside, the New Red House had no separate entrance. With its ground floor structure consisting essentially of only three oak columns, which bore the entire weight of the three-story building above it, the New Red House was unique in the entire German half-timbered landscape and a well-known attraction far beyond the city. It was considered an outstanding example of medieval town planning and community spirit in the lively center of the old town. The Red House formed the passage to ''Tuchgaden'' and stood at the entrance to the butcher's quarter on the ''Lange Schirn'', at which the Frankfurter sausages have been sold since ancient times . The new building is also used by a butcher, which also has a sales stand in the Kleinmarkthalle .\n\nSouth of the new row of houses on the market, the ''town house'' consisting of five building parts was built ''on the market'' from 2013 to 2016 . The design comes from ''Meurer Architects'' , Frankfurt, with ''cba architectes'' , Luxembourg. The town house serves on the one hand to permanently preserve and make accessible the archaeological excavations of the Roman settlement on the cathedral hill and the imperial palace Franconofurd ; on the other hand as a meeting and event building. The end of the building complex to the west to the Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt is ''House 5'' , a residential building. It is based on the course of the historic alley of ''Tuchgaden'' .\n\nThere is a height difference of more than two meters between the street level of the reconstructed Old Market and today's Bendergasse along the Schirn. It is made clear in the section between the New Red House and the western entrance to the Dom / R\u00f6mer underground station by a wall and pergola made of sandstone. Due to the protruding rotunda of the Schirn, there was not enough space in this section for a southern row of houses opposite the Markt 26 to Markt 40 houses. Before the destruction narrow alleys chain in this section three ''Goldhutgasse'' , ''Drachengasse'' and ''sword-alley'' to the south, the south of it at the Five Finger Square met again.\n\n=== Rebstock-Hof ===\n[[File:Dom-Roemer-Projekt-Hof zum-Rebstock-0918.jpg|thumb|''Hof zum Rebstock'' , left part of the back of ''Markt 2'']]\nThe east side of the Rebstock-Hof is the Haus am Dom , which was built from 2001 to 2004 through the renovation and expansion of the ''main customs office'' built by Werner Hebebrand in 1927 . Even though it was built as part of the New Frankfurt project , the main customs office already received a steep, curved gable roof as a tribute to the surrounding old town development, which was retained during the renovation. The house at the cathedral was extended at the southern end during the renovation, so that it protrudes a few meters from the historic building of the ''old market'' and comes closer to the reconstructed ''golden scales'' . The neighboring house ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock''(Market 8), however, keeps the original parcel. The northern entrance to the Rebstock-Hof lies between the two buildings. The north side of it is the new building ''Rebstock-Hof 2'' (Markt 2, formerly Im Rebstock 2),<ref>{{cite web|title=Markt 2 (Rebstock-Hof 2)|periodical=Dom-R\u00f6mer GMBH|publisher=|url=https://www.domroemer.de/markt-2|url-status=|format=|access-date=2018-11-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|last=|date=|year=|language=|pages=|quote=}}</ref> a residential and commercial building by ''Meurer'' , Frankfurt. With a sand-colored plastered facade and slate roof, it looks like an extension to the house on the cathedral.

Instead of the usual overhangs, the two half-timbered upper floors were given wooden arcades in front, also on the back to the inner courtyard on Neugasse. The gable roof is divided by a dwarf house with a Rhenish wave gable and two rows of dormer windows.

The lines of argumentation often followed the same pattern as since the beginning of the reconstruction debate immediately after the destruction. Dieter Bartetzko compares the old town with an unfathomably deep fountain that draws on the myths of the past and gives life in the present. He recalls that the fountain on the chicken market was drilled as early as Roman times and that the Carolingian people were probably already aware that they lived on historical ground. This explains why Frankfurt was referred to in its first documentary mention in 794 as a ''locus celeber'' , a ''celebrated site'' . He describes the old town withNietzsche as an architectural palimpsest that always keeps the memory of the past in the minds of city dwellers, no matter how often it is overwritten. He explains this thesis using the example of the new building at ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8) and the reconstruction at ''Braubachstra\u00dfe 21'' . In contrast, the Technical City Hall, \"rammed as a concrete juggernaut in the middle of the previously closed row of houses on Braubachstrasse\", had remained a provocative and ignorant foreign body in the urban fabric for decades. In spite of its architectural quality, this was his doom.<ref>Dieter Bartetzko: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/umbaumassnahmen-in-der-frankfurter-altstadt-13531714.html ''Mut zum Traum''], in: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 11.

This is no coincidence, \"the reconstruction architecture in Germany is currently developing into a key medium of authoritarian, ethnic, historical revisionist rights\". It was \"scandalous that the initiative of a right-wing radical without any significant civil society resistance led to a slick neighborhood with seemingly seamless repeat architectures\". The new old town is \"a sub-complex heal-world building that reduces history to a one-dimensional concert of your dreams ... A history in which National Socialism, the German wars of aggression and the Holocaust still survive as anecdotes of an otherwise unbroken national history\".<ref>Stephan Tr\u00fcby: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/neue-frankfurter-altstadt-durch-rechtsradikalen-initiiert-15531133.html Wir haben das Haus am rechten Fleck] In: [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]], 8.

The debate about the old town has historical roots, since 1880 the design has always been struggling anew, with opponents and advocates of reconstructions not fitting in a right-left scheme. The reconstruction of the R\u00f6merberg-Ostzeile was based on an idea by the SPD Mayor Rudi Arndt . At the same time, Linke and Spontis had instigated the Frankfurt house fight , \u201csociologists see today as the beginning of a second homeland security movement\u201d.<ref name=\"db1\" /> Te \"storm of indignation\", which was triggered by the \"remarkably mediocre facade views\" of the winning design from the 2005 competition, was decisive for the reconstruction project of the new old town. \"Unlike the second-place design ... which u. a.

They obtain their legitimation primarily from two sources: their craft quality and their civic acceptance. Both are given in Frankfurt. \u201c<ref>Matthias Alexander: [http://www.faz.net/aktuell/rhein-main/debatte-um-neue-frankfurter-altstadt-15587280.html ''Neue Frankfurter Altstadt: Wir waren schon weiter.''] In: ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', 16.

The debate alone leads to more people thinking about the destruction and its background. On the other hand, \u201cno one in Frankfurt felt reminded of the bomb war and Shoah when they saw the now demolished Technical Town Hall.\u201d Most critics mocked questions of taste. \"It is often said that this type of architecture is just a backdrop, untrue, inauthentic ...

Starting with the planning and the careful construction, all parties involved, builders, architects, planners and construction companies pulled together in Frankfurt. \"One would wish that so much attention to detail and care would be put into a construction project that did not pretend that the Second World War had never existed.\".<ref>Laura Wei\u00dfm\u00fcller: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/frankfurter-altstadt-im-korsett-des-turbokapitalismus-1.3974063 ''Frankfurter Altstadt: Das Wirtschaftssystem entscheidet, wie gebaut wird.''] In: ''[[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 14.

One of the main benefits of the project is the recovery of Braubachstrasse. In the past 70 years, practically no urban space has emerged that has the quality of the new old town. The ensemble effect is even better than originally thought. Suddenly the architects are on the defensive and have a professional discussion about their health. One could learn from the project for future new building projects \u201cthat one needs more depth in dealing with architecture. It can no longer be about creating volume. You have to provide identification with special design elements. You have to put more effort into the details \u201d. He opposes criticism that you could have built many social housing for the same money; this thinking is \"totally limited\". \u201cIt was a sensible investment, it brings the city forward. The foreigners in particular, who we led over the construction site, were of the opinion that the people of Frankfurt should have remembered their history as a European metropolis much earlier. \u201dHe personally likes the two new buildingsBest with ''the Three Romans'' (Markt 40) and ''Gro\u00dfer Rebstock'' (Markt 8); the least successful are the ''Goldene Schachtel'' (Markt 32) and her neighbor ''Alter Burggraf'' .<ref>''Im Gespr\u00e4ch: Michael Guntersdorf, Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrer der Dom-R\u00f6mer GmbH'', Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 27.

Frankfurt as a possibility of total idyll.\" He then sits down First of all, basically with architectural reconstructions, using the example of the Dresden Zwinger , the Knochenhaueramtshaus and the Warsaw Old Townwho kept the memory of their destruction in different ways. He recalls an earlier article that he wrote about the planned demolition of the Technical Town Hall and reconstructions in the old town for Die Zeit , and in which he made fun of the \u201chalf-timbered longing\u201d, the \u201clonging for a city like this looks like the cities that Frankfurt might like to visit as tourists \u201d. <ref>{{citation|surname1=Andreas Maier|periodical=[[Die Zeit]]|title=Fachwerk f\u00fcr Alle!|date=2006-05-18|language=German|url=https://www.zeit.de/2006/21/Archi_Frankfurt_xml/komplettansicht|access-date= 2018-11-23\n}}</ref> After a tour of the construction site, however, he was impressed by the quality of the construction and also the architecture, and the enthusiasm of the craftsmen. He states: \u201cValuable materials, traditional craftsmanship, everything at its finest. With its new old town, which is also in the ManufactumCatalog, Frankfurt makes itself a gift. And there is the Belvederchen as praline on top. \u201dIn addition to the Belvederchen, he is particularly impressed by the ''Sch\u00f6nau'' house (Market 10) -\u201c a very narrow thing with a slate facade pulled down deep\u2026 and a slightly convex curvature of the elegantly stepped front.

Rugby split into two sports in 1895, when twenty-one clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (later renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]], [[Huddersfield]], over broken-time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn [[professional sport|professional]] and pay players.

Many factors played a part in the split, including the success of working class northern teams, a decree  by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged, threat of expulsion from the RFU if clubs cannot prove their amateurism, and the banning of \"broken time payments\" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Twenty-two clubs met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield and formed the \"Northern Rugby Football Union\".

During the late 1800s (and even the early 1900s), the two forms of the game were very similar (to the point where the United States was able to win the gold medal for [[rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]), but numerous rule changes have differentiated the gridiron-based game from its rugby counterpart, introduced by [[Walter Camp]] in the United States and [[John Thrift Meldrum Burnside]] in Canada. Among unique features of the North American game are the separation of play into [[down (American football)|downs]] instead of releasing the ball immediately upon tackling, the requirement that the team with the ball set into a [[formation (American football)|set formation]] for at least one second before [[snap (football)|resuming play after a tackle]] (and the allowance of up to 40 seconds to do so), the allowance for one [[forward pass]] from behind the site of the last tackle on each down, the evolution of hard plastic equipment (particularly the [[football helmet]] and [[shoulder pads]]), a smaller and pointier ball that is favorable to being passed but makes [[drop kick]]s impractical, a generally smaller and narrower field measured in customary units instead of metric (in [[Indoor American football|some variants of the American game]] a field can be as short as 50 yards between end zones), and a distinctive field (shaped like a gridiron, from which the code's nickname is derived) with lines marked in five-yard intervals.\n\n[[Rugby league]] is also both a professional and amateur game, administered on a global level by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. In addition to amateur and semi-professional competitions in the [[Rugby league in the United States|United States]], [[Rugby league in Russia|Russia]], [[Rugby league in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Rugby league in Serbia|Serbia]], Europe and Australasia, there are two major professional competitions\u2014the Australasian [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]]. International Rugby League is dominated by [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]], [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].

A group from either team lifts a player to fight and catch the ball for their team. (OSUWRC 2014)]]\n[[File:Scrum-1.JPG|thumb|[[Rugby union]]: A [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] between the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] and the [[Brumbies]] (May 2006)]]\nDistinctive features common to both rugby codes include the oval [[rugby ball|ball]] and throwing the ball forward is not allowed so that players can gain ground only by running with the ball or by kicking it. As the sport of rugby league moved further away from its union counterpart, rule changes were implemented with the aim of making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game. Unlike American and Canadian football, the players do not wear any sort of protection or armour.\n\nThe main differences between the two games, besides league having teams of 13 players and union of 15, involve the [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] and its aftermath:\n* Union players contest possession following the tackle: depending on the situation, either a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] or a [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]] can occur. League players may not contest possession after making a tackle: play is continued with a ''[[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]]''.\n* In league, if the team in possession fails to score before a set of six tackles, it surrenders possession. Union has no six-tackle rule; a team can keep the ball for an unlimited number of tackles before scoring as long as it maintains possession and does not commit an offence.\n\n[[set piece (football)|Set pieces]] of the union code include the \"[[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]]\", which occurs after a minor infringement of the rules (most often a knock-on, when a player knocks the ball forward), where packs of opposing players push against each other for possession, and the \"[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]\", in which parallel lines of players from each team, arranged perpendicular to the [[touch-line]], attempt to catch the ball thrown from [[touch (rugby)|touch]]. A rule has been added to line-outs which allows the jumper to be pulled down once a players' feet are on the ground.\n\nIn the league code, the scrum still exists, but with greatly reduced importance as it involves fewer players and is rarely contested. Set pieces are generally started from the play-the-ball situation. Many of the [[rugby league positions]] have names and requirements similar to [[rugby union positions]], but there are no [[Flanker (rugby union)|flankers]] in rugby league.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Home countries===\nIn England, [[rugby union]] is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the [[upper classes|upper]] and [[middle classes]]. For example, many pupils at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s and [[grammar school]]s play rugby union, although the game (which had a long history of being played at [[state school]]s until the 1980s) is becoming increasingly popular in [[comprehensive school]]s.<ref>Phillips, Buchler. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/99/99ap22.htm Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence to Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport]</ref> Despite this stereotype, the game, particularly in the [[West Country]] is popular amongst all classes. In contrast, [[rugby league]] has traditionally been seen as a working-class pursuit. Another exception to rugby union's upper-class stereotype is in Wales, where it has been traditionally associated with small village teams made up of coal miners and other industrial workers who played on their days off.<ref>Sommerville, D. (1997). The Encyclopedia of Rugby Union. Aurum Press, UK. {{ISBN|1-85410-481-0}}.</ref> In [[Ireland]], both rugby union and rugby league are unifying forces across the national and sectarian divide, with the Ireland international teams representing both political entities.\n\nIn Australia, support for both codes is concentrated in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.<ref name=\"Collins Paper\">Collins, T. (2005). \"Australian Nationalism and Working-Class Britishness: The Case of Rugby League Football.\" History Compass, Vol. 3, No. 1.</ref>\n\nExceptions to the above include New Zealand (although rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many or a game for 'westies' referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently, southern Auckland where the game is also popular), Wales, France (except Paris), [[Cornwall]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Somerset]], [[Scottish Borders]], [[County Limerick]] (see [[Munster Rugby|Munster]]) and the [[Pacific Islands]], where rugby union is popular in working class communities. Nevertheless, rugby league is perceived as the game of the working-class people in [[northern England]]<ref>Collins, T. (1998). Rugby\u2019s Great Split: Class, Culture and the Origins of Rugby League Football (London).</ref> and in the [[Australian states]] of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"Collins Paper\" />\n\nIn the United Kingdom, rugby union fans sometimes used the term \"rugger\" as an alternative name for the sport, (see [[Oxford '-er']]), although this archaic expression has not had currency since the 1950s or earlier.<ref>Rugger:\n* [[OED]]: Rugger \"Slang or colloquial alteration of RUGBY (in the sense of 'Rugby football').

The game is very popular in South Africa, having been introduced by English-speaking settlers in the 19th century. British colonists also brought the game with them to Australia and New Zealand, where the game is widely played. It has spread thence to much of Polynesia, having particularly strong followings in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Rugby union continues to grow in the Americas and parts of Asia as well.\n\n==Injuries==\nAbout a quarter of rugby players are injured in each season.<ref>[https://physioworks.com.au/Injuries-Conditions/Activities/rugby-union-injuries]</ref>\n\n==Rugby ball==\n[[File:Rugbyball2.jpg|thumb|A [[Gilbert (sports equipment)|Gilbert]] rugby football as used in [[rugby union]]]]\n\nA [[rugby ball]], originally called a quanco, is a diamond shape ball used for easier passing.\nRichard Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs\u2019 bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shaped than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.\n\nIn rugby union, World Rugby regulates the size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an official rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280\u2013300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740\u2013770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580\u2013620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material and may be treated to make it [[Waterproofing|water resistant]] and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460&nbsp;grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71\u201368.75 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]], or 0.67\u20130.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5\u201310.0&nbsp;lbs per square inch.<ref>International rugby board.

Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.\nMuch larger versions of traditional balls are also available for purchase, but these are mainly for their novelty attraction.\n\n==World Cups==\nThe [[Rugby World Cup]], which was first held in New Zealand and Australia in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], occurs every four years.  It is an international tournament organized by [[World Rugby]]. The event is played in the union format and features the top 20 teams from around the world. The current world champions are South Africa, who won the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], which was played in Japan.\n\nThe [[Rugby League World Cup]] was the first World Cup of either of the Rugby codes and was first held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], and as of 2013 occurs on a 4-year cycle. It is an international tournament that is organized by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. The event is played in the league format and features the top 14 teams from around the world. The current world champions are Australia, who won the World Cup in [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|2017]], played in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\n\n==Rugby shirt==\n{{see also|Rugby union numbering schemes}}\n[[Rugby shirt]]s were formerly made of leather but are now made of a cotton and polyester mix. This material has the advantage of not absorbing as much water or mud as cotton alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Owing to the more aggressive nature of the game, rugby clothing, in general, is designed to be much more robust and hardwearing than that worn for association football.\n\nThe rugby jerseys are slightly different depending on the type of rugby game played. The shirts worn by [[rugby league]] footballers commonly have a large \"V\" around the neck. The players in rugby union wear jerseys with a more traditional design, sometimes completely white ([[Cahors Rugby]] in France). The number of the player and his or her surname are placed on the upper back of the jersey (often name above number, with the number being significantly larger and more central), and the logo of the team on the upper left chest.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Rugby betting==\n{{See also|Sports betting}}\nWith the popularity of rugby over the years, many betting establishments have made it possible for viewers of the game to place wagers on games.  The various types of wagers that can be placed on games vary, however, the main types of bets that can be placed are as follows:\n* Fixed-odds betting\n* Futures/Outright Bets\n* Prop Bets / Specials\n* Over/Under Bets\n\nLike most team sports, both forms of rugby are vulnerable to match-fixing, particularly bets involving easily manipulated outcomes, such as conceding penalties and first point scorer. A recent example is a deliberate infringement by [[Ryan Tandy]] in order for the first points scored to be a penalty goal in a 2010 NRL match; the attempt backfired when instead of taking a shot at goal, a try was scored.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Rugby football}}\n{{Wikisource|Laws of Football played at Rugby School (1845)}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Rugby football}}\n* [http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/49661/rugbys-most-unfortunate-faces Rugby's Most Unfortunate Faces]\u2014slideshow by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnuRhNtT2E Video on the Basics of Rugby Union]\n* Full Guide of [https://rugbynest.com Rugby World Cup 2019] in Japan\n\n{{Football codes}}\n{{Team Sport|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Sports}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rugby Football}}\n[[Category:Rugby football| ]]\n[[Category:Team sports]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Rugby School]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-move|small=yes}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2010}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[File:Foot Ball, Kingston-upon-Thames, Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 24th, 1846.jpg|thumb|250px|''Football'' match in the 1846 [[Shrove Tuesday]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]]]\n'''Rugby''' is a collective name for the [[team sport]]s of [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], as well as the earlier forms of football from which both games evolved.

Rugby split into two sports in 1895, when twenty-one clubs split from the [[Rugby Football Union]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (later renamed the Rugby Football League in 1922) in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]], [[Huddersfield]], over broken-time payments to players who took time off from work to play the sport, thus making rugby league the first code to turn [[professional sport|professional]] and pay players. Rugby union turned professional one hundred years later in 1995, following the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/02/broken-time-review |title=Broken Time -review |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=https://moneyweek.com/405912/27-august-1995-rugby-union-turns-professional/ |title=27 August 1995:Rugby Union turns professional |publisher=MoneyWeek |date=27 August 2015}}</ref> The respective world governing bodies are [[World Rugby]] (rugby union) and the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (rugby league).\n\nRugby football was one of many versions of [[football]] played at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|English public schools]] in the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/originsofrugby.htm|title=Rugby Football History|website=www.rugbyfootballhistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/Schism.html|title=Rugby Football History|website=www.rugbyfootballhistory.com}}</ref> Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports. In addition to these two codes, both [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]] evolved from rugby football in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n==Forms ==\n{{See also|Comparison of rugby league and rugby union}}\nFollowing the 1895 split in rugby football, the two forms [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] differed in administration only. Soon the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. 100 years later, rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly [[professional sports|professional sport]].\n\nThe Olympic form of rugby is known as Rugby Sevens. In this form of the game, each team has seven players on the field at one time playing seven-minute halves. The rules and pitch size are the same as rugby union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://passport.worldrugby.org/?page=beginners&p=21|title=A Beginners\u2019s Guide to Rugby Union : Rugby Sevens - The Olympic dream|website=passport.worldrugby.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of rugby union|History of rugby league}}\n\n=== Ancient ball games ===\n[[File:Ancient Greek Football Player.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] ''episkyros'' player on an [[Attica|Attic]] ''[[lekythos]]'']]\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.

It claims [[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, picked up the ball and invented rugby. Although a Rugby Football Union inquiry in 1895 found no actual proof, it decided to perpetuate the myth.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n|-\n| 1877 || The number of players is reduced from 20 to 15 a side.\n|-\n| 1880 || English Rugby rules required for a tackled player, when the ball was \"fairly held\", to put the ball down immediately for scrummage. \n[[Walter Camp]] proposed at the US [[College Football]] 1880 rules convention that the contested [[Scrum (rugby)|scrummage]] be replaced with a \"[[line of scrimmage]]\" where the team with the ball started with uncontested possession. This change effectively started the evolution of the modern game of [[History of American Football|American football]] away from its rugby origins. \n|-\n| 1883 || [[1883 Home Nations Championship|First]] [[Six Nations Championship|Home Nations Championship]] between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.\n|-\n| 1886 || Concerned at the growing dominance of the largely working-class northern clubs, the Rugby Football Union introduces strict amateur rules: no one was allowed to seek or receive payment or other material reward for taking part in the game.\n|-\n| 1888 || [[1888\u20131889 New Zealand Native football team|New Zealand Native football team tours Britain, Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889]].\n|-\n| 1890 || Modern points scoring is uniformly accepted by the Home Nations for the 1890\u201391 season.\n|-\n| 1892 || Charges of professionalism are laid against rugby football clubs in Bradford and Leeds, after they compensated players for missing work. This was despite the fact that the Rugby Football Union (RFU) was allowing other players to be paid, such as the [[1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia|1888 British Isles team that toured Australasia]], and the account of [[Harry Hamill]] of his payments to represent New South Wales (NSW) against England in 1904.\n|-\n| 1893 || Yorkshire clubs propose allowing players to be paid six shillings \u2018broken-time\u2019 payments when they miss work due to matches. RFU votes down proposal. Widespread suspensions of northern clubs and players begin.\n|-\n| 1895 || [[History of rugby league|The Schism]] in rugby football results in the formation of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). Many factors played a part in the split, including the success of working class northern teams, a decree  by the RFU banning the playing of rugby at grounds where entrance fees were charged, threat of expulsion from the RFU if clubs cannot prove their amateurism, and the banning of \"broken time payments\" to players who had taken time off work to play rugby. Twenty-two clubs met at the George Hotel, Huddersfield and formed the \"Northern Rugby Football Union\". Within fifteen years of that first meeting in Huddersfield, more than 200 RFU clubs had left to join the Northern Union.\n|-\n| 1897 || To make the game more exciting, the Northern Union abolishes the line-out and reduces value of all goals to two points.

[[James Peters (rugby)|James Peters]] is withdrawn from the England squad after the South Africans objected to playing against a black player.\n|-\n| 1906 ||  James Peters becomes the first black person to play rugby union for England, against Scotland.\n|-\n| 1906 || In the Northern Union the number of players is reduced from fifteen to thirteen a side, in order to allow more room for creative play.

During the late 1800s (and even the early 1900s), the two forms of the game were very similar (to the point where the United States was able to win the gold medal for [[rugby union at the 1924 Summer Olympics]]), but numerous rule changes have differentiated the gridiron-based game from its rugby counterpart, introduced by [[Walter Camp]] in the United States and [[John Thrift Meldrum Burnside]] in Canada. Among unique features of the North American game are the separation of play into [[down (American football)|downs]] instead of releasing the ball immediately upon tackling, the requirement that the team with the ball set into a [[formation (American football)|set formation]] for at least one second before [[snap (football)|resuming play after a tackle]] (and the allowance of up to 40 seconds to do so), the allowance for one [[forward pass]] from behind the site of the last tackle on each down, the evolution of hard plastic equipment (particularly the [[football helmet]] and [[shoulder pads]]), a smaller and pointier ball that is favorable to being passed but makes [[drop kick]]s impractical, a generally smaller and narrower field measured in customary units instead of metric (in [[Indoor American football|some variants of the American game]] a field can be as short as 50 yards between end zones), and a distinctive field (shaped like a gridiron, from which the code's nickname is derived) with lines marked in five-yard intervals.\n\n[[Rugby league]] is also both a professional and amateur game, administered on a global level by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. In addition to amateur and semi-professional competitions in the [[Rugby league in the United States|United States]], [[Rugby league in Russia|Russia]], [[Rugby league in Lebanon|Lebanon]], [[Rugby league in Serbia|Serbia]], Europe and Australasia, there are two major professional competitions\u2014the Australasian [[National Rugby League]] and the [[Super League]]. International Rugby League is dominated by [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]], [[England national rugby league team|England]] and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]].

A group from either team lifts a player to fight and catch the ball for their team. (OSUWRC 2014)]]\n[[File:Scrum-1.JPG|thumb|[[Rugby union]]: A [[Scrum (rugby union)|scrum]] between the [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] and the [[Brumbies]] (May 2006)]]\nDistinctive features common to both rugby codes include the oval [[rugby ball|ball]] and throwing the ball forward is not allowed so that players can gain ground only by running with the ball or by kicking it. As the sport of rugby league moved further away from its union counterpart, rule changes were implemented with the aim of making a faster-paced and more try-oriented game. Unlike American and Canadian football, the players do not wear any sort of protection or armour.\n\nThe main differences between the two games, besides league having teams of 13 players and union of 15, involve the [[tackle (football move)|tackle]] and its aftermath:\n* Union players contest possession following the tackle: depending on the situation, either a [[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]] or a [[Playing rugby union#Maul|maul]] can occur. League players may not contest possession after making a tackle: play is continued with a ''[[Playing rugby league#Play-the-ball|play-the-ball]]''.\n* In league, if the team in possession fails to score before a set of six tackles, it surrenders possession. Union has no six-tackle rule; a team can keep the ball for an unlimited number of tackles before scoring as long as it maintains possession and does not commit an offence.\n\n[[set piece (football)|Set pieces]] of the union code include the \"[[scrum (rugby union)|scrum]]\", which occurs after a minor infringement of the rules (most often a knock-on, when a player knocks the ball forward), where packs of opposing players push against each other for possession, and the \"[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]\", in which parallel lines of players from each team, arranged perpendicular to the [[touch-line]], attempt to catch the ball thrown from [[touch (rugby)|touch]]. A rule has been added to line-outs which allows the jumper to be pulled down once a players' feet are on the ground.\n\nIn the league code, the scrum still exists, but with greatly reduced importance as it involves fewer players and is rarely contested. Set pieces are generally started from the play-the-ball situation. Many of the [[rugby league positions]] have names and requirements similar to [[rugby union positions]], but there are no [[Flanker (rugby union)|flankers]] in rugby league.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Home countries===\nIn England, [[rugby union]] is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the [[upper classes|upper]] and [[middle classes]]. For example, many pupils at [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]s and [[grammar school]]s play rugby union, although the game (which had a long history of being played at [[state school]]s until the 1980s) is becoming increasingly popular in [[comprehensive school]]s.<ref>Phillips, Buchler. [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmcumeds/99/99ap22.htm Appendices to the Minutes of Evidence to Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport]</ref> Despite this stereotype, the game, particularly in the [[West Country]] is popular amongst all classes. In contrast, [[rugby league]] has traditionally been seen as a working-class pursuit. Another exception to rugby union's upper-class stereotype is in Wales, where it has been traditionally associated with small village teams made up of coal miners and other industrial workers who played on their days off.<ref>Sommerville, D. (1997). The Encyclopedia of Rugby Union. Aurum Press, UK. {{ISBN|1-85410-481-0}}.</ref> In [[Ireland]], both rugby union and rugby league are unifying forces across the national and sectarian divide, with the Ireland international teams representing both political entities.\n\nIn Australia, support for both codes is concentrated in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.<ref name=\"Collins Paper\">Collins, T. (2005). \"Australian Nationalism and Working-Class Britishness: The Case of Rugby League Football.\" History Compass, Vol. 3, No. 1.</ref>\n\nExceptions to the above include New Zealand (although rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many or a game for 'westies' referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently, southern Auckland where the game is also popular), Wales, France (except Paris), [[Cornwall]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[Somerset]], [[Scottish Borders]], [[County Limerick]] (see [[Munster Rugby|Munster]]) and the [[Pacific Islands]], where rugby union is popular in working class communities. Nevertheless, rugby league is perceived as the game of the working-class people in [[northern England]]<ref>Collins, T. (1998). Rugby\u2019s Great Split: Class, Culture and the Origins of Rugby League Football (London).</ref> and in the [[Australian states]] of [[New South Wales]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"Collins Paper\" />\n\nIn the United Kingdom, rugby union fans sometimes used the term \"rugger\" as an alternative name for the sport, (see [[Oxford '-er']]), although this archaic expression has not had currency since the 1950s or earlier.<ref>Rugger:\n* [[OED]]: Rugger \"Slang or colloquial alteration of RUGBY (in the sense of 'Rugby football').

The game is very popular in South Africa, having been introduced by English-speaking settlers in the 19th century. British colonists also brought the game with them to Australia and New Zealand, where the game is widely played. It has spread thence to much of Polynesia, having particularly strong followings in Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Rugby union continues to grow in the Americas and parts of Asia as well.\n\n==Injuries==\nAbout a quarter of rugby players are injured in each season.<ref>[https://physioworks.com.au/Injuries-Conditions/Activities/rugby-union-injuries]</ref>\n\n==Rugby ball==\n[[File:Rugbyball2.jpg|thumb|A [[Gilbert (sports equipment)|Gilbert]] rugby football as used in [[rugby union]]]]\n\nA [[rugby ball]], originally called a quanco, is a diamond shape ball used for easier passing.\nRichard Lindon and Bernardo Solano started making balls for Rugby school out of hand stitched, four-panel, leather casings and pigs\u2019 bladders. The rugby ball's distinctive shape is supposedly due to the pig's bladder, although early balls were more plum-shaped than oval. The balls varied in size in the beginning depending upon how large the pig's bladder was.\n\nIn rugby union, World Rugby regulates the size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an official rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280\u2013300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740\u2013770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580\u2013620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material and may be treated to make it [[Waterproofing|water resistant]] and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460&nbsp;grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71\u201368.75 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]], or 0.67\u20130.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5\u201310.0&nbsp;lbs per square inch.<ref>International rugby board. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120417010050/http://www.irblaws.com/downloads/EN/IRB_Laws_2012_EN.pdf \"Rugby ball laws\"] 22 Feb. 2010.</ref> Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or teams do not seek an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.\nMuch larger versions of traditional balls are also available for purchase, but these are mainly for their novelty attraction.\n\n==World Cups==\nThe [[Rugby World Cup]], which was first held in New Zealand and Australia in [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]], occurs every four years.  It is an international tournament organized by [[World Rugby]]. The event is played in the union format and features the top 20 teams from around the world. The current world champions are South Africa, who won the [[2019 Rugby World Cup]], which was played in Japan.\n\nThe [[Rugby League World Cup]] was the first World Cup of either of the Rugby codes and was first held in France in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], and as of 2013 occurs on a 4-year cycle. It is an international tournament that is organized by the [[Rugby League International Federation]]. The event is played in the league format and features the top 14 teams from around the world. The current world champions are Australia, who won the World Cup in [[2017 Rugby League World Cup|2017]], played in Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea.\n\n==Rugby shirt==\n{{see also|Rugby union numbering schemes}}\n[[Rugby shirt]]s were formerly made of leather but are now made of a cotton and polyester mix. This material has the advantage of not absorbing as much water or mud as cotton alone.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}  Owing to the more aggressive nature of the game, rugby clothing, in general, is designed to be much more robust and hardwearing than that worn for association football.\n\nThe rugby jerseys are slightly different depending on the type of rugby game played. The shirts worn by [[rugby league]] footballers commonly have a large \"V\" around the neck. The players in rugby union wear jerseys with a more traditional design, sometimes completely white ([[Cahors Rugby]] in France). The number of the player and his or her surname are placed on the upper back of the jersey (often name above number, with the number being significantly larger and more central), and the logo of the team on the upper left chest.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Rugby betting==\n{{See also|Sports betting}}\nWith the popularity of rugby over the years, many betting establishments have made it possible for viewers of the game to place wagers on games.  The various types of wagers that can be placed on games vary, however, the main types of bets that can be placed are as follows:\n* Fixed-odds betting\n* Futures/Outright Bets\n* Prop Bets / Specials\n* Over/Under Bets\n\nLike most team sports, both forms of rugby are vulnerable to match-fixing, particularly bets involving easily manipulated outcomes, such as conceding penalties and first point scorer. A recent example is a deliberate infringement by [[Ryan Tandy]] in order for the first points scored to be a penalty goal in a 2010 NRL match; the attempt backfired when instead of taking a shot at goal, a try was scored.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons cat|Rugby football}}\n{{Wikisource|Laws of Football played at Rugby School (1845)}}\n{{Wikivoyage|Rugby football}}\n* [http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/49661/rugbys-most-unfortunate-faces Rugby's Most Unfortunate Faces]\u2014slideshow by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnuRhNtT2E Video on the Basics of Rugby Union]\n* Full Guide of [https://rugbynest.com Rugby World Cup 2019] in Japan\n\n{{Football codes}}\n{{Team Sport|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Sports}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rugby Football}}\n[[Category:Rugby football| ]]\n[[Category:Team sports]]\n[[Category:Games and sports introduced in the 19th century]]\n[[Category:Rugby School]]\n", "name_user": "220.246.72.116", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eForms)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football"}
