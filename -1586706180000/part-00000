She enrolled at Gothenburg University in 1968, studying medicine and sociology, obtaining a medical degree in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |last=\u00d6rn |first=Peter |title=Annika Linde varnar f\u00f6r fortsatt virushot |url=http://www.lakartidningen.se/Functions/OldArticleView.aspx?articleId=12163 |publisher=L\u00e4kartidningen |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> After her internship at [[Danderyd Hospital]] she went on to work as an infectious disease specialist at the presently defunct Roslagstull Hospital in Stockholm. In 1979 she started working at the virological department at the Swedish National Bacteriological Laboratory, and completed her PhD in Clinical Virology in 1987. In 1993 she became head of the Swedish influenza centre of the WHO and started working for Department of Virology at the Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control, where she in 2002 became department head.<ref name=\"SMI\">{{cite web |title=Annika Linde |url=http://www.smittskyddsinstitutet.se/om-smi/smis-ledningsgrupp/annika-linde/  |publisher=Swedish Institute for Communicable Disease Control |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref> In 2005 she became head of the Department of Epidemiology and was in the same year appointed State Epidemiologist.<ref name=\"Dagens Medicin\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dagensmedicin.se/nyheter/annika-linde-utsedd-till-statsepidemiolog-/ |title=Annika Linde utsedd till statsepidemiolog |publisher=Dagens Medicin Sverige |accessdate=2014-06-15 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140615121033/http://www.dagensmedicin.se/nyheter/annika-linde-utsedd-till-statsepidemiolog-/ |archivedate=2014-06-15 }}</ref> She served in this role until her retirement in 2013, when she was succeeded by [[Anders Tegnell]].\n\nLinde's research is mainly focused on adapting basic research results to clinical applications. She has researched the reaction of the human body to different types of viruses and evaluation of diagnostic methods. She mainly focused on [[herpes virus]]es to begin with, but eventually came to focus her work mostly on influenza and respiratory viruses.

Popular clubs from around the world, including some teams from [[Superleague Greece|Greece]], [[Ukrainian Premier League|Ukraine]] and [[South African Premier Division|South Africa]], are also included, without those nations' entire leagues. The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Champions League]], [[UEFA Europa League]] and [[UEFA European Football Championship]], as well as a series of football management titles.\n\nAs of ''FIFA 20'', Real Madrid playmaker [[Eden Hazard]] is the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover of the series and in promotional campaigns and advertisements. He takes over from [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] of Juventus who was the face of the previous two covers. [[Lionel Messi]] appeared on four straight covers from ''FIFA 13'' to ''FIFA 16''. [[Wayne Rooney]] has appeared in the most covers being on the cover of every game from ''FIFA 06'' to ''FIFA 12''.

It is available for multiple gaming systems, including the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]], and [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n==History==\nWhile ''FIFA 95'' did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams, ''FIFA 96'' pushed the boundaries. For the first time with real player names by obtaining the [[FIFPro]] license, the [[PlayStation]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Sega 32X|32X]] and [[Sega Saturn]] versions used EA's \"Virtual Stadium\" engine, with 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] players moving around a [[Realtime 3D graphics|real-time 3D]] stadium. ''FIFA 97'' improved on this with [[polygon]]al models for players and added an [[indoor soccer]] mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with ''FIFA: Road to World Cup 98''. This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, ''World Cup 98'', was EA's first officially licensed tournament game.\n\n[[John Motson]] was the first commentator for the ''FIFA'' series, and has worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for ''FIFA 96''; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and [[Clive Tyldesley]] for ''FIFA 06'' but later returned for ''FIFA Manager 08''. [[Martin Tyler]] has been the default commentator for the ''FIFA'' series since 2006, alongside Andy Gray between 2006 and 2010 and Alan Smith from 2011-present.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Conversation with Football Commentator Martin Tyler at the Launch of \u2018FIFA 16\u2019 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qbxw5p/a-conversation-with-football-commentator-martin-tyler-at-the-launch-of-fifa-16-959 |accessdate=10 March 2020 |work=Vice}}</ref>{{Video game timeline\n| 1993 = [[FIFA International Soccer]]\n| 1994 = [[FIFA Soccer 95]]\n| 1995 = [[FIFA Soccer 96]]\n| 1996 = [[FIFA 97]]\n| 1997 = [[FIFA: Road to World Cup 98|FIFA 98]]\n| 1998a = [[World Cup 98 (video game)|FIFA World Cup 98]]\n| 1998b = [[FIFA 99]]\n| 1999 = [[FIFA 2000]]\n| 2000 = [[FIFA 2001]]\n| 2001 = [[FIFA Football 2002]]\n| 2002a = [[2002 FIFA World Cup (video game)|2002 FIFA World Cup]]\n| 2002b = [[FIFA Football 2003]]\n| 2003 = [[FIFA Football 2004]]\n| 2004 = [[FIFA Football 2005]]\n| 2005a = [[FIFA Street (2005 video game)|FIFA Street (2005)]]\n| 2005b = [[FIFA 06]]\n| 2006 = [[FIFA Street 2]]\n| 2006b = [[2006 FIFA World Cup (video game)|2006 FIFA World Cup]]\n| 2006c = [[FIFA 07]]\n| 2007 = [[FIFA 08]]\n| 2008a = [[FIFA Street 3]]\n| 2008b = [[FIFA 09]]\n| 2009 = [[FIFA 10]]\n| 2010a = [[2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa (video game)|2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa]]\n| 2010b = [[FIFA 11]]\n| 2011 = [[FIFA 12]]\n| 2012a = [[FIFA Street (2012 video game)|FIFA Street (2012)]]\n| 2012 = [[FIFA 13]]\n| 2013 = [[FIFA 14]]\n| 2014a = [[2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil (video game)|2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil]]\n| 2014b = [[FIFA 15]]\n| 2015 = [[FIFA 16]]\n| 2016a = [[FIFA 17]]\n| 2016b = [[FIFA Mobile]]\n| 2017 = [[FIFA 18]]\n| 2018 = [[FIFA 19]]\n| 2019 = [[FIFA 20]]\n| 2020 = FIFA 21\n}}''FIFA'' games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor. As the console market is expanding, ''FIFA'' is being challenged directly by other titles such as [[Konami]]'s ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer|Pro Evolution Soccer series]]''.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> Both ''FIFA'' and ''Pro Evolution Soccer'' have a large following but ''FIFA'' sales is rising as much as 23 percent year-on-year.<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/> In 2010, the ''FIFA'' series had sold over 100 million copies, making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable [[EA Sports]] title.<ref name=\"best selling\"/><ref name=\"Sinclair\"/> With ''FIFA 12'' selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its September 27 North American debut in 2011, EA Sports dubbed it \"the most successful launch in EA Sports history\".<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/>\n\nIn 2012, EA Sports signed [[Lionel Messi]] to the ''FIFA'' franchise, luring him away from the competitor ''Pro Evolution Soccer''. Messi's likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of ''[[FIFA Street (2012 video game)|FIFA Street]]''. In 2013, the Spanish professional women's footballer [[Ver\u00f3nica Boquete|Vero Boquete]] started a petition on [[Change.org]], which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the ''FIFA'' series. The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavozdegalicia.es/noticia/deportes/2013/02/22/vero-busca-gol-videojuego/0003_201302G22P49991.htm|title=Vero busca el gol de videojuego|date=February 22, 2013|accessdate=August 1, 2013|work=[[La Voz de Galicia]]|first1=Pablo|first2=Iv\u00e1n|last2=Antelo |last1=G\u00f3mez|language=Spanish}}</ref> ''FIFA 16'', released on September 25, 2015, included female national teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/fifa-16-worlds-best-female-6406129|title=FIFA 16: Where do the world's best female players rank against their male counterparts?|accessdate=|date=September 8, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCalling it \"the slickest, most polished and by far the most popular football game around\", and \"football [video] games\u2019 equivalent of the [[Premier League]]\", ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the game\u2019s FIFA Ultimate Team, which \"encourages you to purchase [[Panini Group|Panini]]-sticker-like player packs to build up a dream team\", adding the series has \"an excellent Journey mode that lets you control an aspiring pro and build him up to an international superstar, and a Career mode that lets you control your favourite team on and off the field.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> One of the [[List of best-selling video game franchises|best-selling video game franchises]], by 2018, the ''FIFA'' series had sold over 260 million copies.<ref name=\"Yahoo\"/><ref name=\"Valentine\"/>\n\n==Games in the series==\n\n===1990s===\n\n====''FIFA International Soccer''====\n{{Main|FIFA International Soccer}}\n*Cover athlete: [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] and [[Piotr \u015awierczewski]] ([[Packie Bonner]] and [[Ruud Gullit]] in some versions)\n*Released for: PC, [[DOS]], [[Amiga]], [[Sega CD]] (as ''FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition''), [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Master System]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: December 15, 1993\n\nKnown as ''EA Soccer'' during development and sometimes subsequently also known as ''FIFA '94'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/fifa-international-soccer | title = FIFA International Soccer | author = mobygames.com}}</ref> the first game in the series was released in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993. This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit era]] games by presenting an [[isometric projection|isometric]] view rather than the more usual top-down view (''[[Kick Off (series)|Kick Off]]''), side view (''[[European Club Soccer]]''), or bird's-eye view (''[[Sensible Soccer (series)|Sensible Soccer]]''). It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, replacing ''[[Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting|Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition]]'', and staying there for a full six months.<ref>Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, February\u2013July 1994, published in [[Mega (magazine)|Mega]] issues 17-22</ref> ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.<ref name=\"megalist\">Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, [[Maverick Magazines]], November 1994</ref> The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title \"FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition\" it includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original.

It was made in celebration for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] held in the United States \u2013 especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament: [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. The game was called ''International Soccer'' so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=How Times Change: 'EA Didn't Give a S--t About FIFA' 20 Years Ago|url=http://kotaku.com/how-times-change-ea-didnt-give-a-s-t-about-fifa-20-1159830549|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n====''FIFA 95''====\n{{Main|FIFA Soccer 95}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Erik Thorstvedt]] ([[Alexi Lalas]] in some versions)\n*Released for: [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n*Release date: November 10, 1994\n\nUsing the same engine with only minor touch-ups,<ref name=\"GPro66\">{{cite news|last= |first= |title=FIFA '95 Is the World Champ!|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=118}}</ref> ''FIFA 95'' introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany's [[Bundesliga]], Italy's [[Serie A]], Spain's [[La Liga]], England's [[Premier League]], France's [[Ligue 1]], Netherlands' [[Eredivisie]] and the United States. Most of the leagues have team lineups based on the 1993\u201394 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still have generic players, many of them even returning from the previous game. The USA League consists of teams and players from the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]], the country's second division \u2013 subsequent editions would feature \"artificial\" division one leagues, a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when [[Major League Soccer]] was included for the first time. In addition, the Brazilian league contained only teams from [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] states, with the exception of [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], from [[Rio Grande do Sul]]\u2014it would not be until ''FIFA 07'' that [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Campeonato Brasileiro]] represented the country. The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original ''FIFA International Soccer''.<ref name=\"GPro66\"/> This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only ''FIFA 64'' and certain versions of the ''FIFA Manager'' series share this distinction).\n\n====''FIFA 96''====\n{{Main|FIFA Soccer 96}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Frank de Boer]] and [[Jason McAteer]] (European version)\n*Released for: [[DOS]]/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sega 32X]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: September 30, 1995\n\nThis is the first ''FIFA'' game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] versions, using technology called \"Virtual Stadium\". It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in ''FIFA 99''), and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters ([[Major League Soccer]] had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game's release, but it would only start to appear in the games as of ''FIFA 2000''). The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Mega Drive]] versions use an updated version of ''FIFA 95'''s engine with new teams and graphics. It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: [[Scottish Premier League]], [[Allsvenskan]] and [[Super League Malaysia]], a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well. This was also the first ''FIFA'' game to have a proper introduction.\n\n====''FIFA 97''====\n{{Main|FIFA 97}}\n*Cover athlete: [[David Ginola]] (European version); [[Bebeto]] (rest of the world)\n*Released for: [[DOS]]/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: November 30, 1996\n\nThe biggest change in ''FIFA '97'' was the inclusion of 6-a-side [[indoor soccer]] mode and polygonal players, with [[motion capture]] provided by [[David Ginola]]. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia. These versions also feature commentary by [[John Motson]], partnered by [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]], with [[Des Lynam]] introducing the matches.\n\n====''FIFA: Road to World Cup 98''====\n{{Main|FIFA: Road to World Cup 98}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Roy Lassiter]] (USA); [[David Beckham]] (UK); [[Paolo Maldini]] (Italy); [[David Ginola]] (France); [[Andreas M\u00f6ller]] (Germany); [[Ra\u00fal (footballer)|Ra\u00fal]] (Spain)\n*Title song: \"[[Song 2]]\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: November 8, 1997\n\nThis game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, improved [[artificial intelligence]], a \"Road to World Cup\" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time. The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee's strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment.\n\nAdditionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the [[Offside (association football)|offside rule]] is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of ''FIFA 98'' corrects this so that the game would only award a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.\n\n''FIFA 98'' was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack, with \"[[Song 2]]\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]] used as the intro track for the game. It was the last ''FIFA'' game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on.\n\n====''FIFA 99''====\n{{Main|FIFA 99}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Dennis Bergkamp]] (World), [[Kasey Keller]] (USA), [[Fabien Barthez]] (France), [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] (Japan); [[Olaf Thon]] (Germany); [[Rui Costa]] (Portugal); [[Christian Vieri]] (Italy); [[Ahn Jung-hwan]] (South Korea); [[Fernando Morientes]] (Spain); [[Jason Kreis]] (USA beta)\n*Title song: \"[[The Rockafeller Skank]] (Remix)\" by [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n*Release date: November 30, 1998.

(football)|Galatasaray]] is not present in the game).\n\nThe game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \"emotion\" to the 3D player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.\n\nThe opening video for ''FIFA 2000'' features [[Sol Campbell]] performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1904, the year of the inauguration of [[FIFA]]. The game also included [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the club supported by Williams, in the \"Rest of the World\" section (they were in the [[Football League First Division]] at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with ''FIFA 2004'').\n\n====''FIFA 2001''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2001}}\n*Title song: \"[[Bodyrock (song)|Bodyrock]]\" by [[Moby]]\n*Cover athlete: [[Edgar Davids]] (Netherlands); [[Paul Scholes]] (UK); [[Gheorghe Hagi]] (Romania); [[Ben Olsen]] (US); [[Ricardo S\u00e1 Pinto]] (Portugal); [[Gaizka Mendieta]] (Spain); [[Filippo Inzaghi]] (Italy); [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]] (Germany); [[Thierry Henry]] (France); [[Leonardo Ara\u00fajo|Leonardo]] (Brazil); [[Shimon Gershon]] (Israel); [[Ko Jong-soo]] (South Korea)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]\n*Release date: November 8, 2000\n\nThis title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] as a playable league for the first time, albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League. A \"[[Professional foul|hack]]\" feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise on a [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|6th generation]] video game console in USA and Europe.\n\nThe PlayStation version of ''FIFA 2001'' received a \"Gold\" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),<ref name=goldelspa>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319031650/http://www.elspa.com/?i=3943 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3943 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Gold |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=March 19, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.<ref name=gamasutrasales>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====''FIFA Football 2002''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2002}}\n*Title song: \"[[19-2000]] ([[Soulchild]] Remix)\" by [[Gorillaz]]\n*Cover athlete: [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] (Japan); [[Thierry Henry]] (France, UK, USA); [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] (Sweden); [[Nuno Gomes]] (Portugal); [[Francesco Totti]] (Italy); [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] (Netherlands); [[\u0130lhan Mans\u0131z]] (Turkey); [[Gerald Asamoah]] (Germany); [[Lampros Choutos]] (Greece); [[Hong Myung-bo]] (South Korea); [[Sibusiso Zuma]] (South Africa & Denmark); [[Nawaf Al-Temyat]] (Saudi Arabia); [[Tomasz Radzinski]] (US); [[Roberto Carlos]] (Brazil); [[Iker Casillas]] (Spain); [[Tomasz Frankowski]] (Poland); [[Haim Revivo]] (Israel)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]]\n*Release date: November 1, 2001\n\nFor ''FIFA Football 2002'', power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Feyenoord]], although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the [[Swiss Super League]], at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from [[Panini Comics|Panini]] was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] ([[France]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones' qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose confederations are not represented in full).\n\n''FIFA Football 2002'' was the final game in the main series to feature the [[Japan national football team|Japanese national team]], as the [[Japan Football Association]] would sell its exclusive rights to [[Konami]] during 2002, thereby depriving not only ''FIFA'', but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA's World Cup spin-offs), from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though) until ''[[FIFA 17]]''.\n\n====''FIFA Football 2003''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2003}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Ryan Giggs]], and [[Edgar Davids]] (in the United States, only [[Landon Donovan]] appeared)\n*Title song: \"[[To Get Down]] ([[Fatboy Slim]] remix)\" by [[Timo Maas]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: November 5, 2002\n\n''FIFA Football 2003'' added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated [[DirectX]] 7 graphics used in ''FIFA 2001'' and ''2002'', and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's \"Freestyle Control\" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to teammates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2, whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped.\nFIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the [[EA Trax]].\nEA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles.\n\n====''FIFA Football 2004''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2004}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Thierry Henry]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Ronaldinho]]\n*Title song: \"[[Red Morning Light]]\" by [[Kings of Leon]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[N-Gage (device)|Nokia N-Gage]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: October 18, 2003\n\nWhile not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in ''FIFA Football 2004'' is secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed \"off the ball\" was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. Another key feature is \"Football Fusion\", which allows owners of both ''FIFA 2004'' and ''[[Total Club Manager 2004]]'' to play games from ''TCM'' in ''FIFA 2004''. This is also the first ''FIFA'' game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico ([[Club Am\u00e9rica|Am\u00e9rica]], [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]]; a team, [[Tigres UANL]], is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina ([[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]). The title sequence, featuring [[Ronaldinho]], [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Alessandro Del Piero]], was filmed at [[St James' Park]], the home ground of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\n====''FIFA Football 2005''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2005}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Fernando Morientes]] and [[Andriy Shevchenko]] (in North America, [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]] replaced Patrick Vieira)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[PlayStation Portable]] (America only), [[Game Boy Advance]], [[N-Gage (device)|Nokia N-Gage]], [[Gizmondo]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: October 11, 2004\n\n''FIFA Football 2005'' was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 4]]'' and avoid clashing with EA Sports' own ''[[FIFA Street (2005 video game)|FIFA Street]]''. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico|Mexican League]]. The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]], who composed the ''FIFA Theme'' especially for the game, using some sounds from the game such as crowd noises and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut.\n\n====''FIFA 06''====\n{{Main|FIFA 06}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (in North America, [[Omar Bravo]] and [[Freddy Adu]] joined Ronaldinho on the cover)\n*Released for: [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Xbox 360]]\n*Release date: October 4, 2005\n\n''FIFA''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of ''FIFA'', claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play, having rewritten more than half the game's code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the \"off the ball\" system, the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of \"team chemistry\" which determines how well team members play together. This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[John Motson]] and (more recently) [[Ally McCoist]], who are replaced by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[Clive Tyldesley]] and former [[Sky Sports]] pundit [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]], who had already worked in the series as guest commentator.\n\nOne of the new features in ''FIFA 06'' was a special \"retro\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation, which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the ''FIFA 06'' developers, a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the ''FIFA'' series which was titled as \"FIFA 94\". The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars. Both teams have the [[Cardiff]] [[Millennium Stadium]] as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \"Fan Shop\".\n\n====''FIFA 07''====\n{{main|FIFA 07}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (worldwide); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Lukas Podolski]] (Germany); [[Ronaldinho]], [[Landon Donovan]] and [[Francisco Fonseca]] (North America); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Juninho Pernambucano]] (France); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[David Villa]] (Spain)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: September 27, 2006\n\nThe main differences from the previous game are a new \"Interactive Leagues\" function, new stadia such as the new [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Emirates Stadium]], and the ability to create custom teams and [[Turkcell Super League]] returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game's front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same. The [[Xbox 360]] version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams. This was the last title released for the [[GameCube|Nintendo Gamecube]].\n\n====''FIFA 08''====\n{{main|FIFA 08}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (worldwide); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Miroslav Klose]] (Germany); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Sergio Ramos]] (Spain); [[Ronaldinho]], [[Jozy Altidore]] and [[Guillermo Ochoa]] (North America); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Euzebiusz Smolarek]] (Poland);\n*Title Song: \"Sketches (20 Something Life)\" by La Rocca\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: September 20, 2007\n''[[FIFA 08]]'' introduced a new game mode called \"Be a Pro\", in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger club section including the [[League of Ireland]], and the [[A-League|Hyundai A-League]] of [[Australia]], for the first time. Unlike ''[[FIFA 06]]'' and ''[[FIFA 07|07]]'' however, ''FIFA 08'' does not include any memorable moments or season highlights.

The player is also able to customise their own player; aside from selecting gender, the players will also have a variety of clothes and accessories to choose from, ranging from shoes and clothes to hats and tattoos. The traditional 11v11 mode has also changed, with more 1-on-1s encouraged, more off-the-ball space creation, as well as new penalty and free-kick mechanics.

The game operates on a similar premise to the \"Ultimate Team\" mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player's skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a \"training\" rating, and the combination of the two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the \"Superstars\" league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game \"coins\", which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing the best players in the game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins may also be used to purchase training and stadium upgrades, such as training cones and seating. The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy services and lots of user complaints on the forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.playfish.com/forumdisplay.php?f=303 |title=FIFA Superstars Online Service Update |publisher=Playfish Forum |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125140328/http://forum.playfish.com/forumdisplay.php?f=303 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n;''[[FIFA World]]''\n:A [[free-to-play]] [[Massive multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer online]] ''FIFA'' game, this time distributed by EA Sports themselves.

For the first time with real player names by obtaining the [[FIFPro]] license, the [[PlayStation]], [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Sega 32X|32X]] and [[Sega Saturn]] versions used EA's \"Virtual Stadium\" engine, with 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] players moving around a [[Realtime 3D graphics|real-time 3D]] stadium. ''FIFA 97'' improved on this with [[polygon]]al models for players and added an [[indoor soccer]] mode, but an early pinnacle was reached with ''FIFA: Road to World Cup 98''. This version featured much improved graphics, a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds (including all national teams) and refined gameplay. Months later, ''World Cup 98'', was EA's first officially licensed tournament game.\n\n[[John Motson]] was the first commentator for the ''FIFA'' series, and has worked alongside Ally McCoist, Andy Gray, Des Lynam, Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle. Motson first joined the franchise for ''FIFA 96''; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and [[Clive Tyldesley]] for ''FIFA 06'' but later returned for ''FIFA Manager 08''. [[Martin Tyler]] has been the default commentator for the ''FIFA'' series since 2006, alongside Andy Gray between 2006 and 2010 and Alan Smith from 2011-present.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Conversation with Football Commentator Martin Tyler at the Launch of \u2018FIFA 16\u2019 |url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/qbxw5p/a-conversation-with-football-commentator-martin-tyler-at-the-launch-of-fifa-16-959 |accessdate=10 March 2020 |work=Vice}}</ref>\n\n''FIFA'' games have been met with some minor criticism; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor.

Messi's likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of ''[[FIFA Street (2012 video game)|FIFA Street]]''. In 2013, the Spanish professional women's footballer [[Ver\u00f3nica Boquete|Vero Boquete]] started a petition on [[Change.org]], which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the ''FIFA'' series.

It only includes national teams, and real player names are not used. A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] so that the ball rebounds off him into the net. The game was number one in the UK charts, replacing ''[[Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting|Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition]]'', and staying there for a full six months.<ref>Official Gallup UK Mega Drive sales chart, February\u2013July 1994, published in [[Mega (magazine)|Mega]] issues 17-22</ref> ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' placed the game at #11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time.<ref name=\"megalist\">Mega magazine issue 26, page 74, [[Maverick Magazines]], November 1994</ref> The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title \"FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition\" it includes some features used in the next title, and is a highly polished version of the original.

It was made in celebration for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] held in the United States \u2013 especially noticeable in the Super NES version which, despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version, had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament: [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]], [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]. The game was called ''International Soccer'' so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe, after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Good|first=Owen|title=How Times Change: 'EA Didn't Give a S--t About FIFA' 20 Years Ago|url=http://kotaku.com/how-times-change-ea-didnt-give-a-s-t-about-fifa-20-1159830549|publisher=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n====''FIFA 95''====\n{{Main|FIFA Soccer 95}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Erik Thorstvedt]] ([[Alexi Lalas]] in some versions)\n*Released for: [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n*Release date: November 10, 1994\n\nUsing the same engine with only minor touch-ups,<ref name=\"GPro66\">{{cite news|last= |first= |title=FIFA '95 Is the World Champ!|work=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=118}}</ref> ''FIFA 95'' introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues: Brazil, Germany's [[Bundesliga]], Italy's [[Serie A]], Spain's [[La Liga]], England's [[Premier League]], France's [[Ligue 1]], Netherlands' [[Eredivisie]] and the United States. Most of the leagues have team lineups based on the 1993\u201394 season, and the teams, although recognisably real, all still have generic players, many of them even returning from the previous game. The USA League consists of teams and players from the [[A-League (1995\u20132004)|A-League]], the country's second division \u2013 subsequent editions would feature \"artificial\" division one leagues, a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition, when [[Major League Soccer]] was included for the first time. In addition, the Brazilian league contained only teams from [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] states, with the exception of [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], from [[Rio Grande do Sul]]\u2014it would not be until ''FIFA 07'' that [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Campeonato Brasileiro]] represented the country. The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original ''FIFA International Soccer''.<ref name=\"GPro66\"/> This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform (counting spin-offs, only ''FIFA 64'' and certain versions of the ''FIFA Manager'' series share this distinction).\n\n====''FIFA 96''====\n{{Main|FIFA Soccer 96}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Frank de Boer]] and [[Jason McAteer]] (European version)\n*Released for: [[DOS]]/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sega 32X]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Sega Game Gear]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: September 30, 1995\n\nThis is the first ''FIFA'' game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] versions, using technology called \"Virtual Stadium\". It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions, with ranking, transfer and team customisation tools. However, the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters, some of them even featuring long-retired players (this would only be corrected in ''FIFA 99''), and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters ([[Major League Soccer]] had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game's release, but it would only start to appear in the games as of ''FIFA 2000''). The [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Mega Drive]] versions use an updated version of ''FIFA 95'''s engine with new teams and graphics. It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor (in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only). Also, in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game, three leagues debuted in the game: [[Scottish Premier League]], [[Allsvenskan]] and [[Super League Malaysia]], a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well. This was also the first ''FIFA'' game to have a proper introduction.\n\n====''FIFA 97''====\n{{Main|FIFA 97}}\n*Cover athlete: [[David Ginola]] (European version); [[Bebeto]] (rest of the world)\n*Released for: [[DOS]]/[[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: November 30, 1996\n\nThe biggest change in ''FIFA '97'' was the inclusion of 6-a-side [[indoor soccer]] mode and polygonal players, with [[motion capture]] provided by [[David Ginola]]. The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England, Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany and Malaysia. These versions also feature commentary by [[John Motson]], partnered by [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]], with [[Des Lynam]] introducing the matches.\n\n====''FIFA: Road to World Cup 98''====\n{{Main|FIFA: Road to World Cup 98}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Roy Lassiter]] (USA); [[David Beckham]] (UK); [[Paolo Maldini]] (Italy); [[David Ginola]] (France); [[Andreas M\u00f6ller]] (Germany); [[Ra\u00fal (footballer)|Ra\u00fal]] (Spain)\n*Title song: \"[[Song 2]]\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Game Boy]]\n*Release date: November 8, 1997\n\nThis game marks the start of an upward trend in the series. It boasts a refined graphics engine, team and player customisation options, 16 stadia, improved [[artificial intelligence]], a \"Road to World Cup\" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams, and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time. The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes. Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee's strictness, allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment.\n\nAdditionally, for the first time in a FIFA game, the [[Offside (association football)|offside rule]] is properly implemented. In previous games, when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running, that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards. The 32-bit version of ''FIFA 98'' corrects this so that the game would only award a [[Direct free kick|free kick]] for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.\n\n''FIFA 98'' was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack, with \"[[Song 2]]\" by [[Blur (band)|Blur]] used as the intro track for the game. It was the last ''FIFA'' game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on.\n\n====''FIFA 99''====\n{{Main|FIFA 99}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Dennis Bergkamp]] (World), [[Kasey Keller]] (USA), [[Fabien Barthez]] (France), [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] (Japan); [[Olaf Thon]] (Germany); [[Rui Costa]] (Portugal); [[Christian Vieri]] (Italy); [[Ahn Jung-hwan]] (South Korea); [[Fernando Morientes]] (Spain); [[Jason Kreis]] (USA beta)\n*Title song: \"[[The Rockafeller Skank]] (Remix)\" by [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]\n*Release date: November 30, 1998.

(football)|Galatasaray]] is not present in the game).\n\nThe game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.\n\nThe game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \"emotion\" to the 3D player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.\n\nThe opening video for ''FIFA 2000'' features [[Sol Campbell]] performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1904, the year of the inauguration of [[FIFA]]. The game also included [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], the club supported by Williams, in the \"Rest of the World\" section (they were in the [[Football League First Division]] at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with ''FIFA 2004'').\n\n====''FIFA 2001''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2001}}\n*Title song: \"[[Bodyrock (song)|Bodyrock]]\" by [[Moby]]\n*Cover athlete: [[Edgar Davids]] (Netherlands); [[Paul Scholes]] (UK); [[Gheorghe Hagi]] (Romania); [[Ben Olsen]] (US); [[Ricardo S\u00e1 Pinto]] (Portugal); [[Gaizka Mendieta]] (Spain); [[Filippo Inzaghi]] (Italy); [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]] (Germany); [[Thierry Henry]] (France); [[Leonardo Ara\u00fajo|Leonardo]] (Brazil); [[Shimon Gershon]] (Israel); [[Ko Jong-soo]] (South Korea)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]\n*Release date: November 8, 2000\n\nThis title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit, and for some players, their own unique faces. Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems, the license includes official club emblems for the first time, although certain leagues, like the Dutch league, are unlicensed. Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community. The game also includes the entire [[Austrian Football Bundesliga|Austrian Bundesliga]] as a playable league for the first time, albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League. A \"[[Professional foul|hack]]\" feature is included, where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul, such a high sliding tackle. This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting (such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game, but it was not in all versions of the game). FIFA 2001 was the first version (for the PC) that could be played online, which was revolutionary, and the first game in the franchise on a [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|6th generation]] video game console in USA and Europe.\n\nThe PlayStation version of ''FIFA 2001'' received a \"Gold\" sales award from the [[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] (ELSPA),<ref name=goldelspa>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319031650/http://www.elspa.com/?i=3943 |url=http://www.elspa.com:80/?i=3943 |title=ELSPA Sales Awards: Gold |work=[[Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association]] |archivedate=March 19, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.<ref name=gamasutrasales>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170918063107/https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112220/ELSPA_Wii_Fit_Mario_Kart_Reach_Diamond_Status_In_UK.php |title=ELSPA: ''Wii Fit'', ''Mario Kart'' Reach Diamond Status In UK | author=Caoili, Eric | date=November 26, 2008 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |archivedate=September 18, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n====''FIFA Football 2002''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2002}}\n*Title song: \"[[19-2000]] ([[Soulchild]] Remix)\" by [[Gorillaz]]\n*Cover athlete: [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] (Japan); [[Thierry Henry]] (France, UK, USA); [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] (Sweden); [[Nuno Gomes]] (Portugal); [[Francesco Totti]] (Italy); [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] (Netherlands); [[\u0130lhan Mans\u0131z]] (Turkey); [[Gerald Asamoah]] (Germany); [[Lampros Choutos]] (Greece); [[Hong Myung-bo]] (South Korea); [[Sibusiso Zuma]] (South Africa & Denmark); [[Nawaf Al-Temyat]] (Saudi Arabia); [[Tomasz Radzinski]] (US); [[Roberto Carlos]] (Brazil); [[Iker Casillas]] (Spain); [[Tomasz Frankowski]] (Poland); [[Haim Revivo]] (Israel)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]]\n*Release date: November 1, 2001\n\nFor ''FIFA Football 2002'', power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] and [[Feyenoord]], although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the \"Rest of World\" header). This game also features, for the first time, the [[Swiss Super League]], at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from [[Panini Comics|Panini]] was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] ([[France]], [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]]), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies. Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones' qualifying rounds (except for Oceania and Africa, whose confederations are not represented in full).\n\n''FIFA Football 2002'' was the final game in the main series to feature the [[Japan national football team|Japanese national team]], as the [[Japan Football Association]] would sell its exclusive rights to [[Konami]] during 2002, thereby depriving not only ''FIFA'', but all other football games in the market (with the exception of EA's World Cup spin-offs), from using its lineup and likeness (Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series, though) until ''[[FIFA 17]]''.\n\n====''FIFA Football 2003''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2003}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Ryan Giggs]], and [[Edgar Davids]] (in the United States, only [[Landon Donovan]] appeared)\n*Title song: \"[[To Get Down]] ([[Fatboy Slim]] remix)\" by [[Timo Maas]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: November 5, 2002\n\n''FIFA Football 2003'' added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles. EA revamped the outdated [[DirectX]] 7 graphics used in ''FIFA 2001'' and ''2002'', and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia, players, and kits. Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe's top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs. A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time, as well as comprehensive analysis. One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport's \"Freestyle Control\" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to teammates. Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho, as well as realistic player responses. An [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2, whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped.\nFIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the [[EA Trax]].\nEA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles.\n\n====''FIFA Football 2004''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2004}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Thierry Henry]], [[Alessandro Del Piero]] and [[Ronaldinho]]\n*Title song: \"[[Red Morning Light]]\" by [[Kings of Leon]]\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[N-Gage (device)|Nokia N-Gage]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: October 18, 2003\n\nWhile not adding much to the game engine, the biggest new inclusion in ''FIFA Football 2004'' is secondary divisions, which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions (a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition, but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues). A new gameplay feature dubbed \"off the ball\" was introduced, which is the ability to simultaneously control two players, in order, for example, to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass. The online mode was touted as the main feature. Another key feature is \"Football Fusion\", which allows owners of both ''FIFA 2004'' and ''[[Total Club Manager 2004]]'' to play games from ''TCM'' in ''FIFA 2004''. This is also the first ''FIFA'' game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League; there are four from Mexico ([[Club Am\u00e9rica|Am\u00e9rica]], [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]] and [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]]; a team, [[Tigres UANL]], is present only in the Game Boy Advance version) and two from Argentina ([[Boca Juniors]] and [[Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate|River Plate]]). The title sequence, featuring [[Ronaldinho]], [[Thierry Henry]] and [[Alessandro Del Piero]], was filmed at [[St James' Park]], the home ground of [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].\n\n====''FIFA Football 2005''====\n{{Main|FIFA Football 2005}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Patrick Vieira]], [[Fernando Morientes]] and [[Andriy Shevchenko]] (in North America, [[Oswaldo S\u00e1nchez]] replaced Patrick Vieira)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation]], [[PlayStation Portable]] (America only), [[Game Boy Advance]], [[N-Gage (device)|Nokia N-Gage]], [[Gizmondo]], [[Mobile phone]]\n*Release date: October 11, 2004\n\n''FIFA Football 2005'' was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over ''[[Pro Evolution Soccer 4]]'' and avoid clashing with EA Sports' own ''[[FIFA Street (2005 video game)|FIFA Street]]''. The game features the return of the create-a-player mode, as well as an improved Career mode. The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes. It is also the first version to feature the full [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico|Mexican League]]. The game has no opening video, but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]], who composed the ''FIFA Theme'' especially for the game, using some sounds from the game such as crowd noises and commentary. This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US. The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut.\n\n====''FIFA 06''====\n{{Main|FIFA 06}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (in North America, [[Omar Bravo]] and [[Freddy Adu]] joined Ronaldinho on the cover)\n*Released for: [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Xbox 360]]\n*Release date: October 4, 2005\n\n''FIFA''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of ''FIFA'', claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play, having rewritten more than half the game's code. In addition to a renovation of the engine, which discards the \"off the ball\" system, the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of \"team chemistry\" which determines how well team members play together. This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from ''[[Match of the Day]]'''s [[John Motson]] and (more recently) [[Ally McCoist]], who are replaced by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s [[Clive Tyldesley]] and former [[Sky Sports]] pundit [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]], who had already worked in the series as guest commentator.\n\nOne of the new features in ''FIFA 06'' was a special \"retro\" which features nostalgia of the game. Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section, a memorable moments video compilation, which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the ''FIFA 06'' developers, a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the ''FIFA'' series which was titled as \"FIFA 94\". The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars. Both teams have the [[Cardiff]] [[Millennium Stadium]] as their primary ground. These clubs must be unlocked in the \"Fan Shop\".\n\n====''FIFA 07''====\n{{main|FIFA 07}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (worldwide); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Lukas Podolski]] (Germany); [[Ronaldinho]], [[Landon Donovan]] and [[Francisco Fonseca]] (North America); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Juninho Pernambucano]] (France); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[David Villa]] (Spain)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: September 27, 2006\n\nThe main differences from the previous game are a new \"Interactive Leagues\" function, new stadia such as the new [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Emirates Stadium]], and the ability to create custom teams and [[Turkcell Super League]] returns after seven years of absence from the series. The game's front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same. The [[Xbox 360]] version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system. This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up, completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues, plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams. This was the last title released for the [[GameCube|Nintendo Gamecube]].\n\n====''FIFA 08''====\n{{main|FIFA 08}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (worldwide); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Miroslav Klose]] (Germany); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Sergio Ramos]] (Spain); [[Ronaldinho]], [[Jozy Altidore]] and [[Guillermo Ochoa]] (North America); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Euzebiusz Smolarek]] (Poland);\n*Title Song: \"Sketches (20 Something Life)\" by La Rocca\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: September 20, 2007\n''[[FIFA 08]]'' introduced a new game mode called \"Be a Pro\", in which the player controls only a single player on the field. This version also introduced a larger club section including the [[League of Ireland]], and the [[A-League|Hyundai A-League]] of [[Australia]], for the first time. Unlike ''[[FIFA 06]]'' and ''[[FIFA 07|07]]'' however, ''FIFA 08'' does not include any memorable moments or season highlights. FIFA 08 does not have a version for the original [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], which means that ''[[FIFA 07]]'' was the last game of the series to feature on the console. The [[Xbox 360]] has taken over permanently since ''FIFA 08''.\n\nIt was the first game in the franchise for [[PlayStation 3]]. The debut version for the [[Wii]] introduced motion controls for shooting, as well as three mini-games that make use of the [[Wii Remote]].\n\n====''FIFA 09''====\n{{main|FIFA 09}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Ronaldinho]] (worldwide); [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Sergio Ramos]] (Spain); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Kevin Kuranyi]] (Germany); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k]] (Hungary); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Daniele De Rossi]] (Italy); [[Ronaldinho]], [[Maurice Edu]] and [[Guillermo Ochoa]] (North America)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: October 3, 2008\n\n''FIFA 09'' features a revamped collision system and an option for 10 versus 10 \"Be a Pro\" online matches, and the new \"[[Adidas]] Live Season\" feature, which updates all the players' stats in a particular league based on the player's form in real life. Although the feature is activated through microtransactions, gamers have access to one free league of their choice from the moment they activate the service to the end of the 2008\u201309 season. Online play has also been improved in ''FIFA 09'', with a feature called \"FIFA 09 Clubs\" allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online. The game is the first in the ''FIFA'' series to feature user-controlled [[goal celebration]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=8 new celebrations we'd love to see in FIFA 18 |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/8-new-celebrations-wed-love-see-fifa-18 |accessdate=18 October 2018 |work=FourFourTwo}}</ref> ''FIFA 09'' has met with generally positive reception from reviewers.\n\n[[Clive Tyldesley]] and [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1955)|Andy Gray]] again provide the commentary in the English version. However, in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game, Tyldesley is replaced by [[Martin Tyler]]. For the first time, users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the [[PlayStation Store]] ([[PlayStation 3]]) and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]] ([[Xbox 360]]).<ref>[http://www.zimbio.com/The+FIFA+07+Game/articles/40/FIFA+soccer+09+Free+download+14+Commentator FIFA soccer 09 Free download - 14 Commentator's Pack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218050234/http://www.zimbio.com/The+FIFA+07+Game/articles/40/FIFA+soccer+09+Free+download+14+Commentator |date=December 18, 2008 }} Zimbio</ref> Another option for the English language is Tyldesley and [[Andy Townsend]].\n\n===2010s===\n\n====''FIFA 10''====\n{{main|FIFA 10}}\n*Cover athlete: [[Theo Walcott]], [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Wayne Rooney]] (UK); [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Tim Cahill]] (Australia); [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Andreas Ivanschitz]] (Austria); [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Bal\u00e1zs Dzsudzs\u00e1k]] (Hungary), [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Robert Lewandowski]] (Poland); [[Ronaldinho]] and [[Giorgio Chiellini]] (Italy); [[Karim Benzema]], [[Steve Mandanda]] and [[Guillaume Hoarau]] (France); [[Wayne Rooney]] and [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] (Germany); [[Frank Lampard]] and [[Sim\u00e3o Sabrosa|Sim\u00e3o]] (Portugal); [[Karim Benzema]] and [[Xavi]] (Spain); [[Frank Lampard]]; [[Sacha Kljestan]] and [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco]] (North America); [[Sergei Semak]] (Russia)\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Java ME]], [[Wii]]\n*Release date:  October 2, 2009 (Europe), October 20, 2009 (USA)\n\n''FIFA 10'' has an extended Manager Mode which includes a new [[Assistant coach|Assistant Manager]] that can be used to take care of the team's line-up and to rotate the squad based on importance of the upcoming match and improved finances. The \"Player Experience and Growth System\" has changed. Player growth will now be determined by in-game performance, demands placed on the player, and achievements based on the player's particular position. The games also features 50 stadia and 31 leagues, among which the [[Russian Premier League]] is introduced to the series (except for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions). It also includes 360 degrees player control instead of the 8-direction control in previous games.\n\n====''FIFA 11''====\n{{main|FIFA 11}}\n*Cover athlete : [[Kak\u00e1]] (World), [[Wayne Rooney]] (United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland & Australia), [[Mesut \u00d6zil]] & [[Ren\u00e9 Adler]] (Germany), [[Tim Cahill]] (Australia), [[Jakub B\u0142aszczykowski]] (Poland);\n*Released for: [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[BlackBerry OS]], [[Java ME]]\n*Release date: September 28, 2010 (USA), October 1, 2010 (Europe)\n\n''FIFA 11'' was released September 28, 2010 in North America and October 1, 2010 in Europe. It features a new replacement to Manager Mode called Career Mode; the player is able to play a career as a Manager, Player or a new feature as a Player Manager. Other new features include an improved passing system, improved player likenesses, the ability to play as a Goalkeeper for the first time, and other various other tweaks and additions.\nThe English commentary is provided for the fourth time by [[Martin Tyler]] and [[Andy Gray (footballer, born 1955)|Andy Gray]]. [[Landon Donovan]], [[Kak\u00e1]] and [[Carlos Vela]] feature on the cover of the North American version of the game, while Kak\u00e1 and [[Wayne Rooney]] feature on the cover of the UK and Irish version.

The [[Xbox 360]] and the [[PlayStation 3]] were the main consoles for the game, and for the first time, the PC version was feature-identical. In May, EA announced that a [[Nintendo 3DS]] version would be available, including career mode, 11 vs 11, street mode and Be a Pro, but excluding any online mode. On 27 May, it was confirmed that ''FIFA 12'' would be released on [[PlayStation 2]]. On June 7, it was confirmed that the [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[iPod Touch]] will also be included and others are to come in the next few months.

The game operates on a similar premise to the \"Ultimate Team\" mode that appears in the main FIFA games. Users collect trading cards that represent different players; each card has a statistical rating of the player's skills, contributing to an average team skill rating. The skill rating is augmented by a \"training\" rating, and the combination of the two ratings gives the overall team rating. These ratings determine the outcomes of matches played by the team; a team must win a certain number of matches to progress through a series of leagues, culminating with the \"Superstars\" league. Users may purchase new player cards with in-game \"coins\", which are acquired through playing matches, winning leagues and as gifts from friends; the cards come in bronze, silver and gold packs, with bronze containing low-rated players and gold containing the best players in the game, although gold packs cost more coins. Coins may also be used to purchase training and stadium upgrades, such as training cones and seating. The game requires match credits, which can be earned by playfish cash, penalty shootouts, playing against your friends or simply waiting over time. The game was released in February 2010. The game has gone offline at the end of March 2013, with very lousy services and lots of user complaints on the forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forum.playfish.com/forumdisplay.php?f=303 |title=FIFA Superstars Online Service Update |publisher=Playfish Forum |date=January 25, 2013 |accessdate=March 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125140328/http://forum.playfish.com/forumdisplay.php?f=303 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n;''[[FIFA World]]''\n:A [[free-to-play]] [[Massive multiplayer online game|massive multiplayer online]] ''FIFA'' game, this time distributed by EA Sports themselves.

The Papal States in central Italy are colored purple.]]\n\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the [[Papal States]], which covered a large portion of the [[Italian Peninsula|Italian peninsula]], for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nFor most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The [[Lateran Palace]], on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at [[Avignon]] in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the [[Quirinal Palace]] in 1583, after work on it was completed under [[Pope Paul V]] (1605\u20131621), but on the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the [[King of Italy]].\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Roman Question}}\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when [[capture of Rome|Rome itself was annexed]] by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had [[Italian unification|united the rest of Italy]], after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846\u20131878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.<ref name=\"World History\">{{cite book| last=Wetterau| first=Bruce| title=World History: A Dictionary of Important People, Places, and Events, from Ancient Times to the Present| location=New York| publisher=Henry Holt & Co.| year=1994| isbn=978-0805023503| url=https://archive.org/details/worldhistorydict00wett}}</ref>\n\n===Lateran treaties===\n{{Main|Lateran Treaty}}\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref name=Preamble>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|title=Preamble of the Lateran Treaty|publisher=|access-date=21 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010175158/http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"lateran\"/><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html#TRATTATO_FRA_LA_SANTA_SEDE_E_L\u2019ITALIA Trattato fra la Santa Sede e l'Italia]</ref> The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.<ref name=Statute>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|title=Patti lateranensi, 11 febbraio 1929 \u2013 Segreteria di Stato, card.

Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]], and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005446 |title=Rome |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> One of the main diplomatic priorities of the [[bishop of Rome]] was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.<ref name=\"Chadwick1\">Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222\u201332</ref> The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".<ref name=\"Chadwick1\"/>\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232\u201336</ref> In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"[[open city]]\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], 500 US aircraft [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed Rome on 19 July 1943]], aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed; Pius XII himself, who had been described in the previous month as \"worried sick\" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath.

It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847\u2013855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565), and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623\u20131644).\n[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|Territory of Vatican City State according to the [[Lateran Treaty]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio&nbsp;XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].<ref name=\"treaty\"/><ref name=\"treaty text\"/> These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.<ref name=\"treaty text\">Lateran Treaty of 1929, Articles 13\u201316</ref>\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|police agents of Vatican City State]] and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]].

The Papal States in central Italy are colored purple.]]\n\nPopes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the [[Papal States]], which covered a large portion of the [[Italian Peninsula|Italian peninsula]], for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nFor most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The [[Lateran Palace]], on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at [[Avignon]] in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the [[Quirinal Palace]] in 1583, after work on it was completed under [[Pope Paul V]] (1605\u20131621), but on the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the [[King of Italy]].\n\n===Italian unification===\n{{Main|Roman Question}}\n\nIn 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when [[capture of Rome|Rome itself was annexed]] by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had [[Italian unification|united the rest of Italy]], after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the \"Roman Question\".\n\nItaly made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871, the Quirinal Palace was confiscated by the King of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter, the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846\u20131878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a \"[[prisoner in the Vatican]]\". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.<ref name=\"World History\">{{cite book| last=Wetterau| first=Bruce| title=World History: A Dictionary of Important People, Places, and Events, from Ancient Times to the Present| location=New York| publisher=Henry Holt & Co.| year=1994| isbn=978-0805023503| url=https://archive.org/details/worldhistorydict00wett}}</ref>\n\n===Lateran treaties===\n{{Main|Lateran Treaty}}\n\nThis situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref name=Preamble>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|title=Preamble of the Lateran Treaty|publisher=|access-date=21 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010175158/http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|archive-date=10 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"lateran\"/><ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html#TRATTATO_FRA_LA_SANTA_SEDE_E_L\u2019ITALIA Trattato fra la Santa Sede e l'Italia]</ref> The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholic Christianity in Italy.<ref name=Statute>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|title=Patti lateranensi, 11 febbraio 1929 \u2013 Segreteria di Stato, card.

Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]], and the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005446 |title=Rome |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> One of the main diplomatic priorities of the [[bishop of Rome]] was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.<ref name=\"Chadwick1\">Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222\u201332</ref> The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: \"that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war\".<ref name=\"Chadwick1\"/>\n\nAfter the US entered into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that \"they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided\". The US military even exempted Catholic pilots and crew from air raids on Rome and other Church holdings, unless voluntarily agreed upon. Notably, with the exception of Rome, and presumably the possibility of the Vatican, no Catholic US pilot or air crew refused a mission within German-held Italy. The British uncompromisingly said \"they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded\".<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232\u201336</ref> In December 1942, the UK's envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an \"[[open city]]\", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the UK, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], 500 US aircraft [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed Rome on 19 July 1943]], aiming particularly at the railway hub.

It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river Tiber, the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847\u2013855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559\u20131565), and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623\u20131644).\n[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|Territory of Vatican City State according to the [[Lateran Treaty]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio&nbsp;XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.\n\nAccording to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].<ref name=\"treaty\"/><ref name=\"treaty text\"/> These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.<ref name=\"treaty text\">Lateran Treaty of 1929, Articles 13\u201316</ref>\n\nCastel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|police agents of Vatican City State]] and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]].

The picture follows an unstable [[children's literature|children's author]] who finds herself engulfed in apparitions and hallucinations while staying at her remote vacation home.\n\nConceived by Altman in the mid-1960s, ''Images'' secured financing in 1971 by [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Film Group Ltd.]], and shot on location in [[County Wicklow]], [[Ireland]] in the fall of that year. The script, which had been sparsely composed by Altman, was collaboratively developed further throughout the shoot with the actors. ''Images'' premiered at the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival|25th Cannes Film Festival]], where York won the award for Best Actress, after which it was released theatrically in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 18, 1972. Its theatrical run in the United States was short-lived, and the film received little promotion from Hemdale in the United Kingdom.\n\nCritical reception of the film was mixed, with some critics praising York's performance and [[Vilmos Zsigmond]]'s cinematography, while others faulted it for being incoherent, comparing it to films like ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965). The film was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film|Best English-Language Foreign Film]], and [[John Williams]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy children's author Cathryn ([[Susannah York]]) receives a series of disturbing phone calls in her home in London one dreary night; the female voice on the other end, sometimes cutting in on other phone conversations, suggests mockingly that her husband Hugh ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois (actor)|Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) is having an affair. Hugh comes home, finding Cathryn in distress. As Hugh attempts to comfort her, Cathryn witnesses a different man who is behaving as if he were her husband. She screams in horror and backs away, only to see her vision of the figure revert to her husband.\n\nHugh attributes her outburst to stress and her pregnancy. He decides to take her on a vacation to an isolated cottage in the [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside, where Cathryn can work on her book and take photographs for its illustrations. Immediately upon her arrival, however, Cathryn hears voices saying her name and sees strange apparitions: While preparing lunch one day, she sees her husband Hugh pass through the kitchen, then transform into her dead lover, Rene ([[Marcel Bozzuffi]]). Rene continues to appear to her around the house, and even speaks with her.\n\nCathryn's paranoia and visions become increasingly pervasive, and are exacerbated when a local neighbor and ex-lover, Marcel ([[Hugh Millais]]), brings his adolescent daughter, Susannah ([[Cathryn Harrison]]), to visit. Cathryn becomes unable to distinguish Hugh from Rene or Marcel, as the men shift before her eyes. One day, Rene taunts Cathryn, asking her to kill him if she wants rid of him, and hands her a shotgun. She shoots him through the abdomen; Susannah, startled by the gunshot, runs into the house, and finds Cathryn standing in the den, having shot Hugh's camera to pieces. Cathryn claims the gun accidentally fired when she was moving it.\n\nSeeking solace, Cathryn goes to a nearby waterfall, where she often sees her [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] staring back at her. After one such occurrence, she returns to the house, where Hugh tells her he has to leave for business. She drives him to the train station and returns to the house, where she finds Marcel waiting inside. He begins to undress to have sex with her, but she stabs him through the chest with a kitchen knife. The next morning, she encounters a local elderly man walking his dog, and invites him to come inside for coffee, in spite of the fact that Marcel's corpse apparently lies in the living room (which suggests that she regards the \"murder\" as an hallucination, like her shooting of Rene); the old man declines the invitation. Later in the evening, Susannah stops by the house, and remarks that her father was not at home when she awoke that morning. Cathryn is alarmed by this, as it could mean that she really did kill Marcel. She is relieved to hear that Marcel did return drunk after midnight, and invites Susannah in for a cup of tea since, logically, Marcel cannot be dead on her living room floor. Susannah asks Cathryn if she looked like her when she was young before ominously saying, \"I'm going to be exactly like you.\"\n\nAfter having tea, Cathryn drives Susannah back home. Marcel comes out of the house and attempts to talk to Cathryn, but she drives away. While on a stretch of road through a desolate field, Cathryn witnesses her doppelg\u00e4nger again, attempting to wave her down. Back at the house, she finds both Rene and Marcel's corpses have reappeared in the living room. Cathryn leaves again, and encounters her doppelg\u00e4nger at a bend in the road; this time she stops. The doppelg\u00e4nger begs Cathryn to let her into the car, and the two begin to speak in unison. She then hits the doppelg\u00e4nger with the car, throwing her off a cliff and into a waterfall below. Cathryn then drives back to her home in London. At her home, she goes to take a shower. While in the bathroom, the door opens, and the doppelg\u00e4nger walks inside. Cathryn screams in terror, \"I killed you,\" to which the doppelg\u00e4nger responds, \"Not me.\" The final shot shows Hugh's corpse lying at the bottom of the falls.\n\n==Themes and interpretations==\nThe film's loose narrative structure and ambiguities have led to numerous readings of it from film scholars. Joe McElhaney suggests in ''A Companion to Robert Altman'', the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977) was inspired directly by [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing ''Images'' five years prior.{{Sfn|McElhaney|2015|p=150}} In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like ''Images'' and ''3 Women'' is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"{{Sfn|Sterritt|2000|p=194}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Lou Lombardo (filmmaker)|Louis Lombardo]] has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1989|p=356}} In 1982's ''American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films'' by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness.

The picture follows an unstable [[children's literature|children's author]] who finds herself engulfed in apparitions and hallucinations while staying at her remote vacation home.\n\nConceived by Altman in the mid-1960s, ''Images'' secured financing in 1971 by [[Hemdale Film Corporation|Hemdale Film Group Ltd.]], and shot on location in [[County Wicklow]], [[Ireland]] in the fall of that year. The script, which had been sparsely composed by Altman, was collaboratively developed further throughout the shoot with the actors. ''Images'' premiered at the [[1972 Cannes Film Festival|25th Cannes Film Festival]], where York won the award for Best Actress, after which it was released theatrically in the United States by [[Columbia Pictures]] on December 18, 1972. Its theatrical run in the United States was short-lived, and the film received little promotion from Hemdale in the United Kingdom.\n\nCritical reception of the film was mixed, with some critics praising York's performance and [[Vilmos Zsigmond]]'s cinematography, while others faulted it for being incoherent, comparing it to films like ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'' (1965). The film was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film|Best English-Language Foreign Film]], and [[John Williams]] was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nWealthy children's author Cathryn ([[Susannah York]]) receives a series of disturbing phone calls in her home in London one dreary night; the female voice on the other end, sometimes cutting in on other phone conversations, suggests mockingly that her husband Hugh ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois (actor)|Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]) is having an affair. Hugh comes home, finding Cathryn in distress. As Hugh attempts to comfort her, Cathryn witnesses a different man who is behaving as if he were her husband. She screams in horror and backs away, only to see her vision of the figure revert to her husband.\n\nHugh attributes her outburst to stress and her pregnancy. He decides to take her on a vacation to an isolated cottage in the [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside, where Cathryn can work on her book and take photographs for its illustrations. Immediately upon her arrival, however, Cathryn hears voices saying her name and sees strange apparitions: While preparing lunch one day, she sees her husband Hugh pass through the kitchen, then transform into her dead lover, Rene ([[Marcel Bozzuffi]]). Rene continues to appear to her around the house, and even speaks with her.\n\nCathryn's paranoia and visions become increasingly pervasive, and are exacerbated when a local neighbor and ex-lover, Marcel ([[Hugh Millais]]), brings his adolescent daughter, Susannah ([[Cathryn Harrison]]), to visit. Cathryn becomes unable to distinguish Hugh from Rene or Marcel, as the men shift before her eyes. One day, Rene taunts Cathryn, asking her to kill him if she wants rid of him, and hands her a shotgun. She shoots him through the abdomen; Susannah, startled by the gunshot, runs into the house, and finds Cathryn standing in the den, having shot Hugh's camera to pieces. Cathryn claims the gun accidentally fired when she was moving it.\n\nSeeking solace, Cathryn goes to a nearby waterfall, where she often sees her [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] staring back at her. After one such occurrence, she returns to the house, where Hugh tells her he has to leave for business. She drives him to the train station and returns to the house, where she finds Marcel waiting inside. He begins to undress to have sex with her, but she stabs him through the chest with a kitchen knife. The next morning, she encounters a local elderly man walking his dog, and invites him to come inside for coffee, in spite of the fact that Marcel's corpse apparently lies in the living room (which suggests that she regards the \"murder\" as an hallucination, like her shooting of Rene); the old man declines the invitation. Later in the evening, Susannah stops by the house, and remarks that her father was not at home when she awoke that morning. Cathryn is alarmed by this, as it could mean that she really did kill Marcel. She is relieved to hear that Marcel did return drunk after midnight, and invites Susannah in for a cup of tea since, logically, Marcel cannot be dead on her living room floor. Susannah asks Cathryn if she looked like her when she was young before ominously saying, \"I'm going to be exactly like you.\"\n\nAfter having tea, Cathryn drives Susannah back home. Marcel comes out of the house and attempts to talk to Cathryn, but she drives away. While on a stretch of road through a desolate field, Cathryn witnesses her doppelg\u00e4nger again, attempting to wave her down. Back at the house, she finds both Rene and Marcel's corpses have reappeared in the living room. Cathryn leaves again, and encounters her doppelg\u00e4nger at a bend in the road; this time she stops. The doppelg\u00e4nger begs Cathryn to let her into the car, and the two begin to speak in unison. She then hits the doppelg\u00e4nger with the car, throwing her off a cliff and into a waterfall below. Cathryn then drives back to her home in London. At her home, she goes to take a shower. While in the bathroom, the door opens, and the doppelg\u00e4nger walks inside. Cathryn screams in terror, \"I killed you,\" to which the doppelg\u00e4nger responds, \"Not me.\" The final shot shows Hugh's corpse lying at the bottom of the falls.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe film's loose narrative structure and ambiguities have led to numerous readings of it from film scholars. Joe McElhaney suggests in ''A Companion to Robert Altman'', the majority of film critics and scholars have tended to note that Altman's ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977) was inspired directly by [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]'' (1966), but, according to McElhaney, Altman himself claimed to have been more influenced by the film when writing and directing ''Images'' five years prior.{{Sfn|McElhaney|2015|p=150}} In a retrospective interview, Altman attested to this, saying: \"What I see becomes personal, so I am as involved in the fabric of those films [with smaller casts] as I am in the others. The difference between those films with many, many characters and small films like ''Images'' and ''3 Women'' is just the size of the canvas. Some are small paintings, whereas others are big, broad murals.\"{{Sfn|Sterritt|2000|p=194}}\n\nFilmmaker [[Lou Lombardo (filmmaker)|Louis Lombardo]] has read the character of Cathryn as a stand-in figure for Altman himself, and the film thus an exploration of the multi-dimensional creative process.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1989|p=356}} In 1982's ''American Skeptic: Robert Altman's Genre-Commentary Films'' by Norman Kagan, he cites the film as an \"anti-genre exploration of what might be called the theme of madness. This genre includes such critically revered films as ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', and ''Persona''.\"{{Sfn|Kagan|1982|p=75}} Writer Frank Caso identified themes of the film as including obsession, [[schizophrenia]] and [[personality disorder]], and linked the film to Altman's earlier film ''[[That Cold Day in the Park]]'' (1969) and his later ''[[3 Women]]'' (1977), declaring them a trilogy.{{sfn|Caso|2015}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Images'' was an American-British coproduction;<ref name=afi>{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54549|work=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]]|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|location=Los Angeles, California|title=Images|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129100705/http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&Movie=54549|archive-date=November 29, 2018}}</ref> the film was shot at Ardmore Studios and at a country home in [[County Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], between October and December 1971.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1989|p=350}} According to a piece published by ''Variety'' in December 1969 while the film was in pre-production, Altman had intended to shoot the film in North America, specifically in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada.<ref name=afi/>\n\nDirector Altman, who had begun to write the project in the 1960s, had said that he wanted to make a film similar to the work of [[Joseph Losey]], whose films he admired.{{Sfn|McGilligan|1989|p=355}} According to Susannah York, the shoot was loose in form as well as collaborative, and the cast would meet with Altman over dinner each night to discuss the scenes of the upcoming day: \"It was quite a bare script originally,\" said York. \"Certainly I began to have very strong ideas about Cathryn.
