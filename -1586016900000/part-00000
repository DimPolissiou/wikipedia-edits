It's a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man, and is a thematic continuation of [[Sonnet 66]]. In this poem, the speaker's anxiety about the social difference between him and his beloved takes the form of a criticism of courtly corruption. This sonnet was placed first in the pirated and mangled edition of 1640.\n\n==Structure== \nSonnet 67 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical [[rhyme scheme]] of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The third line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7   /   \u00d7  /  \u00d7  /  \u00d7     /    \u00d7  / \nThat sin by him advantage should achieve (67.3)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. \n\nLine eight exemplifies an initial reversal, of which there are several in this sonnet:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n / \u00d7  \u00d7    / \u00d7    /     \u00d7   /   \u00d7    / \nRoses of shadow, since his rose is true? (67.8)\n</pre>\n\n==Source and analysis==\nGary Schmidgall notes that the underlying conceit of the sonnet derives from [[Petrarch]], for whom hyperbolic praise is a main part of the stock in trade. For most critics, this theme is in this poem significant as it interacts with another theme, the corruption of the court. This theme, which was prominent in the voguish [[satire]] of the 1590s. As he would in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Shakespeare draws on the language of abuse derived ultimately from Roman satirists such as [[Juvenal]] and [[Horace]]. The combination of satiric and romantic language is commonly said to reinforce the speaker's ambivalence about his beloved. [[Molly Mahood|M. M.

The player is required to master all the intricate steps and maintain a smooth flight for the passengers. The player must follow the red and green markers that indicates the proper flight path during each landing and takeoff phase. The player is required to follow every step including communication with the co-pilot and the tower by pressing the Speak Button.\n\nThe game has two modes including Training Flight, where players can perform 3 landings with explanations of the piloting system, and Airline Flight, where players can select any of 6 airports in Japan. During gameplay, the player takes off once, and thereafter conducts mostly landings at every selected destination airport. [[All Nippon Airways]] is product-placed as the airline in the game. The game has 5 realistic commercial aircraft, including the [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-481D]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767\u2013281]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767\u2013381]], [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777\u2013281]] and [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777\u2013381]].<ref>[http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=581&image=4 The Arcade Flyer Archive].</ref> Players can choose two different piloting systems including Automatic, where players use the [[Yoke (aircraft)|flight yoke]] and [[rudder pedal]]s, and Manual, where the player is given additional controls, using the thrust [[throttle]], flaps setting butttons, and the cockpit display screen change button. There is a small [[LCD]] monitor above the yoke that has 4 configuration displays, including [[horizon indicator]]s, engine operation, airspeed, and altitude.\n\nThe six airports include [[Kansai International Airport|Osaka]], [[Hiroshima Airport|Hiroshima]], [[Naha Airport|Naha]], [[New Chitose Airport|Sapporo]], [[Haneda International Airport|Tokyo]], and [[Fukuoka Airport|Fukuoka]]. During gameplay, the player takes off once, and thereafter conducts mostly landings at every selected destination airport. In Training Flight, players cannot choose their own airport. Inclement weather including [[clouds]], [[rain]], [[thunderstorm]]s, and [[snow]] may be encountered. Time of day is also featured in the game. During each landing in Airline Mode, [[wind speed]] and wind direction are shown and the flight path and wind patterns become more difficult with each successive landing as players progress.\n\nA landing can end with several different results, including \"Clear,\" \"Bad Landing,\" \"Course Out\", \"[[Go-around]]\", \"Over Run\", and \"[[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crash]]\".  After each landing, points are granted or deducted based on piloting evaluation, course evaluation, and passenger evaluation. An adequate number of points must be achieved in order to get a \"Clear\" result and advance to the next airport. The final score is calculated by adding up totals from each landing and dividing by the number of attempts. Erratic flying, such as *High Speed Bank\", \"Inclination Too Great\", \"Stall\", \"Verification Ignored\" can cost players points. The passengers' stress level is also featured depending on how the aircraft is being flown. Smooth flying remains it at green, turning to purple and red for unusual flying. When the stress level meter is full, it indicates that they have become angry, costing players points.\n\nDuring gameplay, the [[copilot]] will occasionally make comments, such as \"Captain, we are veering off course\" or \"Captain, we are in danger of [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]]\". He also announces when the aircraft reaches [[V1 speed|V<sub>1</sub> speed]], [[Velocity 2|V<sub>2</sub> speed]], and [[V speeds#vr|V<sub>R</sub> speed]] during takeoff. In addition, he carries out certain orders such as lowering the landing gear (subsequently confirming, \"Gear down, three green\", implying that the three green Down-Locked indicator lights are on. The [[control tower]] and [[flight attendant]] also are briefly heard from at the beginning of the takeoff phase.

The player is required to master all the intricate steps and maintain a smooth flight for the passengers. The player must follow the red and green markers that indicates the proper flight path during each landing and takeoff phase. The player is required to follow every step including communication with the co-pilot and the tower by pressing the Speak Button.\n\nThe game has two modes including Training Flight, where players can perform 3 landings with explanations of the piloting system, and Airline Flight, where players players can select any of 6 airports in Japan. During gameplay, the player takes off once, and thereafter conducts mostly landings at every selected destination airport. [[All Nippon Airways]] is product-placed as the airline in the game. The game has 5 realistic commercial aircraft, including the [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-481D]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767\u2013281]], [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767\u2013381]], [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777\u2013281]] and [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777\u2013381]].<ref>[http://www.arcadeflyers.com/?page=flyer&db=videodb&id=581&image=4 The Arcade Flyer Archive].</ref> Players can choose two different piloting systems including Automatic, where players use the [[Yoke (aircraft)|flight yoke]] and [[rudder pedal]]s, and Manual, where the player is given additional controls, using the thrust [[throttle]], flaps setting butttons, and the cockpit display screen change button. There is a small [[LCD]] monitor above the yoke that has 4 configuration displays, including [[horizon indicator]]s, engine operation, airspeed, and altitude.\n\nThe six airports include [[Kansai International Airport|Osaka]], [[Hiroshima Airport|Hiroshima]], [[Naha Airport|Naha]], [[New Chitose Airport|Sapporo]], [[Haneda International Airport|Tokyo]], and [[Fukuoka Airport|Fukuoka]]. During gameplay, the player takes off once, and thereafter conducts mostly landings at every selected destination airport. In Training Flight, players cannot choose their own airport. Inclement weather including [[clouds]], [[rain]], [[thunderstorm]]s, and [[snow]] may be encountered. Time of day is also featured in the game. During each landing in Airline Mode, [[wind speed]] and wind direction are shown and the flight path and wind patterns become more difficult with each successive landing as players progress.\n\nA landing can end with several different results, including \"Clear,\" \"Bad Landing,\" \"Course Out\", \"[[Go-around]]\", \"Over Run\", and \"[[Aviation accidents and incidents|Crash]]\".  After each landing, points are granted or deducted based on piloting evaluation, course evaluation, and passenger evaluation. An adequate number of points must be achieved in order to get a \"Clear\" result and advance to the next airport. The final score is calculated by adding up totals from each landing and dividing by the number of attempts. Erratic flying, such as *High Speed Bank\", \"Inclination Too Great\", \"Stall\", \"Verification Ignored\" can cost players points. The passengers' stress level is also featured depending on how the aircraft is being flown. Smooth flying remains it at green, turning to purple and red for unusual flying. When the stress level meter is full, it indicates that they have become angry, costing players points.\n\nDuring gameplay, the [[copilot]] will occasionally make comments, such as \"Captain, we are veering off course\" or \"Captain, we are in danger of [[Stall (flight)|stalling out]]\". He also announces when the aircraft reaches [[V1 speed|V<sub>1</sub> speed]], [[Velocity 2|V<sub>2</sub> speed]], and [[V speeds#vr|V<sub>R</sub> speed]] during takeoff. In addition, he carries out certain orders such as lowering the landing gear (subsequently confirming, \"Gear down, three green\", implying that the three green Down-Locked indicator lights are on. The [[control tower]] and [[flight attendant]] also are briefly heard from at the beginning of the takeoff phase. The [[ground proximity warning system]] and realistic cockpit alarm sounds are also heard frequently.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:1999 video games]]\n[[Category:Flight simulation video games]]\n[[Category:Arcade games]]\n[[Category:Arcade-only games]]\n[[Category:Taito games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Taito arcade games]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGameplay:Typo fixing, replaced: players players \u2192 players", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_High_Japan"}

It is a member of the [[The Sonnets#Fair Youth|Fair Youth]] sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThis sonnet is a continuation of Sonnet 64, and is an influential poem on the aspect of Time's destruction. Shakespeare also offers an escape from Time's clasp in his end couplet, suggesting that the love and human emotion he has used through his writing will test Time and that through the years the black ink will still shine bright.  Shakespeare begins this sonnet by listing several seemingly vast and unbreakable things which are destroyed by time, then asking what chance beauty has of escaping the same fate.  A main theme is that many things are powerful, but nothing remains in this universe forever, especially not a fleeting emotion such as love.  Mortality rules over the universe and everything is perishable in this world, so it is only through the timeless art of writing that emotion and beauty can be preserved.\n\n==Structure==\nSonnet 65 is an English or Shakespearean [[sonnet]]. The English sonnet has three [[quatrain]]s, followed by a final rhyming [[couplet]]. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ''abab cdcd efef gg'' and is composed in [[iambic pentameter]], a type of poetic [[Metre (poetry)|metre]] based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The first line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter:\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n \u00d7      /     \u00d7    /     \u00d7  /       \u00d7   /    \u00d7    / \nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea, (65.1)\n</pre>\n:/ = ''ictus'', a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = ''nonictus''. \n\nThe tenth line exhibits a rightward movement of the third ictus (the resulting four-position figure, <code>\u00d7&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;/&nbsp;/</code>, is sometimes referred to as a ''minor ionic''):\n\n<pre style=\"border:none;background-color:transparent;margin-left:1em\">\n  \u00d7    /      \u00d7    / \u00d7    \u00d7   /       /    \u00d7   / \nShall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid? (65.10)\n</pre>\n\nThis figure may also be detected in lines eleven and fourteen, along with an initial reversal in line three.\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Relation to adjacent sonnets===\nTime is not an innocuous entity. Here in Sonnet 65 Shakespeare shows time's cruel ravages on all that we believe is enduring. According to Lowry Nelson, Jr., Sonnet 65 is simply a continuation of Sonnet 64 and he argues that \"both poems are meditations on the theme of time's destructiveness\".<ref>Nelson, Lowry Jr.  ''Poetic Configurations: essays in literacy, history and criticism''. University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992. 139-142.</ref> He also explains that \"Sonnet 65 makes use of the same words [brass, rage, hand, love] and more or less specific notions, but it proceeds and culminates far more impressively,\" in comparison to Sonnet 64. The last two couplets are Shakespeare's own summary on the theme that love itself is a \"miracle\" that time nor human intervention can destroy.\n\nShakespeare critic Brents Stirling expands on Lowry's idea by placing sonnet 65 in a distinct group among the sonnets presumably addressed to Shakespeare's young friend, because of the strictly third-person mode of address. Stirling links sonnets 63-68 through their use of \"uniform epithet, 'my love' or its variants such as 'my beloved' \".<ref name=\"auto\">Stirling, Brents. The Shakespearean Sonnet Order: Poems and Groups. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1968, 160-163</ref> In sonnet 65, the pronoun 'his' directly references the epithet. \"Sonnet 65 opens with an epitome of [sonnet] 64: 'Since brass not stone nor earth nor boundless sea...\" The opening line refers back to the 'brass,' 'lofty towers,' 'firm soil,' and 'wa'try main' of 64.<ref name=\"auto\"/> 'This rage' of 'sad mortality' calls to mind the 'mortal rage' of 64. \"After its development of 64, sonnet 65 returns with its couplet to the couplet of 63: 'That in black ink my love may still shine bright' echoes 'His beauty' that 'shall in these black lines be seen'; and 'still shine' recalls 'still green' \".<ref name=\"auto\"/> This \"triad\" of poems relates to the group of sonnets 66\u201368, for \"Their respective themes, Time's ruin (63-65) and the Former Age, a pristine earlier world now in ruin and decay (66-68), were conventionally associated in Shakespeare's day,\" suggesting that the sonnets were written as a related group meant to be distinctly categorized.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Verbal patterns===\nShakespearean scholar [[Helen Vendler]] characterizes Sonnet 65 as a \"defective key word\" sonnet.  Often, Shakespeare will use a particular word prominently in each quatrain, prompting the reader to look for it in the couplet and note any change in usage.  Here, however, he repeats the words \"hold\" and \"strong\" (modified slightly to \"stronger\" in Q1), but omits them in the couplet, thus rendering them \"defective.\"  Vendler claims that these key words are replaced by \"miracle\" and \"black ink\" respectively in the quatrain, citing as evidence the shift of focus from organic to inorganic, which parallels the same shift occurring more broadly from the octave to the sestet, as well as the presence of the letters i, a, c, and l visually yoking m'''i'''r'''acl'''e to b'''lac'''k '''i'''nk.<ref>Vendler, Helen.  ''The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets''.  Cambridge, MA:  Harvard UP, 1997.</ref>  [[Stephen Booth (academic)|Stephen Booth]] supports this line of criticism, noting the juxtaposition of \"hand\" and \"foot\" in line 11, suggesting someone being tripped up and perhaps mirroring the shift to come in the couplet.<ref>Booth, Steven, ed.  ''Shakespeare's Sonnets''.  New Haven, CT:  Yale UP, 1977.</ref>\n\nBarry Adams furthers the characterization of Sonnet 65 as somehow disrupted or defective, noting the usage of \"O\" to begin the second and third quatrains and the couplet, but not the first quatrain.  He also notes the paradoxical nature of this device:  \"The effect of this last verbal repetition is to modify (if not nullify) the normal 4+4+4+2 structure of the English or Shakespearean sonnet by blurring the distinction between couplet and quatrain.  Yet the argumentative structure of the poem insists on that distinction, since the concluding couplet is designed precisely to qualify or even contradict the observations in the first three quatrains.\".<ref>Adams, Barry B.  \"Sonnet 65\".  ''The Greenwood Companion to Shakespeare''.  Ed. Joseph Rosenblum.  Westport, CT:  Greenwood Press, 2005.  1153-58.</ref>\n\nJoel Fineman treats Sonnet 65 as [[epideictic]].  He injects cynicism into the Fair Youth sonnets, claiming that the speaker does not believe fully in the immortalizing power of his verse; that it is merely literary and ultimately unreal.  He treats the \"still\" in line 14 as wordplay, reading it to mean \"dead, unmoving\" rather than \"perpetual, eternal\".<ref>Fineman, Joel.  ''Shakespeare's Perjured Eye:  The Invention of Poetic Subjectivity in the Sonnets''.  Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1986.</ref>  There is some scholarly debate over this point, though.  Carl Atkins, for example, writes that the reader is \"not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously.  We are not expected to have any doubt that the 'miracle' of making the beloved shine brightly in black ink has might.  Of course it does - we have been told so before.  'Who can hold back time?' the speaker asks.  'No one, except me,' is the answer\".<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed.  ''Shakespeare's Sonnets with Three Hundred Years of Commentary''.  Cranbury, NJ:  Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp., 2007.</ref> Philip Martin tends toward agreement with Atkins, but refutes the suggestion that the reader is \"not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously,\" asserting instead that, \"the poem's ending is...deliberately and properly tentative\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Martin, Philip. Shakespeare's Sonnets: Self, Love and Art. London: Cambridge University Press, 1972. 154-55.</ref> Murray Krieger agrees with Martin's point that, \"the end of 65 is stronger precisely because it is so tentative\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"The soft, almost non-consonantal 'how shall summer's honey breath hold out' \"  offers no resistance to Time's 'wrackful siege of batt'ring days'.<ref name=\"auto2\">Krieger, Murray. A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and Modern Poetics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1964. 170-173</ref> Krieger suggests that while the sonnet does not resist Time through an assertion of strength, the concession of weakness by the placement of hope solely on a 'miracle,' offers an appeal against Time: \"May there not be a strength that arises precisely from the avoidance of it?\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Connection to ''The Tragedy of Julius C\u00e6sar''===\nTime is a natural force from which none of us is immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume everyone in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths in the context of the play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.\n\nIt is coincidental enough that the speaker suggests that the only way to immortalize his beloved as he is, is through his writing. And the way that Caesar and the others are kept alive is through writing, through history, and in some senses through Shakespeare himself.\n\nIt is rather universally accepted that a body of Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed to a young man whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar may or may not be representative.\n\n==Interpretations==\n*[[Jonathan Pryce]], for the 2002 [[compilation album]], ''[[When Love Speaks]]'' ([[EMI Classics]])\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Shakespeare sonnets bibliography}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/65comm.htm Analysis]\n\n{{Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare's sonnets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonnet 065}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare]]\n", "text_old": "{{Sonnet|65|Sonnet 65 1609.jpg|The first two lines of Sonnet 65 in the 1609 Quarto|\nSince brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,\nBut sad mortality o\u2019er-sways their power,\nHow with this rage shall beauty hold a plea\nWhose action is no stronger than a flower?\nO, how shall summer\u2019s honey breath hold out\nAgainst the wreckful siege of battering days,\nWhen rocks impregnable are not so stout,\nNor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?\nO fearful meditation! where, alack,\nShall Time\u2019s best jewel from Time\u2019s chest lie hid?\nOr what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?\nOr who his spoil of beauty can forbid?\n:O, none, unless this miracle have might,\n:That in black ink my love may still shine bright.\n|source=<ref>{{cite book |title=The Works of Shakespeare: Sonnets |editor-first=C[harles] Knox |editor-last=Pooler |series=The Arden Shakespeare [1st series] |location=London |publisher=Methuen & Company |date=1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/sonnetseditedbyc00shakuoft |oclc=4770201}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Sonnet 65''' is one of [[The Sonnets|154 sonnets]] written by the English playwright and poet [[William Shakespeare]].

He treats the \"still\" in line 14 as wordplay, reading it to mean \"dead, unmoving\" rather than \"perpetual, eternal\".<ref>Fineman, Joel.  ''Shakespeare's Perjured Eye:  The Invention of Poetic Subjectivity in the Sonnets''.  Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1986.</ref>  There is some scholarly debate over this point, though.  Carl Atkins, for example, writes that the reader is \"not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously.  We are not expected to have any doubt that the 'miracle' of making the beloved shine brightly in black ink has might.  Of course it does - we have been told so before.  'Who can hold back time?' the speaker asks.  'No one, except me,' is the answer\".<ref>Atkins, Carl D., ed.  ''Shakespeare's Sonnets with Three Hundred Years of Commentary''.  Cranbury, NJ:  Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp., 2007.</ref> Philip Martin tends toward agreement with Atkins, but refutes the suggestion that the reader is \"not to take the couplet's 'unless' seriously,\" asserting instead that, \"the poem's ending is...deliberately and properly tentative\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Martin, Philip. Shakespeare's Sonnets: Self, Love and Art. London: Cambridge University Press, 1972. 154-55.</ref> Murray Krieger agrees with Martin's point that, \"the end of 65 is stronger precisely because it is so tentative\".<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \"The soft, almost non-consonantal 'how shall summer's honey breath hold out' \"  offers no resistance to Time's 'wrackful siege of batt'ring days'.<ref name=\"auto2\">Krieger, Murray. A Window to Criticism: Shakespeare's Sonnets and Modern Poetics. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1964. 170-173</ref> Krieger suggests that while the sonnet does not resist Time through an assertion of strength, the concession of weakness by the placement of hope solely on a 'miracle,' offers an appeal against Time: \"May there not be a strength that arises precisely from the avoidance of it?\".<ref name=\"auto2\"/>\n\n===Connection to ''The Tragedy of Julius C\u00e6sar''===\nTime is a natural force from which none of us is immune. This theme pervades the sonnet; the speaker recognizes that time will strip the beloved of his beauty and by saying that implies that time will take his beloved from him. Eventually, time will consume everyone in death, and, whether one chooses to recognize it or not, he will not have any control over exactly when that consumption will take place. This theme translates to Julius Caesar as well. Caesar is unfazed by the soothsayer's proclamation in act one, and even though Calpurnia seems for a time to have succeeded in keeping Caesar home on the day of his eventual murder, he goes to Senate anyway. Caesar walks into his own death, much less literally than Brutus, who does actually walk into the sword that kills him. But in these deaths in the context of the play serve to elucidate the truth that death (or 'Time', as the sonnet refers to it) will consume you regardless of your ambitions or future plans; it does not take you into consideration. Obviously, Caesar would not have gone to Senate if he knew he would be stabbed upon entering, just as Brutus and Cassius would not have engaged in a full-blown war if they knew they would be dead before it was over.\n\nIt is coincidental enough that the speaker suggests that the only way to immortalize his beloved as he is, is through his writing. And the way that Caesar and the others are kept alive is through writing, through history, and in some senses through Shakespeare himself.\n\nIt is rather universally accepted that a body of Shakespeare's sonnets, including 65, are addressed to a young man whose beauty the poems make known. The young man is like Caesar, then, in that Shakespeare recognizes the presence of feminine qualities in a man. But the common theme is more than recognition, it is an acknowledgment of tension created by that recognition. Especially by Cassius, Caesar is made out to be rather feminine, as is the young man in descriptions of his beauty. In that the speaker does not directly refer to the addressee of the sonnets as a man, and in that Brutus and the others find discomfort in Caesar's ruling ability because of his appeared weaknesses, shows that Shakespeare recognizes an anxiety about men with feminine qualities, or women with masculine qualities, like Queen Elizabeth, of whom Caesar may or may not be representative.\n\n==Interpretations==\n*[[Jonathan Pryce]], for the 2002 [[compilation album]], ''[[When Love Speaks]]'' ([[EMI Classics]])\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Shakespeare sonnets bibliography}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/65comm.htm Analysis]\n\n{{Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare's sonnets}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sonnet 065}}\n[[Category:British poems]]\n[[Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRelation to adjacent sonnets:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 66-68 \u2192 66\u201368", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_65"}
