He became active in performing in comedy sketches while at [[Cambridge University]], and became president of the [[Footlights]] club, touring internationally with the Footlights revue in 1964. Becoming wider known to the public for his work on [[BBC Radio]] with ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', he moved into television with ''[[At Last the 1948 Show]]'' working together with old Cambridge friends [[John Cleese]] and [[Graham Chapman]]. He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand. He also appeared as an actor in various [[sitcom]]s, and was a panellist on ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'' for almost 50 years.\n\n==Early life and education==\nBrooke-Taylor was born in [[Buxton]], [[Derbyshire]], England, the grandson of [[Francis Pawson]], a [[parson]] who played [[centre forward]] for the English football team in the 1880s.<ref>[http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf The Goodie Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222060025/http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/p4-5DGOLD_tcm9-113565.pdf |date=22 February 2012 }} Retrieved 12 February 2010</ref> His mother was an international [[lacrosse]] player and his father a solicitor.

There he read economics and politics before changing to read law, and mixed with other budding comedians, including [[John Cleese]], [[Graham Chapman]], [[Bill Oddie]], [[Graeme Garden]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]] in the [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] (of which Brooke-Taylor became President in 1963).<ref name=\"fringe\">''From Fringe to Flying Circus'' \u2013 'Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980' \u2013 Roger Wilmut, Eyre Methuen Ltd, 1980.</ref><ref name=\"footlights\">''Footlights!'' \u2013 'A Hundred Years of Cambridge Comedy' \u2013 Robert Hewison, Methuen London Ltd, 1983.</ref>\n\nThe Footlights Club revue, ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful during its [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] run that the show was renamed as ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and  transferred to the [[West End of London|West End]] in London before being taken to both New Zealand and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the United States in September 1964.<ref name=\"fringe\"/><ref name=\"footlights\"/> Brooke-Taylor was also active in the Pembroke College drama society, the [[Pembroke Players]].\n\n==Career==\nBrooke-Taylor moved swiftly into [[BBC Radio]] with the fast-paced comedy show ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' which he performed in and co-wrote.<ref name=\"fringe\" /> As the screeching eccentric Lady Constance de Coverlet, he could be relied upon to generate the loudest audience response of many programmes in this long-running series merely with her unlikely [[catchphrase]] \"Did somebody call?\" uttered after a comic and transparent feed-line, as their adventure story reached its climax or [[cliffhanger]] ending.

Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369 Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]].

Footage of Brooke-Taylor and Cleese from ''At Last the 1948 Show'' was shown on the documentary special ''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]''. The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market. Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week. The episode he was in still survives and has been included in DVD compilation sets.\n\nIn 1968\u201369 Brooke-Taylor was also a cast member and writer on the television comedy series ''[[Marty (TV series)|Marty]]'' starring [[Marty Feldman]], with [[John Junkin]] and [[Roland MacLeod]].<ref name=\"fringe\" /> A compilation of the two series of ''Marty'' has been released on a BBC DVD entitled ''The Best of Marty Feldman''. During this period Brooke-Taylor appeared as two characters in the film ''[[One Man Band (Orson Welles film)|One Man Band]]'' directed by [[Orson Welles]]; however, the project was never completed and remains unreleased.\n\nAt around the same time, Brooke-Taylor made two series of ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with Garden (and Oddie joining for the second series).<ref name=\"fringe\" /> Describing itself as \"An Encyclopedia of the Air\", the show was a string of comedy sketches (often lifted from ''I'm Sorry I'll Read That Again''), linked (loosely) by a weekly running theme. Nothing but a few minutes of film inserts exist for this programme, though home-made off-air audio recordings survive for both seasons.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe success of ''Broaden Your Mind'' led to the commissioning of ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]'', also with Oddie and Garden. First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]]. Brooke-Taylor also appeared regularly in advertisements, including the Christmas commercials for the Brentford Nylons chain of fabric stores, and in a [[Public information film|public information film]] for the now-defunct [[E111 (health form)|E111]] form, since replaced by the [[European Health Insurance Card]].\n\nIn 1971 he played the short, uncredited role of a computer scientist in the film ''[[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory]]''; his scene was the final one filmed for the movie. After the end of ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the [[animated]] television comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman. He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK! Fan Club Website - Articles/Guides|website=www.goodiesruleok.com}}</ref> whilst in ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]'' he took part in the sketches \"Top of the Form\" (with Cleese, Chapman, [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[Rowan Atkinson]] and [[Griff Rhys Jones]]), and \"Cha Cha Cha\" (with Cleese and Chapman). Brooke-Taylor, Garden and Oddie also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' to perform \"Funky Gibbon\".<ref name=BBCDeath/> Garden joined Brooke-Taylor in the theatre production of ''[[The Unvarnished Truth]]''.\n\nOther BBC radio programmes in which Brooke-Taylor played a part include the self-styled \"antidote to panel games\" ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', which started in 1972; he took part regularly for over 40 years.<ref>https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ldEQYB39GSsC</ref> On 18 February 1981, Brooke-Taylor, was the subject of [[Thames Television]]'s ''[[This Is Your Life]]''.\n\nIn 1998 Brooke-Taylor appeared as a guest in one episode of the political satire game show ''[[If I Ruled the World (game show)|If I Ruled the World]]''.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0143043/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Brooke-Taylor and Garden were co-presenters of [[Channel 4]]'s daytime game show, ''Beat the Nation'', in which they indulged in typical game show \"banter\", but took the quiz itself seriously. He appeared on stage in Australia and England, usually as a [[middle class]] Englishman. In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]]. [[Paul McGann]] played the [[Eighth Doctor]], and Brooke-Taylor played the part of Mims, a [[Zygon]] taking the shape of a human.\n\nBrooke-Taylor was the voice of the narrator on the children's cartoon series ''[[Bananaman (TV series)|Bananaman.]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBrooke-Taylor married Christine Weadon in 1968 and they had two sons, Ben and Edward.<ref>\"''Who's Who on Television''\" \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1985). {{ISBN|0-907965-31-8}}</ref><ref>''Who's Who on Television'' \u2013 Independent Television Books, London, England (1988). {{ISBN|0-907965-49-0}}</ref> He lived in [[Berkshire]].<ref>Old Wykehamist Record.</ref>  He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE) in the [[2011 Birthday Honours]] for services to light entertainment.<ref name=LG59808>{{London Gazette|issue=59808 |date=11 June 2011 |page=12 |supp=y}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2011/06/11/13455/obes_all_round...|title=OBEs all round...|author=Powder Blue Internet Business Solutions}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9510000/9510621.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 Today \u2013 Graeme Garden 'thought OBE letter was a bill'|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/uknews/8568812/Birthday-Honours-List-2011-in-pictures.html?image=6|title=Birthday Honours List 2011 in pictures|work=Telegraph.co.uk|date=11 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/goodies-pair-thrilled-with-obes-16010736.html|title=Goodies pair 'thrilled' with OBEs|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}</ref> \n\nDuring the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom|coronavirus pandemic in the United Kingdom]], Brooke-Taylor died of complications from [[coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] on 12 April 2020, aged 79.<ref name=BBCDeath>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dies with coronavirus, aged 79 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52262490 |accessdate=12 April 2020 |work=BBC News |date=12 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Tim Brooke-Taylor dead: Comedian and actor dies aged 79 after contracting coronavirus |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/tim-brooketaylor-dead-dies-79-coronavirus-a4412831.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Lord Rector of the University of St Andrews ===\nBrooke-Taylor was elected Lord [[Rector of the University of St Andrews|Rector]] by the students of the [[University of St Andrews]] and held office between 1979 and 1982.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/previousrectors/|title=Previous Rectors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>  In this role he represented the students, chaired the University Court and presided over the [[General Council of the University of St Andrews|General Council]] in the absence of the [[Chancellor of the University of St Andrews|Chancellor]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yourunion.net/voice/rectorelection/history/|title=History of the Rector|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yourunion.net|publisher=University of St Andrews Students' Association|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/about/governance/key-officials/rector/|title=Rector|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\u00a0 At his installation he arrived by helicopter, rode a motorbike and was hauled in an open carriage as part of The Drag.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://standrewsrarebooks.wordpress.com/2018/04/13/cricketer-comedians-and-campaigners-rectors-1967-93/|title=Cricketer, Comedians, and Campaigners: Rectors, 1967-1993|last=St Andrews Special Collections|date=2018-04-13|website=Echoes from the Vault|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" /> His installation speech included a mother-in-law joke in Latin and a suggestion his successor should be a woman;

{"title_page": "Pantheon of Asturian Kings", "text_new": "[[File:Catedral de Oviedo 2010.JPG|thumb|Principal fa\u00e7ade of the [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador]], [[Oviedo]].]] \nThe '''Pantheon of Asturian Kings''' is a chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto in the [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador]], [[Oviedo]], [[Spain]]. It is the burial place of many of the rulers of the medieval kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nThe name ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto'' (\"Our Lady of the Chaste King\") alludes to [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], known as ''\"the Chaste\"'', considered the founder of the cathedral. The original royal pantheon was located in the 9th-century Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto on the same site. On the initiative of Tom\u00e1s Reluz, Bishop of Oviedo, that pantheon and the church were demolished in the early 18th century due to their poor state of conservation. Both were rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1712.\n\n== The primitive Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo ==\nIn the 9th century Alfonso II of Asturias, [[List of Asturian monarchs|king of Asturias]], ordered the erection of a church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] in his new capital of [[Oviedo]], with the intention of establishing a royal pantheon as a final resting place for himself and his wife, queen Berta. This church later became known in his honor as the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto (\"Church of Our Lady of the Chaste King\").\n\nThe primitive Pantheon of Kings was located in the [[narthex]] of the church. Rather than the church being entered through the narthex as is customary, the main entrance was through a doorway in the southern arm of the church, with the narthex being dedicated entirely as a place of entombment for Asturian monarchs.\n\n[[File:Alfonso II por V\u00edctor Hevia 1-ret.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue by [[V\u00edctor Hevia Granda]] on the portico of the cathedral, representing Alfonso II.]] \nThe primitive pantheon was a small oblong room {{convert|20|ft|m}} wide (the same width as the principal [[nave]] of the church), {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep, and somewhere between {{convert|8|ft|m}} and {{convert|10|ft|m}} in height. The ceiling was of wood, and over the pantheon was the upper [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the church, which, as in the churches of [[San Miguel de Lillo]] and [[Church of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s|San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s]], was located in the narthex.  On either side of the royal pantheon were small closet-like rooms, one of which contained the staircase to the choir upstairs. The other small room may have been for storage of items used during religious services. The pantheon was connected to the main sanctuary of the church through a wide door near the main altar of the church; a small window also connected the pantheon to the sanctuary. Both, according to the chroniclers of the time, were closed with heavy iron bars that nearly prevented any sunlight from entering the pantheon.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'>{{in lang|es}} [[Fortunato de Selgas]], [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/46850585767252386754491/p0000001.htm ''La primitiva bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda del rey Casto de Oviedo y su real pante\u00f3n''], 20 May 1887. Accessed online on cervantesvirtual.com.</ref>\n\nHumble in appearance, the royal pantheon received the bodies of numerous members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family over the course of several centuries. According to the chroniclers of the period, the tombs were quite close together, to the point where it was not possible to walk between them; for lack of space, some members of the royal family were entombed elsewhere in the church. Not all of the bodies were entombed in the walls or in freestanding tombs; some were buried in the floor, their graves covered by unadorned slabs of stone, in most cases without inscriptions.\n\nNear the staircase connecting the church to the upper choir was a tomb that was much venerated in the 16th century, owing to the widespread belief that saints were buried there. Nonetheless, chronicler [[Ambrosio de Morales]] believed that by that time the bodies that had been buried there had been removed to another place. The tomb was covered with a marble slab. A worn and nearly illegible Latin inscription read ''\"Adepti...Regna Celestia potiti\"''.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/> It is impossible to know exactly what the inscription may have originally said, but ''Regna Celestia'' is \"the Kingdom of Heaven\" and ''adepti'' and ''potiti'' both mean \"obtained\" or \"attained\".\n\nIn the royal pantheon, near the entrance, some {{convert|2|ft|m}} above the floor, was a tomb covered by a roughly worked lid without adornment or inscription. Nonetheless, tradition and the preeminent location of the tomb led to general agreement among historians that it was the tomb of Alfonso II, founder of the church and of the royal pantheon.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/>\n\nSeveral other members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family were entombed elsewhere in the primitive Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto, outside the royal pantheon:<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/>\n\n* [[Fruela I of Asturias]] (722-768), king of Asturias.

Nonetheless the remains of kings Alfonso III and Fruela II and queens Jimena, Munia, Elvira Men\u00e9ndez, Urraca S\u00e1nchez and Teresa Ans\u00farez remained in the royal pantheon in Oviedo.<ref name='sepulcro'/>\n\n== The new Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo ==\n\n=== History ===\nToward the end of the 17th century, the pantheon of kings was basically intact but in a poor state of conservation, as was the primitive Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto, of which it was part. On May 15, 1696, [[Charles II of Spain]] issued a royal decree dedicating all [[benefice]]s derived from [[Tanes]] and [[Bra\u00f1alonga]] to the Cathedral of Oviedo with the intent of contributing to the maintenance and restoration of the primitive church. Some years later, in 1705, the council in charge of the cathedral sent a memorial to the king, indicating the continued poor condition of the church and of the royal pantheon; bishop [[Tom\u00e1s Reluz]] sent an accompanying letter recommending the demolition of the primitive church. The proposal was accepted.\n\nReluz was the principal instigator of the early 18th century construction of the new chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto. The new pantheon was located between the pillars of the left nave (known in Spanish as the ''nave del evangelio'', \"the nave of the Gospel\"), enclosed by an iron grate, with light entering through an oval. This disposition has been interpreted as a loss of importance for the function of the royal pantheon to the church, favoring instead the function of the church as a Marian sanctuary. Nonetheless, the location of the new royal pantheon at the foot of the left nave allowed a wider central nave for the new structure.<ref>{{in lang|es}} ''La construcci\u00f3n de la Capilla de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto y Pante\u00f3n Real de la Catedral de Oviedo''. Vidal \u00c1ngel de la Madrid \u00c1lvarez. p. 9 and 14.</ref>\n\nThe contract to construct the new chapel was signed November 10, 1705, by Bishop Reluz and master builder Bernab\u00e9 de Hazas. Construction costs were estimated at 24,000 [[ducats]] and the time for construction at three years. On August 2, 1709, the dome of the new Chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto, still under construction at that time, collapsed, causing several deaths. The chapel was completed in 1712, although it was not until 1717 that the picture of the Virgin was moved from the Chapel of Santa Barbara in the Cathedral to the new chapel.\n\n=== Description ===\nThe Royal Pantheon occupies the last section of the northern side of the chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of Oviedo. It is the most sumptuous part of the cathedral complex, richly decorated in carvings of plants and heraldic emblems.\n\nIn six niches, among other funerary urns, are the remains of many members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family. A tablet on the chapel wall gives the names of those entombed there, although it contains some errors.<ref>{{in lang|es}} ''Sepulcros de la Casa Real de Castilla''. p. 48-49.</ref>\n\nThe gratings of the royal pantheon and the church were made by Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Casielles and were put in place in 1713. The grating that closes off access to the Royal Pantheon is adorned with the coat of arms of king [[Philip V of Spain]]; a similar grating, but without the royal seal, adorns the Chapel of the Annunciation of the cathedral.\n\nIn the center of the Royal Pantheon is a sarcophagus covered by a fifth century marble tombstone. It is the only surviving tomb from the primitive pantheon. Some studies indicate that this sarcophagus was used to transport the remains of the Asturian king Alfonso III (\"the Great\") and his wife Queen Jimena from the city of Astorga to Oviedo. The sepulchral urn is of ordinary unadorned stone. The overlying cover is marble, coffin-shaped, wider at the head than the feet, and entirely covered in reliefs. A sculpted epitaph in somewhat obscure Latin appears to state that it contains the body of one ''Ithacius''\n\n<blockquote>''INCLVSI TENERVM PRAETIOSO MARMORE CORPVS AETERNAM IN SEDE NOMINIS ITHACII''</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Pante\u00f3n real de la Catedral de Oviedo--1.jpg|thumb|The present-day Royal Pantheon.]]\nAt least one possible reading of this is: \"I have enclosed a tender body with precious marble in the eternal resting place of the family of Ithacius,\" but there are various other possibilities (including \"&hellip;of the fame of Ithacius\" and \"&hellip;by the name of Ithacius\").

It is the burial place of many of the rulers of the medieval kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Asturias|Asturias]] and [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nThe name ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto'' (\"Our Lady of the Chaste King\") alludes to [[Alfonso II of Asturias]], known as ''\"the Chaste\"'', considered the founder of the cathedral. The original royal pantheon was located in the 9th-century Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto on the same site. On the initiative of Tom\u00e1s Reluz, Bishop of Oviedo, that pantheon and the church were demolished in the early 18th century due to their poor state of conservation. Both were rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1712.\n\n== The primitive Pantheon of Kings of the Cathedral of Oviedo ==\nIn the 9th century Alfonso II of Asturias, [[List of Asturian monarchs|king of Asturias]], ordered the erection of a church of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] in his new capital of [[Oviedo]], with the intention of establishing a royal pantheon as a final resting place for himself and his wife, queen Berta. This church later became known in his honor as the Iglesia de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto (\"Church of Our Lady of the Chaste King\").\n\nThe primitive Pantheon of Kings was located in the [[narthex]] of the church. Rather than the church being entered through the narthex as is customary, the main entrance was through a doorway in the southern arm of the church, with the narthex being dedicated entirely as a place of entombment for Asturian monarchs.\n\n[[File:Alfonso II por V\u00edctor Hevia 1-ret.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue by [[V\u00edctor Hevia Granda]] on the portico of the cathedral, representing Alfonso II.]] \nThe primitive pantheon was a small oblong room {{convert|20|ft|m}} wide (the same width as the principal [[nave]] of the church), {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep, and somewhere between {{convert|8|ft|m}} and {{convert|10|ft|m}} in height. The ceiling was of wood, and over the pantheon was the upper [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] of the church, which, as in the churches of [[San Miguel de Lillo]] and [[Church of San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s|San Salvador de Valdedi\u00f3s]], was located in the narthex.  On either side of the royal pantheon were small closet-like rooms, one of which contained the staircase to the choir upstairs. The other small room may have been for storage of items used during religious services. The pantheon was connected to the main sanctuary of the church through a wide door near the main altar of the church; a small window also connected the pantheon to the sanctuary. Both, according to the chroniclers of the time, were closed with heavy iron bars that nearly prevented any sunlight from entering the pantheon.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'>{{in lang|es}} [[Fortunato de Selgas]], [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/46850585767252386754491/p0000001.htm ''La primitiva bas\u00edlica de Santa Mar\u00eda del rey Casto de Oviedo y su real pante\u00f3n''], 20 May 1887. Accessed online on cervantesvirtual.com.</ref>\n\nHumble in appearance, the royal pantheon received the bodies of numerous members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family over the course of several centuries. According to the chroniclers of the period, the tombs were quite close together, to the point where it was not possible to walk between them; for lack of space, some members of the royal family were entombed elsewhere in the church. Not all of the bodies were entombed in the walls or in freestanding tombs; some were buried in the floor, their graves covered by unadorned slabs of stone, in most cases without inscriptions.\n\nNear the staircase connecting the church to the upper choir was a tomb that was much venerated in the 16th century, owing to the widespread belief that saints were buried there. Nonetheless, chronicler [[Ambrosio de Morales]] believed that by that time the bodies that had been buried there had been removed to another place. The tomb was covered with a marble slab. A worn and nearly illegible Latin inscription read ''\"Adepti...Regna Celestia potiti\"''.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/> It is impossible to know exactly what the inscription may have originally said, but ''Regna Celestia'' is \"the Kingdom of Heaven\" and ''adepti'' and ''potiti'' both mean \"obtained\" or \"attained\".\n\nIn the royal pantheon, near the entrance, some {{convert|2|ft|m}} above the floor, was a tomb covered by a roughly worked lid without adornment or inscription. Nonetheless, tradition and the preeminent location of the tomb led to general agreement among historians that it was the tomb of Alfonso II, founder of the church and of the royal pantheon.<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/>\n\nSeveral other members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family were entombed elsewhere in the primitive Church of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto, outside the royal pantheon:<ref name='pante\u00f3n'/>\n\n* [[Fruela I of Asturias]] (722-768), king of Asturias.

The chapel was completed in 1712, although it was not until 1717 that the picture of the Virgin was moved from the Chapel of Santa Barbara in the Cathedral to the new chapel.\n\n=== Description ===\nThe Royal Pantheon occupies the last section of the northern side of the chapel of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Rey Casto in the Cathedral of Oviedo. It is the most sumptuous part of the cathedral complex, richly decorated in carvings of plants and heraldic emblems.\n\nIn six niches, among other funerary urns, are the remains of many members of the Asturian-Leonese royal family. A tablet on the chapel wall gives the names of those entombed there, although it contains some errors.<ref>{{in lang|es}} ''Sepulcros de la Casa Real de Castilla''. p. 48-49.</ref>\n\nThe gratings of the royal pantheon and the church were made by Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda Casielles and were put in place in 1713. The grating that closes off access to the Royal Pantheon is adorned with the coat of arms of king [[Philip V of Spain]]; a similar grating, but without the royal seal, adorns the Chapel of the Annunciation of the cathedral.\n\nIn the center of the Royal Pantheon is a sarcophagus covered by a fifth century marble tombstone. It is the only surviving tomb from the primitive pantheon. Some studies indicate that this sarcophagus was used to transport the remains of the Asturian king Alfonso III (\"the Great\") and his wife Queen Jimena from the city of Astorga to Oviedo. The sepulchral urn is of ordinary unadorned stone. The overlying cover is marble, coffin-shaped, wider at the head than the feet, and entirely covered in reliefs. A sculpted epitaph in somewhat obscure Latin appears to state that it contains the body of one ''Ithacius''\n\n<blockquote>''INCLVSI TENERVM PRAETIOSO MARMORE CORPVS AETERNAM IN SEDE NOMINIS ITHACII''</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Pante\u00f3n real de la Catedral de Oviedo--1.jpg|thumb|The present-day Royal Pantheon.]]\nAt least one possible reading of this is: \"I have enclosed a tender body with precious marble in the eternal resting place of the family of Ithacius,\" but there are various other possibilities (including \"&hellip;of the fame of Ithacius\" and \"&hellip;by the name of Ithacius\"). This tomb was reused in the Royal Pantheon, although the specific identity of the body currently located within it is unclear.<ref>{{cite book|last=Del Arco y Garay|first=Ricardo|authorlink=Ricardo del Arco y Garay|publisher=Instituto Jer\u00f3nimo Zurita.
