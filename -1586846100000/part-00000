All government services were opened to women including the district management group and the foreign service (in the civil service), which had been denied to them earlier. About 10% of the seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] and 5% in the provincial assemblies were reserved for women, with no restriction on contesting general seats as well. However, the implementation of these policies was poor as the Government faced a financial crisis due to the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war with India]] and consequent split of the country.<ref name=\"adb_wom_pak\"/>\n\nGender equality was specifically guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Pakistan#The Constitution of 1973|Constitution of Pakistan]] adopted in 1973.

The Sixth Plan during the martial law r\u00e9gime of General Zia-ul-Haq (1977\u20131986) was full of policy contradictions. The r\u00e9gime took many steps toward institutional building for women's development, such as the establishment of the [[Women's Division]] in the Cabinet Secretariat, and the appointment of another commission on the Status of Women. A chapter on [[women in development]] was included for the first time in the Sixth Plan. The chapter was prepared by a working group of 28 professional women headed by [[Syeda Abida Hussain]], chairperson of the [[Jhang District]] council at that time. The main objective as stated in the Sixth Plan was \"to adopt an integrated approach to improve women's status\".<ref name=\"adb_wom_pak\"/> In 1981, General Zia-ul-Haq nominated the ''[[Majlis-e-Shoora]]'' (Federal Advisory Council) and inducted 20 women as members, however Majlis-e-Shoora had no power over the executive branch.<ref>F. Shaheed, K. Mumtaz. et al. 1998. \"Women in Politics: Participation and Representation in Pakistan\". Shirkat Gah, Pakistan.</ref> In 1985, the National Assembly elected through nonparty elections doubled women's reserved quota (20 percent).\n\nHowever, Zia-ul-Haq initiated [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|a process of Islamization]] by introducing discriminatory legislation against women such as the set of [[Hudood Ordinance]]s and the ''Qanun-e-Shahadat'' Order (Law of Evidence Order). He banned women from participating and from being spectators of sports and promoted [[purdah]].<ref name=\"adb_wom_pak\"/> He suspended all fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution that had been adopted in 1973, including the right to be free of discrimination on the basis of sex. He also proposed laws regarding [[Qisas]] and [[Diyat]], Islamic penal laws governing retribution (''qisas'') and compensation (''diyat'') in crimes involving bodily injury. When the victim was a woman, the amount of ''diyat'' was halved<ref>Asma Jahangir, \"A Pound of Flesh,\" Newsline (Karachi), December 1990, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nThe Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 was a subcategory of the [[Hudood Ordinance]]. ''[[Zina (Arabic)|Zina]]'' is the crime of non-marital sexual relations and adultery. The Zina Ordinance included ''zina-bil-jabr'', the category of forced intercourse. If the woman who accuses a man of ''zina-bil-jabr'' (rape) cannot prove to the judicial system that she was raped, she faces adultery charges.<ref name=\"csid6_julie\">[http://www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/6th_Annual_Conference-JulieNorman.pdf Rape Law in Islamic Societies: Theory, Application and the Potential for Reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616161350/http://www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/6th_Annual_Conference-JulieNorman.pdf |date=16 June 2007 }}.

The threat of being prosecuted discourages victims from filing complaints.\n\nIn addition, the legal possibility of marital rape was eliminated; by definition, rape became an extramarital offence according to the Zina ordinance. The ordinance prompted international criticism. [[Women's rights]] groups helped in the production of a film titled \"Who will cast the first stone?\" filmmaker by Sabiha Sumar to highlight the oppression and sufferings of women under the Hudood Ordinances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2005/interviewsep2005.htm|title=I've had no support from Pakistanis at home|author=Sairah Irshad Khan|work=Newsline|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025102228/http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2005/interviewsep2005.htm|archivedate=25 October 2005 }}</ref>\n\nIn September 1981, the first conviction and sentence under the Zina Ordinance, of [[rajm|stoning to death]] for Fehmida and Allah Bakhsh were set aside under national and international pressure. In September 1981, women came together in [[Karachi]] in an emergency meeting to oppose the adverse effects on women of martial law and the Islamization campaign. They launched what later became the first full-fledged national women's movement in Pakistan, the [[Women\u2019s Action Forum]] (WAF). WAF staged public protests and campaigns against the Hudood Ordinances, the Law of Evidence, and the Qisas and Diyat laws (temporarily shelved as a result).<ref name=\"crime_or_custom\">{{cite web\n|title=Crime or Custom\n|url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/pakistan/index.htm\n|accessdate=2007-01-01\n|publisher=Human Rights Watch\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, an orphaned, thirteen-year-old girl Jehan Mina was allegedly raped by her uncle and his sons, and became pregnant.

She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from the public and the press that the Federal [[Shariah]] Court of its own motion, called for the records of the case and ordered that she should be released from prison on her own bond.

The majority of women in prison had been charged under the Hudood Ordinance.

The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth plans formulated under various democratically elected governments have clearly made efforts to include women's concerns in the planning process.

She also promised to repeal controversial Hudood laws that curtailed the rights of women However, during her two incomplete terms in office (1988\u201390 and 1993\u201396), Benazir Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women. She was not able to repeal a single one of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation laws. By virtue of the eighth constitutional amendment imposed by Zia-ul-Haq, these laws were protected both from ordinary legislative modification and from judicial review.<ref name=\"crime_or_custom\"/>\n\nIn early 1988, the case of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar sparked bitter public criticism. Shahida's first husband, Khushi Muhammad, had divorced her and the papers had been signed in front of a magistrate. The husband however, had not registered the divorce documents in the local council as required by law, rendering the divorce not legally binding. Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (''iddat''), remarried. Her first husband, rebounding from a failed attempt at a second marriage, decided he wanted his first wife Shahida back. Shahida's second marriage was ruled invalid. She and her second husband, Sarwar were charged with adultery. They were sentenced to death by stoning.<ref name=\"shahnaz_mediating\"/> The public criticism led to their retrial and acquittal by the Federal Shariah Court.\n\nMinistry of Women's Development (MWD) established Women's Studies centres at five universities in [[Islamabad]], [[Karachi]], [[Quetta]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Lahore]] in 1989. However, four of these centres became almost non-functional due to lack of financial and administrative support.<ref name=\"adb_wom_pak\"/> Only the center at [[University of Karachi]] (funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]]) was able to run a master of arts programme.\n\nThe [[First Women Bank]] Ltd. (FWBL) was established in 1989 to address women's financial needs. FWBL, a nationalised commercial bank, was given the r\u00f4le of a development finance institution, as well as of a social welfare organisation. It operates 38 real-time online branches across the country, managed and run by women. MWD provided a credit line of Rs 48 million to FWBL to finance small-scale credit schemes for disadvantaged women. The Social Action Programme launched in 1992/93 aimed at reducing gender disparities by improving women's access to social services.\n\nPakistan acceded to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) on 29 February 1996.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Pakistan and the CEDAW\n|url=http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/ministries/ContentInfo.jsp?MinID=17&cPath=182_413&ContentID=4068\n|publisher=Government of Pakistan, Ministry of Women Development\n|date=13 December 2006\n|accessdate=2007-01-07\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070303035614/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/ministries/ContentInfo.jsp?MinID=17&cPath=182_413&ContentID=4068 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 3 March 2007}}</ref> The Ministry of Women Development (MWD) is the designated national focal machinery for its implementation.

He had also held office for a truncated term (1990\u20131993), during which he had promised to adopt Islamic law as the supreme law of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1997, the Nawaz Sharif government formally enacted the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, which institutes [[shariah]]-based changes in Pakistan's criminal law. The ordinance had earlier been kept in force by invoking the president's power to re-issue it every four months.<ref name=\"crime_or_custom\"/>\n\nSharif then proposed a fifteenth amendment to the Constitution that would entirely replace the existing legal system with a comprehensive Islamic one and would override the \"constitution and any law or judgment of any court.\".<ref>Associated Press, \"Pakistan Proposes New Islamic Laws,\" 28 August 1998.</ref> The proposal was approved in the National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif's party has a commanding majority, but, it remained stalled in the Senate after facing strong opposition from women's groups, human rights activists, and opposition political parties.<ref>Associated Press, \"Pakistan Moves Closer to Islamic Rule,\" 9 October 1998.</ref>\n\nA 1997 ruling by the [[Lahore High Court]], in the highly publicised Saima Waheed case, upheld a woman's right to marry freely but called for amendments to the 1965 Family Laws, on the basis of Islamic norms, to enforce parental authority to discourage \"love marriages\".<ref name=\"crime_or_custom\"/>\n\nThe report of the Inquiry of the Commission for Women (1997) clearly stated that the Hudood legislation must be repealed as it discriminates against women and is in conflict with their fundamental rights. A similar commission during Benazir Bhutto's administration had also recommended amending certain aspects of Hudood Ordinance. However, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif implemented these recommendations.\n\nThe enhancement of women's status was stated as one of the 16 goals listed in the ''Pakistan 2010 Program'' (1997), a critical policy document. However, the document omits women while listing 21 major areas of interests. Similarly, another major policy document, the \"Human Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy\" (1999), mentioned women as a target group for poverty reduction but lacks gender framework.\n\nThe country's first all-women university, named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], was inaugurated on 6 August 1998.

The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult.  The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/> \nGirls of rural areas are facing many problems regarding their studies. There are several issues and causes of education problems for girls in rural areas of Pakistan.\nInaccessibility of education in Pakistan, especially in backward areas is a result of distance, child labor, scarcity of teachers, local leaders, frequent policy changes and fear of losing power. In KPK and Balochistan women are severely bound by cultural constraints and prejudices. They are involved in reproductive and productive and community work for 14 to 18 hours. Women which are the 51% on the country population, have been forced to just bear children for their husband and remain within their houses. In Balochistan, female literacy rate stands between 15 and 25%.\nIn backward areas, girls schools are far away from their homes, many families cannot afford traveling expenses for their children. Separate schools for girls are not available. Girls live in fear due to extremist policy. In KPK militant groups have blasted thousands of schools because they are against women education, they have given threats to several governments and private girls school for stopping girls education.<ref>https://nation.com.pk/21-Feb-2015/women-education-in-pakistan</ref>\n\nThis [[Feudalism in Pakistan|feudal system]] leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position.  The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role within the confines of the home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5\u201316 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2011).<ref name=\"nargis1\">{{cite web|last=Nargis|first=Sultana|title=Right to Education for Girls in Pakistan: Malala's Struggle Must Continue|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|accessdate=25 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517115947/http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|archive-date=17 May 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as [[acid throwing]] which many girls fall victim to for attending school.\n\n===Rural/urban divide and government policy===\nFemales are educated equally like Males in urban areas such as Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.

Women in urbanized districts typically lead more elite lifestyles and have more opportunities for education.  Rural and tribal areas of Pakistan have an increasingly high rate of poverty and alarmingly low literacy rates.  In 2002 it was recorded that 81.5 percent of 15- to 19-year-old girls from high-income families had attended school while 22.3 percent of girls from low-income families had ever attended school.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/>\n\nIn comparison, it was recorded that 96.6 percent of Pakistani boys ages 15\u201319 coming from high-income families had attended schooling while 66.1 percent of 15- to 19-year-old boys from low-income families had attended school.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/> Girls living in rural areas are encouraged not to go to school because they are needed in the home to do work at a young age.  In most rural villages, secondary schooling simply does not exist for girls, leaving them no choice but to prepare for marriage and do household tasks. These rural areas often have inadequate funding and schooling for girls is at the bottom of their priorities.\n\n===Employment===\nPakistan is a largely rural society (almost two thirds of the population lives in rural areas<ref name=CIA/>) and women are rarely formally employed.

The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male members of the family are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women\u2019s chances to compete for resources in the public arena.<ref name = Mariam/>\n\nThis situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships. However, the spread of [[patriarchy]] is not even. The nature and degree of women\u2019s subordination vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control over their lives.<ref name = Mariam/>\n\nAccording to Pakistani standards, 'good women' could be either educated or uneducated and are expected to be unselfish, calm, tolerant, empathetic, reliable, able to organize, compromise, coordinate and maintain hospitality within the house and in keeping good relationships.<ref name=TazGenderKar /> They are also expected to do household chores, care for her children, husband and in-laws and, when needed, provide the home with external income.<ref name=TazGenderKar>{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=Tazeen S|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pak0istan: a qualitative study|journal=Global Health Action|volume=4|pages=7448|pmc=3208374 |author2=Krantz, Gunilla; Gul, Raisa; Asad, Nargis; Johansson, Eva; Mogren, Ingrid|doi=10.3402/gha.v4i0.7448|pmid=22065609|date=2 November 2011}}</ref> Women are also expected to marry a man of their [[Arranged marriage|parent's choice]], follow Islam's code of dress<ref>{{cite web|title=How people in Muslim countries prefer women to dress in public|url=http://pewrsr.ch/KEyUvb|work=University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Social Research|publisher=Pew Research Centre}}</ref> and sacrifice their own dreams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pakistan: a qualitative study|url=http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/7448/13343#AF0002 |work=Global Health Action|publisher=Global Health Action|authors=Ali, T., Krantz, G., Gul, R., Asad, N., Johansson, E., Mogren, I.|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nIn a study carried out by [[Gallup Pakistan]], the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International, majority of the Pakistanis believe that both males and females have different roles to play in the society.

The r\u00e9gime took many steps toward institutional building for women's development, such as the establishment of the [[Women's Division]] in the Cabinet Secretariat, and the appointment of another commission on the Status of Women. A chapter on [[women in development]] was included for the first time in the Sixth Plan. The chapter was prepared by a working group of 28 professional women headed by [[Syeda Abida Hussain]], chairperson of the [[Jhang District]] council at that time. The main objective as stated in the Sixth Plan was \"to adopt an integrated approach to improve women's status\".<ref name=\"adb_wom_pak\"/> In 1981, General Zia-ul-Haq nominated the ''[[Majlis-e-Shoora]]'' (Federal Advisory Council) and inducted 20 women as members, however Majlis-e-Shoora had no power over the executive branch.<ref>F.

Shahida's first husband, Khushi Muhammad, had divorced her and the papers had been signed in front of a magistrate. The husband however, had not registered the divorce documents in the local council as required by law, rendering the divorce not legally binding. Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (''iddat''), remarried.

However, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif implemented these recommendations.\n\nThe enhancement of women's status was stated as one of the 16 goals listed in the ''Pakistan 2010 Program'' (1997), a critical policy document.

The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult.  The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/> \nGirls of rural areas are facing many problems regarding their studies. There are several issues and causes of education problems for girls in rural areas of Pakistan.\nInaccessibility of education in Pakistan, especially in backward areas is a result of distance, child labor, scarcity of teachers, local leaders, frequent policy changes and fear of losing power. In KPK and Balochistan women are severely bound by cultural constraints and prejudices. They are involved in reproductive and productive and community work for 14 to 18 hours. Women which are the 51% on the country population, have been forced to just bear children for their husband and remain within their houses. In Balochistan, female literacy rate stands between 15 and 25%.\nIn backward areas, girls schools are far away from their homes, many families cannot afford traveling expenses for their children. Separate schools for girls are not available. Girls live in fear due to extremist policy. In KPK militant groups have blasted thousands of schools because they are against women education, they have given threats to several governments and private girls school for stopping girls education.<ref>https://nation.com.pk/21-Feb-2015/women-education-in-pakistan</ref>\n\nThis [[Feudalism in Pakistan|feudal system]] leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position.  The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role within the confines of the home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5\u201316 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2011).<ref name=\"nargis1\">{{cite web|last=Nargis|first=Sultana|title=Right to Education for Girls in Pakistan: Malala's Struggle Must Continue|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|accessdate=25 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517115947/http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|archive-date=17 May 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as [[acid throwing]] which many girls fall victim to for attending school.\n\n===Rural/urban divide and government policy===\nFemales are educated equally like Males in urban areas such as Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi.

Women in urbanized districts typically lead more elite lifestyles and have more opportunities for education.  Rural and tribal areas of Pakistan have an increasingly high rate of poverty and alarmingly low literacy rates.  In 2002 it was recorded that 81.5 percent of 15- to 19-year-old girls from high-income families had attended school while 22.3 percent of girls from low-income families had ever attended school.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/>\n\nIn comparison, it was recorded that 96.6 percent of Pakistani boys ages 15\u201319 coming from high-income families had attended schooling while 66.1 percent of 15- to 19-year-old boys from low-income families had attended school.<ref name=\"lloyd105\"/> Girls living in rural areas are encouraged not to go to school because they are needed in the home to do work at a young age.  In most rural villages, secondary schooling simply does not exist for girls, leaving them no choice but to prepare for marriage and do household tasks. These rural areas often have inadequate funding and schooling for girls is at the bottom of their priorities.\n\n===Employment===\nPakistan is a largely rural society (almost two thirds of the population lives in rural areas<ref name=CIA/>) and women are rarely formally employed.

Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women\u2019s chances to compete for resources in the public arena.<ref name = Mariam/>\n\nThis situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships. However, the spread of [[patriarchy]] is not even. The nature and degree of women\u2019s subordination vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control over their lives.<ref name = Mariam/>\n\nAccording to Pakistani standards, 'good women' could be either educated or uneducated and are expected to be unselfish, calm, tolerant, empathetic, reliable, able to organize, compromise, coordinate and maintain hospitality within the house and in keeping good relationships.<ref name=TazGenderKar /> They are also expected to do household chores, care for her children, husband and in-laws and, when needed, provide the home with external income.<ref name=TazGenderKar>{{cite journal|last=Ali|first=Tazeen S|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pak0istan: a qualitative study|journal=Global Health Action|volume=4|pages=7448|pmc=3208374 |author2=Krantz, Gunilla; Gul, Raisa; Asad, Nargis; Johansson, Eva; Mogren, Ingrid|doi=10.3402/gha.v4i0.7448|pmid=22065609|date=2 November 2011}}</ref> Women are also expected to marry a man of their [[Arranged marriage|parent's choice]], follow Islam's code of dress<ref>{{cite web|title=How people in Muslim countries prefer women to dress in public|url=http://pewrsr.ch/KEyUvb|work=University of Michigan\u2019s Institute for Social Research|publisher=Pew Research Centre}}</ref> and sacrifice their own dreams.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pakistan: a qualitative study|url=http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/7448/13343#AF0002 |work=Global Health Action|publisher=Global Health Action|authors=Ali, T., Krantz, G., Gul, R., Asad, N., Johansson, E., Mogren, I.|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nIn a study carried out by [[Gallup Pakistan]], the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International, majority of the Pakistanis believe that both males and females have different roles to play in the society.

However, even as they were designed, they weren't suited for the needs of the Soviet Army as they lacked a roof (which was added in later versions designated BTR-152K and BTR-40B respectively). The low combat values of the [[BTR-152]] and [[BTR-40]] were exposed when the [[Egyptian Army]] used them during the [[Suez Crisis]]. This was one of the reasons why the new APC was developed.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\">Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata, Issue 41, pp 1, 2</ref>\n\nBetween 1956 and 1957, a decision was made to convert all rifle and mechanized divisions into motor rifle divisions and a requirement for a new transport vehicle was drawn up.\n[[File:ZiL-153 in Kubinka.JPG|thumb|left|ZiL-153 at the Kubinka Tank Museum.]]\nDevelopment proceeded along two paths: a more expensive vehicle that would eventually become the [[BMP-1]], for use in tank divisions, and a cheaper vehicle for use in motor rifle divisions, that would eventually become the BTR-60. Two design bureaus were given the requirements, GAZ led by V. A. Dedkov,<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\">[http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37 Pancerni 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002215227/http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37 |date=2 October 2011 }}. Pancerni.abajt.pl. Retrieved on 21 September 2011.</ref> and ZiL led by Rodionov and Orlov. The requirements stated that the vehicle should have all wheel drive, at least two turnable axles, independent suspension as well as mobility and fording capabilities allowing it to operate alongside tanks. The vehicle was also supposed to be amphibious.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The GAZ design team started to work on the new APC during the winter of 1956. Despite the fact that the army wanted a fully roofed vehicle with NBC protection system, the GAZ design did not have those features. It was argued that firing from the cramped interior would be difficult and that the limitation of losses wasn't a priority.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The prototype was built between 1957 and 1958.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/> ZiL developed a 6x6 design, the ZiL-153, similar in hull shape to the GAZ design. There were also three other 8x8 prototypes: Ob'yekt 560 (also known as MMZ-560<ref name=\"JED Ob'yekt\">[http://www.jedsite.info/misc/oscar/obyekt_series/obyekt-series.html JED Ob'yekt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616194552/http://www.jedsite.info/misc/oscar/obyekt_series/obyekt-series.html |date=16 June 2008 }}. Jedsite.info.

All prototypes were submitted to and passed state trials in 1959. Even though the Ob'yekt 1015B performed best, the GAZ design was selected and given the designation BTR-60P.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/> Officially, the committee that made the decision did so because of the GAZ plant's production capabilities and experience. The main reason was that the GAZ design was the simplest and cheapest one and introduced the fewest technological advancements, which made it easier to put into mass production.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/>\n\nBTR-60P had open-roofed crew and troop compartments, which was deemed to be a serious disadvantage. Accordingly, a new version with an armoured roof, designated BTR-60PA, entered production in 1963. This new version's capacity was reduced from 16 soldiers to 14 soldiers.\n\nThe appearance of the German [[HS.30]] APC, which was armed with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon, prompted the addition of the conical BPU-1 turret. This turret, which was originally developed for the [[BRDM-2]] amphibious armoured scout car, was armed with the KPVT 14.5&nbsp;mm heavy machine gun and a PKT 7.62&nbsp;mm tank machine gun. The new vehicle was designated the BTR-60PAI and entered production in 1965. It was, however, quickly replaced by the BTR-60PB, which had a better sighting system for the machine guns.\n\n==Description==\nBTR-60 was a revolutionary design for its time.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 2\">[http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37&limit=1&limitstart=1 Pancerni 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002215234/http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37&limit=1&limitstart=1 |date=2 October 2011 }}. Pancerni.abajt.pl. Retrieved on 21 September 2011.</ref> It had a non-standard layout for an [[Armoured personnel carrier|APC]]; the crew compartment was in the front, the troop compartment in the middle and the engine compartment in the rear.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/> This meant that, while the BTR-60 did not share some of the weaknesses that other APCs had, it had several disadvantages of its own.\n\n===Crew===\n[[File:Inside a BTR-60B.JPEG|thumb|right|The driver's station.]]\n\nIn the BTR-60, the crew compartment is located in the front of the vehicle and had a roof \u2013 unlike the troop compartment, which first received one with the introduction of the BTR-60PA. In the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, the crew consists of a driver and a commander. The driver's seat is on the left and commander's seat is on the right. In the BTR-60PAI, BTR-60PB and BTR-60PZ, the crew consists of a driver, a commander and a gunner. The position of the driver and commander stations remained unchanged in later models. The gunner operates the BPU-1 turret, using the PP-61A optical sight. In the BTR-60P, both the driver and commander manned their positions by entering the vehicle through the sides. The BTR-60PA introduced two hatches over their stations and crew members had to climb on top of the vehicle to use them. The entry method did not change in later production models. The BTR-60B introduced a side door for the gunner on the right side, and firing ports for both the driver and commander, and two for the gunner, one on each side. (For more information on the BTR-60's firing port see the [[BTR-60#Troop compartment|troop compartment section]]). Both the driver and the commander have forward views through bulletproof windshields, onto which steel covers can be lowered. In the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, the covers had vision slots, and additional slots on both sides of the crew compartment. These were removed in the BTR-60PB in favor of two periscopes on each side.{{clarify|date=May 2014|reason=Unclear whether this means: i) 2 periscopes, 1 per side; or ii) 4 periscopes, 2 per side}} In early models of the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, only the driver had a periscope<!--my guess at the missing word-->, while the commander had a removable OU-3 infrared searchlight. In the BTR-60PB, both the driver and the commander have three periscopes in the front (the commander's center periscope can be hard to see as it's just below the OU-3 infrared light). The vehicle was usually equipped with an R-113 radio; however, some models used the [[R-123]]. The initial BTR-60P production model lacked night-vision and had only four headlights (two infrared, two white, one of each kind per side, these remained in all BTR-60 models). Late BTR-60P models were fitted with night-vision; the TKN-1 connected with the OU-3 infrared searchlight for the commander and the TWN-2 for the driver. This remained unchanged in later models.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/>\n\n===Troop compartment===\nThe troop compartment is behind the crew compartment and in front of the engine compartment. The BTR-60P can transport up to 16 fully equipped soldiers. This number reduced to 14 in BTR-60PB. As the BTR-60P didn't have a roof, it was covered with a tarpaulin when traveling in bad weather conditions. It was also covered with bows and canvas. Also, all BTR-60 models had three firing ports on each upper side of the hull through which the infantry being transported could fire at the enemy with their personal weapons. The difference between models was in the position of these three firing ports. The BTR-60P and BTR-60PA had the firing ports positioned in a row between the middle and the front part of the troop compartment. In the BTR-60PB, the firing ports were relocated; one was next to the driver and commander, one next to the gunner and one in the side of the troop compartment.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"softland 1\"/>\n\nBecause of the engine placement (in the rear of the vehicle), transported infantry must mount and dismount through the sides in the BTR-60P or through the roof hatches in the roofed BTR-60PA, BTR-60PB, and BTR-60PZ variants. To help the infantry to mount and dismount the vehicle, the BTR-60P had two steps on each side of the hull, one between the first and second pair of road wheels and the other between the third and fourth pair of wheels. It also had two vertical hand rails on each side of the troop compartment, as well as an angled horizontal one on the left-hand side of the hull next to the engine compartment. The BTR-60PA introduced yet another step on each side of the hull between the second and third pair of wheels, as well as six horizontal hand rails on each side of the vehicle, three on the lower side and three on the upper side. The vertical ones were removed, while yet another angled horizontal one was added on the right-hand side of the hull next to the engine compartment. In the BTR-60PB, the number of hand rails decreased from six to five on each side of the hull; the rear upper hand rail was removed from he right side, whereas the center upper one was removed from the left side. The BTR-60P has two doors on each side of the troop compartment (one in the front and one in the rear), but infantry still had to dismount through the sides.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The side doors were removed in the BTR-60PA.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/> They were used mostly as emergency exits and as auxiliary firing ports. In the BTR-60PB, a side door was added on the front left of the troop compartment.\n\n===Protection===\nThe hull armour is made from welded steel and provides protection against [[small arms]] fire and [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]].<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\" /><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /> The frontal armour can withstand 7.62&nbsp;mm bullets from any range. The rest of the armour can withstand 7.62&nbsp;mm bullets from a range of 100&nbsp;m.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" />\n\nThe BTR-60P did not have a roof over the troop compartment, which made a weakness that could easily be exploited\u2014even the simplest explosives could take out a BTR-60P. The new BTR design with a roof was called the BTR-60PA.\n\nArmour thickness is as follows:\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\nHull:\n\n* Upper front: 7&nbsp;mm at 86\u00b0<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Lower front: 9&nbsp;mm at 47\u00b0<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Sides: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Upper rear: 5&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Lower rear: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Floor: 5&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Roof: 7&nbsp;mm (over the troop compartment since BTR-60PA)<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\nTurret (since BTR-60PAI):\n\n* Front: 10&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"FAS\" />\n* Sides: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Rear: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Roof: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n|}\n\n===Maneuverability===\nThe BTR-60 has a 8x8 suspension. Originally, there were difficulties in finding a suitable engine for it: the six-cylinder GAZ-40P gasoline engine, which produces 90&nbsp;hp, had insufficient power, while the 205-hp YaAZ-206B was too heavy. Instead, the BTR was fitted with two six-cylinder gasoline GAZ-40P<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> engines (67&nbsp;kW)<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 2\"/><ref name=\"opfor\"/><ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/> located side by side in the rear of the vehicle. The combined power of the engines is 180&nbsp;hp (134&nbsp;kW). Each engine propels two of the vehicle's axles. The engine on the right propels the second and the fourth axles, while the one on the left propels the first and the third axles. Each engine has its own four-speed [[gear box]] with a single-shielded hydraulically controlled [[clutch]] and an exhaust. Each axle has its own [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and is hung on transversal torsion bars. The first two axles each have two hydraulic absorbers, while the third and fourth only have one. The first and second pair of wheels can be turned. The gaps between the first and second axles and between the third and fourth axles are even. The gap between the second and third axles is slightly larger than the other ones.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\"/><ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\nThe two-engines setup has an advantage in the fact that each engine could work without the other. This means that if one engine is disabled, it does not affect the other one and the vehicle can still move, albeit with reduced speed. This setup, however, caused several problems that either do not exist in single-engined vehicles or were not as serious: the design itself was complicated and the amount of work that had to be done during exploitation and repair was higher than in vehicles with a single engine. The engines themselves were originally intended for truck use, which meant that they were working in extreme conditions not originally envisioned for them. Because of this, engine breakdowns were frequent. The vehicle also used large amounts of fuel and caught fire easily. Despite all this, the two-engines setup was used in all BTR-60 production models as well as most variants of the [[BTR-70]].

Both the BTR-60PA and BTR-60PA-1 were produced until 1966.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The BTR-60PAI also entered production in 1965,<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> but was quickly replaced in 1966 by the BTR-60PB, which had a better sighting system for the machine guns. The BTR-60PB remained in production until 1976, when it was superseded by the [[BTR-70]].<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> According to Western estimates, around 25,000 BTR-60''s'' were produced by GAZ.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 4\"/> During BTR-80 production, and therefore after BTR-60 production had ended, there was a special production run of 100 BTR-60PB''s'', some of which have been exported to Iraq.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\n==Service history==\n===Soviet Union===\nAn order to enter the BTR-60P into Soviet Army service was issued on 13 December 1959. However, production did not start until 1960.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The first BTR-60P''s'' were delivered in 1960. It first entered service with the [[Soviet Army]] and later the Soviet naval infantry. The BTR-60 entered service with the Soviet military at the time when the USSR was arming on a mass scale.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> In the early 1960s, it replaced the BTR-152 in the role of the basic APC. The BTR-60P was first seen by the West in 1961. The BTR-60PA entered service with the Soviet Army in 1963, the BTR-60PA-1 and BTR-60PAI entered service in 1965, the BTR-60PB in 1966, the BTR-60PZ in 1972 and the BTR-60PBK in 1975. As newer models of the BTR-60 appeared, the older ones were gradually withdrawn from front-line service. A number of old BTR-60P''s'' were converted into repair vehicles.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\nThe first use of Soviet BTR-60''s'' during a conflict happened during the Warsaw Pact [[1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

The frontier units operating on the island were equipped with BTR-60PB''s'', while the 57th border detachment group was equipped with BTR-50P''s'' and BTR-50PK''s''. The BTR-60 proved to be a good vehicle, although it sustained high losses due to the large number of RPGs used by the Chinese and mistakes made by the commanders of the APCs, which originated from the low amount of experience in combat use of the new vehicles.<ref name=\"Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 p. 32\">{{cite book |last1= Baryatinsky |first1= M. |title= Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 (literally: Domestic wheeled BTR-60 BTR-70 BTR-80) |series= Bronekollektsiya |volume= special issue no. 11 |year= 2007 |publisher= Modelist-konstruktor |language=Russian | page = 32  }}</ref>\nThe high losses due to RPG hits wasn't unexpected, as the BTR-60's armour was designed to protect the vehicle from small arms fire and shrapnel, and not specialized anti-tank weapons.

The [[BMP-1]], the world's first mass-produced [[infantry fighting vehicle]], started production in 1966 and therefore Soviet Army had very small numbers of those vehicles available at the time of Sino-Soviet border conflict.

This was because the units that were originally used for this operation weren't the top priority of the Soviet military, which prioritized the units stationed in East Germany. The same design flaws were present during this conflict and the vehicle became even more vulnerable due to the kind of fighting that took place in Afghanistan. The GAZ-40P gasoline engines experienced frequent power losses and overheating due to the tropical highland climate for which they were not well suited. Also, the BTR-60PB's turret could not elevate its armament high enough to fire at the Mujahideen attacking from high ground. Like during the Sino-Soviet border conflict, many BTR-60PBs fell victim to RPGs. Because of those drawbacks, the BTR-60PBs were replaced by BTR-70s as soon as possible to a point where only the BTR-60 command variants were used.<ref name=\"Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 p. 34\"/>\n\n====Other operational use====\nSoviet BTR-60''s'', BTR-70''s'' and BTR-80''s'' were used for dispersing the demonstrations in [[Tbilisi]] in 1989 and stopping the fighting on the border between [[Uzbek SSR]] and [[Kirghiz SSR]].

This was because Policja, unlike MO, didn't have a need for weaponry with such a high muzzle velocity \u2013 such weapons were dangerous to use in urban areas. The MO needed such weaponry because it was also supposed to carry out anti-partisan operations. Policja used unarmed BTR-60PB''s'' for security during [[European Economy Summit 2004]] in [[Warsaw]], as well as for clearing blockades set up by the [[Samoobrona]] political party.

The program was completed in the late 1970s. However, the vehicle did not enter service in large numbers because the PRC's primitive road system and rugged terrain meant that the wheeled APC was not well suited for the Chinese conditions as it lacked the cross country capability of the tracked APCs in the Chinese inventory.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> It should be noted though that, before the [[Sino-Soviet split]], the PRC imported 100 BTR-40''s'' and 100 BTR-152''s'' from the USSR and manufactured copies of those vehicles; and these served with the PLA until the mid-1990s.<ref name=\"SIPRI\"/><ref name=\"Global Security PRC\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/pla-inventory.htm People's Liberation Army] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910165811/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/pla-inventory.htm |date=10 September 2009 }}.

Adding a bolted on superstructure with two hatches in its front, going all the way from the front hatches to the engine compartment which is necessary to adapt the vehicle to the new systems and parts (The engine compartment now externally resembles the one Russian MWS however it does not have a service hatch in the back and is angled near the top, also it too has rear lights mounted on both sides of the engine compartment although the lights themselves are different.). Sand blasting and repainting the hull. Resembling the vehicle with new and improved systems and parts as well as installing a new split transfer box that includes a limited split differential and a monitoring system allowing driving in rough terrain and improving the cross-country capabilities. Replacing the two GAZ-40P petrol engines with a single Caterpillar diesel engine developing 300&nbsp;hp. Fitting a number of new parts for the new engine including a clutch system, split gear case, axillary engine systems, cooling systems, air inlet system, exhaust system. Converting and adapting a new fuel system for the diesel engine and integrating new and bigger fuel tanks to increase the maximum operational range. Installing a new and advanced electrical system including an advance control panel as well as replacement of all internal and external lighting. Increasing the driver's field of view by installing a rear view camera with an LCD screen. Improving the man-machine interface. The vehicle is armed with a pintle-mounted [[M2 machine gun|M2]] heavy machine gun in the front and a second machine gun of a smaller caliber mounted on a \"ring\" in the rear. The rear machine gun is controlled from the inside, uses the \"ring\" to move and can rotate a full 360\u00b0. The vehicle also has two whip antennas in the front part of the superstructure. The modernization can also be applied to the [[BTR-70]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SBe6Ulq7rw Saymar'&#39;s'&#39; BTR-60 and BTR-70 modernization program promotional video] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418125450/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SBe6Ulq7rw |date=18 April 2017 }}.

However, even as they were designed, they weren't suited for the needs of the Soviet Army as they lacked a roof (which was added in later versions designated BTR-152K and BTR-40B respectively). The low combat values of the [[BTR-152]] and [[BTR-40]] were exposed when the [[Egyptian Army]] used them during the [[Suez Crisis]]. This was one of the reasons why the new APC was developed.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\">Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata, Issue 41, pp 1, 2</ref>\n\nBetween 1956 and 1957, a decision was made to convert all rifle and mechanized divisions into motor rifle divisions and a requirement for a new transport vehicle was drawn up.\n[[File:ZiL-153 in Kubinka.JPG|thumb|left|ZiL-153 at the Kubinka Tank Museum.]]\nDevelopment proceeded along two paths: a more expensive vehicle that would eventually become the [[BMP-1]], for use in tank divisions, and a cheaper vehicle for use in motor rifle divisions, that would eventually become the BTR-60. Two design bureaus were given the requirements, GAZ led by V. A. Dedkov,<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\">[http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37 Pancerni 1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002215227/http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37 |date=2 October 2011 }}.

The requirements stated that the vehicle should have all wheel drive, at least two turnable axles, independent suspension as well as mobility and fording capabilities allowing it to operate alongside tanks. The vehicle was also supposed to be amphibious.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The GAZ design team started to work on the new APC during the winter of 1956. Despite the fact that the army wanted a fully roofed vehicle with NBC protection system, the GAZ design did not have those features. It was argued that firing from the cramped interior would be difficult and that the limitation of losses wasn't a priority.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The prototype was built between 1957 and 1958.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/> ZiL developed a 6x6 design, the ZiL-153, similar in hull shape to the GAZ design. There were also three other 8x8 prototypes: Ob'yekt 560 (also known as MMZ-560<ref name=\"JED Ob'yekt\">[http://www.jedsite.info/misc/oscar/obyekt_series/obyekt-series.html JED Ob'yekt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616194552/http://www.jedsite.info/misc/oscar/obyekt_series/obyekt-series.html |date=16 June 2008 }}.

All prototypes were submitted to and passed state trials in 1959. Even though the Ob'yekt 1015B performed best, the GAZ design was selected and given the designation BTR-60P.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/> Officially, the committee that made the decision did so because of the GAZ plant's production capabilities and experience. The main reason was that the GAZ design was the simplest and cheapest one and introduced the fewest technological advancements, which made it easier to put into mass production.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/>\n\nBTR-60P had open-roofed crew and troop compartments, which was deemed to be a serious disadvantage. Accordingly, a new version with an armoured roof, designated BTR-60PA, entered production in 1963. This new version's capacity was reduced from 16 soldiers to 14 soldiers.\n\nThe appearance of the German [[HS.30]] APC, which was armed with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon, prompted the addition of the conical BPU-1 turret. This turret, which was originally developed for the [[BRDM-2]] amphibious armoured scout car, was armed with the KPVT 14.5&nbsp;mm heavy machine gun and a PKT 7.62&nbsp;mm tank machine gun. The new vehicle was designated the BTR-60PAI and entered production in 1965. It was, however, quickly replaced by the BTR-60PB, which had a better sighting system for the machine guns.\n\n==Description==\nBTR-60 was a revolutionary design for its time.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 2\">[http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37&limit=1&limitstart=1 Pancerni 2] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002215234/http://www.pancerni.abajt.pl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37&limit=1&limitstart=1 |date=2 October 2011 }}.

In the BTR-60PAI, BTR-60PB and BTR-60PZ, the crew consists of a driver, a commander and a gunner. The position of the driver and commander stations remained unchanged in later models. The gunner operates the BPU-1 turret, using the PP-61A optical sight. In the BTR-60P, both the driver and commander manned their positions by entering the vehicle through the sides. The BTR-60PA introduced two hatches over their stations and crew members had to climb on top of the vehicle to use them. The entry method did not change in later production models. The BTR-60B introduced a side door for the gunner on the right side, and firing ports for both the driver and commander, and two for the gunner, one on each side. (For more information on the BTR-60's firing port see the [[BTR-60#Troop compartment|troop compartment section]]). Both the driver and the commander have forward views through bulletproof windshields, onto which steel covers can be lowered. In the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, the covers had vision slots, and additional slots on both sides of the crew compartment. These were removed in the BTR-60PB in favor of two periscopes on each side.{{clarify|date=May 2014|reason=Unclear whether this means: i) 2 periscopes, 1 per side; or ii) 4 periscopes, 2 per side}} In early models of the BTR-60P and BTR-60PA, only the driver had a periscope<!--my guess at the missing word-->, while the commander had a removable OU-3 infrared searchlight. In the BTR-60PB, both the driver and the commander have three periscopes in the front (the commander's center periscope can be hard to see as it's just below the OU-3 infrared light). The vehicle was usually equipped with an R-113 radio; however, some models used the [[R-123]]. The initial BTR-60P production model lacked night-vision and had only four headlights (two infrared, two white, one of each kind per side, these remained in all BTR-60 models). Late BTR-60P models were fitted with night-vision; the TKN-1 connected with the OU-3 infrared searchlight for the commander and the TWN-2 for the driver. This remained unchanged in later models.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/>\n\n===Troop compartment===\nThe troop compartment is behind the crew compartment and in front of the engine compartment. The BTR-60P can transport up to 16 fully equipped soldiers. This number reduced to 14 in BTR-60PB. As the BTR-60P didn't have a roof, it was covered with a tarpaulin when traveling in bad weather conditions. It was also covered with bows and canvas. Also, all BTR-60 models had three firing ports on each upper side of the hull through which the infantry being transported could fire at the enemy with their personal weapons. The difference between models was in the position of these three firing ports. The BTR-60P and BTR-60PA had the firing ports positioned in a row between the middle and the front part of the troop compartment. In the BTR-60PB, the firing ports were relocated; one was next to the driver and commander, one next to the gunner and one in the side of the troop compartment.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"softland 1\"/>\n\nBecause of the engine placement (in the rear of the vehicle), transported infantry must mount and dismount through the sides in the BTR-60P or through the roof hatches in the roofed BTR-60PA, BTR-60PB, and BTR-60PZ variants. To help the infantry to mount and dismount the vehicle, the BTR-60P had two steps on each side of the hull, one between the first and second pair of road wheels and the other between the third and fourth pair of wheels. It also had two vertical hand rails on each side of the troop compartment, as well as an angled horizontal one on the left-hand side of the hull next to the engine compartment. The BTR-60PA introduced yet another step on each side of the hull between the second and third pair of wheels, as well as six horizontal hand rails on each side of the vehicle, three on the lower side and three on the upper side. The vertical ones were removed, while yet another angled horizontal one was added on the right-hand side of the hull next to the engine compartment. In the BTR-60PB, the number of hand rails decreased from six to five on each side of the hull; the rear upper hand rail was removed from he right side, whereas the center upper one was removed from the left side. The BTR-60P has two doors on each side of the troop compartment (one in the front and one in the rear), but infantry still had to dismount through the sides.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The side doors were removed in the BTR-60PA.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/> They were used mostly as emergency exits and as auxiliary firing ports. In the BTR-60PB, a side door was added on the front left of the troop compartment.\n\n===Protection===\nThe hull armour is made from welded steel and provides protection against [[small arms]] fire and [[Shrapnel (fragment)|shrapnel]].<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\" /><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /> The frontal armour can withstand 7.62&nbsp;mm bullets from any range. The rest of the armour can withstand 7.62&nbsp;mm bullets from a range of 100&nbsp;m.<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" />\n\nThe BTR-60P did not have a roof over the troop compartment, which made a weakness that could easily be exploited\u2014even the simplest explosives could take out a BTR-60P. The new BTR design with a roof was called the BTR-60PA.\n\nArmour thickness is as follows:\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:25%;\"|\nHull:\n\n* Upper front: 7&nbsp;mm at 86\u00b0<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Lower front: 9&nbsp;mm at 47\u00b0<ref name=\"Pancerni 1\" /><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Sides: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Upper rear: 5&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Lower rear: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Floor: 5&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Roof: 7&nbsp;mm (over the troop compartment since BTR-60PA)<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n| style=\"vertical-align:top; width:50%;\"|\nTurret (since BTR-60PAI):\n\n* Front: 10&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"FAS\" />\n* Sides: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Rear: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n* Roof: 7&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\" />\n|}\n\n===Maneuverability===\nThe BTR-60 has a 8x8 suspension. Originally, there were difficulties in finding a suitable engine for it: the six-cylinder GAZ-40P gasoline engine, which produces 90&nbsp;hp, had insufficient power, while the 205-hp YaAZ-206B was too heavy. Instead, the BTR was fitted with two six-cylinder gasoline GAZ-40P<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> engines (67&nbsp;kW)<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 2\"/><ref name=\"opfor\"/><ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/> located side by side in the rear of the vehicle. The combined power of the engines is 180&nbsp;hp (134&nbsp;kW). Each engine propels two of the vehicle's axles. The engine on the right propels the second and the fourth axles, while the one on the left propels the first and the third axles. Each engine has its own four-speed [[gear box]] with a single-shielded hydraulically controlled [[clutch]] and an exhaust. Each axle has its own [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] and is hung on transversal torsion bars. The first two axles each have two hydraulic absorbers, while the third and fourth only have one. The first and second pair of wheels can be turned. The gaps between the first and second axles and between the third and fourth axles are even. The gap between the second and third axles is slightly larger than the other ones.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"Pancerni 1\"/><ref name=\"Gary's Combat Vehicle Reference Guide\"/><ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\nThe two-engines setup has an advantage in the fact that each engine could work without the other. This means that if one engine is disabled, it does not affect the other one and the vehicle can still move, albeit with reduced speed. This setup, however, caused several problems that either do not exist in single-engined vehicles or were not as serious: the design itself was complicated and the amount of work that had to be done during exploitation and repair was higher than in vehicles with a single engine. The engines themselves were originally intended for truck use, which meant that they were working in extreme conditions not originally envisioned for them. Because of this, engine breakdowns were frequent. The vehicle also used large amounts of fuel and caught fire easily. Despite all this, the two-engines setup was used in all BTR-60 production models as well as most variants of the [[BTR-70]]. The single-engine setup was introduced in the BTR-80.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/>\n\n[[File:BTR-60-latrun-4.jpg|thumb|right|Ex-Egyptian or ex-Syrian BTR-60PB, in the Yad la-Shiryon museum, Israel, 2005.

The BTR-60P was produced between 1960 and 1963.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The BTR-60PA entered production in 1963,<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/><ref name=\"opfor\"/> followed by the BTR-60PA-1 in 1965. Both the BTR-60PA and BTR-60PA-1 were produced until 1966.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The BTR-60PAI also entered production in 1965,<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> but was quickly replaced in 1966 by the BTR-60PB, which had a better sighting system for the machine guns. The BTR-60PB remained in production until 1976, when it was superseded by the [[BTR-70]].<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> According to Western estimates, around 25,000 BTR-60''s'' were produced by GAZ.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 4\"/> During BTR-80 production, and therefore after BTR-60 production had ended, there was a special production run of 100 BTR-60PB''s'', some of which have been exported to Iraq.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\n==Service history==\n===Soviet Union===\nAn order to enter the BTR-60P into Soviet Army service was issued on 13 December 1959. However, production did not start until 1960.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> The first BTR-60P''s'' were delivered in 1960. It first entered service with the [[Soviet Army]] and later the Soviet naval infantry. The BTR-60 entered service with the Soviet military at the time when the USSR was arming on a mass scale.<ref name=\"Czo\u0142gi \u015awiata 1\"/> In the early 1960s, it replaced the BTR-152 in the role of the basic APC. The BTR-60P was first seen by the West in 1961. The BTR-60PA entered service with the Soviet Army in 1963, the BTR-60PA-1 and BTR-60PAI entered service in 1965, the BTR-60PB in 1966, the BTR-60PZ in 1972 and the BTR-60PBK in 1975. As newer models of the BTR-60 appeared, the older ones were gradually withdrawn from front-line service. A number of old BTR-60P''s'' were converted into repair vehicles.<ref name=\"JED The Military Equipment Directory\"/>\n\nThe first use of Soviet BTR-60''s'' during a conflict happened during the Warsaw Pact [[1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

The frontier units operating on the island were equipped with BTR-60PB''s'', while the 57th border detachment group was equipped with BTR-50P''s'' and BTR-50PK''s''. The BTR-60 proved to be a good vehicle, although it sustained high losses due to the large number of RPGs used by the Chinese and mistakes made by the commanders of the APCs, which originated from the low amount of experience in combat use of the new vehicles.<ref name=\"Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 p. 32\">{{cite book |last1= Baryatinsky |first1= M. |title= Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 (literally: Domestic wheeled BTR-60 BTR-70 BTR-80) |series= Bronekollektsiya |volume= special issue no. 11 |year= 2007 |publisher= Modelist-konstruktor |language=Russian | page = 32  }}</ref>\nThe high losses due to RPG hits wasn't unexpected, as the BTR-60's armour was designed to protect the vehicle from small arms fire and shrapnel, and not specialized anti-tank weapons. The most effective tactic found for using BTR-60PB''s'' was in covering the dismounted infantry.<ref name=\"Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 p. 32\"/> This is a job more suited for infantry fighting vehicles than armoured personnel carriers, whose main role is transporting infantry to the battlefield and providing them with armour protection during that time. The [[BMP-1]], the world's first mass-produced [[infantry fighting vehicle]], started production in 1966 and therefore Soviet Army had very small numbers of those vehicles available at the time of Sino-Soviet border conflict.

This was because the units that were originally used for this operation weren't the top priority of the Soviet military, which prioritized the units stationed in East Germany. The same design flaws were present during this conflict and the vehicle became even more vulnerable due to the kind of fighting that took place in Afghanistan. The GAZ-40P gasoline engines experienced frequent power losses and overheating due to the tropical highland climate for which they were not well suited. Also, the BTR-60PB's turret could not elevate its armament high enough to fire at the Mujahideen attacking from high ground. Like during the Sino-Soviet border conflict, many BTR-60PBs fell victim to RPGs. Because of those drawbacks, the BTR-60PBs were replaced by BTR-70s as soon as possible to a point where only the BTR-60 command variants were used.<ref name=\"Otechestvennye koljosnye bronetransportjory BTR-60, BTR-70, BTR-80 p. 34\"/>\n\n====Other operational use====\nSoviet BTR-60''s'', BTR-70''s'' and BTR-80''s'' were used for dispersing the demonstrations in [[Tbilisi]] in 1989 and stopping the fighting on the border between [[Uzbek SSR]] and [[Kirghiz SSR]].

Adding a bolted on superstructure with two hatches in its front, going all the way from the front hatches to the engine compartment which is necessary to adapt the vehicle to the new systems and parts (The engine compartment now externally resembles the one Russian MWS however it does not have a service hatch in the back and is angled near the top, also it too has rear lights mounted on both sides of the engine compartment although the lights themselves are different.). Sand blasting and repainting the hull. Resembling the vehicle with new and improved systems and parts as well as installing a new split transfer box that includes a limited split differential and a monitoring system allowing driving in rough terrain and improving the cross-country capabilities. Replacing the two GAZ-40P petrol engines with a single Caterpillar diesel engine developing 300&nbsp;hp. Fitting a number of new parts for the new engine including a clutch system, split gear case, axillary engine systems, cooling systems, air inlet system, exhaust system. Converting and adapting a new fuel system for the diesel engine and integrating new and bigger fuel tanks to increase the maximum operational range. Installing a new and advanced electrical system including an advance control panel as well as replacement of all internal and external lighting. Increasing the driver's field of view by installing a rear view camera with an LCD screen. Improving the man-machine interface. The vehicle is armed with a pintle-mounted [[M2 machine gun|M2]] heavy machine gun in the front and a second machine gun of a smaller caliber mounted on a \"ring\" in the rear. The rear machine gun is controlled from the inside, uses the \"ring\" to move and can rotate a full 360\u00b0. The vehicle also has two whip antennas in the front part of the superstructure.

At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father.

After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealled it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and the Germans released them. However, the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided it was time they fled Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>  \n\n===Car journey===\nBritish Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them a few days later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained pictures of the German military buildup near the Soviet Union's border and signalled to the British that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could hardly believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continue on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gizyeki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded him to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance in Budapest. Kowerski and Skarbek then continued their journey in the Opel through Syria and Lebanon which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek persuaded the Vichy Embassy officials to give them visas. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs.

I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M.

Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol.

Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Krystyna, their second child, took after her father and his liking for riding horses, which she sat astride rather than [[side-saddle]] as was usual for women. She also became an expert skier during visits to [[Zakopane]] in the [[Tatra mountains]] of southern Poland. From the start, there was a complete rapport between father and daughter, who needed little encouragement to become a [[tomboy]].<ref>M.

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a [[Fiat Automobiles|Fiat]] car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead as much of an open-air life as she could. She began spending a great deal of time hiking and skiing the Tatra Mountains.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 20\u201321.</ref>\n\nOn 21 April 1930, Krystyna married a young businessman, Gustaw Gettlich at the Spiritual Seminary Church in Warsaw. They proved incompatible, and the marriage soon ended without rancour. A subsequent love affair came to naught when the young man's mother refused to consider the penniless divorc\u00e9e as a potential daughter-in-law.<ref>M.

Her rescuer was Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, a brilliant, moody, irascible eccentric, who came from a wealthy family in [[Kamieniec Podolski]] (formerly Poland, at the time Soviet Union). At fourteen, he had quarrelled with his father, run away from home, and worked in the United States as a cowboy and gold prospector. He eventually became an author and travelled the world in search of material for his books and articles. He knew Africa well and hoped one day to return there.<ref name=\"Christine p. 24\">M.

The British authorities showed little interest but were eventually convinced by Skarbek's acquaintances, including journalist [[Frederick Augustus Voigt]], who introduced her to the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS). The first SIS mention of her was in December 1939.

At a Warsaw caf\u00e9, she was hailed by a woman acquaintance: \"Krystyna! Krystyna Skarbek! What are you doing here? We heard that you'd gone abroad!\" When Skarbek denied that her name was Krystyna Skarbek, the lady answered that she would have ''sworn'' she was Krystyna Skarbek; the resemblance was positively uncanny! After the woman left, Skarbek, to minimise suspicion, tarried a while before leaving the caf\u00e9.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 950.</ref>\n\nIn Hungary, Skarbek met a Polish army officer, [[Andrzej Kowerski]] (1912\u20131988), who later used the British ''nom de guerre'' \"Andrew Kennedy\". Skarbek had first met him as a child and briefly encountered him again before the war at Zakopane. Kowerski, who had lost part of his leg in a pre-war hunting accident, was now [[exfil]]trating Polish and other Allied military personnel and collecting [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]].\nSkarbek helped organise a system of Polish couriers who brought intelligence reports from Warsaw to Budapest. Kowerski (Kennedy)'s cousin, Ludwik Popiel, managed to smuggle out a unique Polish [[anti-tank rifle, model 35]], with the stock and barrel sawn off for easier transport. Skarbek, for a time, concealled it in her [[Budapest]] apartment. However, it never saw wartime service with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], as the designs and specifications had deliberately been destroyed upon the outbreak of war and there was no time for [[reverse engineering]]. Captured stocks of the rifle were, however, used by the Germans and the Italians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |title=WW II German Infantry Anti-Tank Weapons |accessdate=27 October 2009 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027135457/http://geocities.com/Augusta/8172/panzerfaust6.htm |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the request of MI6, she and Kowerski organised surveillance of all the rail, road and river traffic on the borders with Romania and Germany.

In Budapest, in January 1941, she showed her penchant for stratagem when she and Kowerski were arrested by the Hungarian police and imprisoned and questioned by the [[Gestapo]]. She feigned symptoms of pulmonary [[tuberculosis]] by biting her tongue until it bled and the Germans released them. However, the couple was followed by the police afterwards and they decided it was time they fled Hungary, a German ally.<ref>Mulley, pp. 96-99</ref>  \n\n===Car journey===\nBritish Ambassador in Hungary, [[Owen O'Malley]], undertook to help Skarbek and Kowerski escape Hungary. He issued British passports to them.  Kowerski became \"Anthony Kennedy\" and Skarbek became \"Christine Granville\" a name she used for the rest of her life.  She also shaved seven years off her age. Her passport gave her birth date as 1915. A British Embassy driver smuggled Skarbek out of Hungary and into [[Yugoslavia]] in the trunk of O'Malley's [[Chrysler]].  Kowerski aka Kennedy drove his [[Opel]] across the border. The couple reunited in Yugoslavia and O'Malley joined them a few days later in [[Belgrade]] where they enjoyed a few days of \"drinking champagne in Belgrade's nightclubs and belly-dancing bars.  In late-February, Skarbek and Kowerski continued their journey in the Opel, first to [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Sofia's best hotel \"was full of Nazis\". Skarbek and Kowerski called at the British Legation, meeting with air attache [[Aidan Crawley]]. The couple gave Crawley rolls of [[microfilm]] given them by a Polish intelligence organisation called the \"[[:pl:Muszkieterzy (organizacja)|Musketeers]]. The microfilm contained pictures of the German military buildup near the Soviet Union's border and signalled to the British that a German invasion of the Soviet Union was being planned. The microfilm was sent to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] in London who could hardly believe it, but by March, with information from other sources, the Prime Minister was persuaded that Skarbek and Kennedy's intelligence was accurate. The Germans invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941.<ref>Mulley, pp. 99-107</ref>    \n\nLeaving Bulgaria, Kowerski and Skarbek continue on to [[Turkey]]. In [[Istanbul]], the couple met with exiled Poles and Skarbek tried to ensure that the courier routes from Istanbul to Poland remained functional.  Skarbek's husband, the intimidating Jerzy Gizyeki, met them in Istanbul on 17 March 1941. Apparently no fireworks ensued when the husband met Kowerski, and they persuaded him to go to Budapest to take over Skarbek's previous role as the contact point for the British with the Polish resistance in Budapest. Kowerski and Skarbek then continued their journey in the Opel through Syria and Lebanon which were under the control of [[Vichy France]]. Skarbek persuaded the Vichy Embassy officials to give them visas. They then entered [[Mandatory Palestine]] and proceeded onward to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]] arriving in May 1941.<ref>Mulley, 108-118</ref>            \n\nSkarbek and Kowerski \"had driven fairly blithely across hundreds of miles of Nazi-sympathizing territory, often carrying incriminating letters and sometimes microfilm and just weeks or at times days ahead of the Nazi advance.\"<ref>Mulley, p.118</ref>\n\n===Cairo===\n[[File:ColinGubbins.jpg|thumb|upright|Gen.

Only German spies, some Polish intelligence officers believed, could have obtained the visas.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 116.</ref>\n\nThere were also specific suspicions about Kowerski. These were addressed in London by General [[Colin Gubbins]]\u2014to be, from September 1943, head of SOE\u2014in a letter of 17 June 1941 to Polish Commander-in-Chief and the Prime Minister of Poland [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]]:{{blockquote|Last year [\u2026] a Polish citizen named Kowerski was working with our officials in [[Budapest]] on Polish affairs. He is now in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [\u2026]. I understand from Major [[Peter Wilkinson (SOE)|Wilkinson]] [of SOE] that General [[Stanis\u0142aw Kopa\u0144ski|Kopa\u0144ski]] [Kowerski's former commander in Poland] is doubtful about Kowerski's loyalty to the Polish cause [because] Kowerski has not reported to General Kopa\u0144ski for duty with the [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade|Brigade]]. Major Wilkinson informs me that Kowerski had had instructions from our officials not to report to General Kopa\u0144ski, as he was engaged [\u2026] on work of a secret nature which necessitated his remaining apart.  It seems therefore that Kowerski's loyalty has only been called into question because of these instructions.<ref>Quoted in M. Binney, ''The Women Who Lived for Danger'', pp. 71\u201372.</ref>|}}\n\nKowerski eventually cleared up any misunderstandings with General Kopa\u0144ski and was able to resume intelligence work. Similarly, when Skarbek visited Polish military headquarters in her British [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] uniform, she was treated by the Polish military chiefs with the highest respect.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], \"Krystyna Skarbek: Re-viewing Britain's Legendary Polish Agent\", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XLIX, no. 3 (2004), p. 949.</ref>\n\nIt could not but have helped that, in the meantime, Germany had started [[Operation Barbarossa]], an invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] (22 June 1941), as her intelligence obtained from the Musketeers had predicted.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 131.</ref> It is now known that advance information about Operation Barbarossa had also been provided by a number of other sources, including [[Ultra]].<ref>Read, Anthony, and David Fisher, ''[[Lucy spy ring|Operation Lucy]]: Most Secret Spy Ring of the Second World War'', New York, Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1981; {{ISBN|0-698-11079-X}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Gi\u017cycki, was informed that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed out of his own career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told her husband that she loved Kowerski, Gi\u017cycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 127.</ref> The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in [[Berlin]] on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. [[Vera Atkins]], assistant to the head of F Section, [[Maurice Buckmaster]], later described Skarbek being \"very brave, very attractive, but a loner and a law unto herself\".<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved'', pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n\n===France===\n[[File:Maquis Haute Savoie.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Maquisards'' (Resistance fighters) in the [[Haute-Savoie]] Department in August 1944. Skarbek is second from right.]]  \nSkarbek's situation changed greatly in 1944, with a turn of events that led to some of her most famous exploits. Fluent in French, she was offered to SOE's teams in France, under the ''nom de guerre'' \"Madame Pauline\". The offer was timely: SOE was running short of trained operatives to cover the increased demands being placed on it in the run-up to the invasion of France. New operatives were already in training, but the work took time. If inserted into occupied Europe before they had absorbed the numerous physical and intellectual skills required for survival, the operatives could compromise not only themselves but their SOE colleagues already in place and French Resistance members. Skarbek had a track record of successful courier work in occupied Europe and would need only a little \"refresher\" work and some guidance about working in France. There was one particular need that required urgent attention: the replacement of a lost [[courier]] on a busy circuit that would be among the first to meet the proposed Allied landings. Skarbek was selected to replace SOE agent [[Cecily Lefort]], who had been captured, tortured and executed by the Gestapo.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe SOE had several branches working in France. Though most of the women in France answered to [[F Section]] in London, Skarbek's mission was launched from [[Algiers]], the base of AMF Section. This factor, combined with Skarbek's absence from the usual SOE training programme, sometimes intrigues researchers. AMF Section was only set up in the wake of [[Operation Torch]], the Allied landings in North Africa, partly with staff from London (F Section) and partly with staff from Cairo (MO.4). AMF Section served three purposes: (1) it was simpler and safer to run the resupply operations from [[North African Campaign|Allied North Africa]] than from London, across [[German occupation of France during World War II|German-occupied France]]; (2) since the [[South of France]] would be liberated by separate Allied landings there ([[Operation Dragoon]]), SOE units in the area needed to be transferred to have links with those headquarters, not with forces for [[Normandy]]; (3) AMF Section tapped into the skills of the French in North Africa, who did not generally support [[Charles de Gaulle]] and who had been linked with opposition in the former \"[[Vichy France|Unoccupied Zone]]\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nAfter the two invasions, the distinctions became irrelevant, and almost all the SOE Sections in France were united with the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]] into the ''[[French Forces of the Interior|Forces Francaises de l'Interieur]]'' (''FFI'').  (There was one exception: The [[EU/P Section]], which was formed by Poles in France and remained part of the trans-European Polish Resistance movement, under Polish command.) Skarbek, as \"Pauline Armand\", parachuted into southeastern France on 6 July 1944 and became part of the \"Jockey\" network directed by a Belgian-British lapsed pacifist, [[Francis Cammaerts]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} She assisted Cammaerts by linking [[Italian Resistance|Italian partisans]] and French Maquis for joint operations against the Germans in the [[Alps]] and by inducing non-Germans, especially conscripted Poles, in the German occupation forces to defect to the Allies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIn early August 1944, she made contact with Polish conscripts in the German garrison at [[Col de Larche]], a high-altitude pass.  After a two-day hike through the mountains she persuaded the Polish conscripts to desert and then managed to convince the resident German troops to surrender.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn 13 August 1944, at [[Digne]], two days before the Allied Operation Dragoon landings in southern France, Cammaerts, [[Xan Fielding]]\u2014another SOE agent, who had previously operated in [[Crete]]\u2014and a French officer, Christian Sorensen, were arrested at a roadblock by the Gestapo. Skarbek, learning that they were to be executed, managed to meet with Captain Albert Schenck, an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] who acted as liaison officer between the local French [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] and the Gestapo. She introduced herself as a niece of British General [[Bernard Law Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] and threatened Schenck with terrible retribution if harm came to the prisoners. She reinforced the threat with a mercenary appeal \u2013 an offer of two million francs for the men's release. Schenck then introduced her to a Gestapo officer, Max Waem, a Belgian.<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', p. 205.</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|For three hours Christine argued and bargained with him and, having turned the full force of her magnetic personality on him... told him that the Allies would be arriving at any moment and that she, a British parachutist, was in constant wireless contact with the British forces.  To make her point, she produced some broken... useless W/T crystals.... 'If I were you,' said Christine, 'I should give careful thought to the proposition I have made you. As I told ''Capitaine'' Schenck, if anything should happen to my husband [as she falsely described Cammaerts] or to his friends, the reprisals would be swift and terrible, for I don't have to tell you that both you and the ''Capitaine'' have an infamous reputation among the locals.' Increasingly alarmed by the thought of what might befall him when the Allies and the Resistance decided to avenge the many murders he had committed, Waem struck the butt end of his revolver on the table and said, 'If I do get them out of prison, what will you do to protect me?'<ref>M. Masson, ''Christine'', pp. 205\u2013206.</ref>}}\n\nAfter Cammaerts and the other two men were released, Schenck was advised to leave Digne. He did not and was subsequently murdered by a person or persons unknown. His wife kept the bribe money and, after the war, attempted to exchange it for new francs. She was arrested, but was released after the authorities investigated her story. She was able to exchange the money for only a tiny portion of its value.<ref>[[Francis Cammaerts]], who after the war kept in touch with Max Waem, in Belgium, gave his account to the sound archives of the [[Imperial War Museum]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe story of Skarbeks's bribe is fictionalized in the last episode of the television series, ''[[Wish Me Luck]].''\n\n===D\u00e9nouement===\n[[File:Krystyna Skarbek.jpg|thumb|upright 1.4|Krystyna Skarbek]]\nSkarbek's service in France restored her political reputation and greatly enhanced her military reputation. When the SOE teams returned from France (or in some cases, were given 24 hours to depart by de Gaulle), some of the British women sought new missions in the [[Pacific War]], since the [[Empire of Japan]] still held on; but Skarbek, as a Pole, was ideally placed to serve as a courier for missions to her homeland in the final missions of SOE. \n\nAs the [[Red Army]] advanced across Poland, the British government and [[Polish government-in-exile]] worked together to leave a network in place that would report on events in the [[People's Republic of Poland]]. Kowerski and Skarbek were now fully reconciled with the Polish forces and were preparing to be dropped into Poland in early 1945. In the event, the mission, called [[Operation Freston]], was cancelled because the first party to enter Poland were captured by the Red Army (they were released in February 1945).<ref>[http://www.polandinexile.com/exile11.htm Guideline of events surrounding Operation Freston], polandinexile.com; accessed 1 July 2014.</ref>\n\nThe women of SOE were all given military rank, with honorary commissions in either the Women's Transport Service, the [[First Aid Nursing Yeomanry]] (FANY), officially part of the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]] (ATS) though a very elite and autonomous part, or the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]] (WAAF). Skarbek appears to have been a member of both. In preparation for her service in France, she appears to have been with FANY. On her return, she seems to have transferred to the WAAF as an officer until the end of the war in Europe: 21 November 1944 to 14 May 1945. \n\nShe was one of the few SOE female field agents promoted beyond [[subaltern]] rank to [[Captain (land)|captain]], or the Air Force equivalent: [[flight officer]], the WAAF counterpart of the [[flight lieutenant]] rank for male officers. Skarbek, like [[Pearl Witherington]], the courier who had taken command of a group when the designated commander was captured, and [[Yvonne Cormeau]], the most successful [[wireless]] operator,{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} ended the war as honorary flight officers.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nSkarbek's exploits were recognised with award of the [[George Medal]].<ref>[[Clare Mulley]], ''The Spy Who Loved: The Secrets and Lives of Christine Granville, Britain's First Special Agent of World War II'', London, Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4472-2565-2}}, p. 297.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/worldwar2/theatres-of-war/western-europe/investigation/resistance/sources/docs/2/transcript.htm |title=Extract from a citation for Christine Granville |work=The National Archives |year=2015 |accessdate=22 November 2015}} recommendation for [[George Cross]]</ref> Several years after the Digne incident, in London, she told another Pole and fellow [[World War II]] veteran that, during her negotiations with the Gestapo, she had been unaware of any danger to herself.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]]. Three of these, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, known as the [[Synoptic Gospels]], give similar accounts.

Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (i.e.: when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\").<ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion \u2013 from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]] \u2013 during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

Most [[Roman Catholic]] churches, as well as many [[Anglican]], [[Lutheran]]. and [[Methodist]] parishes, contain Stations of the Cross, typically placed at intervals along the sidewalls of the [[nave]]; in most churches, they are small plaques with [[relief]]s or paintings, although in others they may be simple crosses with a numeral in the center.<ref name=\"ChryssidesWilkins2014\">{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|last2=Wilkins|first2=Margaret Z.|title=Christians in the Twenty-First Century|date=11 September 2014|publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]]|isbn=9781317545576|page=51|quote=Most churches in the Roman Catholic, High Anglican and Lutheran traditions have the stations of the cross displayed pictorially or in bas-relief form around their interior walls, and thus the stations can be used locally for devotion, without the necessity of visiting a place of pilgrimage.}}</ref><ref name=SMEC>{{cite web|url=http://st-michaels-episcopal.org/episcopalian-beliefs/stations-of-the-cross/|title=Stations of the Cross|year=2012|publisher=St. Michael's Episcopal Church|accessdate=3 March 2015|quote=Eventually fixed at fourteen, the Stations soon became a familiar feature in Catholic; Lutheran, Anglican, and Methodist churches.

It is most commonly done during [[Lent]], especially on [[Good Friday]], but it can be done on other days as well, especially Wednesdays and Fridays. \n\n===The Passion Offices ===\nThe Passion Offices were the special prayers said by various [[Roman Catholic]] communities, particularly the [[Passionist fathers]] to commemorate the [[Passion of Christ]].<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Passion Offices}}</ref>\n\n===The Little Office of the Passion===\n{{main|Little Office of the Passion}}\nAnother devotion is the Little Office of the Passion created by [[Francis of Assisi]] (1181/82\u20131226). He ordered this office around the medieval association of five specific moments in Jesus' Passion with specific hours of the day. Having then attributed these to hours of the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], he arrived at this schema:<ref name=\"Hugo\">{{harvnb|Hugo|2011}}</ref>\n\n* Compline - 21:00 - Jesus' [[Agony in the Garden|Arrest]] on the [[Mount of Olives]]\n* Matins - 00:00 - Jesus' [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Trial]] before the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]]\n* Prime - 06:00 - \"an interlude celebrating Christ as the light of the new day\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n* Terce - 09:00 - Jesus' [[Pilate's Court|Trial]] before [[Pontius Pilate]]\n* Sext - 12:00 - Jesus' [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]\n* None - 15:00 - Jesus' Death\n* Vespers - 18:00 - \"recalling and celebrating the entire daily cycle\"<ref name=\"Hugo\"/>\n\n==In the arts==\n\n===Visual art===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Normandie Manche Avranches3 tango7174.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A set of the [[Stations of the Cross]] in painted [[vitreous enamel|enamel]].]]\nFor a full list of the subjects forming narrative works of art on the Passion, or episodes from it, see [[Life of Christ in art]]. Each episode, such as the [[Flagellation of Christ]] or [[Entombment of Christ]], has been represented thousands of times and has developed its own [[iconography|iconographic]] tradition; the Crucifixion is much the most common and important of these subjects. The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels. [[Holy Week in Spain]] retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.\n\n====In Latin America====\nDuring the Passion week many towns in [[Mexico]] have a representation of the passion.\n\n====In Spain====\nDuring the Passion week many cities and towns in [[Spain]] have a representation of the Passion. \n\nMany Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and ''[[Vita Christi|Vitae Christi]]'', and also a popular ''Monotessaron'' or ''Pasi\u00f3n de l'eterno principe Jesucristo'' attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates. However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide. Traditional Bethlehem cloth is striped like pajama material.<ref>Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, exhibition notes</ref> It would thus appear that Jesus' \"[[Seamless robe of Jesus|seamless robe]]\" was made of cloth from either Bethlehem or Damascus.\n*A tradition linked to [[icon]]s of Jesus holds that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] was a pious woman of Jerusalem who then gave [[Veil of Veronica|her kerchief]] to him to wipe his forehead.

Those parts of the four canonical [[Gospel]]s that describe these events are known as the \"Passion narratives\". In some Christian communities, commemoration of the Passion also includes remembrance of the sorrow of [[Mary, the mother of Jesus]], on the [[Friday of Sorrows]].\n\nThe word ''passion'' has taken on a more general application and now may also apply to accounts of the suffering and death of [[Christian martyrs]], sometimes using the Latin form '''''passio'''''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sheingorn|first1=Pamela|title=The Book of Sainte Foy|date=1 January 1995|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0812215125|page=3}}</ref>\n\n== Narratives according to the four canonical Gospels ==\nAccounts of the Passion are found in the four [[canonical gospels]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]].

Peter has followed Jesus and joined the mob awaiting Jesus\u2019 fate; they suspect he is a sympathizer, so Peter repeatedly denies he knows Jesus. Suddenly, the cock crows and Peter remembers what Jesus had said.\n* [[Pilate's court|Pilate's trial of Jesus]], early morning. [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman governor of Judea, questions Jesus, but cannot find any fault with him (according to some gospels, Pilate explicitly declares Jesus' innocence); however, the Jewish leaders and the crowd demand Jesus\u2019 death; Pilate gives them the choice of saving [[Barabbas]], a criminal, or saving Jesus. In response to the screaming mob Pilate sends Jesus out to be crucified.\n* The [[Stations of the Cross|Way of the Cross]]: Jesus and two other convicts are forced to walk to their place of execution. According to the Synoptics, [[Simon of Cyrene]] is forced to carry Jesus' cross, while John writes that Jesus carried his cross himself.\n* The [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]: Jesus and the two other convicts are nailed to crosses at [[Golgotha]], a hill outside Jerusalem, later morning through mid afternoon. Various [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]] are recorded in the gospels before he dies.\n* The [[Burial of Jesus]]: the body of Jesus is [[Descent from the Cross|taken down from the cross]] and put in a tomb by [[Joseph of Arimathea]] (and [[Nicodemus]] according to John).\n* The [[Resurrection of Jesus]]: Jesus rises from the dead, leaving behind an [[empty tomb]] and reportedly [[Post-Resurrection appearances of Jesus|appearing to several of his followers]].\n\n=== Differences between the canonical Gospels ===\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] states that Pilate sends Jesus to be judged by [[Herod Antipas]] because as a Galilean he is under his jurisdiction. Herod is excited at first to see Jesus and hopes Jesus will perform a miracle for him; he asks Jesus several questions but Jesus does not answer. Herod then [[Mocking of Jesus|mocks him]] and sends him back to Pilate after giving him an \"elegant\" robe to wear.<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|23:8-12|31}}</ref>\n\nAll the Gospels relate that a man named [[Barabbas]] <ref>Bar-abbas means ''son of Abbas,'' the Lord. Some manuscripts of Matthew say \"Jesus Barabbas\", suggesting that an early version of the story contrasted the fate of two men both named Jesus</ref> was released by Pilate instead of Jesus. Matthew, Mark and John have Pilate offer a choice between Jesus and Barabbas to the crowd; Luke lists no choice offered by Pilate, but represents the crowd demanding his release.\n\n[[File:Jesus in Golgotha by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Icon]] of the Passion, detail showing (left) the Flagellation and (right) Ascent to [[Golgotha]] ([[fresco]] by [[Theophanes the Cretan]], [[Stavronikita]] [[Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]]).]]\n\nIn all the Gospels, Pilate asks Jesus if he is [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]] and Jesus replies \"So you say\". Once condemned by Pilate, he was [[flagellation of Christ|flogged]] before execution. The Canonical Gospels, except Luke, record that Jesus is then taken by the soldiers to the [[Praetorium]] where, according to Matthew and Mark, the whole contingent of soldiers has been called together. They place a [[purple]] [[robe]] on him, put a [[crown of thorns]] on his head, and according to [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], put a [[sceptre|rod]] in his hand. They [[Mocking of Jesus#Second stage|mock him]] by hailing him as \"[[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of the Jews]]\", paying [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and hitting him on the head with the rod.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of John, Pilate has Jesus brought out a second time, wearing the purple robe and the crown of thorns, in order to appeal his innocence before the crowd, saying ''[[Ecce homo]],'' (\"Behold the man\"). But, John represents, the priests urge the crowd to demand Jesus' death. Pilate resigns himself to the decision, washing his hands (according to Matthew) before the people as a sign that Jesus' blood will not be upon him. According to the Gospel of Matthew they replied, \"[[Blood curse|His blood be on us and on our children!]]\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Matthew|27:25}}</ref>\n\nMark and Matthew record that Jesus is returned his own clothes, prior to being led out for execution. According to the Gospel accounts he is forced, like other victims of crucifixion, to drag his own cross to [[Golgotha]],<ref>The meaning of Golgotha is \"place of a skull.\"</ref> the location of the execution. The three [[Synoptic Gospels]] refer to a man called [[Simon of Cyrene]] who is made to carry the cross ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:21}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|27:32}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|23:26}}), while in the Gospel of John ({{bibleverse-nb||John|19:17}}) Jesus is made to carry his own cross. The [[Gospel of Mark]] gives the names of Simon's children, Alexander and Rufus. However, the Gospel of Luke refers to Simon carrying the cross ''after'' Jesus, in that it states: \"they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%2023:26-23:26&version=9 |title=Bible gateway Luke 23:26 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-05}}</ref> Luke adds that Jesus' female followers follow, mourning his fate, but that he responds by quoting [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hosea+10%3A8&version=NIV Hosea 10:8]. \n\n[[File:Albrecht Altdorfer 016.jpg|thumb|right|''Crucifixion'' by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] (c. 1526)]]\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels state that on arrival at Golgotha, Jesus is offered [[wine]] laced with [[myrrh]] to lessen the pain, but he refuses it. Jesus is then crucified, according to Mark, at \"the third hour\" (9 a.m.) the morning after the Passover meal, but according to John he is handed over to be crucified at \"the sixth hour\" (noon) the day before the Passover meal, although many resolve this by saying that the Synoptics use Jewish time, and that John uses Roman time. Pilate has a [[Titulus (inscription)|plaque]] fixed to Jesus' cross inscribed, (according to John) in Hebrew, Greek and Latin \u2013 ''[[INRI|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudeorum]]'',<ref>The original Greek of the Gospels reads  \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 \u1f41 \u039d\u03b1\u03b6\u03c9\u03c1\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f41 B\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u1f38\u03bf\u03c5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03bd, \"Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews\".</ref> meaning ''Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews''. Mark has the plaque say simply, ''King of the Jews.'' The Gospels then state that the soldiers divide Jesus' clothes among themselves, except for one garment for which they [[Sortition|cast lots]]. The Gospel of John claims that this fulfills a prophecy from {{bibleverse||Psalms|22:18}}. Some of the crowd who have been following [[Mocking of Jesus#Third stage|taunt Jesus]], saying \"He trusts in God; let God deliver him now!\", and suggest that Jesus might perform a [[miracle]] to release himself from the cross.\n\nAccording to the Gospels, two [[Theft|thieves]] are also crucified, one on each side of him. According to Luke, one of the thieves reviles Jesus, while the other declares Jesus innocent and begs that he might be remembered when Jesus comes to his kingdom (see [[Penitent thief]]).\n\nJohn records that Mary, his mother, and two other women stand by the cross as does a disciple, described as [[Disciple whom Jesus loved|the one whom Jesus loved]]. Jesus commits his mother to this disciple's care. According to the synoptics, the [[Crucifixion eclipse|sky becomes dark at midday]] and the darkness lasts for three hours, until the ninth hour when Jesus cries out ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' (\"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\").<ref>Mark reports Jesus says ''Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?'' in [[Aramaic]]; Matthew reports ''Eli, Eli....''</ref> The centurion standing guard, who has seen how Jesus has died, declares Jesus innocent (Luke) or the \"Son of God\" (Matthew, Mark).\n\nJohn says that, as was the custom, the soldiers come and break the legs of the thieves, so that they will die faster, but that on coming to Jesus they find him already dead. A soldier pierces his side with a [[Holy Lance|spear]].\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew, Judas, the betrayer, is filled with remorse and tries to return the money he was paid for betraying Jesus. When the high priests say that that is his affair, Judas throws the money into the [[Jerusalem temple|temple]], goes off, and hangs himself.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|27}}</ref> However, according to the [[Book of Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:18|9}}, Judas was not remorseful, took the money and bought a field from it, whereupon he suddenly fell and died.\n\n== Narrative according to the Gospel of Peter ==\n[[File:Veronicas Svetteduk av Domenico Fetti.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Veil of Veronica]]'', painting by [[Domenico Fetti]] (c. 1620).]]\nFurther claims concerning the Passion are made in some non-canonical early writings. Another passion narrative is found in the fragmentary ''[[Gospel of Peter]]'', long known to scholars through references, and of which a fragment was discovered in Cairo in 1884.\n\nThe narrative begins with Pilate washing his hands, as in Matthew, but the Jews and Herod refuse this. [[Joseph of Arimathea]], before Jesus has been crucified, asks for his body, and Herod says he is going to take it down to comply with the Jewish custom of not leaving a dead body hung on a tree overnight. Herod then turns Jesus over to the people who drag him, give him a purple robe, crown him with thorns, and beat and flog him.\n\nThere are also two criminals, crucified on either side of him and, as in Luke, one begs Jesus for forgiveness. The writer says Jesus is silent as they crucify him, \"...as if in no pain.\" <ref>{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}. This is the passage that was condemned as possibly leading to [[Docetism]].</ref> Jesus is labeled the [[Jesus, King of the Jews|King of Israel]] on his cross and his clothes are divided and gambled over.\n\nAs in the canonical Gospels, darkness covers the land. Jesus is also given vinegar to drink. Peter has \"My Power, My Power, why have you forsaken me?\" as the last words of Jesus, rather than \"My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?\" as quoted in Mark. He is then \"taken up\", possibly a [[euphemism]] for death or maybe an allusion to [[heaven]].<ref name=\"Miller 403\">{{harvnb|Miller|1994|p=403}}</ref> Peter then has a resurrection, similar to the other books.\n\n[[Serapion of Antioch]] urged the exclusion of the Gospel of Peter from the Church because [[Docetism|Docetists]] were using it to bolster their [[Theology|theological]] claims, which Serapion rejected.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=11}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref> Many modern scholars also reject this conclusion, as the statement about Jesus being silent \"as if in no pain\" seems to be based on Isaiah's description of the suffering servant, \"as a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth.\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|53:7|HE}}).<ref name=\"Miller 403\"/>\n\n==The Trials of Jesus==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nThe gospels provide differing accounts of the trial of Jesus. Mark describes two separate proceedings, one involving Jewish leaders and one in which the Roman prefect for Judea, Pontius Pilate, plays the key role. Both Matthew and John's accounts generally support Mark's two-trial version. Luke, alone among the gospels, adds yet a third proceeding: having Pilate send Jesus to Herod Antipas. The non-canonical Gospel of Peter describes a single trial scene involving Jewish, Roman, and Herodian officials.\n\n== Biblical prophecies ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n=== Old Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Man lorenzetti.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ as [[Man of Sorrows]]'' by [[Pietro Lorenzetti]], c. 1330 ([[Lindenau-Museum]], [[Altenburg]])]]\n\nChristians interpret at least three passages of the Old Testament as prophecies about Jesus\u2019 Passion.\n\nThe first and most obvious is the one from {{bibleverse||Isaiah|52:13\u201353:12|HE}} (either 8th or 6th century BC). This prophetic oracle describes a sinless man who will atone for the sins of his people. By his voluntary suffering, he will save sinners from the just punishment of God. The death of Jesus is said to fulfill this prophecy. For example, \"He had no form or comeliness that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|53:2-5|HE}}).\n\nThe second prophecy of Christ's Passion is the ancient text which Jesus himself quoted, while he was dying on the cross. From the cross, Jesus cried with a loud voice, ''Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?'' which means, \"My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?\" These words of Jesus were a quotation of the ancient {{Bibleverse||Psalm||22|HE}}. [[King David]], in [[Psalm]] 22, foretold the sufferings of the messiah. For example, \"I am a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of the people. All who see me, laugh me to scorn, they draw apart their lips, and wag their heads: \u2018He trusts in the Lord: let him free him, let him deliver him if he loves him.\u2019 Stand not far from me, for I am troubled; be thou near at hand: for I have no helper. ...Yea, dogs are round about me; a company of evildoers encircle me; they have pierced my hands and feet&nbsp;\u2013 I can count all my bones&nbsp;\u2013 they stare and gloat over me; they divide my garments among them, and for my raiment they cast lots\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|22:7-19|HE}}). The words \"[[they have pierced my hands and feet]]\" are disputed, however.\n\nThe third main prophecy of the Passion is from the [[Book of Wisdom|Book of the Wisdom of Solomon]]. Protestant Christians place it in the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]], [[Roman Catholic]]s and [[Eastern Orthodox]] among the [[deuterocanonical]] books. But it was written about 150 BC, and many have understood these verses (12-20 of chapter 2) as a direct prophecy of Jesus\u2019 Passion. For example, \"Let us lie in wait for the just, because he is not for our turn. ...He boasteth that he hath the knowledge of God, and calleth himself the son of God ... and glorieth that he hath God for his father. Let us see then if his words be true. ...For if he be the true son of God, he will defend him, and will deliver him from the hands of his enemies. Let us examine him by outrages and tortures. ...Let us condemn him to a most shameful death. ...These things they thought, and were deceived, for their own malice blinded them\" (Wisdom 2:12-20).\n\nIn addition to the above, it deserves to be mentioned that at least three other, less elaborate messianic prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion, namely, the following Old Testament passages:\n\n\"Many are the afflictions of the just man; but the Lord delivers him from all of them. He guards all his bones: not even one of them shall be broken\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|34:20|HE}}).\n\n\"And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink\" ({{bibleverse||Psalm|69:21|HE}}).\n\n\"And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced; and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for an only son; and they shall grieve over him, as the manner is to grieve for the death of the firstborn\" ({{bibleverse||Zechariah|12:10|HE}}).\n\n=== New Testament prophecy ===\n[[File:Stolb2.jpg|thumb|Fragment of the Pillar of the [[Flagellation]], [[Church of St George, Istanbul|Hagios Georgios]] Patriarchal Church, [[Istanbul]].]]\n\nThe Gospel explains how these old prophecies were fulfilled in Jesus\u2019 crucifixion.\n\n\"So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with Jesus; but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. ...For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, \u2018Not a bone of him shall be broken.\u2019 And again another scripture says, \u2018They shall look on him whom they have pierced\u2019\" ({{bibleverse||John|19:32-37|KJV}}).\n\nIn the [[Gospel of Mark]], Jesus is described as prophesying his own Passion and his Resurrection three times:\n*On the way to [[Caesarea Philippi]], predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*After the [[transfiguration of Jesus]], again predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be killed and rise within three days.\n*On the way to Jerusalem, predicting that the ''Son of Man'' will be delivered to the leading [[Pharisees]] and [[Sadducees]], be condemned to death, delivered to the [[Gentiles]], mocked, scourged, killed, and rise within three days.\n\nChristians argue that these are cases of genuine and fulfilled [[prophecy]] and many scholars see [[ancient Semitic religion|Semitic features and tradition]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|9:31|KJV}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Brown||p=140}}{{full citation needed|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the third prophecy, the Gospel of Mark states that the brothers [[James the Great|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] ask Jesus to be his left and right hand men, but Jesus asks if they can drink from the \"cup\" he must drink from. They say that they can do this. Jesus confirms this, but says that the places at his right and left hand are reserved for others. Many Christian see this as being a reference to the two criminals at Jesus' crucifixion, thus relating to the Passion. The \"cup\" is sometimes interpreted as the symbol of his death, in the light of Jesus' prayer at Gethsemane \"Let this cup be taken from me!\"\n\n==Liturgical use==\n[[File:Arma Christi 1468 Wald am Arlberg VLM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Arma Christi]] on the back of an Austrian [[altarpiece]] of 1468.]]\n\n===Holy Week===\nMost Christian denominations will read one or more narratives of the Passion during [[Holy Week]], especially on [[Good Friday]]. In the [[Roman Catholic]] church, a large cross depicting the crucified Christ is brought out into the church and each of the faithful come forward to [[venerate]] the cross. Rather than having the Gospel read solely by the priest, whole Roman Catholic congregations participate in the reading of the Passion Gospel during the [[Palm Sunday]] Mass and the Good Friday service. These readings have the Priest read the part of Christ, a narrator read the narrative, other reader(s) reading the other speaking parts, and either the choir or the congregation reading the parts of crowds (''i.e.'': when the crowd shouts \"Crucify Him! Crucify Him!\") <ref>Today's Missal: Holy Week&nbsp;\u2013 Pentecost, March 14 - May 17, 2008, Oregon Catholic Press</ref>\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches, the [[Matins]] service for Good Friday is called ''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'', and is remarkable for the interspersing of twelve readings from the [[Gospel Book]] detailing chronologically the events of the Passion\u2014from the [[Last Supper]] to the burial in the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb]]\u2014during the course of the service. The first of these twelve readings is the longest Gospel reading of the entire [[liturgical year]]. In addition, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year is dedicated in part to the commemoration of the Passion.<ref>{{Cite document\n | last =Sokolof\n | first =[[Archpriest]] D.\n | author-link =\n | last2=\n | first2=\n | author2-link=\n | contribution =\n | year =1962\n | publication-date=2001\n | title =A Manual of the Orthodox Church's Divine Services\n | editor-last =\n | editor-first =\n | editor-link=\n | edition=\n | volume =\n | series =3rd printing (re-edited)\n | page =35\n | place =[[Jordanville, N.Y.]]\n | publisher =[[Holy Trinity Monastery (Jordanville, New York)|Holy Trinity Monastery]]\n | id =\n | isbn =\n | url =\n | accessdate =\n | postscript =<!--None--> }}\n</ref>\n\nDuring [[Holy Week]]/[[Passion Week]] Congregations of the [[Moravian Church]] ([[Herrnhut]]er Bruedergemeine) read the entire story of Jesus' final week from a Harmony of the Gospels prepared for that purpose since 1777. Daily meetings are held, some times two or three times a day, to follow the events of the day. During the course of the reading, the Congregation sings hymn verses to respond to the events of the text.\n\nMost liturgical churches hold some form of commemoration of the Crucifixion on the afternoon of Good Friday. Sometimes, this will take the form of a [[vigil]] from noon to 3:00 pm, the approximate time that Jesus hung on the cross. Sometimes there will be a reenactment of the [[Descent from the Cross]]; for instance, at [[Vespers]] in the Byzantine (Eastern Orthodox and Greek-Catholic) tradition.\n[[File:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|right|[[El Greco]]'s ''Jesus Carrying the Cross'', 1580.]]\n\n===Reparation to Jesus===\nThe [[Roman Catholic]] tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as ''[[acts of reparation]]'' for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during his Passion. These ''[[Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ]]'' do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to ''repair the sins'' against Jesus. Some such prayers are provided in the [[Raccolta]] Catholic prayer book (approved by a Decree of 1854, and published by the [[Holy See]] in 1898) which also includes prayers as [[Acts of Reparation to the Virgin Mary]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia||last=Slater |first=T. |date=1911 |title=Reparation |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12775a.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Delany |first=F.X. |date=1911 |title=Raccolta |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |publication-place=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |access-date=July 28, 2019 |via=New Advent |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12620a.htm}}</ref><ref>Joseph P.

The Passion is often covered by a cycle of depictions; [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]'s [[Old master print|print]] cycles were so popular that he produced three different versions. [[Andachtsbilder]] is a term for devotional subjects such as the [[Man of Sorrows]] or [[Piet\u00e0]] that may not precisely represent a moment in the Passion but are derived from the Passion story. The ''[[Arma Christi]]'', or \"Instruments of the Passion\" are the objects associated with Jesus' Passion, such as the cross, the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Longinus]].  Each of the major Instruments has been supposedly recovered as [[Relics attributed to Jesus|relics]] which have been an object of veneration among many Christians, and have been depicted in art. [[Veronica's Veil]] is also often counted among the Instruments of the Passion; like the [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] it is a cloth relic supposed to have touched Jesus.\n\nIn the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (and some [[Anglo-Catholic]] and [[Western Rite Orthodox]] churches), the Passion story is depicted in the [[Stations of the Cross]] (''via crucis'', also translated more literally as \"Way of the Cross\"). These 14 stations depict the Passion from the sentencing by Pilate to the sealing of the tomb, and since the 16th-century representations of them in various media have decorated the [[nave]]s of most Catholic churches. The Way of the Cross is a devotion practiced by many people on Fridays throughout the year, most importantly on [[Good Friday]]. This may be simply by going round the Stations in a church, or may involve large-scale re-enactments, as in [[Jerusalem]]. The [[Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy]] are similar schemes on a far larger scale than church Stations, with chapels containing large sculpted groups arranged in a hilly landscape; for [[pilgrim]]s to tour the chapels typically takes several hours. They mostly date from the late 16th to the 17th century; most depict the Passion, others different subjects as well.\n\n===Music===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n{{Main|Passion (music)|Tenebrae}}\n[[File:St John the Baptist church frescoes.JPG|thumb|Fresco depicting the trial and beating of Jesus (17th century, [[St. John the Baptist Church, Yaroslavl]], Russia).]]\nThe main traditional types of [[church music]] sung during Holy Week are \"Passions\", musical settings of the Gospel narratives, both a Catholic and Lutheran tradition, and settings of the readings and responses from the Catholic [[Tenebrae]] services, especially those of the ''[[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]]''. The many settings of the ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' or ''[[musical settings of sayings of Jesus on the cross]]'' are also commonly performed.\n\nThe reading of the Passion section of one of the Gospels during [[Holy Week]] dates back to the 4th century. It began to be intoned (rather than just spoken) in the Middle Ages, at least as early as the 8th century. 9th-century manuscripts have \"litterae significativae\" indicating interpretive chant, and later manuscript begin to specify exact notes to be sung. By the 13th century, different singers were used for different characters in the narrative, a practice which became fairly universal by the 15th century, when [[polyphonic]] settings of the [[turba]] passages began to appear also. (''Turba'', while literally meaning \"crowd\", is used in this case to mean any passage in which more than one speaker speak simultaneously.)\n\nIn the later 15th century a number of new styles began to emerge:\n* Responsorial Passions set all of Christ's words and the turba parts polyphonically.\n* Through-composed Passions were entirely polyphonic (also called ''motet Passions''). [[Jacob Obrecht]] wrote the earliest extant example of this type.\n* Summa Passionis settings were a synopsis of all four Gospels, including the [[Seven Last Words]] (a text later set by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Th\u00e9odore Dubois]]). These were discouraged for church use but circulated widely nonetheless.\n\nIn the 16th century, settings like these, and further developments, were created for the Catholic Church by [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria|Victoria]], [[William Byrd]], [[Jacobus Gallus]], [[Francisco Guerrero (composer)|Francisco Guerrero]], [[Orlando di Lasso]], and [[Cypriano de Rore]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Kremlin Museums Exhibitions-5.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox]] [[icon]] of the Passion with scenes of the [[martyr]]dom of the [[Twelve Apostles]], symbolizing how all are called to enter into the Passion ([[Moscow Kremlin]]).]]\n\n[[Martin Luther]] wrote, \"The Passion of Christ should not be acted out in words and pretense, but in real life.\" Despite this, sung Passion performances were common in Lutheran churches right from the start, in both Latin and German, beginning as early as [[Laetare Sunday]] (three weeks before Easter) and continuing through Holy Week. Luther's friend and collaborator Johann Walther wrote responsorial Passions which were used as models by Lutheran composers for centuries, and \"summa Passionis\" versions continued to circulate, despite Luther's express disapproval. Later 16th-century passions included choral \"exordium\" (introduction) and \"conclusio\" sections with additional texts. In the 17th century came the development of \"[[oratorio]]\" passions which led to [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]]'s [[Passions (Bach)|Passions]], accompanied by instruments, with interpolated texts (then called \"madrigal\" movements) such as [[sinfonia]]s, other Scripture passages, Latin [[motet]]s, chorale arias, and more. Such settings were created by [[Bartholom\u00e4us Gesius]] and [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]]. Thomas Strutz wrote a passion (1664) with arias for Jesus himself, pointing to the standard [[oratorio]] tradition of [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz|Sch\u00fctz]], [[Giacomo Carissimi|Carissimi]], and others, although these composers seem to have thought that putting words in Jesus\u2019 mouth was beyond the pale. The practice of using [[recitative]] for the Evangelist (rather than plainsong) was a development of court composers in northern Germany and only crept into church compositions at the end of the 17th century. A famous musical reflection on the Passion is [[Messiah Part II|Part II]] of ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]'', an oratorio by [[George Frideric Handel]], though the text here draws from Old Testament prophecies rather than from the Gospels themselves.\n\nThe best known Protestant musical settings of the Passion are by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], who wrote several Passions, of which two have survived, one based on the [[Gospel of John]] (the ''[[St John Passion]]''), the other on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]''). His ''[[St Mark Passion, BWV 247|St Mark Passion]]'' was reconstructed in various ways. The Passion continued to be very popular in Protestant Germany in the 18th century, with Bach's second son [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|Carl Philipp Emanuel]] composing [[The Passions of C.P.E. Bach|over twenty settings.]] In the 19th century, with the exception of [[John Stainer]]'s ''[[The Crucifixion (Stainer)|The Crucifixion]]'' (1887), Passion settings were less popular, but in the 20th century, they have again come into fashion. Two notable settings are the ''[[St. Luke Passion (Penderecki)|St. Luke Passion]]'' (1965) by [[Poland|Polish]] composer [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] and the ''[[Passio (P\u00e4rt)|Passio]]'' (1982) by [[Estonia]]n composer [[Arvo P\u00e4rt]]. Recent examples include ''The Passion According to St. Matthew'' (1997), by [[Mark Alburger]], and ''The Passion According to the Four Evangelists'', by Scott King. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (book and lyrics by [[Tim Rice]]), and [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]]'s ''[[Godspell]]'' both contain elements of the traditional passion accounts. Choral meditations on aspects of the suffering through which Christ humbled himself on the cross include arrangements such as [[Buxtehude]]'s 1680 composition [[Membra Jesu Nostri]], the first such Lutheran treatment, incorporating lyrics excerpted from a medieval Latin poem and featuring Old Testament verses that prefigure the Messiah as suffering servant, see [[Passion cantata]].\n\n===Drama and processions===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Stuttgart 2009 040 (RaBoe).jpg|thumb|upright|Christian Easter passion [[procession]] in Stuttgart, Germany]]\n[[File:5 010 Via Dolorosa- Walk in Jerusalem, with Jesus Christ-Actor and Press.jpg|thumb|upright|Reenacting the [[Stations of the Cross]] in [[Jerusalem]] on the [[Via Dolorosa]] from the [[Lions' Gate]] to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]\n\nNon-musical settings of the Passion story are generally called [[Passion play]]s; these have been very widely performed in traditionally Catholic countries, often in churches as [[liturgical drama]]s&nbsp;\u2013 for versions with musical settings, see the previous section. One famous cycle is performed at intervals at [[Oberammergau]] Germany, another in [[Sordevolo]] one of the most important in Italy, and another in the Brazilian state of [[Pernambuco]] uses what is considered the [[New Jerusalem theater|largest open-air theater]] in the world. The Passion figures among the scenes in the English [[mystery play]]s in more than one cycle of dramatic vignettes. In the [[Chester Mystery Plays]]' portrayal of Christ's Passion, specifically his humiliation before his sentence to crucifixion, the accounts of the Gospels concerning the physical violence visited on Jesus during his trial before the Sanhedrin, and the humiliating crowning of thorns visited upon him in Pilate's palace (or by Herod's soldiers, according to Luke), is further confused by showing both actions as being carried out by jeering Jews.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-28 |url=http://www.umm.maine.edu/faculty/necastro/drama/chester/play_16.html\n|title= The Chester Cycle Play XVI (16) \u2013 The Passion of Christ \u2013 Annas and Caiphas\n|publisher=From Stage to Page |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nProcessions on [[Palm Sunday]] commonly re-enact to some degree the entry of Jesus to Jerusalem; traditional ones often using special wooden [[donkey]]s on wheels. [[Holy Week in Spain]] retains more traditional public processions than other countries, with the most famous, in [[Holy Week in Seville|Seville]] featuring floats with carved tableaux showing scenes from the story.\n\n====In Latin America====\nDuring the Passion week many towns in [[Mexico]] have a representation of the passion.\n\n====In Spain====\nDuring the Passion week many cities and towns in [[Spain]] have a representation of the Passion. \n\nMany Passion poems and prose text circulated in the fifteenth-century [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], among which there were the first modern translations of earlier Latin Passion texts and ''[[Vita Christi|Vitae Christi]]'', and also a popular ''Monotessaron'' or ''Pasi\u00f3n de l'eterno principe Jesucristo'' attributed to a pseudo-Gerson. It was most likely written by Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose ''[[The Imitation of Christ#Criticisms|Imitation of Christ]]'' mentions the Passion for few times, uniquely when talking about the Eucharist.<ref>{{cite book | author = Laura Delbrugge | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 | title = A scholarly edition of Andr\u00e9s de Li's Thesoro de la passion (1494) | pages = 46-47 | publisher = Brill | series = Medieval and early modern Iberian world | volume = 41 | location = Boston | date = 3 February 2011 | oclc = 884810931 | isbn = 9789004201200 | archive-url = https://archive.today/20190728112916/https://books.google.it/books?id=yOF5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22circulated+in+both+Latin+and+vernacular+translations%22&hl=it&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-i4KbwdfjAhWCaVAKHUPbCi4Q6AEIKzAA%23v=onepage&q=%22circulated%20in%20both%20Latin%20and%20vernacular%20translations%22&f=false | archive-date = 28 July 2019 | url-status = live | access-date = 28 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n===Film===\nThere have also been a number of [[:Category:Film portrayals of Jesus' death and resurrection|films telling the passion story]], with a prominent example being [[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 ''[[The Passion of the Christ]].''\n\n==Other traditions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2019}}\n*The sons of Simon of Cyrene are named as if they might have been early Christian figures known to Mark's intended audience (Brown et al. 628).

The garments could be disassembled and the strips of cloth were frequently recycled. A single garment might hold sections of many different dates. However, in Damascus and Bethlehem cloth was woven on wider looms, some Damascene being {{convert|40|in|mm}} wide. Traditional Bethlehem cloth is striped like pajama material.<ref>Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, exhibition notes</ref> It would thus appear that Jesus' \"[[Seamless robe of Jesus|seamless robe]]\" was made of cloth from either Bethlehem or Damascus.\n*A tradition linked to [[icon]]s of Jesus holds that [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] was a pious woman of Jerusalem who then gave [[Veil of Veronica|her kerchief]] to him to wipe his forehead.
