{"title_page": "Golden Throats", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2010}}\n'''Golden Throats''' is [[Rhino Records]]' series of humorous [[compilation album|compilations]] of critically lambasted [[cover version]]s of songs, performed mostly either by celebrities known for something other than musical talent or musicians not known for the genre from which the song they are covering comes. For example, [[William Shatner]] sings (or, more precisely, does a [[Recitation|dramatic reading]] of the lyrics to) \"[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]],\" [[Leonard Nimoy]] sings \"[[If I Had a Hammer]],\" and [[Muhammad Ali]] sings \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E.

In most cases, the songs appear to be performed sincerely, rather than in a spirit of irony or intentional goofiness. In many respects, these albums were among the first to anthologize [[lounge music]], with their focus on \"light\" versions of contemporary hits. The series (of four albums) was created and produced by long-time Rhino staffer [[Gary Peterson (record producer)|Gary Peterson]] and pop culture historian Pat Sierchio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/24/entertainment/ca-46029 |title=These Beatles Covers Are Forgettable Camp - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 24, 1997 |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |first=Robert |last=Hilburn}}</ref> Each release contained liner notes penned by acclaimed music historian [[Irwin Chusid]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wfmu.org/irwin/discography.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704172020/http://www.wfmu.org/irwin/discography.html |archive-date=July 4, 2004 |title=Irwin Chusid - Discography |publisher=Wfmu.org |accessdate=October 25, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and most featured original art by [[Drew Friedman (cartoonist)|Drew Friedman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/drew-friedman/689197 |title=Drew Friedman @ ARTISTdirect.com - Free Drew Friedman Music Videos, Downloads, News, Biography, MP3, Lyrics and More |publisher=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}</ref> The cover art parodied well-known albums (''[[Sgt.

Theoretically, the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is the body that advises the sovereign or viceroy on the exercise of executive power. However, in practice, that task is performed solely by the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], a committee within the Privy Council composed of [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]]. [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], ministers are also members of Parliament or senators, and are [[Responsible government|responsible to]] the elected chamber of the [[Parliament of Canada]], the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The Cabinet is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], who is invited by the governor general to form a government after securing the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the House of Commons. This is typically through the election of enough members of a single political party in a federal election to provide a majority of seats in Parliament, forming a [[governing party]].\n\nThe prime minister (currently [[Justin Trudeau]]) is the head of government and appoints the members of Cabinet. Each member of Cabinet is typically a minister, with responsibilities towards a department, a region or other specific duties. The Cabinet also nominates members of the judicial branch and the heads of Crown Corporations. The Cabinet administers the regulations set down in law. The government, through the Parliament of Canada, sets the budget of the various departments. During its term, the government must retain the confidence of Parliament. Certain bills such as the budget must be passed by Parliament. They are known as confidence motions. Laws are formed by the passage of bills in Parliament; either sponsored by the government or individual members of Parliament. After the bill's passage, the bills are given royal assent and become law. The laws are then the responsibility of the government to enforce.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Canada wordmark.svg|left|thumb|The [[wordmark]] of the Government of Canada]]\nIn Canadian English, the word ''[[government]]'' is used to refer both to the whole set of institutions that govern the country (as in American usage, but where Britons would use ''[[Government|state]]''), and to the current political leadership (as in British usage, but where Americans would use ''[[administration (government)|administration]]'').\n\nIn federal department [[press release]]s, the government has sometimes been referred to by the phrase ''[last name of prime minister] Government''; this terminology has been commonly employed in the media.\n<ref name=GMName>{{citation| last=Cheadle| first=Bruce| title=Tories re-brand government in Stephen Harper's name| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=3 March 2011| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tories-re-brand-government-in-stephen-harpers-name/article1929175/| accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> In late 2010, an informal instruction from the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister]] urged government departments to consistently use in all department communications the term (at that time ''Harper Government'') in place of ''Government of Canada''.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Tories defend use of 'Harper Government'|  publisher=CTV| date=7 March 2011| url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20110307/pco-harper-government-110307/| accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> The same cabinet earlier directed its press department to use the phrase ''Canada's New Government''.<ref name=GMName />\n\n== Government structure ==\n{{See|Structure of the Canadian federal government}}\n\n===Monarchy===\n{{Main|Monarchy of Canada}}\n[[File:Official Diamond Jubilee Portrait of the Queen of Canada.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of Canada, wearing her Canadian insignia as Sovereign of the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]]]]\nAs per the [[Constitution|''Constitution Acts'']] of [[Constitution Act, 1867|1867]] and [[Constitution Act, 1982|1982]], Canada is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the reigning sovereign is both legal and practical, but not political.<ref name=Forsey>{{Cite journal| last=Forsey| first=Helen|  title=As David Johnson Enters Rideau Hall&nbsp;... | journal=The Monitor| date=1 October 2010| url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/david-johnson-enters-rideau-hall| accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> The Crown is regarded as a [[Corporation sole#Secular application|corporation sole]], with the monarch, vested as she is with all powers of state,<ref>{{cite book| last=Privy Council Office| authorlink=Privy Council Office (Canada)| title=Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State \u2013 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2008| location=Ottawa| page=45| url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=ag-gr/2008/ag-gr-eng.htm| isbn=978-1-100-11096-7| accessdate=17 May 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318110030/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=ag-gr%2F2008%2Fag-gr-eng.htm| archive-date=18 March 2010| url-status=dead}}</ref> at the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority.<ref name=Smith6>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=David E. |title=The Crown and the Constitution: Sustaining Democracy?

That confusion gives an unscrupulous government plenty of opportunity to oversimplify and misrepresent, making much of the alleged conflict between popular democracy\u2014supposedly embodied in the Prime Minister\u2014and the constitutional mechanisms at the heart of responsible government, notably the 'reserve powers' of the Crown, which gets portrayed as illegitimate.\" As examples, she cited the campaign of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] following the [[King\u2013Byng Affair]] of 1926 and [[Stephen Harper]]'s comments during the [[2008\u20132009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]].<ref name=Forsey/>|group=n|name=Forsey}}\n\n===Legislative power===\n{{Main|Parliament of Canada}}\n[[File:Parliament-Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Centre Block]] of the Canadian parliament buildings on [[Parliament Hill]]]] The Parliament of Canada, the [[bicameral]] national legislature located on [[Parliament Hill]] in the [[Capital city|national capital]] of [[Ottawa]], consists of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]] (normally represented by the governor general), the appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] ([[upper house]]), and the elected House of Commons ([[lower house]]).<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.17}}</ref> The governor general summons and appoints each of the 105 senators on the advice of the prime minister,<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.24}}</ref> while the 338 members of the House of Commons (members of Parliament or 'MPs') are directly elected by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canada citizenship|citizens]], with each member representing a single [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] for a period mandated by law of not more than four years;<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=31 May 2000| title=Canada Elections Act| series=56.1.2| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2000-c-9/latest/sc-2000-c-9.html| accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref> the constitution mandates a maximum of five years. Per democratic tradition, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament; the Senate and Crown rarely oppose its will. The Senate, thus, reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint.\n\nThe ''Constitution Act, 1867'', outlines that the governor general is responsible for summoning parliament in the Queen's name. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. A session begins with a \"[[Speech from the throne]]\" when the governor general or the monarch delivers the governing party's prepared speech of their intentions for the session. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. As a general election typically follows, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. The end of a parliament may also be necessary, however, if the majority of Members of Parliament revoke their confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to govern, such as when the [[Money bill|government's budget]] is voted down (a [[loss of supply]]) or through a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]]. The ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' mandates that members of Parliament must stand for election a minimum of every four-years, however, no parliament has been allowed to expire in such a fashion.\n\n===Judicial power===\n{{Main|Court system of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada, Ottawa.jpg|right|thumb|Supreme Court Building in [[Ottawa]]]]\nThe sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref name=Cools>{{cite hansard| title=Debates of the Senate (Hansard), 2nd Session, 36th Parliament, Volume 138, Issue 29| url=https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/chamber/362/debates/029db_2000-02-17-e#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| house=Senate| date=17 February 2000| column_start=1500| column_end=1510| accessdate=21 November 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904143557/http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/029db_2000-02-17-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=36&Ses=2#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| archivedate=4 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's courts.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]]\u2014the country's [[court of last resort]]\u2014has nine justices appointed by the governor general on recommendation by the prime minister and led by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]], and hears appeals from decisions rendered by the various appellate courts (provincial, territorial and federal).\n\nThe [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] hears cases arising under certain areas of federal law.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| last=Federal Court| authorlink=Federal Court (Canada)| title=About the Court > Jurisdiction| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929234011/http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| archive-date=29 September 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the [[Tax Court of Canada]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=27 March 2002| title=Courts Administration Service Act| series=2.a| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2002-c-8/latest/sc-2002-c-8.html| accessdate=18 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Federalism==\n{{Main|Canadian federalism}}\nThe powers of the parliaments in Canada are limited by the constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial governments; in general, the [[Legislative Assembly|legislatures]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution, such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and \"matters of a merely local or private nature\",<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.92}}</ref> while any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal parliament's power. Thus, the parliament at Ottawa alone can pass laws relating to, amongst other things, the [[mail|postal service]], the [[census]], [[Canadian Forces|the military]], [[criminal law]], navigation and shipping, [[fishing]], [[currency]], [[bank]]ing, [[weights and measures]], [[bankruptcy]], [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, [[Aboriginal people in Canada|First Nations]], and [[naturalization]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.91}}</ref> In some cases, however, the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial parliaments may be more vague. For instance, the federal parliament regulates [[marriage]] and [[divorce]] in general, but the solemnization of marriage is regulated only by the provincial legislatures. Other examples include the powers of both the federal and provincial parliaments to impose taxes, borrow money, punish crimes, and regulate [[agriculture]].\n\n== Political culture ==\n{{Main|Politics of Canada}}\n\n[[File:Canadiancharterofrightsandfreedoms.jpg|thumb|upright =1.5|A copy of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'']]\n\nAn emphasis on [[liberalism]]<ref name=\"WesthuesWharf2014\">{{cite book|author1=Anne Westhues|author2=Brian Wharf|title=Canadian Social Policy: Issues and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chTaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|year=2014|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.

Theoretically, the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] is the body that advises the sovereign or viceroy on the exercise of executive power. However, in practice, that task is performed solely by the [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], a committee within the Privy Council composed of [[Minister of the Crown|ministers of the Crown]]. [[Convention (norm)|Conventionally]], ministers are also members of Parliament or senators, and are [[Responsible government|responsible to]] the elected chamber of the [[Parliament of Canada]], the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. The Cabinet is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]], who is invited by the governor general to form a government after securing the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of the House of Commons. This is typically through the election of enough members of a single political party in a federal election to provide a majority of seats in Parliament, forming a [[governing party]].\n\nThe prime minister (currently [[Justin Trudeau]]) is the head of government and appoints the members of Cabinet. Each member of Cabinet is typically a minister, with responsibilities towards a department, a region or other specific duties. The Cabinet also nominates members of the judicial branch and the heads of Crown Corporations. The Cabinet administers the regulations set down in law. The government, through the Parliament of Canada, sets the budget of the various departments. During its term, the government must retain the confidence of Parliament. Certain bills such as the budget must be passed by Parliament. They are known as confidence motions. Laws are formed by the passage of bills in Parliament; either sponsored by the government or individual members of Parliament. After the bill's passage, the bills are given royal assent and become law. The laws are then the responsibility of the government to enforce.\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Canada wordmark.svg|left|thumb|The [[wordmark]] of the Government of Canada]]\nIn Canadian English, the word ''[[government]]'' is used to refer both to the whole set of institutions that govern the country (as in American usage, but where Britons would use ''[[Government|state]]''), and to the current political leadership (as in British usage, but where Americans would use ''[[administration (government)|administration]]'').\n\nIn federal department [[press release]]s, the government has sometimes been referred to by the phrase ''[last name of prime minister] Government''; this terminology has been commonly employed in the media.\n<ref name=GMName>{{citation| last=Cheadle| first=Bruce| title=Tories re-brand government in Stephen Harper's name| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| date=3 March 2011| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/tories-re-brand-government-in-stephen-harpers-name/article1929175/| accessdate=26 April 2011}}</ref> In late 2010, an informal instruction from the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister]] urged government departments to consistently use in all department communications the term (at that time ''Harper Government'') in place of ''Government of Canada''.<ref>{{Cite news| title=Tories defend use of 'Harper Government'|  publisher=CTV| date=7 March 2011| url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Politics/20110307/pco-harper-government-110307/| accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref> The same cabinet earlier directed its press department to use the phrase ''Canada's New Government''.<ref name=GMName />\n\n== Government structure ==\n{{See|Structure of the Canadian federal government}}\n\n===Monarchy===\n{{Main|Monarchy of Canada}}\n[[File:Official Diamond Jubilee Portrait of the Queen of Canada.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Her Majesty Queen [[Elizabeth II]] of Canada, wearing her Canadian insignia as Sovereign of the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Order of Military Merit (Canada)|Order of Military Merit]]]]\nAs per the [[Constitution|''Constitution Acts'']] of [[Constitution Act, 1867|1867]] and [[Constitution Act, 1982|1982]], Canada is a constitutional monarchy, wherein the role of the reigning sovereign is both legal and practical, but not political.<ref name=Forsey>{{Cite journal| last=Forsey| first=Helen|  title=As David Johnson Enters Rideau Hall&nbsp;... | journal=The Monitor| date=1 October 2010| url=http://www.policyalternatives.ca/publications/monitor/david-johnson-enters-rideau-hall| accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> The Crown is regarded as a [[Corporation sole#Secular application|corporation sole]], with the monarch, vested as she is with all powers of state,<ref>{{cite book| last=Privy Council Office| authorlink=Privy Council Office (Canada)| title=Accountable Government: A Guide for Ministers and Ministers of State \u2013 2008| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2008| location=Ottawa| page=45| url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=ag-gr/2008/ag-gr-eng.htm| isbn=978-1-100-11096-7| accessdate=17 May 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318110030/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=information&sub=publications&doc=ag-gr%2F2008%2Fag-gr-eng.htm| archive-date=18 March 2010| url-status=dead}}</ref> at the centre of a construct in which the power of the whole is shared by multiple institutions of government acting under the sovereign's authority.<ref name=Smith6>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=David E. |title=The Crown and the Constitution: Sustaining Democracy?

That confusion gives an unscrupulous government plenty of opportunity to oversimplify and misrepresent, making much of the alleged conflict between popular democracy\u2014supposedly embodied in the Prime Minister\u2014and the constitutional mechanisms at the heart of responsible government, notably the 'reserve powers' of the Crown, which gets portrayed as illegitimate.\" As examples, she cited the campaign of [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] following the [[King\u2013Byng Affair]] of 1926 and [[Stephen Harper]]'s comments during the [[2008\u20132009 Canadian parliamentary dispute]].<ref name=Forsey/>|group=n|name=Forsey}}\n\n===Legislative power===\n{{Main|Parliament of Canada}}\n[[File:Parliament-Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Centre Block]] of the Canadian parliament buildings on [[Parliament Hill]]]] The Parliament of Canada, the [[bicameral]] national legislature located on [[Parliament Hill]] in the [[Capital (political)|national capital]] of [[Ottawa]], consists of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]] (normally represented by the governor general), the appointed [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] ([[upper house]]), and the elected House of Commons ([[lower house]]).<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.17}}</ref> The governor general summons and appoints each of the 105 senators on the advice of the prime minister,<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=IV.24}}</ref> while the 338 members of the House of Commons (members of Parliament or 'MPs') are directly elected by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Canada citizenship|citizens]], with each member representing a single [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] for a period mandated by law of not more than four years;<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=31 May 2000| title=Canada Elections Act| series=56.1.2| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2000-c-9/latest/sc-2000-c-9.html| accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref> the constitution mandates a maximum of five years. Per democratic tradition, the House of Commons is the dominant branch of parliament; the Senate and Crown rarely oppose its will. The Senate, thus, reviews legislation from a less partisan standpoint.\n\nThe ''Constitution Act, 1867'', outlines that the governor general is responsible for summoning parliament in the Queen's name. A parliamentary session lasts until a prorogation, after which, without ceremony, both chambers of the legislature cease all legislative business until the governor general issues another royal proclamation calling for a new session to begin. A session begins with a \"[[Speech from the throne]]\" when the governor general or the monarch delivers the governing party's prepared speech of their intentions for the session. After a number of such sessions, each parliament comes to an end via dissolution. As a general election typically follows, the timing of a dissolution is usually politically motivated, with the prime minister selecting a moment most advantageous to his or her political party. The end of a parliament may also be necessary, however, if the majority of Members of Parliament revoke their confidence in the Prime Minister's ability to govern, such as when the [[Money bill|government's budget]] is voted down (a [[loss of supply]]) or through a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no-confidence]]. The ''[[Canada Elections Act]]'' mandates that members of Parliament must stand for election a minimum of every four-years, however, no parliament has been allowed to expire in such a fashion.\n\n===Judicial power===\n{{Main|Court system of Canada}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Canada, Ottawa.jpg|right|thumb|Supreme Court Building in [[Ottawa]]]]\nThe sovereign is responsible for rendering justice for all her subjects, and is thus traditionally deemed the ''fount of justice''.<ref name=Cools>{{cite hansard| title=Debates of the Senate (Hansard), 2nd Session, 36th Parliament, Volume 138, Issue 29| url=https://sencanada.ca/en/Content/Sen/chamber/362/debates/029db_2000-02-17-e#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| house=Senate| date=17 February 2000| column_start=1500| column_end=1510| accessdate=21 November 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904143557/http://www.parl.gc.ca/36/2/parlbus/chambus/senate/deb-e/029db_2000-02-17-e.htm?Language=E&Parl=36&Ses=2#0.2.W54BJ2.MERRJT.A7B6PH.2F| archivedate=4 September 2007| url-status=dead}}</ref> However, she does not personally rule in judicial cases; instead the judicial functions of the royal prerogative are performed in trust and in the queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's courts.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Canada]]\u2014the country's [[court of last resort]]\u2014has nine justices appointed by the governor general on recommendation by the prime minister and led by the [[Chief Justice of Canada]], and hears appeals from decisions rendered by the various appellate courts (provincial, territorial and federal).\n\nThe [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]] hears cases arising under certain areas of federal law.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| last=Federal Court| authorlink=Federal Court (Canada)| title=About the Court > Jurisdiction| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=20 November 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929234011/http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/Jurisdiction| archive-date=29 September 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> It works in conjunction with the [[Tax Court of Canada]].<ref>{{Citation| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| date=27 March 2002| title=Courts Administration Service Act| series=2.a| location=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2002-c-8/latest/sc-2002-c-8.html| accessdate=18 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Federalism==\n{{Main|Canadian federalism}}\nThe powers of the parliaments in Canada are limited by the constitution, which divides legislative abilities between the federal and provincial governments; in general, the [[Legislative Assembly|legislatures]] of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] may only pass laws relating to topics explicitly reserved for them by the constitution, such as education, provincial officers, municipal government, charitable institutions, and \"matters of a merely local or private nature\",<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.92}}</ref> while any matter not under the exclusive authority of the provincial legislatures is within the scope of the federal parliament's power. Thus, the parliament at Ottawa alone can pass laws relating to, amongst other things, the [[mail|postal service]], the [[census]], [[Canadian Forces|the military]], [[criminal law]], navigation and shipping, [[fishing]], [[currency]], [[bank]]ing, [[weights and measures]], [[bankruptcy]], [[copyright]]s, [[patent]]s, [[Aboriginal people in Canada|First Nations]], and [[naturalization]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Victoria| 1867| loc=VI.91}}</ref> In some cases, however, the jurisdictions of the federal and provincial parliaments may be more vague. For instance, the federal parliament regulates [[marriage]] and [[divorce]] in general, but the solemnization of marriage is regulated only by the provincial legislatures. Other examples include the powers of both the federal and provincial parliaments to impose taxes, borrow money, punish crimes, and regulate [[agriculture]].\n\n== Political culture ==\n{{Main|Politics of Canada}}\n\n[[File:Canadiancharterofrightsandfreedoms.jpg|thumb|upright =1.5|A copy of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'']]\n\nAn emphasis on [[liberalism]]<ref name=\"WesthuesWharf2014\">{{cite book|author1=Anne Westhues|author2=Brian Wharf|title=Canadian Social Policy: Issues and Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=chTaAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA10|year=2014|publisher=Wilfrid Laurier Univ.
