{"title_page": "Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures", "text_new": "'''Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures''' is the common name given to the [[sanitation]] procedures in food production plants which are required by the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] and regulated by 9 CFR part 416 in conjunction with [[Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations|21 CFR]] part 178.1010.  It is considered one of the prerequisite programs of [[HACCP]].\n\nSSOPs are generally documented steps that must be followed to ensure adequate cleaning of product contact and non-product surfaces.  These cleaning procedures must be detailed enough to make certain that adulteration of product will not occur. All HACCP plans require SSOPs to be documented and reviewed periodically to incorporate changes to the physical plant. This reviewing procedure can take on many forms, from annual formal reviews to random reviews, but any review should be done by \"responsible educated management\".  As these procedures can make their way into the public record if there are serious failures, they might be looked at as public documents because they are required by the government. SSOPs, in conjunction with the Master Sanitation Schedule and Pre-Operational Inspection Program, form the entire sanitation operational guidelines for food-related processing and one of the primary backbones of all food industry HACCP plans.\n\nSSOPs can be very simple to extremely intricate depending on the focus.  Food industry equipment should be constructed of sanitary design; however, some automated processing equipment by necessity is difficult to clean.

It is considered one of the prerequisite programs of [[HACCP]].\n\nSSOPs are generally documented steps that must be followed to ensure adequate cleaning of product contact and non-product surfaces.  These cleaning procedures must be detailed enough to make certain that adulteration of product will not occur. All HACCP plans require SSOPs to be documented and reviewed periodically to incorporate changes to the physical plant. This reviewing procedure can take on many forms, from annual formal reviews to random reviews, but any review should be done by \"responsible educated management\".  As these procedures can make their way into the public record if there are serious failures, they might be looked at as public documents because they are required by the government.

Called up in 1940, he had the leftwing equivalent of a good war: \"I had several large-scale quarrels with authority, although I was a good and efficient soldier\". Against the party line, he refused to take a commission, but advanced rapidly from anti-aircraft gunner to gunnery sergeant-major instructor and [[regimental sergeant major]], engaged in political work wherever he went \u2013 especially, from 1943 to 1946, in India.<ref name=jisc/>\n\nWhilst in India, Saville met Nehru and leaders of the Muslim League and his friendship with Indian communist students in Britain, all from establishment families, opened most anti-imperial doors, reinforced his own firm, but no longer uncritical, convictions.
