It occurred along with elections for the [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2018|U.S. Senate]], [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maine, 2018|U.S. House]], and other state and local elections. Incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Paul LePage]] was term limited and could not seek reelection to a third consecutive term in office.\n\nThe primaries for this election were the first in Maine to be conducted with [[ranked choice voting]] (RCV), as opposed to a simple plurality, after voters passed [[Maine Question 5, 2016|a citizen referendum]] approving the change in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Maine became the first state in the country Tuesday to pass ranked choice voting|url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/11/10/maine-became-the-first-state-in-the-country-to-pass-ranked-choice-voting|accessdate=November 17, 2016|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=November 10, 2016}}</ref> An [[advisory opinion]] by the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] held that RCV would be unconstitutional for general elections for governor and the state legislature.

The Democratic candidate was [[Maine Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet T. Mills|Janet Mills]]. [[Maine State Treasurer|State Treasurer]] [[Terry Hayes (politician)|Terry Hayes]] and businessman Alan Caron had qualified for the ballot as independents, though Caron dropped out on October 29 and endorsed Mills. Former state senator and former mayor of [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] and [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] John Jenkins and perennial candidate Kenneth Capron ran write-in campaigns.\n\nMills defeated Moody and Hayes with a majority on the first count to become the first female Governor of Maine. She also became the first gubernatorial candidate to win at least 50% of the vote since [[Angus King]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], and the first non-incumbent to do so since [[Kenneth M. Curtis]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1966|1966]]. Mills also became the first Maine gubernatorial candidate to earn 300,000 votes and received more votes for governor than any other candidate in state history.\n\n==Background==\nIncumbent Republican [[Paul LePage]] is term-limited, having been elected twice consecutively in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]] and [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]]. LePage did not win a majority of the vote either time (receiving 37.6% in a crowded four-way race in 2010 and 48.2% in a three-way race in 2014), with Democrats accusing independent candidate [[Eliot Cutler]] of splitting the anti-LePage vote in both instances, though Cutler finished closer to LePage than Democratic candidate [[Libby Mitchell]] in the 2010 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republican-governors-association-exploits-its-pawn-maine|title=Republican Governors Association exploits its pawn in Maine|publisher=MSNBC|author=Steve Benen|date=October 28, 2014 |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMaine's history of governors elected without majorities, including LePage, was one impetus for the [[Maine Question 5, 2016|citizen's referendum]] to implement [[Ranked-Choice Voting|ranked choice voting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/10/27/politics/elections/maine-lawmakers-seek-to-end-strategic-voting-spoilers-with-petition-for-ranked-choice-voting/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine lawmakers seek to end strategic voting, 'spoilers' with petition for ranked-choice voting|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=October 27, 2015 |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcvmaine.com/whats_the_problem_with_our_current_voting_system|title=What's the problem with our current voting system?|publisher=The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting |accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref> Indeed, the last time a gubernatorial candidate received a majority of the vote was in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], when incumbent Governor (and current United States Senator) [[Angus King]], an independent, won reelection with 58.6% of the vote. The last time a non-incumbent candidate received more than 50% of the vote was the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1966|1966 gubernatorial election]], which Democrat [[Kenneth M. Curtis]] won over incumbent Republican [[John H. Reed]] with 53.1% of the vote.\n\nThough ranked-choice voting was approved by voters in a [[Maine Question 5, 2016|2016 referendum]], the [[Maine Legislature]] voted to delay and potentially repeal RCV for all elections after an [[advisory opinion]] by the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled it unconstitutional for general elections for state offices. RCV supporters succeeded in a people's veto effort to prevent the delay, which suspends it until a June 2018 referendum vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/02/ranked-choice-voters-submit-signatures-for-peoples-veto-ballot-initiative/|title=Ranked-choice voters submit signatures for 'people's veto' ballot initiative |date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> RCV supporters were victorious in the June referendum, and ranked-choice voting will remain in place for state and federal primaries and federal general elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/maine-lepage-ranked-choice-voting/562871/|title=Maine Voters Overrule Their Leaders|first=Russell|last=Berman|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Republican primary==\nSpeculation that U.S. Senator [[Susan Collins]] was considering running for governor arose during the 2015 [[Maine Legislature|Maine Legislative]] session when Representative [[Matt Moonen]] (D-Portland) introduced a bill to strip the governor (LePage at the time) of the power to appoint replacement U.S. Senators in the event of a vacancy and to instead have a special primary and general election.

The Democratic candidate was [[Maine Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Janet T. Mills|Janet Mills]]. [[Maine State Treasurer|State Treasurer]] [[Terry Hayes (politician)|Terry Hayes]] and businessman Alan Caron had qualified for the ballot as independents, though Caron dropped out on October 29 and endorsed Mills. Former state senator and former mayor of [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]] and [[Auburn, Maine|Auburn]] John Jenkins and perennial candidate Kenneth Capron ran write-in campaigns.\n\nMills defeated Moody and Hayes with a majority on the first count to become the first female Governor of Maine. She also became the first gubernatorial candidate to win at least 50% of the vote since [[Angus King]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], and the first non-incumbent to do so since [[Kenneth M. Curtis]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1966|1966]]. Mills also became the first Maine gubernatorial candidate to earn 300,000 votes and received more votes for governor than any other candidate in state history.\n\n==Background==\nIncumbent Republican [[Paul LePage]] is term-limited, having been elected twice consecutively in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]] and [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]]. LePage did not win a majority of the vote either time (receiving 37.6% in a crowded four-way race in 2010 and 48.2% in a three-way race in 2014), with Democrats accusing independent candidate [[Eliot Cutler]] of splitting the anti-LePage vote in both instances, though Cutler finished closer to LePage than Democratic candidate [[Libby Mitchell]] in the 2010 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/republican-governors-association-exploits-its-pawn-maine|title=Republican Governors Association exploits its pawn in Maine|publisher=MSNBC|author=Steve Benen|date=October 28, 2014 |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMaine's history of governors elected without majorities, including LePage, was one impetus for the [[Maine Question 5, 2016|citizen's referendum]] to implement [[Ranked-Choice Voting|ranked choice voting]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/10/27/politics/elections/maine-lawmakers-seek-to-end-strategic-voting-spoilers-with-petition-for-ranked-choice-voting/?ref=relatedBox|title=Maine lawmakers seek to end strategic voting, 'spoilers' with petition for ranked-choice voting|publisher=Bangor Daily News |date=October 27, 2015 |accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcvmaine.com/whats_the_problem_with_our_current_voting_system|title=What's the problem with our current voting system?|publisher=The Committee for Ranked Choice Voting |accessdate=January 29, 2018}}</ref> Indeed, the last time a gubernatorial candidate received a majority of the vote was in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 1998|1998]], when incumbent Governor (and current United States Senator) [[Angus King]], an independent, won reelection with 58.6% of the vote.

RCV supporters succeeded in a people's veto effort to prevent the delay, which suspends it until a June 2018 referendum vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressherald.com/2018/02/02/ranked-choice-voters-submit-signatures-for-peoples-veto-ballot-initiative/|title=Ranked-choice voters submit signatures for 'people's veto' ballot initiative |date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> RCV supporters were victorious in the June referendum, and ranked-choice voting will remain in place for state and federal primaries and federal general elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/maine-lepage-ranked-choice-voting/562871/|title=Maine Voters Overrule Their Leaders|first=Russell|last=Berman|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Republican primary==\nSpeculation that U.S. Senator [[Susan Collins]] was considering running for governor arose during the 2015 [[Maine Legislature|Maine Legislative]] session when Representative [[Matt Moonen]] (D-Portland) introduced a bill to strip the governor (LePage at the time) of the power to appoint replacement U.S. Senators in the event of a vacancy and to instead have a special primary and general election.

The overhaul of the Afghan electoral system prior to a new parliamentary election was a key part of the post-election power-sharing deal reached between President [[Mohammad Ashraf Ghani]] and Chief Executive [[Abdullah Abdullah]]. Whilst both agree in not holding an election before the process is overhauled, there is disagreement on how to proceed and who should oversee the process. Ghani's recommendation of Shukria Barakzai for the post was rejected by Abdullah, who saw her as being too close to Ghani. Simultaneously Abdullah has also been strongly opposed to the same officials overseeing the election as oversaw the 2014 Presidential election, due in part to the widespread belief that Ghani benefited from the 2014 elections irregularities compared to Abdullah. Tying into this is the fact that no officials from the election have been charged with any crime or removed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mashal |first=Mujib |date=19 June 2015 |title=Afghan Parliament\u2019s Term Is Extended After Squabbles Delay Elections |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/world/asia/afghan-parliaments-term-is-extended-after-squabbles-delay-elections.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref> In contrast to Abdullah's more hardline calls for total overhaul, Ghani's supporters have been more supportive of more limited reforms.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news |last=Loyn |first=David |date=14 February 2015 |title=Afghanistan's attempts to reform voting face failure |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31445182 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Issues to be addressed===\nOne of the major issues in need of reform has been voter registration. Afghan voters are currently not limited to voting in particular areas, meaning that they can use their 2001-issued voting cards in any polling station. Simultaneously there have been 3 major registrations since 2001, resulting in a total of 20 million election cards being distributed. In contrast, Afghanistan only has an estimated 12 million voters, making the number of cards in circulation a source of potential fraud. Introducing an electronic identity system is a difficult process however, with some estimating it may take up to 10 years.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nThe continuing failure to set a date for new elections or reform the system led to the United Nations Development Programme to cancel a multimillion-dollar project to fund Afghan electoral bodies in June 2015. The cut came at a time when Afghan aid projects were coming under increased scrutiny.<ref>{{cite news |last=Donati |first=Jessica |date=12 June 2015 |title=Frustrated donors end funding for Afghan parliamentary elections |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/us-afghanistan-election-idUSKBN0OS18S20150612 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, and following a 9-month delay, Ghani issued a decree establishing a 16-member commission to look into electoral reform.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rasmussen |first=Naomi |date=1 September  2015 |title=Strengthening Afghanistan\u2019s Ballot Box |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/01/strengthening-afghanistans-ballot-box/ |newspaper=Foreign Policy |location= |access-date= }}</ref> The parliaments term expired on 22 June 2015, leading President Ghani to issue a decree extending the parliament until new elections.

Amongst the proposals were calls for allotting 83, or 1/3, of the Afghan parliaments 250 seats to political parties, in accordance with the parties national results. Other proposals included the restructuring of the current election commission; the creation of a clear voter identification system ahead of future polling; and moving to an electoral system that divides provinces into smaller voting districts that can be easily quarantined in case of fraud. According to ''The New York Times'', observers felt that the proposals weighed towards the view of reform favored by Abdullah Abdullah.<ref name=\"NYT Plan\">{{cite news |last=Mashal |first=Mujib |date=31 August 2015 |title=Afghanistan\u2019s Electoral Reform Plan Is Met With Skepticism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/world/asia/afghanistans-electoral-reform-plan-is-met-with-skepticism.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location=Kabul |access-date=24 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDisagreements over the plan saw two members of the commission; Kawun Kakar and Shah Mahmood Miakhel, who are believed to be close to Mr. Ghani, walking out. Both criticised the plan for allocating party seats on the basis of a national constituency result. Instead, both felt that smaller, more local constituencies would offer a closer link between parliamentarians and the electorate, whilst they felt the suggested system discriminated in favour of larger, national parties.

The overhaul of the Afghan electoral system prior to a new parliamentary election was a key part of the post-election power-sharing deal reached between President [[Mohammad Ashraf Ghani]] and Chief Executive [[Abdullah Abdullah]]. Whilst both agree in not holding an election before the process is overhauled, there is disagreement on how to proceed and who should oversee the process. Ghani's recommendation of Shukria Barakzai for the post was rejected by Abdullah, who saw her as being too close to Ghani. Simultaneously Abdullah has also been strongly opposed to the same officials overseeing the election as oversaw the 2014 Presidential election, due in part to the widespread belief that Ghani benefited from the 2014 elections irregularities compared to Abdullah. Tying into this is the fact that no officials from the election have been charged with any crime or removed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mashal |first=Mujib |date=19 June 2015 |title=Afghan Parliament\u2019s Term Is Extended After Squabbles Delay Elections |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/20/world/asia/afghan-parliaments-term-is-extended-after-squabbles-delay-elections.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref> In contrast to Abdullah's more hardline calls for total overhaul, Ghani's supporters have been more supportive of more limited reforms.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite news |last=Loyn |first=David |date=14 February 2015 |title=Afghanistan's attempts to reform voting face failure |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-31445182 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n===Issues to be addressed===\nOne of the major issues in need of reform has been voter registration. Afghan voters are currently not limited to voting in particular areas, meaning that they can use their 2001-issued voting cards in any polling station. Simultaneously there have been 3 major registrations since 2001, resulting in a total of 20 million election cards being distributed. In contrast, Afghanistan only has an estimated 12 million voters, making the number of cards in circulation a source of potential fraud. Introducing an electronic identity system is a difficult process however, with some estimating it may take up to 10 years.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nThe continuing failure to set a date for new elections or reform the system led to the United Nations Development Programme to cancel a multimillion-dollar project to fund Afghan electoral bodies in June 2015. The cut came at a time when Afghan aid projects were coming under increased scrutiny.<ref>{{cite news |last=Donati |first=Jessica |date=12 June 2015 |title=Frustrated donors end funding for Afghan parliamentary elections |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/12/us-afghanistan-election-idUSKBN0OS18S20150612 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |location=Kabul |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nOn July 16, and following a 9-month delay, Ghani issued a decree establishing a 16-member commission to look into electoral reform.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rasmussen |first=Naomi |date=1 September  2015 |title=Strengthening Afghanistan\u2019s Ballot Box |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/01/strengthening-afghanistans-ballot-box/ |newspaper=Foreign Policy |location= |access-date= }}</ref> The parliaments term expired on 22 June 2015, leading President Ghani to issue a decree extending the parliament until new elections.

Amongst the proposals were calls for allotting 83, or 1/3, of the Afghan parliaments 250 seats to political parties, in accordance with the parties national results. Other proposals included the restructuring of the current election commission; the creation of a clear voter identification system ahead of future polling; and moving to an electoral system that divides provinces into smaller voting districts that can be easily quarantined in case of fraud. According to the ''New York Times'', observers felt that the proposals weighed towards the view of reform favored by Abdullah Abdullah.<ref name=\"NYT Plan\">{{cite news |last=Mashal |first=Mujib |date=31 August 2015 |title=Afghanistan\u2019s Electoral Reform Plan Is Met With Skepticism |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/world/asia/afghanistans-electoral-reform-plan-is-met-with-skepticism.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |location=Kabul |access-date=24 September 2015 }}</ref>\n\nDisagreements over the plan saw two members of the commission; Kawun Kakar and Shah Mahmood Miakhel, who are believed to be close to Mr. Ghani, walking out. Both criticised the plan for allocating party seats on the basis of a national constituency result. Instead, both felt that smaller, more local constituencies would offer a closer link between parliamentarians and the electorate, whilst they felt the suggested system discriminated in favour of larger, national parties.

Council of the Slovak Republic|National Council]]. The ruling left-wing populist [[Direction \u2013 Social Democracy]] (SMER\u2013SD) party remained the strongest party, but lost its majority. The [[Slovak Democratic and Christian Union \u2013 Democratic Party]] (SDK\u00da-DS) which led the government between 2000\u201306 and 2010\u201312 was defeated heavily, failing to cross the electoral threshold and losing its representation in the National Council. The centre-right [[Christian Democratic Movement]] (KDH) also failed to cross the threshold for the first time since 1990, whilst the far-right nationalist [[Kotleba \u2013 People's Party Our Slovakia]] (\u013dSNS) entered parliament for the first time.\n\n==Electoral system==\nThe 150 members of the [[National Council of the Slovak Republic|National Council]] were elected by [[proportional representation]] in a single nationwide constituency with an [[electoral threshold]] of 5% for single parties, 7% for coalitions grouping at least two parties. The elections used the [[open list]] system, with seats allocated using the [[Hagenbach-Bischoff system]]. Voters were able to cast up to four preferential votes for candidates on the list of the party they voted for.<ref>{{cite web|title=Slovakia N\u00e1rodn\u00e1 rada (National Council) Electoral System|url=http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2285_B.htm|publisher=[[Inter-Parliamentary Union]]|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nAll participating parties had to register 90 days before election day and pay a [[deposit (politics)|deposit]] of \u20ac17,000, which was refunded to all parties gaining 2% or more of the vote.

They can also be present on only one side of the body which is why these are categorized as hemispheric disconnections. The cause for hemispheric disconnection is if the interhemispheric fibers, as mentioned earlier, are cut or reduced.\n\nAn example is commissural disconnect in adults which usually results from surgical intervention, tumor, or interruption of the blood supply to the corpus callosum or the immediately adjacent structures. Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left ideomotor apraxia and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], and is relatively rare.\n\nOther examples include [[commissurotomy]], the surgical cutting of cerebral commissures to treat epilepsy and callosal agenesis which is when individuals are born without a [[corpus callosum]]. Those with callosal agenesis can still perform interhemispheric comparisons of visual and tactile information but with deficits in processing complex information when performing the respective tasks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schummer|first=Gary|date=2009|title=The Disconnection Syndrome|url=https://www.resourcenter.net/images/AAPB/Files/Biofeedback/2008/biof-36-04-157-162.pdf|journal=Biofeedback|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\n== Sensorimotor disconnection ==\nHemispheric disconnection has impacted behaviors relating to the sensory and motor systems. The different systems affected are listed below:\n\n* [[Olfaction]] \u2013 The olfactory system is not crossed across hemispheres like the other senses, which means that left input goes to the left hemisphere and right input goes to the right hemisphere. Fibers in the anterior commissure control the olfactory regions in each hemisphere. A patient who lacks an anterior commissure cannot name odors entering the right nostril or use the right hand to pick up the object corresponding to the odor because the left hemisphere, responsible for language and controlling the right hand, is disconnected from the sensory information.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology|last=Kolb and Whishaw|first=Bryan and Ian|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2009|isbn=978-0716795865|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n* [[Visual system|Vision]] \u2013 Information from one visual field travels to the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, with a commissurotomy patient, visual information presented in the left visual field travelling to the right hemisphere would be disconnected from verbal output since the left hemisphere is responsible for speech.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* [[Somatosensory system|Somatosensory]] \u2013 If the two hemispheres are disconnected, the somatosensory functions of the left and right parts of the body become independent. For example, when something is placed on the left hand of a blindfolded patient with the two hemispheres disconnected, the left hand can pick the correct object within a set of objects but the right hand cannot.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Audition]] \u2013 Though most of the input from one ear would go through the same ear, the opposite ear also receives some input. Therefore, the disconnection effects seems to be reduced in audition compared to the other systems. However, studies have shown that when the hemispheres are disconnected, the individual does not hear anything from the left and only hears from the right.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Motor system|Movement]] \u2013 [[Apraxia]] and [[agraphia]] may occur where responding to any verbal instructions by movement or writing in the left hand is inhibited because the left hand cannot receive these instructions from the right hemisphere,<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==History==\nThe concept of disconnection syndrome emerged in the late nineteenth century when scientists became aware that certain neurological disorders result from communication problems among brain areas.<ref name=\"Melillo2009\">{{cite book|author= Robert Melillo|title=Disconnected Kids: The Groundbreaking Brain Balance Program for Children with Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Other Neurological Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCdXuxkRlaoC&pg=PT14|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-01481-3|pages=14\u2013}}</ref> In 1874, [[Carl Wernicke]] introduced this concept in his dissertation when he suggested that [[conduction aphasia]] could result from the disconnection of the sensory speech zone from the motor speech area by a single lesion in the left hemisphere<ref name=\"SpreenRisser1995\" /> to the [[arcuate fasciculus]]. As the father of the disconnection theory, Wernicke believed that instead of being localized in specific regions of the brain, higher functions resulted from associative connections between the motor and sensory memory areas.\n\nLissauer, a pupil of Wernicke, described a case of [[visual agnosia]] as a disconnection between the visual and language areas.<ref name=\"Bulgheroni2011\">{{cite book|author1=Daria Riva |author2=Charles Njiokiktjien |author3=Sara Bulgheroni |title=Brain Lesion Localization and developmental Functions : Frontal lobes, Limbic system, Visuocognitive system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD9n4QbmnO0C&pg=PA3|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|isbn=978-2-7420-0825-4|pages=3\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDejerine in 1892 described specific symptoms resulting from a lesion to the corpus callosum that caused [[alexia (condition)|alexia]] without [[agraphia]]. The patient had a lesion in the left occipital lobe, blocking sight in the right visual field ([[hemianopia]]), and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Dejerine interpreted this case as a disconnection of the speech area in the left hemisphere from the right visual cortex.\n\nIn 1965, [[Norman Geschwind]], an American neurologist, wrote \u2018Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man\u2019 where he described a disconnectionist framework that revolutionized neurosciences and clinical neurology. Studies of the monkey brain led to his theory that disconnection syndromes were higher function deficits. Building on Wernicke and previously mentioned psychologists\u2019 idea that disconnection syndromes involved [[white matter]] lesion to association tracts connecting two regions of the brain, Geschwind was more detailed in explaining some disconnection syndromes as lesions of the association cortex itself, specifically in the parietal lobe. He described the callosal syndrome, an example of a disconnection syndrome, which is a lesion in the corpus callosum that leads to tactile anomia in just the patient\u2019s left hand.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThough Geschwind made significant advances in describing disconnection syndromes, he was not completely accurate. He didn\u2019t think the association cortex had any specialized role of its own besides acting as a relay station between the primary sensory and motor areas. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, Mesulam and Damasio incorporated specific functional roles for the association cortex. With Mesulam and Damasio\u2019s contributions, Geschwind\u2019s model has evolved over the past 50 years to include connections between brain regions as well as specializations of association cortices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMore recently, neurologists have been using imaging techniques such as [[Diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to visualize association pathways in the human brain to advance the future of this disconnection theme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molko|first=N.|last2=Cohen|first2=L.|last3=Mangin|first3=J.

These fibers make up the interhemispheric connections in the cortex.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCallosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left ideomotor apraxia and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], and is relatively rare.<ref>{{cite book|title=Stroke: Clinical manifestations and pathogenesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqteDvJT5oMC&pg=PA429|accessdate=4 August 2013|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-444-52004-3|pages=429\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==Hemispheric disconnection==\nMany studies have shown that disconnection syndromes such as [[aphasia]], [[agnosia]], [[apraxia]], pure [[alexia (condition)|alexia]] and many others are not caused by direct damage to functional neocortical regions. They can also be present on only one side of the body which is why these are categorized as hemispheric disconnections. The cause for hemispheric disconnection is if the interhemispheric fibers, as mentioned earlier, are cut or reduced.\n\nAn example is commissural disconnect in adults which usually results from surgical intervention, tumor, or interruption of the blood supply to the corpus callosum or the immediately adjacent structures. Callosal disconnection syndrome is characterized by left ideomotor apraxia and left-hand agraphia and/or tactile [[Anomic aphasia|anomia]], and is relatively rare.\n\nOther examples include [[commissurotomy]], the surgical cutting of cerebral commissures to treat epilepsy and callosal agenesis which is when individuals are born without a [[corpus callosum]]. Those with callosal agenesis can still perform interhemispheric comparisons of visual and tactile information but with deficits in processing complex information when performing the respective tasks.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Schummer|first=Gary|date=2009|title=The Disconnection Syndrome|url=https://www.resourcenter.net/images/AAPB/Files/Biofeedback/2008/biof-36-04-157-162.pdf|journal=Biofeedback|doi=|pmid=|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>\n\n== Sensorimotor disconnection ==\nHemispheric disconnection has impacted behaviors relating to the sensory and motor systems. The different systems affected are listed below:\n\n* [[Olfaction]] \u2013 The olfactory system is not crossed across hemispheres like the other senses, which means that left input goes to the left hemisphere and right input goes to the right hemisphere. Fibers in the anterior commissure control the olfactory regions in each hemisphere. A patient who lacks an anterior commissure cannot name odors entering the right nostril or use the right hand to pick up the object corresponding to the odor because the left hemisphere, responsible for language and controlling the right hand, is disconnected from the sensory information.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology|last=Kolb and Whishaw|first=Bryan and Ian|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2009|isbn=978-0716795865|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n* [[Visual system|Vision]] \u2013 Information from one visual field travels to the contralateral hemisphere. Therefore, with a commissurotomy patient, visual information presented in the left visual field travelling to the right hemisphere would be disconnected from verbal output since the left hemisphere is responsible for speech.<ref name=\":2\" />\n* [[Somatosensory system|Somatosensory]] \u2013 If the two hemispheres are disconnected, the somatosensory functions of the left and right parts of the body become independent. For example, when something is placed on the left hand of a blindfolded patient with the two hemispheres disconnected, the left hand can pick the correct object within a set of objects but the right hand cannot.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Audition]] \u2013 Though most of the input from one ear would go through the same ear, the opposite ear also receives some input. Therefore, the disconnection effects seems to be reduced in audition compared to the other systems. However, studies have shown that when the hemispheres are disconnected, the individual does not hear anything from the left and only hears from the right.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Motor system|Movement]] \u2013 [[Apraxia]] and [[agraphia]] may occur where responding to any verbal instructions by movement or writing in the left hand is inhibited because the left hand cannot receive these instructions from the right hemisphere,<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==History==\nThe concept of disconnection syndrome emerged in the late nineteenth century when scientists became aware that certain neurological disorders result from communication problems among brain areas.<ref name=\"Melillo2009\">{{cite book|author= Robert Melillo|title=Disconnected Kids: The Groundbreaking Brain Balance Program for Children with Autism, ADHD, Dyslexia, and Other Neurological Disorders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCdXuxkRlaoC&pg=PT14|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=6 January 2009|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-01481-3|pages=14\u2013}}</ref> In 1874, [[Carl Wernicke]] introduced this concept in his dissertation when he suggested that [[conduction aphasia]] could result from the disconnection of the sensory speech zone from the motor speech area by a single lesion in the left hemisphere<ref name=\"SpreenRisser1995\" /> to the [[arcuate fasciculus]]. As the father of the disconnection theory, Wernicke believed that instead of being localized in specific regions of the brain, higher functions resulted from associative connections between the motor and sensory memory areas.\n\nLissauer, a pupil of Wernicke, described a case of [[visual agnosia]] as a disconnection between the visual and language areas.<ref name=\"Bulgheroni2011\">{{cite book|author1=Daria Riva |author2=Charles Njiokiktjien |author3=Sara Bulgheroni |title=Brain Lesion Localization and developmental Functions : Frontal lobes, Limbic system, Visuocognitive system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD9n4QbmnO0C&pg=PA3|accessdate=4 August 2013|date=1 January 2011|publisher=John Libbey Eurotext|isbn=978-2-7420-0825-4|pages=3\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDejerine in 1892 described specific symptoms resulting from a lesion to the corpus callosum that caused [[alexia (condition)|alexia]] without [[agraphia]]. The patient had a lesion in the left occipital lobe, blocking sight in the right visual field ([[hemianopia]]), and in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Dejerine interpreted this case as a disconnection of the speech area in the left hemisphere from the right visual cortex.\n\nIn 1965, [[Norman Geschwind]], an American neurologist, wrote \u2018Disconnexion syndromes in animals and man\u2019 where he described a disconnectionist framework that revolutionized neurosciences and clinical neurology. Studies of the monkey brain led to his theory that disconnection syndromes were higher function deficits. Building on Wernicke and previously mentioned psychologists\u2019 idea that disconnection syndromes involved [[white matter]] lesion to association tracts connecting two regions of the brain, Geschwind was more detailed in explaining some disconnection syndromes as lesions of the association cortex itself, specifically in the parietal lobe. He described the callosal syndrome, an example of a disconnection syndrome, which is a lesion in the corpus callosum that leads to tactile anomia in just the patient\u2019s left hand.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThough Geschwind made significant advances in describing disconnection syndromes, he was not completely accurate. He didn\u2019t think the association cortex had any specialized role of its own besides acting as a relay station between the primary sensory and motor areas. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, Mesulam and Damasio incorporated specific functional roles for the association cortex. With Mesulam and Damasio\u2019s contributions, Geschwind\u2019s model has evolved over the past 50 years to include connections between brain regions as well as specializations of association cortices.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMore recently, neurologists have been using imaging techniques such as [[Diffusion MRI|diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to visualize association pathways in the human brain to advance the future of this disconnection theme.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molko|first=N.|last2=Cohen|first2=L.|last3=Mangin|first3=J.
