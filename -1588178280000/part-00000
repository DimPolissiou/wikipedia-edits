He is the main [[antagonist]] of the series' first part, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', appearing in the debut chapter {{Nihongo|\"Dio the Invader\"|\u4fb5\u7565\u8005\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Shinryakusha Dio}}, published in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' in 1987.<ref>{{Cite comic |cartoonist= [[Hirohiko Araki|Araki, Hirohiko]]|story= Dio the Invader|title= Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|volume= 1|issue= 1/2|date= 1 January 1987|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|location= Japan|page= 3}}</ref> He later returns, known simply as '''DIO''', as the main antagonist of the series' third part,  ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', now a powerful vampire and the user of the time-stopping [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure#Supernatural powers|Stand]] known as {{Nihongo|The World|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Za W\u0101rudo}}.\n\nIn the alternate universe of the series' seventh part, ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'', a character named {{nihongo|Diego Brando|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30b4\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc|Diego Burand\u014d}} bearing a resemblance appears as a minor antagonist.\n\nThe poor son of an abusive \"[[alcoholic]]\" who worked his mother to death, Dio holds an inordinate amount of enmity toward others. As the series' most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which manifests in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost.\n\n==Creation and design==\nWhen beginning the series Dio is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. He also revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character, and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated. In regard to Dio's characterization, Araki said that he was inspired by [[FBI method of profiling|FBI profiling]] of serial killers, admitting that in a way he thinks they must be incredibly strong to be able to commit the heinous crimes that they do. How serial killers control their victims through [[psychological manipulation]] interested Araki as well, a trait similar to how Dio uses his charisma to ensure his followers to do his bidding.<ref name=\"vizver\">{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Phantom Blood|volume=3|page=343|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-7881-1}}</ref> The author intended to characterize Dio as unapologetically baleful in his pursuit of power, with his literal abandonment of his humanity reflecting his figurative and emotional one.<ref name=\"JojoniumVol6Pg31\">{{Cite book | last= Araki|first=Hirohiko|authorlink=Hirohiko Araki|title = JoJonium|volume=6|date=2014|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|location=Japan|page=31|isbn=978-4-08-782837-5}}</ref> Araki wanted his name to sound cool next to JoJo's, so he chose Dio, the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for [[God]].<ref name=\"vizver\" />\n\nAccording to Araki, Dio's physical appearance is inspired by [[Rutger Hauer]]'s character [[Roy Batty]] from the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-02-27/hirohiko-araki-reveals-which-blade-runner-character-inspired-dio/.128280 |title=Hirohiko Araki Reveals Which Blade Runner Character Inspired DIO |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=27 February 2018 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> Throughout all his adulthood depictions, Dio possesses a towering, muscular build as impressive as that of the series' first three titular protagonists. As a vampire, he maintains messy, shoulder-length blond hair, and his various designs all feature clothing that prominently display the color [[Gold (color)|gold]].\n\nOnce Dio fuses his head to the body of Jonathan Joestar, the first protagonist of ''JoJo'', he abandons his pattern of ornate clothes in favor of simple jackets, tanktops, bracelets, and pants that continue to emphasize the color gold, while simultaneously contrasting this with the rather outlandish wardrobe choices of gold-colored elf shoes and a bright green headband, belt, and knee pads bearing heart symbols. Prior to his full reveal in ''Stardust Crusaders'', Dio appears topless during various interludes in the shadows of his mansion, his face remaining unseen until his reunion with Jean-Pierre Polnareff. After consuming the blood of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson and the second protagonist of ''JoJo'', Dio abandons his jacket and accessories while his spiked blonde hair becomes more prominent; his facial expressions become more manic in nature; and his lips gain a dark coloration. Merchandise often refers to this appearance as \"High Dio\", in reference to him describing this state as \"the ultimate high\".\n\nDio's mannerisms, such as his frequent [[Battle cry|cries]] of {{Nihongo|\"[[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]\"|\u7121\u99c4||\"useless\"}} and \"WRYYY\", have yielded several [[meme]]s and other popular culture references.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2014-06-01/.75101 |title=The Mike Toole Show - Jojo's Mojo |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=1 June 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/04/09/spotted-in-japan-seriously-stylish-japannequins/|title=Spotted in Japan: seriously stylish Japannequins|last=Clegg|first=Cara|date=9 April 2015|work=RocketNews24|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> It has become popular to the point where the word \"Muda\" is used untranslated by English voice actors in the OVA and anime, but only as a battle cry.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Phantom Blood''===\nIn ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', the child of an abusive drunkard named Dario Brando, Dio Brando becomes the adopted brother of Jonathan Joestar by using the promise that George Joestar made to Dario years ago. Upon entering the Joestar estate after his father died, Dio wasted no time unequivocally making young Jonathan's life a living hell to take everything from him including abusing Jonathan's dog.But Dio underestimated Jonathan's retaliation for forcefully kissing his beloved Erina Pendleton, spending the next seven years feigning to be Jonathan's friend before enacting his plan to steal the Joestar fortune by poisoning George with the same poison he used to kill Dario. When Jonathan investigates the matter for proof, Dio plots to use an ancient [[Aztec]] stone mask to murder Jonathan.\n\nHowever, Dio learns the mask transforms the wearer into a vampire when exposed to blood, and uses it on himself when his scheme is exposed. Although seemingly killed when Jonathan impales him on a stone statue and leaves him in the burning Joestar mansion, Dio survives, and proceeds to start his subjugation of England in the small village of Windknight's Lot, amassing sired followers to his cause. Jonathan is sought out by William Zeppeli, a master of an ancient martial art called Hamon, which can kill Vampires, and he teaches Jonathan how to use this ability as Dio sends other vampires and zombies in his pursuit to kill him so he can take over the world.\n\nJonathan seemingly kills him once more, but Dio's head survives. With the help of his servant, Wang Chan, Dio attacks Jonathan on his honeymoon with Erina in an attempt to claim his enemy's body for his own. Despite having his throat fatally punctured by Dio, Jonathan is able to use Hamon one last time to overload the ship's engines, with Dio apparently destroyed in the resulting explosion. Erina, escaping unharmed with an orphaned girl, survives with their unborn son.\n\n===''Battle Tendency''===\nDio Brando does not appear in ''[[Battle Tendency]]'', but the aftermath of his apparent death at the hands of Jonathan Joestar affects the plot. It is ultimately revealed that Jonathan and Erina's son George Joestar II, a famed pilot of the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[World War I]], was murdered by one of Dio's zombie henchmen who survived the battle of Knight's Lot and had infiltrated the RAF. George II's wife, the orphaned girl Elizabeth, hunted down this zombie and killed him with her Hamon. But as no one in the RAF knew that her victim was not human, she became a wanted murderer, Elizabeth was forced to go into hiding as Lisa Lisa. Lisa Lisa would later encounter her son [[Joseph Joestar]], teaching him Hamon so he can defeat the Pillar Man, Kars, whose creation of the Stone masks made him indirectly responsible for Dio's transformation.\n\n===''Stardust Crusaders''===\nIt is revealed in ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' that Dio survived the ship's explosion and attached his head to Jonathan's headless body as the ship sank, confining himself in a casket at the bottom of the ocean for a century until a shipwreck salvage operation retrieved him in 1983. Dio soon meets the mystic Enya Geil who awakens his \"[[JoJo's Bizzare Adventure#Supernatural Powers|Stand]]\" , {{Nihongo|The World|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Za W\u0101rudo}}, allowing the newly dubbed \"DIO\" to stop the passage of time around him. As his head is attached to Jonathan Joestar's body, it awakens Stand abilities in all of Jonathan's living descendants. While Joseph Joestar and his grandson [[Jotaro Kujo]] have the resolve to control their Stands, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother Holly has her very life sapped away because of her kind disposition. This spurs Jotaro and Joseph to track down Dio along with friends Mohammed Avdol, Noriaki Kakyoin, Jean-Pierre Polnareff, and Iggy the Boston Terrier to kill him once and for all, freeing Holly from the curse the Stand has trapped her under.\n\nDio responds by preemptively trying to assassinate the Joestars before they can find him in his lair in Cairo, sending other evil Stand users, some of whom he controlled mentally before they joined the Joestars on their journey. Along the way, Avdol and Iggy are killed by Dio's right hand Vanilla Ice, who in turn is killed by Polnareff. Dio kills Jotaro's friend Kakyoin in combat and nearly kills Joseph after draining him of his blood, but Jotaro's own Stand Star Platinum proves to be The World's equally powered counterpart, and Jotaro's own rage at Dio being the cause of his friends' deaths and his mother's dwindling health leads him to kill Dio with Star Platinum. After the Speedwagon Foundation restores Joseph's blood, he and Jotaro take Jonathan's infected body out into the desert and expose it to sunlight, vanquishing the evil vampire once and for all.\n\n===''Diamond Is Unbreakable'' and ''Golden Wind''===\nDio is not present in either ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' or ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', but his influence on the story is still present. In ''Diamond Is Unbreakable'', it is revealed that Dio acquired his Stand by means of an ancient artifact known as the \"Bow and Arrow\", and this has reappeared in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh because the children of one of Dio's former lackeys, Mr. Nijimura are seeking out someone who can possibly free their father from the strange mutation he has suffered as a result of Dio's death. In ''Golden Wind'', the protagonist [[Giorno Giovanna]] is Dio's son, but because Dio was in possession of Jonathan's body at the time of Giorno's conception, Giorno is biologically Jonathan's son and thus a member of the Joestar family, and his own virtuous soul prevents him from becoming evil as Dio was, thanks to his encounter with a heroic gangster in his childhood life.\n\n===''Stone Ocean''===\nDio's influence on the ''JoJo'' story returns in ''[[Stone Ocean]]'', where it is revealed that he met the story arc's main antagonist Father Enrico Pucci during the events of ''Stardust Crusaders''. He told Father Pucci of his desire to use his Stand The World in order to reach \"Heaven\", and saw in the young priest a friendship that would help him achieve his goals. Father Pucci's reverence for Dio drives him to carry out his plans decades later, manipulating events to frame Jotaro Kujo's daughter [[Jolyne Cujoh]] for murder in order to trap her in the prison where he serves as a chaplain, using the final physical remains of Dio to evolve his Stand to reset reality in what he believes is Dio's vision of Heaven, a world where everyone knows their own destiny, and more importantly a world free of the Joestar bloodline. However, his hubris leads to his defeat at the hands of Jolyne's last surviving friend Emporio, who manages to reset reality back to what it once was, but not quite exactly the way it was before.\n\n===''Steel Ball Run''===\nDio Brando himself does not appear in ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'', set in an alternate universe in 1890, but an alternate version of himself known as Diego Brando does. Diego Brando is, like his original counterpart, the child of an abusive household, and one who reveres his mother. She instilled in him a sense of pride that he took with him as he became a masterful jockey in his adulthood. When he decides to take part in the Steel Ball Run horse race across the United States, he winds up under the thrall of the Stand {{nihongo|Scary Monsters|\u30b9\u30b1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Sukear\u012b Monsut\u0101zu}}, transforming him into a [[dromaeosaurid]] dinosaur. As a result of this encounter, however, he gains his own Stand Scary Monsters, which grants him the same abilities that he now has under his control.\n\nDiego is hired by United States President Funny Valentine in his quest to seek out the pieces of the Saint's Corpse scattered along the race course, but after some time fighting against the heroes Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli, he realizes that President Valentine's plans are more dangerous to the world as a whole and joins the heroes in an attempt to stop him, only to die during his attempt to kill the evil President.\n\nValentine then uses his Stand's powers to summon a Diego Brando from an alternate universe. This Diego Brando's possesses the same stand powers as Dio, thanks to having his own version of The World as a Stand. He manages to defeat Johnny Joestar in battle, and wins the Steel Ball Run, in addition to obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse and hiding it in a secure location, even though President Valentine has already been killed by Johnny in a fight. However, this alternate universe Diego meets his demise at the hands of Lucy Steel, who uses the skull of this universe's Diego Brando to obliterate his own head as a result of the effects of Valentine's Stand.\n\n===In other media===\nDio Brando has appeared in many video games related to the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' franchise, usually as a [[Playable character|player character]] or a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Some games include multiple versions of the character; in ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven]]'' for example, both Dio Brando from Part 1 and Dio from Part 3 are playable characters, along with Diego Brando and Parallel World Diego from Part 7. Furthermore, he has appeared as a playable character in several crossover video games, such as ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', and ''[[Jump Force]]''.\n\nDio is the main antagonist in the story mode of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven''. Although the video game begins with the final scenes of ''Stardust Crusaders'', the antagonist is a version of Dio from another universe who managed to beat the Joestar family. He seeks to control all universes by means of the [[Steel Ball Run#Saint's Corpse|Saint's Corpse]], and uses his more advanced powers over time to bring all of the fallen heroes and villains back to life to serve him in preventing [[Jotaro Kujo]] and the other Joestars from obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse, or at least using them to gather the parts so he can steal them from them and achieve his ultimate power. This version of Dio is called {{Nihongo|\"Dio, Gone to Heaven\"<!--Do not change; this is the translation used in the official English release-->|\u5929\u56fd\u306b\u5230\u9054\u3057\u305fDIO|Tengoku ni T\u014dtatsu-shita Dio}} and his Stand is called {{Nihongo|\"The World Over Heaven\"|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Za W\u0101rudo \u014cb\u0101 Hebun}}.\n\n==Abilities==\nAbove all else, Dio Brando is known for his cunning and careful consideration.<ref name=\"JojoniumVol6Pg31\" /> It is when Jonathan Joestar defies his expectations, defeating him in battle and thwarting his deliberate machinations, that Dio dons the Stone Mask that grants him the power of a [[vampire]]. He attains superhuman speed, regeneration, and strength insofar as he can lift a [[road roller]] with ease - a frequent source of references to Dio in popular culture.\n\nAs a vampire, he most frequently uses an exaggerated [[Evaporative cooler|evaporated cooling]] form of [[freezing]] known simply as the {{Nihongo|''Vaporative Freezing Technique''|\u6c17\u5316\u51b7\u51cd\u6cd5|Kikareit\u014dh\u014d}} that allows him to freeze his opponents while rendering direct attacks with Hamon useless. Another vampiric technique available to Dio is {{Nihongo|''Space Ripper Stingy Eyes''|{{ruby-ja|\u7a7a\u88c2\u773c\u523a\u9a5a|\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ae\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30ba}}|Sup\u0113su Rip\u0101 Suting\u012b Aizu}} that allows him to shoot two pressurized fluid jets from his eyes. He can also [[Graft (surgery)|graft]] body parts of different beings together, an ability he used to take Jonathan Joestar's headless body as his own.\n\nOnce he returns 100 years later with Jonathan's body, Dio lost many of the abilities he had in his original body. Despite this, Dio's new zombified body enabled him to develop his signature Stand, {{Nihongo|The World|{{ruby-ja|\u4e16\u754c|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9}}|Za W\u0101rudo}}, once it was pierced by the Bow and Arrow. As a psychic manifestation of Dio, it has all of his aforementioned superhuman abilities and facilitates melee attacks, though its signature ability is to stop time. This time-stopping ability only lasts for a limited amount of time, though this limit can be extended through practice or through other means of increasing the user's strength (such as when Dio was able to increase his limit by several seconds after drinking Joseph Joestar's blood).\n\n===''Steel Ball Run''===\nDio's Part 7 counterpart, Diego Brando, first encounters {{Nihongo|Scary Monsters|\u30b9\u30b1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Sukear\u012b Monsut\u0101zu}} when he comes into conflict with its original user Dr. Ferdinand, Ferdinand \"infects\" Diego, as well as an entire village, transforming them into [[dinosaur]]s. After gaining the Left Eye Corpse Part, Diego gains his own version of Scary Monsters that allows him to transform into a dinosaur, partially or entirely. Scary Monsters grants Diego increased strength, speed, and \"dynamic vision\", and retains the infection ability.\n\nAfter Diego's death by the hands of Funny Valentine, Valentine summons a Diego from an alternate universe. This Diego possesses The World like Part 3's Dio, and can also stop time. The design of Diego's The World is very similar to that of Part 3, apart from its skinnier profile.\n\n==Voice actors==\nDio Brando has had many different voice actors in different types of media. He was first voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] in drama CDs, followed by Nobuo Tanaka in [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (OVA)|the OVAs]] and [[Isshin Chiba]] in the [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (video game)|Capcom fighting game]]. He has been voiced by [[Kenji Nojima]] and [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] in both the [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood (film)|''Phantom Blood'' animated film]] and video game as the younger and older incarnations, respectively. In the television anime and in video games released after the anime aired, such as ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle|All Star Battle]],'' ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven|Eyes of Heaven]],'' and ''[[Jump Force]],'' Dio Brando is voiced by [[Takehito Koyasu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-01-07/crunchyroll-to-stream-jojo-bizarre-adventure-stardust-crusaders-egypt-arc-tv-anime/.83020|title=Crunchyroll to Stream JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders Egypt Arc TV Anime|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nDio has only ever had two English voice actors; he was voiced by [[Kid Beyond]] in the OVAs<ref name=\"twitter.com\">{{cite web |title=Kid Beyond on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/kidbeyond/status/613851418722578432 |website=Twitter |accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref> and by [[Patrick Seitz]] in the TV anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-10/anime-expo-to-premiere-english-jojo-bizarre-adventure-dub-with-director-naokatsu-tsuda/.89098|title=Anime Expo to Premiere English JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Dub With Director Naokatsu Tsuda|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is the main [[antagonist]] of the series' first part, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', appearing in the debut chapter {{Nihongo|\"Dio the Invader\"|\u4fb5\u7565\u8005\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa|Shinryakusha Dio}}, published in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' in 1987.<ref>{{Cite comic |cartoonist= [[Hirohiko Araki|Araki, Hirohiko]]|story= Dio the Invader|title= Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump|volume= 1|issue= 1/2|date= 1 January 1987|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|location= Japan|page= 3}}</ref> He later returns, known simply as '''DIO''', as the main antagonist of the series' third part,  ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', now a powerful vampire and the user of the time-stopping [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure#Supernatural powers|Stand]] known as {{Nihongo|The World|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Za W\u0101rudo}}.\n\nIn the alternate universe of the series' seventh part, ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'', a character named {{nihongo|Diego Brando|\u30c7\u30a3\u30a8\u30b4\u30fb\u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30fc|Diego Burand\u014d}} bearing a resemblance appears as a minor antagonist.\n\nThe poor son of an abusive \"[[alcoholic]]\" who worked his mother to death, Dio holds an inordinate amount of enmity toward others. As the series' most prolific villain, his defining trait is his staunch ambition, which manifests in a peerless desire for power, no matter the cost.\n\n==Creation and design==\nWhen beginning the series Dio is the character that Araki looked forward to drawing the most. He also revealed that he had not thought up a weakness for the character, and that it was difficult to come up with a way for Dio to be defeated. In regard to Dio's characterization, Araki said that he was inspired by [[FBI method of profiling|FBI profiling]] of serial killers, admitting that in a way he thinks they must be incredibly strong to be able to commit the heinous crimes that they do. How serial killers control their victims through [[psychological manipulation]] interested Araki as well, a trait similar to how Dio uses his charisma to ensure his followers to do his bidding.<ref name=\"vizver\">{{cite book |author=Araki, Hirohiko|title=JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Part 1 Phantom Blood|volume=3|page=343|date=February 3, 2015|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|isbn=978-1-4215-7881-1}}</ref> The author intended to characterize Dio as unapologetically baleful in his pursuit of power, with his literal abandonment of his humanity reflecting his figurative and emotional one.<ref name=\"JojoniumVol6Pg31\">{{Cite book | last= Araki|first=Hirohiko|authorlink=Hirohiko Araki|title = JoJonium|volume=6|date=2014|publisher= [[Shueisha]]|location=Japan|page=31|isbn=978-4-08-782837-5}}</ref> Araki wanted his name to sound cool next to JoJo's, so he chose Dio, the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for [[God]].<ref name=\"vizver\" />\n\nAccording to Araki, Dio's physical appearance is inspired by [[Rutger Hauer]]'s character [[Roy Batty]] from the 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2018-02-27/hirohiko-araki-reveals-which-blade-runner-character-inspired-dio/.128280 |title=Hirohiko Araki Reveals Which Blade Runner Character Inspired DIO |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=27 February 2018 |accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref> Throughout all his adulthood depictions, Dio possesses a towering, muscular build as impressive as that of the series' first three titular protagonists. As a vampire, he maintains messy, shoulder-length blond hair, and his various designs all feature clothing that prominently display the color [[Gold (color)|gold]].\n\nOnce Dio fuses his head to the body of Jonathan Joestar, the first protagonist of ''JoJo'', he abandons his pattern of ornate clothes in favor of simple jackets, tanktops, bracelets, and pants that continue to emphasize the color gold, while simultaneously contrasting this with the rather outlandish wardrobe choices of gold-colored elf shoes and a bright green headband, belt, and knee pads bearing heart symbols. Prior to his full reveal in ''Stardust Crusaders'', Dio appears topless during various interludes in the shadows of his mansion, his face remaining unseen until his reunion with Jean-Pierre Polnareff. After consuming the blood of Joseph Joestar, Jonathan's grandson and the second protagonist of ''JoJo'', Dio abandons his jacket and accessories while his spiked blonde hair becomes more prominent; his facial expressions become more manic in nature; and his lips gain a dark coloration. Merchandise often refers to this appearance as \"High Dio\", in reference to him describing this state as \"the ultimate high\".\n\nDio's mannerisms, such as his frequent [[Battle cry|cries]] of {{Nihongo|\"[[Muda (Japanese term)|Muda]]\"|\u7121\u99c4||\"useless\"}} and \"WRYYY\", have yielded several [[meme]]s and other popular culture references.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2014-06-01/.75101 |title=The Mike Toole Show - Jojo's Mojo |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=1 June 2014 |accessdate=8 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2015/04/09/spotted-in-japan-seriously-stylish-japannequins/|title=Spotted in Japan: seriously stylish Japannequins|last=Clegg|first=Cara|date=9 April 2015|work=RocketNews24|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> It has become popular to the point where the word \"Muda\" is used untranslated by English voice actors in the OVA and anime, but only as a battle cry.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===''Phantom Blood''===\nIn ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', the child of an abusive drunkard named Dario Brando, Dio Brando becomes the adopted brother of Jonathan Joestar by using the promise that George Joestar made to Dario years ago. Upon entering the Joestar estate after his father died, Dio wasted no time unequivocally making young Jonathan's life a living hell to take everything from him including abusing Jonathan's dog.But Dio underestimated Jonathan's retaliation for forcefully kissing his beloved Erina Pendleton, spending the next seven years feigning to be Jonathan's friend before enacting his plan to steal the Joestar fortune by poisoning George with the same poison he used to kill Dario. When Jonathan investigates the matter for proof, Dio plots to use an ancient [[Aztec]] stone mask to murder Jonathan.\n\nHowever, Dio learns the mask transforms the wearer into a vampire when exposed to blood, and uses it on himself when his scheme is exposed. Although seemingly killed when Jonathan impales him on a stone statue and leaves him in the burning Joestar mansion, Dio survives, and proceeds to start his subjugation of England in the small village of Windknight's Lot, amassing sired followers to his cause. Jonathan is sought out by William Zeppeli, a master of an ancient martial art called Hamon, which can kill Vampires, and he teaches Jonathan how to use this ability as Dio sends other vampires and zombies in his pursuit to kill him so he can take over the world.\n\nJonathan seemingly kills him once more, but Dio's head survives. With the help of his servant, Wang Chan, Dio attacks Jonathan on his honeymoon with Erina in an attempt to claim his enemy's body for his own. Despite having his throat fatally punctured by Dio, Jonathan is able to use Hamon one last time to overload the ship's engines, with Dio apparently destroyed in the resulting explosion. Erina, escaping unharmed with an orphaned girl, survives with their unborn son.\n\n===''Battle Tendency''===\nDio Brando does not appear in ''[[Battle Tendency]]'', but the aftermath of his apparent death at the hands of Jonathan Joestar affects the plot. It is ultimately revealed that Jonathan and Erina's son George Joestar II, a famed pilot of the [[Royal Air Force]] in [[World War I]], was murdered by one of Dio's zombie henchmen who survived the battle of Knight's Lot and had infiltrated the RAF. George II's wife, the orphaned girl Elizabeth, hunted down this zombie and killed him with her Hamon. But as no one in the RAF knew that her victim was not human, she became a wanted murderer, Elizabeth was forced to go into hiding as Lisa Lisa. Lisa Lisa would later encounter her son [[Joseph Joestar]], teaching him Hamon so he can defeat the Pillar Man, Kars, whose creation of the Stone masks made him indirectly responsible for Dio's transformation.\n\n===''Stardust Crusaders''===\nIt is revealed in ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' that Dio survived the ship's explosion and attached his head to Jonathan's headless body as the ship sank, confining himself in a casket at the bottom of the ocean for a century until a shipwreck salvage operation retrieved him in 1983. Dio soon meets the mystic Enya Geil who awakens his \"[[JoJo's Bizzare Adventure#Supernatural Powers|Stand]]\" , {{Nihongo|The World|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9|Za W\u0101rudo}}, allowing the newly dubbed \"DIO\" to stop the passage of time around him. As his head is attached to Jonathan Joestar's body, it awakens Stand abilities in all of Jonathan's living descendants. While Joseph Joestar and his grandson [[Jotaro Kujo]] have the resolve to control their Stands, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother Holly has her very life sapped away because of her kind disposition. This spurs Jotaro and Joseph to track down Dio along with friends Mohammed Avdol, Noriaki Kakyoin, Jean-Pierre Polnareff, and Iggy the Boston Terrier to kill him once and for all, freeing Holly from the curse the Stand has trapped her under.\n\nDio responds by preemptively trying to assassinate the Joestars before they can find him in his lair in Cairo, sending other evil Stand users, some of whom he controlled mentally before they joined the Joestars on their journey. Along the way, Avdol and Iggy are killed by Dio's right hand Vanilla Ice, who in turn is killed by Polnareff. Dio kills Jotaro's friend Kakyoin in combat and nearly kills Joseph after draining him of his blood, but Jotaro's own Stand Star Platinum proves to be The World's equally powered counterpart, and Jotaro's own rage at Dio being the cause of his friends' deaths and his mother's dwindling health leads him to kill Dio with Star Platinum. After the Speedwagon Foundation restores Joseph's blood, he and Jotaro take Jonathan's infected body out into the desert and expose it to sunlight, vanquishing the evil vampire once and for all.\n\n===''Diamond Is Unbreakable'' and ''Golden Wind''===\nDio is not present in either ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' or ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', but his influence on the story is still present. In ''Diamond Is Unbreakable'', it is revealed that Dio acquired his Stand by means of an ancient artifact known as the \"Bow and Arrow\", and this has reappeared in the fictional Japanese town of Morioh because the children of one of Dio's former lackeys, Mr. Nijimura are seeking out someone who can possibly free their father from the strange mutation he has suffered as a result of Dio's death. In ''Golden Wind'', the protagonist [[Giorno Giovanna]] is Dio's son, but because Dio was in possession of Jonathan's body at the time of Giorno's conception, Giorno is biologically Jonathan's son and thus a member of the Joestar family, and his own virtuous soul prevents him from becoming evil as Dio was, thanks to his encounter with a heroic gangster in his childhood life.\n\n===''Stone Ocean''===\nDio's influence on the ''JoJo'' story returns in ''[[Stone Ocean]]'', where it is revealed that he met the story arc's main antagonist Father Enrico Pucci during the events of ''Stardust Crusaders''. He told Father Pucci of his desire to use his Stand The World in order to reach \"Heaven\", and saw in the young priest a friendship that would help him achieve his goals. Father Pucci's reverence for Dio drives him to carry out his plans decades later, manipulating events to frame Jotaro Kujo's daughter [[Jolyne Cujoh]] for murder in order to trap her in the prison where he serves as a chaplain, using the final physical remains of Dio to evolve his Stand to reset reality in what he believes is Dio's vision of Heaven, a world where everyone knows their own destiny, and more importantly a world free of the Joestar bloodline. However, his hubris leads to his defeat at the hands of Jolyne's last surviving friend Emporio, who manages to reset reality back to what it once was, but not quite exactly the way it was before.\n\n===''Steel Ball Run''===\nDio Brando himself does not appear in ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'', set in an alternate universe in 1890, but an alternate version of himself known as Diego Brando does. Diego Brando is, like his original counterpart, the child of an abusive household, and one who reveres his mother. She instilled in him a sense of pride that he took with him as he became a masterful jockey in his adulthood. When he decides to take part in the Steel Ball Run horse race across the United States, he winds up under the thrall of the Stand {{nihongo|Scary Monsters|\u30b9\u30b1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Sukear\u012b Monsut\u0101zu}}, transforming him into a [[dromaeosaurid]] dinosaur. As a result of this encounter, however, he gains his own Stand Scary Monsters, which grants him the same abilities that he now has under his control.\n\nDiego is hired by United States President Funny Valentine in his quest to seek out the pieces of the Saint's Corpse scattered along the race course, but after some time fighting against the heroes Johnny Joestar and Gyro Zeppeli, he realizes that President Valentine's plans are more dangerous to the world as a whole and joins the heroes in an attempt to stop him, only to die during his attempt to kill the evil President.\n\nValentine then uses his Stand's powers to summon a Diego Brando from an alternate universe. This Diego Brando's possesses the same stand powers as Dio, thanks to having his own version of The World as a Stand. He manages to defeat Johnny Joestar in battle, and wins the Steel Ball Run, in addition to obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse and hiding it in a secure location, even though President Valentine has already been killed by Johnny in a fight. However, this alternate universe Diego meets his demise at the hands of Lucy Steel, who uses the skull of this universe's Diego Brando to obliterate his own head as a result of the effects of Valentine's Stand.\n\n===In other media===\nDio Brando has appeared in many video games related to the ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' franchise, usually as a [[Playable character|player character]] or a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Some games include multiple versions of the character; in ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven]]'' for example, both Dio Brando from Part 1 and Dio from Part 3 are playable characters, along with Diego Brando and Parallel World Diego from Part 7. Furthermore, he has appeared as a playable character in several crossover video games, such as ''[[Jump Super Stars]]'', ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'', and ''[[Jump Force]]''.\n\nDio is the main antagonist in the story mode of ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven''. Although the video game begins with the final scenes of ''Stardust Crusaders'', the antagonist is a version of Dio from another universe who managed to beat the Joestar family. He seeks to control all universes by means of the [[Steel Ball Run#Saint's Corpse|Saint's Corpse]], and uses his more advanced powers over time to bring all of the fallen heroes and villains back to life to serve him in preventing [[Jotaro Kujo]] and the other Joestars from obtaining all of the Saint's Corpse, or at least using them to gather the parts so he can steal them from them and achieve his ultimate power. This version of Dio is called {{Nihongo|\"Dio, Gone to Heaven\"<!--Do not change; this is the translation used in the official English release-->|\u5929\u56fd\u306b\u5230\u9054\u3057\u305fDIO|Tengoku ni T\u014dtatsu-shita Dio}} and his Stand is called {{Nihongo|\"The World Over Heaven\"|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30fb\u30aa\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Za W\u0101rudo \u014cb\u0101 Hebun}}.\n\n==Abilities==\nAbove all else, Dio Brando is known for his cunning and careful consideration.<ref name=\"JojoniumVol6Pg31\" /> It is when Jonathan Joestar defies his expectations, defeating him in battle and thwarting his deliberate machinations, that Dio dons the Stone Mask that grants him the power of a [[vampire]]. He attains superhuman speed, regeneration, and strength insofar as he can lift a [[road roller]] with ease - a frequent source of references to Dio in popular culture.\n\nAs a vampire, he most frequently uses an exaggerated [[Evaporative cooler|evaporated cooling]] form of [[freezing]] known simply as the {{Nihongo|''Vaporative Freezing Technique''|\u6c17\u5316\u51b7\u51cd\u6cd5|Kikareit\u014dh\u014d}} that allows him to freeze his opponents while rendering direct attacks with Hamon useless. Another vampiric technique available to Dio is {{Nihongo|''Space Ripper Stingy Eyes''|{{ruby-ja|\u7a7a\u88c2\u773c\u523a\u9a5a|\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30d1\u30fc\u30fb\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30ae\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30ba}}|Sup\u0113su Rip\u0101 Suting\u012b Aizu}} that allows him to shoot two pressurized fluid jets from his eyes. He can also [[Graft (surgery)|graft]] body parts of different beings together, an ability he used to take Jonathan Joestar's headless body as his own.\n\nOnce he returns 100 years later with Jonathan's body, Dio lost many of the abilities he had in his original body. Despite this, Dio's new zombified body enabled him to develop his signature Stand, {{Nihongo|The World|{{ruby-ja|\u4e16\u754c|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9}}|Za W\u0101rudo}}, once it was pierced by the Bow and Arrow. As a psychic manifestation of Dio, it has all of his aforementioned superhuman abilities and facilitates melee attacks, though its signature ability is to stop time. This time-stopping ability only lasts for a limited amount of time, though this limit can be extended through practice or through other means of increasing the user's strength (such as when Dio was able to increase his limit by several seconds after drinking Joseph Joestar's blood).\n\n===''Steel Ball Run''===\nDio's Part 7 counterpart, Diego Brando, first encounters {{Nihongo|Scary Monsters|\u30b9\u30b1\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba|Sukear\u012b Monsut\u0101zu}} when he comes into conflict with its original user Dr. Ferdinand, Ferdinand \"infects\" Diego, as well as an entire village, transforming them into [[dinosaur]]s. After gaining the Left Eye Corpse Part, Diego gains his own version of Scary Monsters that allows him to transform into a dinosaur, partially or entirely. Scary Monsters grants Diego increased strength, speed, and \"dynamic vision\", and retains the infection ability.\n\nAfter Diego's death by the hands of Funny Valentine, Valentine summons a Diego from an alternate universe. This Diego possesses The World like Part 3's Dio, and can also stop time. The design of Diego's The World is very similar to that of Part 3, apart from its skinnier profile.\n\n==Voice actors==\nDio Brando has had many different voice actors in different types of media. He was first voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] in drama CDs, followed by Nobuo Tanaka in [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (OVA)|the OVAs]] and [[Isshin Chiba]] in the [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (video game)|Capcom fighting game]]. He has been voiced by [[Kenji Nojima]] and [[Hikaru Midorikawa]] in both the [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood (film)|''Phantom Blood'' animated film]] and video game as the younger and older incarnations, respectively. In the television anime and in video games released after the anime aired, such as ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle|All Star Battle]],'' ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven|Eyes of Heaven]],'' and ''[[Jump Force]],'' Dio Brando is voiced by [[Takehito Koyasu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-01-07/crunchyroll-to-stream-jojo-bizarre-adventure-stardust-crusaders-egypt-arc-tv-anime/.83020|title=Crunchyroll to Stream JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders Egypt Arc TV Anime|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=7 January 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nDio has only ever had two English voice actors; he was voiced by [[Kid Beyond]] in the OVAs<ref name=\"twitter.com\">{{cite web |title=Kid Beyond on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/kidbeyond/status/613851418722578432 |website=Twitter |accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref> and by [[Patrick Seitz]] in the TV anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-06-10/anime-expo-to-premiere-english-jojo-bizarre-adventure-dub-with-director-naokatsu-tsuda/.89098|title=Anime Expo to Premiere English JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Dub With Director Naokatsu Tsuda|work=[[Anime News Network]]|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is a study of the lowest depths of showbiz and its sleazy inhabitants \u2013 the dark, shadowy world of a second rate [[carnival]] filled with hustlers, scheming [[confidence trick|grifters]], and Machiavellian [[femme fatale|femmes fatales]].\n\nGresham attributed the origin of ''Nightmare Alley'' to conversations he had with a former carnival worker while they were both serving as volunteers with the Loyalist forces in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Gresham wrote the novel, his first, while working as an editor for a \"true crime,\" pulp magazine in New York City during the 1940s. He outlined the plot and wrote the first six chapters over a period of two years, then finished the book in four months. Each chapter is represented by a different [[Tarot card]].\n\n==Plot==\nStanton Carlisle watches the [[geek show]] at a [[Ten-in-One]] where he has recently begun working. He later asks the carnival's [[carnival barker|talker]] Clem Hoately where geeks come from. Clem explains that geeks are \"made\": a sideshow owner finds an alcoholic [[Homelessness|bum]] and offers him a temporary job with a steady supply of liquor. Initially, the bum is only asked to pretend to be a geek, using a razor blade to slice chickens' necks and then faking the drinking of the blood. After a few weeks, the owner threatens to end the job and replace the bum with a \"real\" geek, and the fear of sobering up terrifies the bum into actually biting the chickens. Thus, a geek is made.\n\nStan performs [[sleight of hand]] tricks in the [[sideshow]] but studies under the carnival's [[mentalist]] Zeena to learn a refined \"code\" act, where performers [[Mnemonist|memorize verbal cues]] that allow them to appear [[psychic]] by accurately answering written audience questions. Stan also begins to pick up Zeena's talent for [[cold reading]]. He eventually leaves the carnival with beautiful and na\u00efve electric girl,<ref>{{cite book |page=248 |title=Secrets of the Sideshows |author=Joe Nickell |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-8131-2358-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sACcmMWM6t4C&pg=PA248#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Molly Cahill to perform a team code act.\n\nTheir act becomes very successful, but Stan grows bored and transforms himself into Reverend Carlisle, an upstanding [[Spiritualist]] preacher offering [[s\u00e9ance]] sessions with the help of his [[mediumship|medium]] (Molly, appearing as \"Miss Cahill\" to obfuscate their relationship). Stan gains a devoted following, but the stress of leading a false life leads him to seek the help of a [[psychologist]] named Lilith Ritter, who seduces and then begins controlling him. Stan pleads constantly for them to go away together, and Lilith eventually agrees, suggesting the Rev. Carlisle swindle a rich man for the getaway money. They settle on Ezra Grindle, a ruthless [[Business magnate|auto tycoon]] with a [[Skepticism|skeptical]] interest in the [[occult]]. Stan manages to convince Grindle of his powers, and the businessman becomes a devoted spiritualist.\n\nStan keeps Grindle hooked by promising to reunite him with his deceased college sweetheart Dorrie, who died in a botched [[Unsafe abortion|back-alley abortion]] Grindle convinced her to seek. A reluctant Molly plays \"Dorrie\" in a series of sessions but eventually breaks character, destroying the illusion, and Grindle vows revenge for Stan's lies. Stan tells Molly to go back to carnival life. At Lilith's suggestion he decides to go into hiding with Grindle's money but later discovers that Lilith has stolen a majority of it by replacing the five hundred dollar bills with singles. When he confronts her, she tells him that he is deluded and attempts to have him committed to a mental institution, and he narrowly escapes. He flees and resorts to performing as a mentalist at increasingly shoddy venues, barely evading the men Grindle continually sends after him. Eventually he becomes a hobo, staying afloat by giving Tarot readings and selling [[horoscopes]]. He descends into alcoholism and depression when he discovers through a newspaper article that Lilith has wed Grindle.\n\nHis life in shambles, Stan finds a carnival owner and asks to join the sideshow as a palm reader. The owner gives Stan some whiskey but refuses his proposal, saying the show is full. But as Stan begins to drunkenly stumble out, the owner changes his tune and invites Stan back in with a job offer: \"Of course, it's only temporary \u2013 just until we get a real geek.\"\n\n==Reception==\nIn a 2010 review, the [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning book critic [[Michael Dirda]] proclaimed, \"I was utterly unprepared for its raw, Dostoevskian power...

Each chapter is represented by a different [[Tarot card]].\n\n==Plot==\nStanton Carlisle watches the [[geek show]] at a [[Ten-in-One]] where he has recently begun working. He later asks the carnival's [[carnival barker|talker]] Clem Hoately where geeks come from. Clem explains that geeks are \"made\": a sideshow owner finds an alcoholic [[Homelessness|bum]] and offers him a temporary job with a steady supply of liquor. Initially, the bum is only asked to pretend to be a geek, using a razor blade to slice chickens' necks and then faking the drinking of the blood. After a few weeks, the owner threatens to end the job and replace the bum with a \"real\" geek, and the fear of sobering up terrifies the bum into actually biting the chickens. Thus, a geek is made.\n\nStan performs [[sleight of hand]] tricks in the [[sideshow]] but studies under the carnival's [[mentalist]] Zeena to learn a refined \"code\" act, where performers [[Mnemonist|memorize verbal cues]] that allow them to appear [[psychic]] by accurately answering written audience questions. Stan also begins to pick up Zeena's talent for [[cold reading]]. He eventually leaves the carnival with beautiful and na\u00efve electric girl,<ref>{{cite book |page=248 |title=Secrets of the Sideshows |author=Joe Nickell |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-8131-2358-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sACcmMWM6t4C&pg=PA248#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> Molly Cahill to perform a team code act.\n\nTheir act becomes very successful, but Stan grows bored and transforms himself into Reverend Carlisle, an upstanding [[Spiritualist]] preacher offering [[s\u00e9ance]] sessions with the help of his [[mediumship|medium]] (Molly, appearing as \"Miss Cahill\" to obfuscate their relationship). Stan gains a devoted following, but the stress of leading a false life leads him to seek the help of a [[psychologist]] named Lilith Ritter, who seduces and then begins controlling him. Stan pleads constantly for them to go away together, and Lilith eventually agrees, suggesting the Rev. Carlisle swindle a rich man for the getaway money. They settle on Ezra Grindle, a ruthless [[Business magnate|auto tycoon]] with a [[Skepticism|skeptical]] interest in the [[occult]]. Stan manages to convince Grindle of his powers, and the businessman becomes a devoted spiritualist.\n\nStan keeps Grindle hooked by promising to reunite him with his deceased college sweetheart Dorrie, who died in a botched [[Unsafe abortion|back-alley abortion]] Grindle convinced her to seek. A reluctant Molly plays \"Dorrie\" in a series of sessions but eventually breaks character, destroying the illusion, and Grindle vows revenge for Stan's lies. Stan tells Molly to go back to carnival life. At Lilith's suggestion he decides to go into hiding with Grindle's money but later discovers that Lilith has stolen a majority of it by replacing the five hundred dollar bills with singles. When he confronts her, she tells him that he is deluded and attempts to have him committed to a mental institution, and he narrowly escapes. He flees and resorts to performing as a mentalist at increasingly shoddy venues, barely evading the men Grindle continually sends after him. Eventually he becomes a hobo, staying afloat by giving Tarot readings and selling [[horoscopes]]. He descends into alcoholism and depression when he discovers through a newspaper article that Lilith has wed Grindle.\n\nHis life in shambles, Stan finds a carnival owner and asks to join the sideshow as a palm reader. The owner gives Stan some whiskey but refuses his proposal, saying the show is full. But as Stan begins to drunkenly stumble out, the owner changes his tune and invites Stan back in with a job offer: \"Of course, it's only temporary \u2013 just until we get a real geek.\"\n\n==Reception==\nIn a 2010 review, the [[Pulitzer Prize]]\u2013winning book critic [[Michael Dirda]] proclaimed, \"I was utterly unprepared for its raw, Dostoevskian power... It's not often that a novel leaves a weathered and jaded reviewer like myself utterly flattened, but this one did....it's more than just a steamy noir classic.

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]]s attempted to prevent the British from passing upriver by emplacing 106 ''[[chevaux de frise]]'' (upright [[logging|logs]] tipped with [[iron]] points) between the island and Plum Point across the river (see [[Hudson River Chains]]). [[Caisson (engineering)|Caisson]]s from several ''chevaux de frise'' still rest at the river bottom. Still, these obstructions did not stop a British flotilla from burning [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]] in 1777.<ref name=\"underwater\"/> [[General]] [[George Washington]] later signed a plan to use the island as a [[military]] [[prison]]; however, there is no evidence that a prison was ever built there.<ref name=\"Ban1\"/>\n\n==Bannerman's Castle==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name = Bannerman's Island Arsenal\n| nrhp_type = \n| image = BannermanCastle3685.jpg\n| caption = View from the railroad on the eastern bank of the Hudson River\n| location= Pollepel Island, [[Newburgh, New York]]\n| locmapin = New York#USA\n| built = 1901\n| architect = Bannerman, Francis VI\n| added = November 23, 1982\n| area = {{convert|13.4|acre}}\n| governing_body = State\n| mpsub = {{NRHP url|id=64000559|title=Hudson Highlands MRA}}\n| refnum = 82001121<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n}}\n\n===Origin===\nFrancis Bannerman VI, the castle's eponym, was born on March&nbsp;24, 1851, in Northern Ireland, according to Civil Registration records for Ireland, and emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1854. His grandfather was from [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] where he worked as a 'linenman'. The family moved to [[Brooklyn]] in 1858 and began a military surplus business near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in 1865 purchasing surplus military equipment at the close of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n\nIn 1867 the business occupied a [[ship chandler]]y on Atlantic Avenue engaged in the purchase of worn [[rope]] for [[paper]]making.  The store on the 500-block of Broadway opened in 1897 to outfit volunteers for the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=catalog/> The business bought weapons directly from the Spanish government before it evacuated [[Cuba]]; and then purchased over 90 percent of the Spanish [[gun]]s, [[ammunition]], and equipment captured by the United States military and auctioned off by the United States government.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"American Heritage\"/> Bannerman's illustrated mail order catalog expanded to 300 pages; and became a reference for collectors of antique military equipment.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n\nBannerman purchased the island in November 1900,<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" /><ref name=\"catalog\"/> for use as a storage facility for his growing surplus business.<ref name=\"Ban4\"/> Because his storeroom in New York City was not large enough to provide a safe location to store thirty million surplus [[munition]]s cartridges,<ref name=\"catalog\"/> in the spring of 1901 he began to build an arsenal on Pollepel. Bannerman designed the buildings himself and let the constructors interpret the designs on their own.<ref name=ruins/>\n\nMost of the building was devoted to the stores of army surplus but Bannerman built another castle in a smaller scale on top of the island near the main structure as a residence, often using items from his surplus collection for decorative touches. The castle, clearly visible from the shore of the river, served as a giant [[advertisement]] for his business. On the side of the castle facing the western bank of the Hudson, Bannerman cast the legend \"Bannerman's Island Arsenal\" into the wall.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" />\n\nConstruction ceased at Bannerman's death in 1918. In August 1920, 200 pounds of shells and powder exploded in an ancillary structure, destroying a portion of the complex. Bannerman's sales of military weapons to civilians declined during the early 20th century as a result of [[Sullivan Act|state]] and [[National Firearms Act|federal legislation]].  After the sinking of the ferryboat ''Pollepel'', which had served the island, in a storm in 1950, the Arsenal and island were essentially left vacant.<ref name=\"Ban5\" /> The island and buildings were bought by New York State in 1967, after the old military merchandise had been removed, and tours of the island were given in 1968.<ref name=\"Ban1\" /> However, on August 8, 1969, fire devastated the Arsenal, and the roofs and floors were destroyed.<ref name=\"Ban5\" /> The island was placed off-limits to the public.\n\n===Current status===\nThe castle is currently the property of the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] and is mostly in ruins. While portions of the exterior walls still stand, all the internal floors and non-structural walls have since burned down. The island has been the victim of [[vandalism]], [[trespass]], neglect, and decay.<ref name=Ban6/> Several old bulkheads and causeways that submerge at high tide present a serious navigational [[hazard]]. On-island guided [[hard hat]] tours were recently made available through the Bannerman's Castle Trust.<ref name=Ban8/>  The castle is easily visible to riders of the [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] and the [[Amtrak]] [[Empire Service (train)|''Empire Service'']] and [[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]] lines. One side of the castle, which carries the words \"Bannermans' Island Arsenal\", is also visible to southbound riders.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" />\n\n[[File:Bannerman collapsed wall.jpg|thumb|left|The collapsed wall viewed from shore]]\n\nSometime during the week before December 28, 2009, parts of the castle collapsed.  Officials estimate 30\u201340 percent of the structure's front wall and about half of the east wall fell.  The collapse was reported by a motorist and by officials on the Metro-North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/article/20091228/NEWS01/91228026/1006/news01|title=Walls collapse at Bannerman Castle; officials hope to assess damage as soon as possible|work=The Poughkeepsie Journal|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 19, 2015, the island was the destination of a kayak trip taken by Angelika Graswald and her fianc\u00e9, Vincent Viafore.

During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriot]]s attempted to prevent the British from passing upriver by emplacing 106 ''[[chevaux de frise]]'' (upright [[logging|logs]] tipped with [[iron]] points) between the island and Plum Point across the river (see [[Hudson River Chains]]). [[Caisson (engineering)|Caisson]]s from several ''chevaux de frise'' still rest at the river bottom. Still, these obstructions did not stop a British flotilla from burning [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]] in 1777.<ref name=\"underwater\"/> [[General]] [[George Washington]] later signed a plan to use the island as a [[military]] [[prison]]; however, there is no evidence that a prison was ever built there.<ref name=\"Ban1\"/>\n\n==Bannerman's Castle==\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name = Bannerman's Island Arsenal\n| nrhp_type = \n| image = BannermanCastle3685.jpg\n| caption = View from the railroad on the eastern bank of the Hudson River\n| location= Pollepel Island, [[Newburgh, New York]]\n| locmapin = New York#USA\n| built = 1901\n| architect = Bannerman, Francis VI\n| added = November 23, 1982\n| area = {{convert|13.4|acre}}\n| governing_body = State\n| mpsub = {{NRHP url|id=64000559|title=Hudson Highlands MRA}}\n| refnum = 82001121<ref name=\"nris\"/>\n}}\n\n===Origin===\nFrancis Bannerman VI, the castle's eponym, was born on March&nbsp;24, 1851, in Northern Ireland, according to Civil Registration records for Ireland, and emigrated to the United States with his parents in 1854. His grandfather was from [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]] where he worked as a 'linenman'. The family moved to [[Brooklyn]] in 1858 and began a military surplus business near the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] in 1865 purchasing surplus military equipment at the close of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n\nIn 1867 the business occupied a [[ship chandler]]y on Atlantic Avenue engaged in the purchase of worn [[rope]] for [[paper]]making.  The store on the 500-block of Broadway opened in 1897 to outfit volunteers for the [[Spanish\u2013American War]].<ref name=catalog/> The business bought weapons directly from the Spanish government before it evacuated [[Cuba]]; and then purchased over 90 percent of the Spanish [[gun]]s, [[ammunition]], and equipment captured by the United States military and auctioned off by the United States government.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"American Heritage\"/> Bannerman's illustrated mail order catalog expanded to 300 pages; and became a reference for collectors of antique military equipment.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"catalog\"/>\n\nBannerman purchased the island in November 1900,<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" /><ref name=\"catalog\"/> for use as a storage facility for his growing surplus business.<ref name=\"Ban4\"/> Because his storeroom in New York City was not large enough to provide a safe location to store thirty million surplus [[munition]]s cartridges,<ref name=\"catalog\"/> in the spring of 1901 he began to build an arsenal on Pollepel. Bannerman designed the buildings himself and let the constructors interpret the designs on their own.<ref name=ruins/>\n\nMost of the building was devoted to the stores of army surplus but Bannerman built another castle in a smaller scale on top of the island near the main structure as a residence, often using items from his surplus collection for decorative touches. The castle, clearly visible from the shore of the river, served as a giant [[advertisement]] for his business. On the side of the castle facing the western bank of the Hudson, Bannerman cast the legend \"Bannerman's Island Arsenal\" into the wall.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" />\n\nConstruction ceased at Bannerman's death in 1918. In August 1920, 200 pounds of shells and powder exploded in an ancillary structure, destroying a portion of the complex. Bannerman's sales of military weapons to civilians declined during the early 20th century as a result of [[Sullivan Act|state]] and [[National Firearms Act|federal legislation]].  After the sinking of the ferryboat ''Pollepel'', which had served the island, in a storm in 1950, the Arsenal and island were essentially left vacant.<ref name=\"Ban5\" /> The island and buildings were bought by New York State in 1967, after the old military merchandise had been removed, and tours of the island were given in 1968.<ref name=\"Ban1\" /> However, on August 8, 1969, fire devastated the Arsenal, and the roofs and floors were destroyed.<ref name=\"Ban5\" /> The island was placed off-limits to the public.\n\n===Current status===\nThe castle is currently the property of the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] and is mostly in ruins. While portions of the exterior walls still stand, all the internal floors and non-structural walls have since burned down. The island has been the victim of [[vandalism]], [[trespass]], neglect, and decay.<ref name=Ban6/> Several old bulkheads and causeways that submerge at high tide present a serious navigational [[hazard]]. On-island guided [[hard hat]] tours were recently made available through the Bannerman's Castle Trust.<ref name=Ban8/>  The castle is easily visible to riders of the [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[Hudson Line (Metro-North)|Hudson Line]] and the [[Amtrak]] [[Empire Service (train)|''Empire Service'']] and [[Adirondack (train)|Adirondack]] lines. One side of the castle, which carries the words \"Bannermans' Island Arsenal\", is also visible to southbound riders.<ref name=\"Ban2\" /><ref name=\"Ban0\" />\n\n[[File:Bannerman collapsed wall.jpg|thumb|left|The collapsed wall viewed from shore]]\n\nSometime during the week before December 28, 2009, parts of the castle collapsed.

By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of [[Southern Unionist]] governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Unlike the other \"cotton states\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the [[Texas Legislature]] into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him.\n\nIn early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \"[[Voice vote|viva voce]]\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.<ref>An Act to direct the mode of voting in all popular elections, approved March 19, 1846. {{cite book|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897|volume=2|editor-first=H.P.N.|editor-last=Gammel|editorlink=Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen Gammel|year=1898|page=1318|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/1322/|ref={{harvid|Gammel|1898b}}}}</ref> Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate.

The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union.\nThe ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \"strike down the interests and prosperity\"<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" /> of the Southern people.\n  \nAfter the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the [[United States]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" />\n\nIn the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday).\n\nOn February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \"yea\" votes were recorded before there was a single \"nay.\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. [[James W. Throckmorton|James Webb Throckmorton]], from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Minor |first=David |title=Throckmorton, James Webb |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth36 |date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe final tally for secession was 166\u20137{{cn span|, a vote whose legality was upheld by the Texas Legislature on February 7|date=January 2016}}.

On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\", which had been drawn up by its \"Provisional Congress\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1).\n\nIn March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery:\n\n{{Quotation|With the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual...

Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office.\n\n===Seizure of federal property and arms===\nAfter Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \"Commissioners of Public Safety\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron [[Samuel A. Maverick]] and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. [[Philip N. Luckett]] met with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[David E. Twiggs]] on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], including the military stores being housed in the old [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo mission]].\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=O.M. |author-link=Oran Milo Roberts |title=Texas |editor-link=Clement A.

The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered.\n\nThe largest concentration of anti-secession sentiment was among the [[German Texan]] population in the [[Texas Hill Country]], and in some of the counties of [[North Texas]]. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the [[Upper South]].

A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|hanged in Gainesville]], two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal.

Some men were veterans of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]; a few had served in the earlier [[Texas Revolution]]. The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the [[Confederate Congress]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], passed a [[conscription|conscription law]] that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \"[[Twenty Negro Law]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|authorlink=James W.

Often serving as \"shock troops\" of General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Texas Brigade was \"always favorites\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \"my Texans.\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the [[Battle of Antietam]], where they faced off with Wisconsin's [[Iron Brigade]], and at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then [[Little Round Top]].\n\n\"[[Walker's Greyhounds|Walker's Greyhound Division]]\" was a [[division (military)|division]] composed of 4 brigades with Texan units; the only division in the [[Confederate States Army]] that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General [[John George Walker]] it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4<sup>th</sup> brigade fought at the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]], where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new 4<sup>th</sup> brigade was added the division in 1865.\n\nAmong the most famous mounted units were [[Terry's Texas Rangers]], a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33<sup>rd</sup> Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel [[Santos Benavides]], which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico.\n\nOver 2,000 Texas men joined the [[Union Army]]. Notable among them was future Texas governor [[Edmund J. Davis]] who initially commanded the Union Army's [[1st Texas Cavalry Regiment (Union)|1<sup>st</sup> Texas Cavalry Regiment]] and rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]].\n\nTexas's relatively large [[German American|German]] population around [[Austin County]] led by [[Paul Machemehl]] tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. [[East Texas]] gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]], [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]], and [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]], although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the [[9th Texas Infantry Regiment|9<sup>th</sup> Texas Infantry Regiment]]; the 1<sup>st</sup> Partisan Rangers; 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup>, and 29<sup>th</sup> Texas Cavalry; and the 9<sup>th</sup> Texas Field Battery.\n\nIn 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] named a former [[United States Congressman]], [[Andrew J. Hamilton]], as the Military Governor of Texas. Hamilton held the title throughout the War. During the early stages of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas.\n\nYears into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \"we are fighting for our property\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\".<ref name=JMMcPherson1997p117>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph|url-access=registration|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=[https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph/page/117 117]|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|oclc=34912692|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

Confederate troops under Gen. [[John B. Magruder]] recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] attacked and sank the [[USS Hatteras (1861)|USS ''Hatteras'']] in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston. \n\n[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|left|Anaconda Plan, Civil War]]\n\n[[Wends_of_Texas#Civil_War-era|Civilian]] [[Blockade#Blockade_running|Blockade Runners]] largely evaded the Union blockades, bandits, and Union-sympathetic Mexicans in order to smuggle cotton out of [[Bagdad,_Tamaulipas|The Port of Bagdad, Mexico]] at a premium in exchange for goods on [[Europe]]an and [[black markets]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/drw01 |title = WARTIME COTTON TRADE &#124; the Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|date = 28 June 2012}}</ref>, as Texas offered an unparalleled and significant opportunity to export Southern cotton out of the Confederacy.

Banks|General Nathaniel P. Banks]], was then sent forth to secure the ports near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and pushed 100 miles in-land, in order to impede the flow of cotton and deny freedom of movement.\n\nA few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]], [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]. Federal attempts to seize control of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and [[Sabine Pass]] failed. By the end of the war no territory but [[Brazos Island]] and El Paso was in Union hands.  The [[California Column]] occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war.\n\nThe most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]], a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. [[Richard W. Dowling]], 1<sup>st</sup> Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from [[New Orleans]] under Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder\u20144,000 men on 27 ships\u2014to retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the [[Davis Guard Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=War Medals of the Confederacy: The Davis Guard Medal |website=20-20site.org |url=http://www.2020site.org/medals/davisguard.html |access-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> CSA President [[Jefferson Davis]] stated, \"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\"\n\nIn 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under [[Camille de Polignac]], a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Banks]]' [[Red River Campaign]], which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. [[Confederate army|Confederate forces]] halted the expedition at the [[Battle of Mansfield]], just east of the Texas border.\n\nUnion forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender on April 9, 1865, at [[Old Appomattox Court House]], [[Virginia]].\n\n==Collapse of Confederate authority in Texas==\nIn the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the [[Trans-Mississippi]] under General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \"fight on, boys\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them.\n\nThe month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]]'s surrenders confirmed that Texas, [[Louisiana]], and [[Arkansas]] were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals [[John B. Magruder]] and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population.\n\nThe haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the [[blockade runner]] ''Lark'' when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original Confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas.\n\nThe formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \"a commander without an army\u2013 a General without troops.\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \"Trans-Mississippi\".\n\n==Restoration to the Union==\nFederal troops didn't arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday [[Juneteenth]] commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Breakup: The Collapse of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Army in Texas, 1865 |first=Brad R. |last=Clampitt |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |volume=108 |issue=4 |date=April 2005 |jstor=30240424}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed Union General [[Andrew J. Hamilton]], a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the [[United States Congress]] permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress,<ref>{{cite web |title=An Act to admit the State of Texas to Representation in the Congress of the United States |website=Texas State Archives and Library Commission |url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/30march1870.html |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}</ref> although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission.\n\n==Notable Civil War leaders from Texas==\nA number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. [[John Bell Hood]] gained fame as the commander of the [[Texas Brigade]] in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|\"Sul\" Ross]] was a significant leader in a number of \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" Confederate armies. [[Felix Huston Robertson]] was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. [[TJ Goree]] was one of Lt. General [[James Longstreet]]'s most trusted aides. [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] was an influential member of [[Jefferson Davis]]'s cabinet. Col. [[Santos Benavides]] was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military.\n\nThe office of [[Governor of Texas]] was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. [[Sam Houston]] was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]]. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to [[Francis Lubbock]]. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate [[conscription]], working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist [[Pendleton Murrah]] replaced him in office. Even after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico.\n\n===Notable Civil War leaders (Confederacy) from Texas===\n<gallery>\nImage:Francis lubbock.jpg|<center>Governor<br />[[Francis Lubbock]]</center>\nImage:JohnHReagan.jpg|<center>Postmaster General<br />[[John Henninger Reagan]]</center>\nImage:ASJohnston.jpg|<center>Gen.<br />[[A.

However, [[Confederate Memorial Day|Confederate Heroes Day]] is an official state holiday, and the month of April is recognized by the Texas Senate as [[Confederate History Month]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Jackson |title=Confederate History and Heritage Month Resolution |website=State of Texas Legislature |date=March 30, 1999 |url=http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/76R/billtext/html/SR00526F.htm}}</ref> Although not an official holiday, April 26 is, among Southern historical organizations within the state, often observed as \"[[Confederate Memorial Day]].\" On the south lawn of the state capital in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] is a Confederate monument, and several other memorials to individual Texas [[Confederate States Army|Confederate military units]] are nearby.

As with those of other States, the Declaration was not recognized by the United States government at Washington. Some Texan military units fought in the [[American Civil War#Confederate states|Civil War]] east of the [[Mississippi River]], but Texas was most useful for supplying soldiers and horses for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate forces]]. Texas' supply role lasted until mid-1863, after which time Union gunboats controlled the Mississippi River, making large transfers of men, horses or cattle impossible. Some cotton was sold in [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]], but most of the crop became useless because of the Union naval blockade of [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], and other ports.\n\n==Secession==\nIn the early winter of 1860, Texan counties sent delegates to a special convention to debate the merits of secession. The convention adopted an \"[[Ordinance of Secession]]\" by a vote of 166 to 8, which was ratified by a popular referendum on February 23.<ref name=\"Secession Convention\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mjs01 |title=Secession Convention |work=[[Handbook of Texas Online]] |last=Buenger |first=Walter L. |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |date=March 8, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\">{{cite web |title=An Ordinance: To dissolve the union between the State of Texas and the other States, united under the compact styled \"The Constitution of the United States of America.\" Adopted in Convention, at Austin City, the first day of February, A.D. 1861. |work=Narrative History of Texas Secessionand Readmission to the Union |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/ref/abouttx/secession/1feb1861.html |location=Austin |date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nSeparately from the Ordinance of Secession, which was considered a legal document, Texas also issued a declaration of causes spelling out the rationale for declaring secession.<ref name=\"Declaration of Causes\">{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/csa_texsec.asp |title=A Declaration of the Causes which Impel the State of Texas to Secede from the Federal Union |date=2008 |website=Avalon Project |publisher=Yale Law School}}</ref> The document specifies several reasons for secession, including its solidarity with its \"sister slave-holding States,\" the U.S. government's inability to prevent [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] attacks, slave-stealing raids, and other border-crossing acts of banditry.

The bulk of the document offers justifications for [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] saying that remaining a part of the United States would jeopardize the security of the two.

By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of [[Southern Unionist]] governor, [[Sam Houston]]. Unlike the other \"cotton states\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the [[Texas Legislature]] into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him.\n\nIn early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \"[[Voice vote|viva voce]]\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.<ref>An Act to direct the mode of voting in all popular elections, approved March 19, 1846. {{cite book|title=The Laws of Texas, 1822-1897|volume=2|editor-first=H.P.N.|editor-last=Gammel|editorlink=Hans Peter Mareus Neilsen Gammel|year=1898|page=1318|publisher=[[University of North Texas]]|url=http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth6726/m1/1322/|ref={{harvid|Gammel|1898b}}}}</ref> Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate. This resulted in lopsided representation of secessionists delegates.<ref name=\"Secession Convention\"/>\n\nThe election call had stipulated for the delegates to assemble in convention on January 28. Houston called the Legislature into session, hoping that the elected body would declare the unauthorized convention illegal.<ref name=\"Secession Convention\"/> Though he expressed reservations about the election of Abraham Lincoln, he urged the State of Texas to reject secession, citing the horrors of war and a probable defeat of the South. The convention removed Houston from the governorship, then promoted the Lieutenant Governor, Edward Clark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Houston, Sam|author=Thomas H.

The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union.\nThe ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \"strike down the interests and prosperity\"<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" /> of the Southern people.\n  \nAfter the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the [[United States]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution.<ref name=\"Ordinance of Secession\" />\n\nIn the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday).\n\nOn February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \"yea\" votes were recorded before there was a single \"nay.\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. [[James W. Throckmorton|James Webb Throckmorton]], from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Minor |first=David |title=Throckmorton, James Webb |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fth36 |date=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe final tally for secession was 166\u20137{{cn span|, a vote whose legality was upheld by the Texas Legislature on February 7|date=January 2016}}.

On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\", which had been drawn up by its \"Provisional Congress\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1).\n\nIn March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery:\n\n{{Quotation|With the social balance wheel of slavery to regulate its machinery, we may fondly indulge the hope that our Southern government will be perpetual...

Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office.\n\n===Seizure of federal property and arms===\nAfter Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \"Commissioners of Public Safety\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron [[Samuel A. Maverick]] and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. [[Philip N. Luckett]] met with [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[David E. Twiggs]] on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], including the military stores being housed in the old [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo mission]].\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=O.M. |author-link=Oran Milo Roberts |title=Texas |editor-link=Clement A.

The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered.\n\nThe largest concentration of anti-secession sentiment was among the [[German Texan]] population in the [[Texas Hill Country]], and in some of the counties of [[North Texas]]. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the [[Upper South]]. Some of the leaders initially opposed to secession accepted the Confederate cause once the matter was decided, some withdrew from public life, others left the state, and a few even joined the Union army.<ref name=\"Civil War\">{{cite encyclopedia |first=Ralph A. |last=Wooster |title=Civil War |work=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qdc02 |date=March 4, 2011 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}</ref> Confederate conscription laws forced most men of military age into the Confederate army, regardless of their sentiment.

Young on the orders of Colonel James Bourland, Confederate Provost Marshal for northern Texas. A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were [[Great Hanging at Gainesville|hanged in Gainesville]], two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal. Under the primitive conditions on the Texas frontier during the Civil War, evidence against the accused was questionable, and the legal proceedings were highly imperfect. A granite monument in a small park marks the spot where the hangings took place.<ref name=\"Great Hanging\"/>\n\nThe Confederacy's conscription act proved controversial, not only in Texas but all across the South. Despite the referendum result, some opponents argued that the war was being fought by poor people on behalf of a few wealthy [[Slavery in the United States|slave owners]]. The Act exempted from the draft men who owned fifteen or more slaves.<ref>[http://www.kwanah.com/txmilmus/tnghist10.htm Texas in the Civil War: A Capsule History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820005155/http://www.kwanah.com/txmilmus/tnghist10.htm |date=August 20, 2006 }}</ref> Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to [[Mexico]].

While he argued for slave property rights and deplored the election of the Lincoln Administration, he considered secession unconstitutional and thought secession at that moment in time was a \"rash action\" that was certain to lead to a conflict favoring the industrial and populated North. He predicted: \"Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Alfred Mason |title=Sam Houston and the War of Independence in Texas |url=https://archive.org/details/samhoustonandwa00willgoog |year=1893 |publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company |pages=[https://archive.org/details/samhoustonandwa00willgoog/page/n371 354]}}</ref><ref name=Haley/>\n\nHouston rejected the actions of the Texas Secession Convention, believing it had overstepped its authority in becoming a member state of the newly formed Confederacy. He refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy and was deposed from office.

Before he died, Houston wrote a friend: \"There comes a time a man's section is his country...I stand with mine.

The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the [[Confederate Congress]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], passed a [[conscription|conscription law]] that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \"[[Twenty Negro Law]]\".<ref>{{Cite book|authorlink=James W.

Often serving as \"shock troops\" of General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s [[Army of Northern Virginia]], the Texas Brigade was \"always favorites\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \"my Texans.\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the [[Battle of Antietam]], where they faced off with Wisconsin's [[Iron Brigade]], and at [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then [[Little Round Top]].\n\n\"[[Walker's Greyhounds|Walker's Greyhound Division]]\" was a [[division (military)|division]] composed of 4 brigades with Texan units; the only division in the [[Confederate States Army]] that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General [[John George Walker]] it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4<sup>th</sup> brigade fought at the [[Battle of Arkansas Post]], where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new 4<sup>th</sup> brigade was added the division in 1865.\n\nAmong the most famous mounted units were [[Terry's Texas Rangers]], a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33<sup>rd</sup> Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel [[Santos Benavides]], which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico.\n\nOver 2,000 Texas men joined the [[Union Army]]. Notable among them was future Texas governor [[Edmund J. Davis]] who initially commanded the Union Army's [[1st Texas Cavalry Regiment (Union)|1<sup>st</sup> Texas Cavalry Regiment]] and rose to the rank of [[brigadier general]].\n\nTexas's relatively large [[German American|German]] population around [[Austin County]] led by [[Paul Machemehl]] tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. [[East Texas]] gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]], [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]], and [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar County]], although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the [[9th Texas Infantry Regiment|9<sup>th</sup> Texas Infantry Regiment]]; the 1<sup>st</sup> Partisan Rangers; 3<sup>rd</sup>, 4<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup>, 27<sup>th</sup>, and 29<sup>th</sup> Texas Cavalry; and the 9<sup>th</sup> Texas Field Battery.\n\nIn 1862, [[Abraham Lincoln]] named a former [[United States Congressman]], [[Andrew J.

During the early stages of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas.\n\nYears into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \"we are fighting for our property\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\".<ref name=JMMcPherson1997p117>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph|url-access=registration|title=For Cause and Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War|page=[https://archive.org/details/forcausecomrades00mcph/page/117 117]|last=McPherson|first=James M.|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc.|oclc=34912692|location=New York City, New York|authorlink=James M.

However, the Union mounted several attempts to capture the \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" regions of Texas and [[Louisiana]] from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east captured or under blockade, Texas in particular became a [[Texas_in_the_American_Civil_War#Texas_occupation|blockade-running haven]]. \n\n==Texas occupation==\nUnder the [[Anaconda Plan]], the [[Union Navy]] blockaded the principal seaport, [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]] and the entire Gulf and Southern borders, for four years, and federal troops occupied the city for three months in late 1862. Confederate troops under Gen. [[John B. Magruder]] recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']] attacked and sank the [[USS Hatteras (1861)|USS ''Hatteras'']] in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston. \n\n[[File:Scott-anaconda.jpg|thumb|left|Anaconda Plan, Civil War]]\n\n[[Wends_of_Texas#Civil_War-era|Civilian]] [[Blockade#Blockade_running|Blockade Runners]] largely evaded the Union blockades, bandits, and Union-sympathetic Mexicans in order to smuggle cotton out of [[Bagdad,_Tamaulipas|The Port of Bagdad, Mexico]] at a premium in exchange for goods on [[Europe]]an and [[black markets]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/drw01 |title = WARTIME COTTON TRADE &#124; the Handbook of Texas Online&#124; Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)|date = 28 June 2012}}</ref>, as Texas offered an unparalleled and significant opportunity to export Southern cotton out of the Confederacy.

Banks|General Nathaniel P. Banks]], was then sent forth to secure the ports near [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and pushed 100 miles in-land, in order to impede the flow of cotton and deny freedom of movement.\n\nA few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including [[Port Lavaca, Texas|Port Lavaca]], [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]. Federal attempts to seize control of [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]], [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]], and [[Sabine Pass]] failed. By the end of the war no territory but [[Brazos Island]] and El Paso was in Union hands.  The [[California Column]] occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war.\n\nThe most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the [[Second Battle of Sabine Pass]], a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. [[Richard W. Dowling]], 1<sup>st</sup> Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from [[New Orleans]] under Gen. [[William B. Franklin]]. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder\u20144,000 men on 27 ships\u2014to retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the [[Davis Guard Medal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=War Medals of the Confederacy: The Davis Guard Medal |website=20-20site.org |url=http://www.2020site.org/medals/davisguard.html |access-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> CSA President [[Jefferson Davis]] stated, \"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\"\n\nIn 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under [[Camille de Polignac]], a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. [[Nathaniel Banks]]' [[Red River Campaign]], which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. [[Confederate army|Confederate forces]] halted the expedition at the [[Battle of Mansfield]], just east of the Texas border.\n\nUnion forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the [[Battle of Palmito Ranch]], fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender on April 9, 1865, at [[Old Appomattox Court House]], [[Virginia]].\n\n==Collapse of Confederate authority in Texas==\nIn the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the [[Trans-Mississippi]] under General [[Edmund Kirby Smith]]. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \"fight on, boys\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them.\n\nThe month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s and [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]]'s surrenders confirmed that Texas, [[Louisiana]], and [[Arkansas]] were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals [[John B. Magruder]] and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population.\n\nThe haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the [[blockade runner]] ''Lark'' when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original Confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas.\n\nThe formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]], the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \"a commander without an army\u2013 a General without troops.\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \"Trans-Mississippi\".\n\n==Restoration to the Union==\nFederal troops didn't arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. [[Gordon Granger]] and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on [[Galveston Island]] to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday [[Juneteenth]] commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Breakup: The Collapse of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Army in Texas, 1865 |first=Brad R. |last=Clampitt |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |volume=108 |issue=4 |date=April 2005 |jstor=30240424}}</ref>\n\nPresident [[Andrew Johnson]] appointed Union General [[Andrew J. Hamilton]], a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the [[United States Congress]] permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress,<ref>{{cite web |title=An Act to admit the State of Texas to Representation in the Congress of the United States |website=Texas State Archives and Library Commission |url=https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/secession/30march1870.html |accessdate=August 24, 2011}}</ref> although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission.\n\n==Notable Civil War leaders from Texas==\nA number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. [[John Bell Hood]] gained fame as the commander of the [[Texas Brigade]] in the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. [[Lawrence Sullivan Ross|\"Sul\" Ross]] was a significant leader in a number of \"[[Trans-Mississippi]]\" Confederate armies. [[Felix Huston Robertson]] was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. [[TJ Goree]] was one of Lt. General [[James Longstreet]]'s most trusted aides. [[John Henninger Reagan|John H. Reagan]] was an influential member of [[Jefferson Davis]]'s cabinet. Col. [[Santos Benavides]] was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military.\n\nThe office of [[Governor of Texas]] was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. [[Sam Houston]] was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor [[Edward Clark (governor)|Edward Clark]]. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to [[Francis Lubbock]]. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate [[conscription]], working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist [[Pendleton Murrah]] replaced him in office. Even after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico.\n\n===Notable Civil War leaders (Confederacy) from Texas===\n<gallery>\nImage:Francis lubbock.jpg|<center>Governor<br />[[Francis Lubbock]]</center>\nImage:JohnHReagan.jpg|<center>Postmaster General<br />[[John Henninger Reagan]]</center>\nImage:ASJohnston.jpg|<center>Gen.<br />[[A.

In Italian politics, he prohibited bishops from interfering with local elections, and he helped the Christian Democratic Party to cooperate with the socialists. In international affairs, his \"Ostpolitik\" engaged in dialogue with the Communist countries of Eastern Europe. He especially reached out to the Eastern Orthodox churches. His overall goal was to modernize the Church by emphasizing its pastoral role, and its necessary involvement with affairs of state. He dropped the traditional rule of 70 cardinals, increasing the size to 85. He used the opportunity to name the first cardinals from Africa, Japan, and the Philippines. He promoted ecumenical movements in cooperation with other Christian faiths. In doctrinal matters, he was a traditionalist, but he ended the practice of automatically formulating social and political policies on the basis of old theological propositions.<ref>David  Wilsford. ed., ''Political Leaders of Contemporary Western Europe: A Biographical Dictionary'' (Greenwood, 1995) pp 203\u2013207.</ref>\n\nHe did not live to see the Vatican Council to completion.

With Pius X's few surviving relatives, Roncalli celebrated a mass in his honor.\n\nHis sister Ancilla would soon be diagnosed with stomach cancer in the early 1950s. Roncalli's last letter to her was dated on 8 November 1953 where he promised to visit her within the next week.

He was elected pope at 4:30&nbsp;pm with a total of 38 votes. After the long pontificate of Pope Pius XII, the cardinals chose a man who \u2013 it was presumed because of his advanced age \u2013 would be a short-term or \"stop-gap\" pope. They wished to choose a candidate who would do little during the new pontificate. Upon his election, Cardinal [[Eug\u00e8ne Tisserant]] asked him the ritual questions of whether he would accept and if so, what name he would take for himself. Roncalli gave the first of his many surprises when he chose \"John\" as his [[regnal name]]. Roncalli's exact words were \"I will be called John\". This was the first time in over 500 years that this name had been chosen; previous popes had avoided its use since the time of the [[Antipope John XXIII]] during the [[Western Schism]] several centuries before.\n\nOn the choice of his papal name, Pope John XXIII said to the cardinals:\n{{Quote|I choose John... a name sweet to us because it is the name of our father, dear to me because it is the name of the humble parish church where I was baptized, the solemn name of numberless cathedrals scattered throughout the world, including our own basilica [St. John Lateran].

His [[papal coronation]] ran for the traditional five hours (Pope Paul&nbsp;VI, by contrast, opted for a shorter ceremony, while later popes declined to be crowned). Pope John XXIII, like his predecessor Pius XII, chose to have the coronation itself take place on the balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], in view of the crowds assembled in [[Saint Peter's Square]] below.\n\nHe wore a number of papal tiaras during his papacy. On the most formal of occasions would he don the 1877 Palatine tiara he received at his coronation, but on other occasions, he used the 1922 tiara of Pope Pius XI, which was used so often that it was associated with him quite strongly. The people of Bergamo gave him an expensive silver [[Tiara of Pope John XXIII|tiara]], but he requested that the number of jewels used be halved and that the money be given to the poor.\n\n===Liturgical reform===\nMaintaining continuity with his predecessors, John XXIII continued the gradual reform of the Roman liturgy, and published changes that resulted in the [[1962 Roman Missal]], the last typical edition containing the [[Tridentine Mass]] established in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]] at the request of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n===Beatifications and canonization ceremonies===\n{{Main|List of saints canonized by Pope John XXIII}}\n[[File:Pope John XXIII - Time Magazine Cover - January 4, 1963.jpg|left|thumb|Pope John XXIII on [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] Cover of January 4, 1963|alt=]]\nJohn XXIII beatified four individuals in his reign: [[Elena Guerra]] (26 April 1959), [[Innocenzo da Berzo]] (12 November 1961), [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]] (17 March 1963) and [[Luigi Maria Palazzolo]] (19 March 1963).\n\nHe also canonized a small number of individuals: he canonized [[Charles of Sezze]] and [[Joaquina Vedruna de Mas]] on 12 April 1959, [[Gregorio Barbarigo]] on 26 May 1960, [[Juan de Ribera]] on 12 June 1960, [[Maria Bertilla Boscardin]] on 11 May 1961, [[Martin de Porres]] on 6 May 1962, and [[Antonio Maria Pucci]], [[Francis Mary of Camporosso]] and [[Peter Julian Eymard]] on 9 December 1962.

John XXIII's closing speech made subtle references to [[Pope Pius IX]], and he had expressed the desire to see Pius IX beatified and eventually canonized. In his journal in 1959 during a spiritual retreat, John XXIII made this remark: \"I always think of Pius IX of holy and glorious memory, and by imitating him in his sacrifices, I would like to be worthy to celebrate his canonization\".\n\n===Final months and death===\nOn 23 September 1962, Pope John XXIII was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]. The diagnosis, which was kept from the public, followed nearly eight months of occasional stomach hemorrhages, and reduced the pontiff's appearances. Looking pale and drawn during these events, he gave a hint to his ultimate fate in April 1963, when he said to visitors, \"That which happens to all men perhaps will happen soon to the Pope who speaks to you today.\"\n\nPope John XXIII offered to mediate between US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. Both men applauded the pope for his deep commitment to peace. Khrushchev would later send a message via [[Norman Cousins]] and the letter expressed his best wishes for the pontiff's ailing health. John XXIII personally typed and sent a message back to him, thanking him for his letter. Cousins, meanwhile, travelled to [[New York City]] and ensured that John would become [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine's]] '[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]'. John XXIII became the first Pope to receive the title, followed by [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in 1994 and [[Pope Francis|Francis]] in 2013.\n\nOn 10 February 1963, John XXIII officially opened the process of beatification for the late Cardinal [[Andrea Carlo Ferrari]], [[Archbishop of Milan]] from 1894 to 1921. This conferred upon him the title of [[Servant of God]].\n\nOn 7 March 1963, the feast of the University's patron Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], Pope John XXIII visited the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] and with the ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Dominicanus Ordo'',<ref>{{Citation |journal=[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] |volume=55 |year=1963 |place=[[Rome]], [[Italy|IT]] |url=https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS%2055%20%5B1963%5D%20-%20ocr.pdf |title=Acta Ioannis Pp.

While in the car en route to the official ceremony, he suffered great stomach pains but insisted on meeting with Segni to receive the award in the [[Quirinal Palace]], refusing to do so within the Vatican.

The doctors conferred in a decision regarding this matter and John XXIII's aide Loris F. Capovilla broke the news to him saying that the cancer had done its work and nothing could be done for him. Around this time, his remaining siblings arrived to be with him. By 31 May, it had become clear that the cancer had overcome the resistance of John XXIII \u2013 it had left him confined to his bed.\n\n\"At 11&nbsp;am [[Petrus Canisius Van Lierde]] as Papal Sacristan was at the bedside of the dying pope, ready to [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|anoint]] him. The pope began to speak for the very last time: ''\"I had the great grace to be born into a Christian family, modest and poor, but with the fear of the Lord. My time on earth is drawing to a close. But Christ lives on and continues his work in the Church. Souls, souls, [[That they all may be one|ut omnes unum sint]].\"''{{Efn | \u2018...that all may be one.\u2019}}  Van Lierde then anointed his eyes, ears, mouth, hands and feet. Overcome by emotion, Van Lierde forgot the right order of anointing. John XXIII gently helped him before bidding those present a last farewell.<ref name=\"Hebblethwaite 1994 502\" />\n\nJohn XXIII died of [[peritonitis]] caused by a perforated stomach at 19:49 local time on 3 June 1963 at the age of 81, ending a historic pontificate of four years and seven months. He died just as a Mass for him finished in Saint Peter's Square below, celebrated by [[Luigi Traglia]]. After he died, his brow was ritually tapped to see if he was dead, and those with him in the room said prayers. Then the room was illuminated, thus informing the people of what had happened. He was buried on 6 June in the Vatican grottos. Two [[wreath]]s, placed on the two sides of his tomb, were donated by the prisoners of the Regina Coeli prison and the Mantova jail in Verona. On 22 June 1963, one day after his friend and successor [[Pope Paul VI]] was elected, the latter prayed at his tomb.\n\nOn 3 December 1963, US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] posthumously awarded him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' highest civilian award, in recognition of the good relationship between Pope John XXIII and the United States of America. In his speech on 6 December 1963, Johnson said: \"I have also determined to confer the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously on another noble man whose death we mourned 6 months ago: His Holiness, Pope John XXIII. He was a man of simple origins, of simple faith, of simple charity. In this exalted office he was still the gentle pastor. He believed in discussion and persuasion. He profoundly respected the dignity of man.\nHe gave the world immortal statements of the rights of man, of the obligations of men to each other, of their duty to strive for a world community in which all can live in peace and fraternal friendship. His goodness reached across temporal boundaries to warm the hearts of men of all nations and of all faiths\".\n\nThe citation for the medal reads:\n''His Holiness Pope John XXIII, dedicated servant of God. He brought to all citizens of the planet a heightened sense of the dignity of the individual, of the brotherhood of man, and of the common duty to build an environment of peace for all human kind.''{{Clear}}\n\n==Beatification and canonization==\n{{Main|Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II}}\n[[File:Reliquienschrein Papst Johannes XXIII. - Petersdom 1.JPG|thumb|left|215px|The body of John XXIII in the altar of Saint Jerome]]\n[[File:Canonization 2014- The Canonization of Saint John XXIII and Saint John Paul II (14036819834).jpg|thumb|left|215px|The canonization ceremony of John XXIII and John Paul II]]\nHe was known affectionately as the \"Good Pope\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/popes-john-paul-ii-john-xxiii-canonized-april-083140672.html |agency=Associated Press |title=Popes John Paul II, John XXIII canonized April 27 |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |first=Nicole |last=Weinfeld}}</ref> His cause for canonization was opened under [[Pope Paul VI]] during the final session of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on 18 November 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19651118_penultima-sessione-concilio_it.html|title=Penultima sessione generale del Concilio|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> along with the cause of [[Pope Pius XII]].

As a sign of his esteem, the [[President of France]], [[Vincent Auriol]], claimed the ancient privilege possessed by French monarchs and bestowed the red biretta on Roncalli at a ceremony in the [[\u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace]]. It was around this time that he, with the aid of Monsignor [[Bruno Heim]], formed his coat of arms with a lion of Saint Mark on a white ground. Auriol also awarded Roncalli three months later with the award of [[Legion of Honour|Commander of the Legion of Honour]].\n\nRoncalli decided to live on the second floor of the residence reserved for the patriarch, choosing not to live in the first floor room once resided in by Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, who later became [[Pope Pius X]]. On 29 May 1954, the late Pius X was canonized and Roncalli ensured that the late pontiff's patriarchal room was remodelled into a 1903 (the year of the new saint's papal election) look in his honor. With Pius X's few surviving relatives, Roncalli celebrated a mass in his honor.\n\nHis sister Ancilla would soon be diagnosed with stomach cancer in the early 1950s. Roncalli's last letter to her was dated on 8 November 1953 where he promised to visit her within the next week. He could not keep that promise, as Ancilla died on 11 November 1953 at the time when he was consecrating a new church in Venice. He attended her funeral back in his hometown. In his will around this time, he mentioned that he wished to be buried in the crypt of Saint Mark's in Venice with some of his predecessors rather than with the family in Sotto il Monte.\n\n==Papacy==\n{{Infobox popestyles\n| image      = John 23 coa.svg\n| dipstyle=[[His Holiness]]\n| offstyle=Your Holiness\n| relstyle=Holy Father\n| deathstyle=[[Canonization|Saint]]}}\n{{Ordination\n|ordained deacon by   =\n|date of diaconal ordination =\n|place of diaconal ordination =\n|ordained priest by   = [[Giuseppe Ceppetelli]]\n|date of priestly ordination = 10 August 1904\n|place of priestly ordination = Santa Maria in Monte Santo in Piazza del Popolo, [[Rome]], Italy\n|consecrated by              = [[Giovanni Tacci Porcelli|Giovanni Tacci Card.

He was elected pope at 4:30&nbsp;pm with a total of 38 votes. After the long pontificate of Pope Pius XII, the cardinals chose a man who \u2013 it was presumed because of his advanced age \u2013 would be a short-term or \"stop-gap\" pope. They wished to choose a candidate who would do little during the new pontificate. Upon his election, Cardinal [[Eug\u00e8ne Tisserant]] asked him the ritual questions of whether he would accept and if so, what name he would take for himself. Roncalli gave the first of his many surprises when he chose \"John\" as his [[regnal name]]. Roncalli's exact words were \"I will be called John\". This was the first time in over 500 years that this name had been chosen; previous popes had avoided its use since the time of the [[Antipope John XXIII]] during the [[Western Schism]] several centuries before.\n\nOn the choice of his papal name, Pope John XXIII said to the cardinals:\n{{Quote|I choose John... a name sweet to us because it is the name of our father, dear to me because it is the name of the humble parish church where I was baptized, the solemn name of numberless cathedrals scattered throughout the world, including our own basilica [St. John Lateran].

However, there was no [[Pope John XX]], owing to confusion caused by medieval historians misreading the [[Liber Pontificalis]] to refer to another Pope John between [[Pope John XIV|John XIV]] and [[Pope John XV|John XV]].\n\nAfter his election, he confided in Cardinal [[Maurice Feltin]] that he had chosen the name \"in memory of France and in the memory of John XXII who continued the history of the papacy in France\".<ref>{{Citation |first=Peter |last=Hebblethwaite |title=John XXIII, Pope of the Council |edition=rev |publisher=Harper Collins |place=Glasgow |year=1994 |page=220}}</ref>\n\nAfter he answered the two ritual questions, the traditional [[Habemus Papam]] announcement was delivered by Cardinal [[Nicola Canali]] to the people at 6:08&nbsp;pm, an exact hour after the white smoke appeared. A short while later, he appeared on the balcony and gave his first [[Urbi et Orbi]] blessing to the crowds of the faithful below in [[Saint Peter's Square]]. That same night, he appointed [[Domenico Tardini]] as his Secretary of State. Of the three cassocks prepared for whomever the new pope was, even the largest was not enough to fit his five-foot-two, 200-plus-pound frame, which had to be let out in certain places and only to be held together with great effort by bobby pins.

The following day, he visited Rome's [[Regina Coeli prison]], where he told the inmates: \"You could not come to me, so I came to you.\" These acts created a sensation, and he wrote in his diary: \"... great astonishment in the Roman, Italian and international press.

In ''[[Pacem in terris]]'', John XXIII also sought to prevent nuclear war and tried to improve relations between the Soviet Union and the United States.

His [[papal coronation]] ran for the traditional five hours (Pope Paul&nbsp;VI, by contrast, opted for a shorter ceremony, while later popes declined to be crowned). Pope John XXIII, like his predecessor Pius XII, chose to have the coronation itself take place on the balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], in view of the crowds assembled in [[Saint Peter's Square]] below.\n\nHe wore a number of papal tiaras during his papacy. On the most formal of occasions would he don the 1877 Palatine tiara he received at his coronation, but on other occasions, he used the 1922 tiara of Pope Pius XI, which was used so often that it was associated with him quite strongly. The people of Bergamo gave him an expensive silver [[Tiara of Pope John XXIII|tiara]], but he requested that the number of jewels used be halved and that the money be given to the poor.\n\n===Liturgical reform===\nMaintaining continuity with his predecessors, John XXIII continued the gradual reform of the Roman liturgy, and published changes that resulted in the [[1962 Roman Missal]], the last typical edition containing the [[Tridentine Mass]] established in 1570 by [[Pope Pius V]] at the request of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n===Beatifications and canonization ceremonies===\n{{Main|List of saints canonized by Pope John XXIII}}\n[[File:Pope John XXIII - Time Magazine Cover - January 4, 1963.jpg|left|thumb|Pope John XXIII on [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] Cover of January 4, 1963|alt=]]\nJohn XXIII beatified four individuals in his reign: [[Elena Guerra]] (26 April 1959), [[Innocenzo da Berzo]] (12 November 1961), [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]] (17 March 1963) and [[Luigi Maria Palazzolo]] (19 March 1963).\n\nHe also canonized a small number of individuals: he canonized [[Charles of Sezze]] and [[Joaquina Vedruna de Mas]] on 12 April 1959, [[Gregorio Barbarigo]] on 26 May 1960, [[Juan de Ribera]] on 12 June 1960, [[Maria Bertilla Boscardin]] on 11 May 1961, [[Martin de Porres]] on 6 May 1962, and [[Antonio Maria Pucci]], [[Francis Mary of Camporosso]] and [[Peter Julian Eymard]] on 9 December 1962.

John XXIII's closing speech made subtle references to [[Pope Pius IX]], and he had expressed the desire to see Pius IX beatified and eventually canonized. In his journal in 1959 during a spiritual retreat, John XXIII made this remark: \"I always think of Pius IX of holy and glorious memory, and by imitating him in his sacrifices, I would like to be worthy to celebrate his canonization\".\n\n===Final months and death===\nOn 23 September 1962, Pope John XXIII was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]. The diagnosis, which was kept from the public, followed nearly eight months of occasional stomach hemorrhages, and reduced the pontiff's appearances. Looking pale and drawn during these events, he gave a hint to his ultimate fate in April 1963, when he said to visitors, \"That which happens to all men perhaps will happen soon to the Pope who speaks to you today.\"\n\nPope John XXIII offered to mediate between US President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962. Both men applauded the pope for his deep commitment to peace. Khrushchev would later send a message via [[Norman Cousins]] and the letter expressed his best wishes for the pontiff's ailing health. John XXIII personally typed and sent a message back to him, thanking him for his letter. Cousins, meanwhile, travelled to [[New York City]] and ensured that John would become [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine's]] '[[Time Person of the Year|Man of the Year]]'. John XXIII became the first Pope to receive the title, followed by [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in 1994 and [[Pope Francis|Francis]] in 2013.\n\nOn 10 February 1963, John XXIII officially opened the process of beatification for the late Cardinal [[Andrea Carlo Ferrari]], [[Archbishop of Milan]] from 1894 to 1921.

On 11 May, the Italian President [[Antonio Segni]] officially awarded Pope John XXIII with the Balzan Prize for his engagement for peace. While in the car en route to the official ceremony, he suffered great stomach pains but insisted on meeting with Segni to receive the award in the [[Quirinal Palace]], refusing to do so within the Vatican. He stated that it would have been an insult to honour a pontiff on the remains of the crucified [[Saint Peter]].<ref name=\"Hebblethwaite 1994 502\">{{Citation |first=Peter |last=Hebblethwaite |title=John XXIII, Pope of the Council |edition=rev |publisher=Harper Collins |place=Glasgow |year=1994 |page=502}}</ref> It was the pope's last public appearance.\n\nOn 25 May 1963, the pope suffered another haemorrhage and required several blood transfusions, but the cancer had perforated the stomach wall and [[peritonitis]] soon set in. The doctors conferred in a decision regarding this matter and John XXIII's aide Loris F. Capovilla broke the news to him saying that the cancer had done its work and nothing could be done for him. Around this time, his remaining siblings arrived to be with him. By 31 May, it had become clear that the cancer had overcome the resistance of John XXIII \u2013 it had left him confined to his bed.\n\n\"At 11&nbsp;am [[Petrus Canisius Van Lierde]] as Papal Sacristan was at the bedside of the dying pope, ready to [[Anointing of the Sick (Catholic Church)|anoint]] him. The pope began to speak for the very last time: ''\"I had the great grace to be born into a Christian family, modest and poor, but with the fear of the Lord. My time on earth is drawing to a close. But Christ lives on and continues his work in the Church. Souls, souls, [[That they all may be one|ut omnes unum sint]].\"''{{Efn | \u2018...that all may be one.\u2019}}  Van Lierde then anointed his eyes, ears, mouth, hands and feet. Overcome by emotion, Van Lierde forgot the right order of anointing. John XXIII gently helped him before bidding those present a last farewell.<ref name=\"Hebblethwaite 1994 502\" />\n\nJohn XXIII died of [[peritonitis]] caused by a perforated stomach at 19:49 local time on 3 June 1963 at the age of 81, ending a historic pontificate of four years and seven months. He died just as a Mass for him finished in Saint Peter's Square below, celebrated by [[Luigi Traglia]]. After he died, his brow was ritually tapped to see if he was dead, and those with him in the room said prayers. Then the room was illuminated, thus informing the people of what had happened. He was buried on 6 June in the Vatican grottos. Two [[wreath]]s, placed on the two sides of his tomb, were donated by the prisoners of the Regina Coeli prison and the Mantova jail in Verona. On 22 June 1963, one day after his friend and successor [[Pope Paul VI]] was elected, the latter prayed at his tomb.\n\nOn 3 December 1963, US President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] posthumously awarded him the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the United States' highest civilian award, in recognition of the good relationship between Pope John XXIII and the United States of America. In his speech on 6 December 1963, Johnson said: \"I have also determined to confer the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously on another noble man whose death we mourned 6 months ago: His Holiness, Pope John XXIII. He was a man of simple origins, of simple faith, of simple charity. In this exalted office he was still the gentle pastor. He believed in discussion and persuasion. He profoundly respected the dignity of man.\nHe gave the world immortal statements of the rights of man, of the obligations of men to each other, of their duty to strive for a world community in which all can live in peace and fraternal friendship. His goodness reached across temporal boundaries to warm the hearts of men of all nations and of all faiths\".\n\nThe citation for the medal reads:\n''His Holiness Pope John XXIII, dedicated servant of God. He brought to all citizens of the planet a heightened sense of the dignity of the individual, of the brotherhood of man, and of the common duty to build an environment of peace for all human kind.''{{Clear}}\n\n==Beatification and canonization==\n{{Main|Canonization of Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II}}\n[[File:Reliquienschrein Papst Johannes XXIII. - Petersdom 1.JPG|thumb|left|215px|The body of John XXIII in the altar of Saint Jerome]]\n[[File:Canonization 2014- The Canonization of Saint John XXIII and Saint John Paul II (14036819834).jpg|thumb|left|215px|The canonization ceremony of John XXIII and John Paul II]]\nHe was known affectionately as the \"Good Pope\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/popes-john-paul-ii-john-xxiii-canonized-april-083140672.html |agency=Associated Press |title=Popes John Paul II, John XXIII canonized April 27 |date=30 September 2013 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |first=Nicole |last=Weinfeld}}</ref> His cause for canonization was opened under [[Pope Paul VI]] during the final session of the [[Second Vatican Council]] on 18 November 1965,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19651118_penultima-sessione-concilio_it.html|title=Penultima sessione generale del Concilio|accessdate=5 June 2014}}</ref> along with the cause of [[Pope Pius XII]].

All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who had kids, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did.

Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764.

To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G.

Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]].

Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]].

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college.

Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P. Greene and J. R. Pole, eds.

It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783.

The Thirteen Colonies had very similar political, constitutional, and legal systems, and were dominated by Protestant English-speakers. The northern colonies were founded primarily for religious reasons, while the southern colonies were founded for financial profit and business expansion. All thirteen were part of [[British America|Britain's possessions]] in the New World, which also included colonies in Canada, Florida, and the Caribbean.\n\nThe colonial population grew from about 2,000 to 2.4 million between 1625 and 1775, sometimes displacing American Indians.

The [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) against France and its Indian allies led to growing tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies. During the 1750s, the colonies began collaborating with one another instead of dealing directly with Britain. These inter-colonial activities cultivated a sense of shared American identity and led to calls for protection of the colonists' \"[[Rights of Englishmen|Rights as Englishmen]]\", especially the principle of \"[[no taxation without representation]]\". Grievances with the British government led to the [[American Revolution]], in which the colonies worked together to form the [[Continental Congress]]. The colonists fought the American Revolutionary War (1775\u201383) with the aid of the [[Kingdom of France]] and, to a much smaller degree, the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Kingdom of Spain]].<ref>Richard Middleton and Anne Lombard, ''Colonial America: A History to 1763'' (4th ed. 2011)</ref>\n\n== British colonies ==\nIn 1606, King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] granted charters to both the [[Plymouth Company]] and the [[London Company]] for the purpose of establishing permanent settlements in America. The London Company established the [[Colony and Dominion of Virginia]] in 1607, the first permanently settled English colony on the continent. The Plymouth Company founded the [[Popham Colony]] on the [[Kennebec River]], but it was short-lived. The [[Plymouth Council for New England]] sponsored several colonization projects, culminating with [[Plymouth Colony]] in 1620 which was settled by English Puritan separatists, known today as the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]].<ref>Richter, pp. 152\u201353</ref> The Dutch, Swedish, and French also established successful American colonies at roughly the same time as the English, but they eventually came under the English crown.

It was a private venture, financed by a group of English [[Lords Proprietors]] who obtained a [[Royal Charter]] to the Carolinas in 1663, hoping that a new colony in the south would become profitable like Jamestown. Carolina was not settled until 1670, and even then the first attempt failed because there was no incentive for emigration to that area. Eventually, however, the Lords combined their remaining capital and financed a settlement mission to the area led by Sir [[John Colleton]]. The expedition located fertile and defensible ground at what became [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], originally Charles Town for [[Charles II of England]].<ref>Robert M. Weir, ''Colonial South Carolina: A History'' (1983).</ref>\n\n===New England===\nThe [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrims]] were a small group of Puritan separatists who felt that they needed to distance themselves physically from the Church of England, which they perceived as corrupted. They initially moved to the Netherlands, but eventually sailed to America in 1620 on the ''[[Mayflower]]''. Upon their arrival, they drew up the [[Mayflower Compact]], by which they bound themselves together as a united community, thus establishing the small [[Plymouth Colony]]. [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]] was their main leader. After its founding, other settlers traveled from England to join the colony.<ref>Nathaniel Philbrick, ''Mayflower: A Story of Courage, Community, and War Paperback'' (2007).</ref>\n\nMore Puritans immigrated in 1629 and established the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] with 400 settlers. They sought to reform the [[Church of England]] by creating a new, ideologically pure church in the New World. By 1640, [[Migration to New England (1620\u20131640)|20,000 had arrived]]; many died soon after arrival, but the others found a healthy climate and an ample food supply. The Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies together spawned other Puritan colonies in New England, including the [[New Haven Colony|New Haven]], [[Saybrook Colony|Saybrook]], and [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] colonies. During the 17th century, the New Haven and Saybrook colonies were absorbed by Connecticut.<ref>Francis J. Bremer, ''The Puritan Experiment: New England Society from Bradford to Edwards'' (1995).</ref>\n\n[[Roger Williams]] established [[Providence Plantations]] in 1636 on land provided by [[Narragansett people|Narragansett]] sachem [[Canonicus]]. Williams was a Puritan who preached religious tolerance, [[separation of Church and State]], and a complete break with the Church of England. He was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony over theological disagreements; he founded the settlement based on an egalitarian constitution, providing for majority rule \"in civil things\" and \"liberty of conscience\" in religious matters.<ref name=\"taylor\"/><ref>Benjamin Woods Labaree, ''Colonial Massachusetts: a history'' (1979)</ref> In 1637, a second group including [[Anne Hutchinson]] established a second settlement on [[Aquidneck Island]], also known as Rhode Island.\n\nOther colonists settled to the north, mingling with adventurers and profit-oriented settlers to establish more religiously diverse colonies in [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] and [[Province of Maine|Maine]]. Massachusetts absorbed these small settlements when it made significant land claims in the 1640s and 1650s, but New Hampshire was eventually given a separate charter in 1679. Maine remained a part of Massachusetts until achieving statehood in 1820.\n\nIn 1685, King [[James II of England]] closed the legislatures and consolidated the New England colonies into the [[Dominion of New England]], putting the region under control of Governor [[Edmund Andros]]. In 1688, the colonies of New York, West Jersey, and East Jersey were added to the dominion. Andros was overthrown and the dominion was closed in 1689, after the [[Glorious Revolution]] deposed King James II; the former colonies were re-established.<ref name=\"HallLederKammen2012\">{{cite book|editor1=Michael G.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] established permanent settlements on the Hudson River, creating the Dutch colony of [[New Netherland]]. In 1626, [[Peter Minuit]] purchased the island of [[Manhattan]] from the [[Lenape]] Indians and established the outpost of [[New Amsterdam]].<ref>Richter, pp. 138\u201340</ref> Relatively few Dutch settled in New Netherland, but the colony came to dominate the regional fur trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 159\u2013\n60</ref> It also served as the base for extensive trade with the English colonies, and many products from New England and Virginia were carried to Europe on Dutch ships.<ref>Richter pp. 212\u201313</ref> The Dutch also engaged in the burgeoning [[Atlantic slave trade]], supplying enslaved Africans to the English colonies in North America and [[Barbados]].<ref>Richter pp. 214\u201315</ref> The West India Company desired to grow New Netherland as it became commercially successful, yet the colony failed to attract the same level of settlement as the English colonies did.

Large numbers of Dutch remained in the colony, dominating the rural areas between New York City and Albany, while people from New England started moving in as well as immigrants from Germany. New York City attracted a large polyglot population, including a large black slave population.<ref>Michael G.

From that time until 1708, the northern and southern settlements remained under one government. However, during this period, the two halves of the province began increasingly to be known as North Carolina and South Carolina, as the descendants of the colony's proprietors fought over the direction of the colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 319\u201322</ref> The colonists of Charles Town finally deposed their governor and elected their own government. This marked the start of separate governments in the [[Province of North-Carolina]] and the [[Province of South Carolina]]. In 1729, the king formally revoked Carolina's colonial charter and established both North Carolina and South Carolina as crown colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 323\u201324</ref>\n\n[[File:North America 1748.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|The Thirteen Colonies and neighboring polities in 1748]]\nIn the 1730s, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliamentarian]] [[James Oglethorpe]] proposed that the area south of the Carolinas be colonized with the \"worthy poor\" of England to provide an alternative to the overcrowded debtors' prisons. Oglethorpe and other English philanthropists secured a royal charter as the Trustees of the colony of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on June 9, 1732.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/statech.asp Colonial charters, grants and related documents]</ref> Oglethorpe and his compatriots hoped to establish a utopian colony that banned slavery and recruited only the most worthy settlers, but by 1750 the colony remained sparsely populated. The proprietors gave up their charter in 1752, at which point Georgia became a crown colony.<ref>Richter, pp. 358\u201359</ref>\n\nThe colonial population of Thirteen Colonies grew immensely in the 18th century. According to historian Alan Taylor, the population of the Thirteen Colonies stood at 1.5 million in 1750, which represented four-fifths of the population of [[British North America]].<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 20</ref> More than 90 percent of the colonists lived as farmers, though some seaports also flourished. In 1760, the cities of Philadelphia, New York, and [[Boston]] had a population in excess of 16,000, which was small by European standards.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 23</ref> By 1770, the economic output of the Thirteen Colonies made up forty percent of the [[gross domestic product]] of the British Empire.<ref>Taylor (2016), p. 25</ref>\n\nAs the 18th century progressed, colonists began to settle far from the Atlantic coast. Pennsylvania, Virginia, Connecticut, and Maryland all laid claim to the land in the [[Ohio River]] valley. The colonies engaged in a scramble to purchase land from Indian tribes, as the British insisted that claims to land should rest on legitimate purchases.<ref>Richter, pp. 373\u201374</ref> Virginia was particularly intent on western expansion, and most of the elite Virginia families invested in the [[Ohio Company]] to promote the settlement of [[Ohio Country]].<ref>Richter, pp. 376\u201377</ref>\n\n===Global trade and immigration===\nThe British colonies in North America became part of the global British trading network, as the value tripled for exports from British North America to Britain between 1700 and 1754. The colonists were restricted in trading with other European powers, but they found profitable trade partners in the other British colonies, particularly in the Caribbean. The colonists traded foodstuffs, wood, tobacco, and various other resources for Asian tea, West Indian coffee, and West Indian sugar, among other items.<ref>Richter, pp. 329\u201330</ref> American Indians far from the Atlantic coast supplied the Atlantic market with beaver fur and deerskins.<ref>Richter, pp. 332\u201336</ref> British North America had an advantage in natural resources and established its own thriving shipbuilding industry, and many North American merchants engaged in the transatlantic trade.<ref>Richter, pp. 330\u201331</ref>\n\nImproved economic conditions and easing of religious persecution in Europe made it more difficult to recruit labor to the colonies, and many colonies became increasingly reliant on slave labor, particularly in the South. The population of slaves in British North America grew dramatically between 1680 and 1750, and the growth was driven by a mixture of forced immigration and the reproduction of slaves.<ref>Richter, pp. 346\u201347</ref> Slaves supported vast plantation economies in the South, while slaves in the North worked in a variety of occupations.<ref>Richter, pp. 351\u201352</ref> There were some slave revolts, such as the [[Stono Rebellion]] and the [[New York Conspiracy of 1741]], but these uprisings were suppressed.<ref>Richter, pp. 353\u201354</ref>\n\nA small proportion of the English population migrated to British North America after 1700, but the colonies attracted new immigrants from other European countries. These immigrants traveled to all of the colonies, but the Middle Colonies attracted the most and continued to be more ethnically diverse than the other colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 18\u201319</ref> Numerous settlers immigrated from [[Ireland]],<ref>Richter, p. 360</ref> both Catholic and Protestant\u2014particularly \"[[Old and New Light|New Light]]\" [[Ulster]] [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]].<ref>Richter, p. 361</ref> Protestant Germans also migrated in large numbers, particularly to Pennsylvania.<ref>Richter, p. 362</ref> In the 1740s, the Thirteen Colonies underwent the [[First Great Awakening]].<ref>Middlekauff, pp. 46\u201349</ref>\n\n===French and Indian War===\nIn 1738, an incident involving a Welsh mariner named [[Robert Jenkins (master mariner)|Robert Jenkins]] sparked the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Britain and Spain. Hundreds of North Americans volunteered for Admiral [[Edward Vernon]]'s [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias|assault]] on [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartegena de Indias]], a Spanish city in South America.<ref>Richter, p. 345</ref> The war against Spain merged into a broader conflict known as the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], but most colonists called it [[King George's War]].<ref>Richter, pp. 379\u201380</ref> In 1745, British and colonial forces [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|captured]] the town of [[Louisbourg]], and the war came to an end with the 1748 [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]]. However, many colonists were angered when Britain returned Louisbourg to France in return for [[Chennai|Madras]] and other territories.<ref>Richter, pp. 380\u201381</ref> In the aftermath of the war, both the British and French sought to expand into the Ohio River valley.<ref>Richter, pp. 383\u201385</ref>\n\nThe [[French and Indian War]] (1754\u201363) was the American extension of the general European conflict known as the [[Seven Years' War]]. Previous colonial wars in North America had started in Europe and then spread to the colonies, but the French and Indian War is notable for having started in North America and spread to Europe. One of the primary causes of the war was increasing competition between Britain and France, especially in the Great Lakes and Ohio valley.<ref name=\"anderson\">Fred Anderson, ''The War That Made America: A Short History of the French and Indian War'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French and Indian War took on a new significance for the British North American colonists when [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt the Elder]] decided that major military resources needed to be devoted to North America in order to win the war against France. For the first time, the continent became one of the main theaters of what could be termed a \"[[world war]]\". During the war, it became increasingly apparent to American colonists that they were under the authority of the British Empire, as British military and civilian officials took on an increased presence in their lives.\n\nThe war also increased a sense of American unity in other ways. It caused men to travel across the continent who might otherwise have never left their own colony, fighting alongside men from decidedly different backgrounds who were nonetheless still American. Throughout the course of the war, British officers trained Americans for battle, most notably [[George Washington]], which benefited the American cause during the Revolution. Also, colonial legislatures and officials had to cooperate intensively in pursuit of the continent-wide military effort.<ref name=\"anderson\"/> The relations were not always positive between the British military establishment and the colonists, setting the stage for later distrust and dislike of British troops. At the 1754 [[Albany Congress]], Pennsylvania colonist [[Benjamin Franklin]] proposed the [[Albany Plan]] which would have created a unified government of the Thirteen Colonies for coordination of defense and other matters, but the plan was rejected by the leaders of most colonies.<ref>Richter, pp. 390\u201391</ref>\n\n[[File:NorthAmerica1762-83.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Territorial changes following the French and Indian War; land held by the British before 1763 is shown in red, land gained by Britain in 1763 is shown in pink]]\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]], France formally ceded to Britain the eastern part of its vast North American empire, having secretly given to Spain the territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]] west of the Mississippi River the previous year. Before the war, Britain held the thirteen American colonies, most of present-day [[Nova Scotia]], and most of the [[Hudson Bay]] watershed. Following the war, Britain gained all French territory east of the Mississippi River, including Quebec, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio River valley. Britain also gained [[Spanish Florida]], from which it formed the colonies of [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]]. In removing a major foreign threat to the thirteen colonies, the war also largely removed the colonists' need of colonial protection.\n\nThe British and colonists triumphed jointly over a common foe. The colonists' loyalty to the mother country was stronger than ever before. However, disunity was beginning to form. [[British Prime Minister]] William Pitt the Elder had decided to wage the war in the colonies with the use of troops from the colonies and tax funds from Britain itself. This was a successful wartime strategy but, after the war was over, each side believed that it had borne a greater burden than the other. The British elite, the most heavily taxed of any in Europe, pointed out angrily that the colonists paid little to the royal coffers. The colonists replied that their sons had fought and died in a war that served European interests more than their own. This dispute was a link in the chain of events that soon brought about the American Revolution.<ref name=\"anderson\"/>\n\n===Growing dissent===\nThe British were left with large debts following the French and Indian War, so British leaders decided to increase taxation and control of the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 51\u201353</ref> They imposed several new taxes, beginning with the [[Sugar Act]] of 1764. Later acts included the [[Currency Act of 1764]], the [[Stamp Act of 1765]], and the [[Townshend Acts]] of 1767.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 94\u201396, 107</ref>\n\nThe British also sought to maintain peaceful relations with those Indian tribes that had allied with the French by keeping them separated from the American frontiersmen. To this end, the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] restricted settlement west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], as this was designated an [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].<ref>Colin G. Calloway, ''The Scratch of a Pen: 1763 and the Transformation of North America'' (2006), pp. 92\u201398</ref> Some groups of settlers disregarded the proclamation, however, and continued to move west and establish farms.<ref>W.

Parliament rejected the colonial protests and asserted its authority by passing new taxes.\n\nColonial discontentment grew with the passage of the 1773 [[Tea Act]], which reduced taxes on tea sold by the [[East India Company]] in an effort to undercut competition, and Prime Minister North's ministry hoped that this would establish a precedent of colonists accepting British taxation policies. Trouble escalated over the tea tax, as Americans in each colony boycotted the tea, and those in Boston dumped the tea in the harbor during the [[Boston Tea Party]] in 1773 when the [[Sons of Liberty]] dumped thousands of pounds of tea into the water. Tensions escalated in 1774 as Parliament passed the laws known as the [[Intolerable Acts]], which greatly restricted self-government in the colony of Massachusetts. These laws also allowed British military commanders to claim colonial homes for the quartering of soldiers, regardless whether the American civilians were willing or not to have soldiers in their homes. The laws further revoked colonial rights to hold trials in cases involving soldiers or crown officials, forcing such trials to be held in England rather than in America. Parliament also sent [[Thomas Gage]] to serve as Governor of Massachusetts and as the commander of British forces in North America.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 112\u201314</ref>\n\nBy 1774, colonists still hoped to remain part of the British Empire, but discontentment was widespread concerning British rule throughout the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201321</ref> Colonists elected delegates to the [[First Continental Congress]] which convened in [[Philadelphia]] in September 1774. In the aftermath of the Intolerable Acts, the delegates asserted that the colonies owed allegiance only to the king; they would accept royal governors as agents of the king, but they were no longer willing to recognize Parliament's right to pass legislation affecting the colonies. Most delegates opposed an attack on the British position in Boston, and the Continental Congress instead agreed to the imposition of a boycott known as the [[Continental Association]]. The boycott proved effective and the value of British imports dropped dramatically.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 123\u201327</ref> The Thirteen Colonies became increasingly divided between [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] opposed to British rule and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] who supported it.<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 137\u201338</ref>\n\n==American Revolution==\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:British colonies 1763-76 shepherd1923.PNG|thumb|upright=1.50|Map of the Thirteen Colonies (red) and nearby colonial areas (1763\u20131775) just before the Revolutionary War]]\n\nIn response, the colonies formed bodies of elected representatives known as [[Provincial Congress]]es, and Colonists began to boycott imported British merchandise.<ref>T.H.

During the [[Second Continental Congress]], the remaining colony of Georgia sent delegates, as well.\n\nMassachusetts Governor [[Thomas Gage]] feared a confrontation with the colonists; he requested reinforcements from Britain, but the British government was not willing to pay for the expense of stationing tens of thousands of soldiers in the Thirteen Colonies. Gage was instead ordered to seize Patriot arsenals. He dispatched a force to march on the arsenal at [[Concord, Massachusetts]], but the Patriots learned about it and blocked their advance. The Patriots repulsed the British force at the April 1775 [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]], then lay [[Siege of Boston|siege to Boston]].<ref>Taylor (2016), pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\nBy spring 1775, all royal officials had been expelled, and the [[Continental Congress]] hosted a convention of delegates for the 13 colonies. It raised an army to fight the British and named George Washington its commander, made treaties, declared independence, and recommended that the colonies write constitutions and become states.<ref>[[Robert Middlekauff]], ''The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789'' (Oxford History of the United States) (2007)</ref> The [[Second Continental Congress]] assembled in May 1775 and began to coordinate armed resistance against Britain. It established a government that recruited soldiers and printed its own money. General Washington took command of the Patriot soldiers in New England and forced the British to withdraw from Boston. In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies declared their independence from Britain. With the help of France and Spain, they defeated the British in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. In the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], Britain officially recognized the independence of the United States of America.\n\n==Thirteen British colonies population==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; clear:right; margin-left:8px; margin-right:0;\"\n|+ Population of the thirteen British colonies<ref>Note: the population figures are estimates by historians; they do not include the Indian tribes outside the jurisdiction of the colonies.

From 1770 until 1860, the rate of natural growth of North American slaves was much greater than for the population of any nation in Europe, and was nearly twice as rapid as that in England.\n\n==Religion==\nProtestantism was the predominant religious affiliation in the Thirteen Colonies, although there were also Catholics, Jews, and [[deists]], and a large fraction had no religious connection. The [[Church of England]] was officially established in most of the South. The [[Puritan movement]] became the [[Congregational church]], and it was the established religious affiliation in Massachusetts and Connecticut into the 18th century.<ref>Stephen Foster, ''The Long Argument: English Puritanism and the Shaping of New England Culture, 1570\u20131700;'' (1996).</ref> In practice, this meant that tax revenues were allocated to church expenses. The [[Anglican]] parishes in the South were under the control of local vestries and had public functions such as repair of the roads and relief of the poor.<ref>Patricia U. Bonomi, ''Under the cope of heaven: Religion, society, and politics in Colonial America'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe colonies were religiously diverse, with different Protestant denominations brought by British, German, Dutch, and other immigrants. The [[Reformed tradition]] was the foundation for [[Presbyterian]], [[Congregationalist]], and [[Continental Reformed]] denominations. French [[Huguenots]] set up their own Reformed congregations. The [[Dutch Reformed Church]] was strong among [[Dutch Americans]] in New York and New Jersey, while [[Lutheranism]] was prevalent among [[German American|German immigrants]]. Germans also brought diverse forms of [[Anabaptism]], especially the [[Mennonite]] variety. [[Reformed Baptist]] preacher [[Roger Williams]] founded [[Providence Plantations]] which became the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. Jews were clustered in a few port cities.

Of the 200\u2013250,000 Irish who came to the Colonies between 1701 and 1775 less than 20,000 were Catholic, many of whom hid their faith or lapsed because of prejudice and discrimination.

The oldest colleges were [[Harvard College|New College (Harvard)]], [[Princeton College|College of New Jersey (Princeton)]], [[Yale College|Collegiate School (Yale)]], [[Columbia University|King's College (Columbia)]], and the [[Brown University|College of Rhode Island (Brown)]]. Other colleges were [[University of Pennsylvania|College of Philadelphia (University of Pennsylvania)]], [[Rutgers College|Queen's College (Rutgers)]] and [[Dartmouth College]] in New Hampshire. South of Philadelphia, there was only the [[College of William and Mary]] which trained the secular elite in Virginia, especially aspiring lawyers.\n\nThe southern colonies held the belief that the family had the responsibility of educating their children, mirroring the common belief in Europe. Wealthy families either used tutors and governesses from Britain or sent children to school in England. By the 1700s, university students based in the colonies began to act as tutors.<ref>Urban, Wayne J. and Jennings L. Wagoner, Jr. ''American Education: A History''.

Girls were educated at home or by small local private schools, and they had no access to college. Aspiring physicians and lawyers typically learned as apprentices to an established practitioner, although some young men went to medical schools in Scotland.<ref>Wayne J. Urban and Jennings L. Wagoner Jr., ''American Education: A History'' (5th ed. 2013) pp 11\u201354.</ref>\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies}}\n\nThe three forms of colonial government in 1776 were provincial ([[royal colony]]), [[Proprietary colony|proprietary]], and [[Charter colony|charter]]. These governments were all subordinate to the British monarch with no representation in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. The administration of all British colonies was overseen by the [[Board of Trade]] in London beginning late in the 17th century.\n\nThe provincial colony was governed by commissions created at pleasure of the king. A governor and his council were appointed by the crown. The governor was invested with general executive powers and authorized to call a locally elected assembly. The governor's council would sit as an upper house when the assembly was in session, in addition to its role in advising the governor. Assemblies were made up of representatives elected by the freeholders and planters (landowners) of the province. The governor had the power of absolute veto and could [[Legislative session|prorogue]] (i.e., delay) and dissolve the assembly. The assembly's role was to make all local laws and ordinances, ensuring that they were not inconsistent with the laws of Britain. In practice, this did not always occur, since many of the provincial assemblies sought to expand their powers and limit those of the governor and crown. Laws could be examined by the British Privy Council or Board of Trade, which also held veto power of legislation. New Hampshire, New York, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia were crown colonies. Massachusetts became a crown colony at the end of the 17th century.\n\nProprietary colonies were governed much as royal colonies, except that lord proprietors appointed the governor rather than the king. They were set up after the [[English Restoration]] of 1660 and typically enjoyed greater civil and religious liberty. Pennsylvania (which included Delaware), New Jersey, and Maryland were proprietary colonies.<ref>John Andrew Doyle, ''English Colonies in America: Volume IV The Middle Colonies'' (1907) [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wYOAAAAIAAJ  online]</ref>\n\nCharter governments were political corporations created by [[letters patent]], giving the grantees control of the land and the powers of legislative government. The charters provided a fundamental constitution and divided powers among legislative, executive, and judicial functions, with those powers being vested in officials. Massachusetts, Providence Plantation, Rhode Island, Warwick, and Connecticut were charter colonies. The Massachusetts charter was revoked in 1684 and was replaced by a provincial charter that was issued in 1691.<ref>Louise Phelps Kellogg, ''The American colonial charter'' (1904) [https://archive.org/details/americancolonia00kellgoog  online]</ref> [[Providence Plantations]] merged with the settlements at [[Aquidneck Island|Rhode Island]] and [[Warwick, Rhode Island|Warwick]] to form the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], which also became a charter colony in 1636.\n\n===British role===\nAfter 1680, the imperial government in London took an increasing interest in the affairs of the colonies, which were growing rapidly in population and wealth. In 1680, only Virginia was a royal colony; by 1720, half were under the control of royal governors. These governors were appointees closely tied to the government in London.\n\nHistorians before the 1880s emphasized American nationalism. However, scholarship after that time was heavily influenced by the \"Imperial school\" led by [[Herbert L. Osgood]], [[George Louis Beer]], [[Charles McLean Andrews]], and [[Lawrence H. Gipson]]. This viewpoint dominated colonial historiography into the 1940s, and they emphasized and often praised the attention that London gave to all the colonies. In this view, there was never a threat (before the 1770s) that any colony would revolt or seek independence.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=27787750|url=http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/7801/9315|title=The Imperial School of American Colonial Historians|journal=Indiana Magazine of History|volume=45|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|last1=Savelle|first1=Max|year=1949}}</ref>\n\n===Self-government===\nBritish settlers did not come to the American colonies with the intention of creating a democratic system; yet they quickly created a broad electorate without a land-owning aristocracy, along with a pattern of free elections which put a strong emphasis on voter participation. The colonies offered a much freer degree of [[suffrage]] than Britain or indeed any other country. Any property owner could vote for members of the lower house of the legislature, and they could even vote for the governor in Connecticut and Rhode Island.<ref name=\"Robert\">Robert J. Dinkin, ''Voting in Provincial America: A Study of Elections in the Thirteen Colonies, 1689\u20131776'' (1977)</ref> Voters were required to hold an \"interest\" in society; as the South Carolina legislature said in 1716, \"it is necessary and reasonable, that none but such persons will have an interest in the Province should be capable to elect members of the Commons House of Assembly\".<ref>Thomas Cooper and David James McCord, eds. ''The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts, 1685\u20131716'' (1837) p. 688</ref> The main legal criterion for having an \"interest\" was ownership of real estate property, which was uncommon in Britain, where 19 out of 20 men were controlled politically by their landlords. (Women, children, indentured servants, and slaves were subsumed under the interest of the family head.) London insisted on this requirement for the colonies, telling governors to exclude from the ballot men who were not freeholders\u2014that is, those who did not own land. Nevertheless, land was so widely owned that 50% to 80% of the men were eligible to vote.<ref>Alexander Keyssar, ''The Right to Vote'' (2000) pp. 5\u20138</ref>\n\nThe colonial political culture emphasized deference, so that local notables were the men who ran and were chosen. But sometimes they competed with each other and had to appeal to the common man for votes. There were no political parties, and would-be legislators formed ad-hoc coalitions of their families, friends, and neighbors. Outside of Puritan New England, election day brought in all the men from the countryside to the county seat to make merry, politick, shake hands with the grandees, meet old friends, and hear the speeches\u2014all the while toasting, eating, treating, tippling, and gambling. They voted by shouting their choice to the clerk, as supporters cheered or booed. Candidate [[George Washington]] spent \u00a339 for treats for his supporters. The candidates knew that they had to \"swill the planters with bumbo\" (rum). Elections were carnivals where all men were equal for one day and traditional restraints were relaxed.<ref>Daniel Vickers, ''A Companion to Colonial America'' (2006) p. 300</ref>\n\nThe actual rate of voting ranged from 20% to 40% of all adult white males. The rates were higher in Pennsylvania and New York, where long-standing factions based on ethnic and religious groups mobilized supporters at a higher rate. New York and Rhode Island developed long-lasting two-faction systems that held together for years at the colony level, but they did not reach into local affairs. The factions were based on the personalities of a few leaders and an array of family connections, and they had little basis in policy or ideology. Elsewhere the political scene was in a constant whirl, based on personality rather than long-lived factions or serious disputes on issues.<ref name=\"Robert\" />\n\nThe colonies were independent of one other long before 1774; indeed, all the colonies began as separate and unique settlements or plantations. Further, efforts had failed to form a colonial union through the [[Albany Congress]] of 1754 led by [[Benjamin Franklin]]. The thirteen all had well-established systems of self-government and elections based on the [[Rights of Englishmen]] which they were determined to protect from imperial interference.<ref>Greene and Pole, eds. (2004), p. 665</ref>\n\n===Economic policy===\nThe British Empire at the time operated under the [[Mercantilism|mercantile system]], where all trade was concentrated inside the Empire, and trade with other empires was forbidden. The goal was to enrich Britain\u2014its merchants and its government. Whether the policy was good for the colonists was not an issue in London, but Americans became increasingly restive with mercantilist policies.<ref>Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204\u201311]</ref>\n\nMercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants\u2014and kept others out\u2014by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling\u2014which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch.<ref>George Otto Trevelyan, ''The American revolution: Volume 1'' [https://archive.org/details/americanrevolut14trevgoog/page/n13 <!-- pg=128 quote=smuggling american revolution. --> (1899) p. 128 online]</ref> The tactic used by mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a superb [[History of the Royal Navy#Expansion of the fighting force, 1642\u20131689|Royal Navy]], which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. Thus the British Navy captured [[New Amsterdam]] (New York) in 1664. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.<ref>William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.</ref>\n\nBritain implemented mercantilism by trying to block American trade with the French, Spanish, or Dutch empires using the [[Navigation Acts]], which Americans avoided as often as they could. The royal officials responded to smuggling with open-ended search warrants ([[Writ of assistance|Writs of Assistance]]). In 1761, Boston lawyer [[James Otis, Jr.|James Otis]] argued that the writs violated the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|constitutional rights]] of the colonists. He lost the case, but John Adams later wrote, \"Then and there the child Independence was born.\"<ref name=Stephens2006>Stephens, ''Unreasonable Searches and Seizures'' (2006) p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, the colonists took pains to argue that they did not oppose British regulation of their external trade; they only opposed legislation which affected them internally.\n\n==Other British colonies==\n{{main|British America}}\n[[File:British Colonies in North America c1750 v2.png|thumb|right|British colonies in North America, {{Circa|1750}}{{ordered list|[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]|Nova Scotia|Thirteen Colonies|Bermuda|[[Bahamas]]|[[British Honduras]]|[[Jamaica]]|[[British Leeward Islands]] and [[Barbados]]}}]]\n\nBesides these thirteen colonies, Britain had another dozen in the [[British America|New World]]. Those in the [[British West Indies]], [[Newfoundland Colony|Newfoundland]], the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], [[Bermuda]], and [[East Florida|East]] and [[West Florida]] remained loyal to the crown throughout the war (although Spain reacquired Florida before the war was over, and later  sold it to the United States). There was a certain degree of sympathy with the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause in several of the other colonies, but their geographical isolation and the dominance of British naval power precluded any effective participation.<ref>Jack P.

It was tightly bound to Britain and controlled by the Royal Navy and had no assembly that could voice grievances.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nNova Scotia had a large [[Yankee]] element that had recently arrived from New England, and shared the sentiments of the Americans about demanding the rights of the British men. The royal government in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] reluctantly allowed the Yankees of Nova Scotia a kind of \"neutrality\". In any case, the island-like geography and the presence of the major British naval base at Halifax made the thought of armed resistance impossible.<ref>Meinig pp. 313\u201314; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 61</ref>\n\nQuebec was inhabited by French Catholic settlers who came under British control in the previous decade. The [[Quebec Act of 1774]] gave them formal cultural autonomy within the empire, and many priests feared the intense Protestantism in New England. The American grievances over taxation had little relevance, and there was no assembly nor elections of any kind that could have mobilized any grievances. Even so, the Americans offered membership in the new nation and sent a military expedition that failed to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|capture Canada]] in 1775. Most Canadians remained neutral but some joined the American cause.<ref>Meinig pp 314\u201315; Greene and Pole (2004) ch 61</ref>\n\nIn the West Indies the elected assemblies of Jamaica, [[Grenada]], and Barbados formally declared their sympathies for the American cause and called for mediation, but the others were quite loyal. Britain carefully avoided antagonizing the rich owners of sugar plantations (many of whom lived in London); in turn the planters' greater dependence on slavery made them recognize the need for British military protection from possible slave revolts. The possibilities for overt action were sharply limited by the overwhelming power of Royal Navy in the islands. During the war there was some opportunistic trading with American ships.<ref>Andrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, ''An Empire Divided: The American Revolution and the British Caribbean'' (2000) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn Bermuda and the Bahamas local leaders were angry at the food shortages caused by British blockade of American ports. There was increasing sympathy for the American cause, including smuggling, and both colonies were considered \"passive allies\" of the United States throughout the war. When an American naval squadron arrived in the Bahamas to seize gunpowder, the colony gave no resistance at all.<ref>Meinig pp. 315\u201316; Greene and Pole (2004) ch. 63</ref>\n\nEast Florida and West Florida were territories transferred from Spain to Britain after the French and Indian War by treaty. The few British colonists there needed protection from attacks by Indians and Spanish privateers. After 1775, East Florida became a major base for the British war effort in the South, especially in the invasions of Georgia and South Carolina.<ref>Meinig p. 316</ref> However, Spain seized Pensacola in West Florida in 1781, then recovered both territories in the [[Peace of Paris (1783)#Treaty with Spain|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the war in 1783.

In more recent times, sholapith handicrafts have found a wider application in home d\u00e9cor such as Hindu gods and artistic objects.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.zimbio.com/Asian+Home+Decor/articles/34/Shola+craft+Bengal+Magic+soft+reed |title = Shola-pith |accessdate = 2009-05-04|last =   |first =    |work =  |publisher =zimbio.com}}</ref>\n\nSholapith is similar in form to man-made  [[Polystyrene#Foams|polystyrene foam]] (sometimes known by the brand names Thermacol and Styrofoam), but is superior in terms of malleability, texture, [[wikt:lustre|lustre]] and sponginess.<ref name=govt/>\n\n==West Bengal==\n[[File:Craft sholapith.jpg|thumb|An example of sholapith craftwork.]]\nIn [[West Bengal]], this craft is mainly practised in the districts of [[Bardhaman district|Bardhaman]], [[Murshidabad district|Murshidabad]], [[Birbhum district|Birbhum]], [[Nadia district|Nadia]], [[Hooghly district|Hooghly]], [[Malda district|Malda]] and south 24 Parganas district. Sholapith craftsmen are known as ''Malakar'', meaning \"garland maker\", probably because they made shola garlands for idols and for the noble class.\n\nAbout 5,000 artisans practice this craft. Craftsmen spend months on each piece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutbengal.com/2009/02/shola_pith_craft_west_bengal/ |title=Shola pith craft of West Bengal |accessdate=2009-05-04 |publisher=aboutbengal.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208003607/http://www.aboutbengal.com/2009/02/shola_pith_craft_west_bengal |archivedate=December 8, 2013 }}</ref> In [[Murshidabad]] shola crafts are flowery designs, decorative headwear of gods and goddesses, garlands, figurines such as the faces of gods and goddesses, elephant [[howdah]]s, peacock boats and [[Litter (vehicle)|palanquins]].<ref name=govt/> Shola products are exported to across the world. In [[South 24 Parganas]], many poor families earn their livelihood from shola products. Big [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ''[[pandal]]s'' of Calcutta are beautifully decorated using shola.\n\nThe idol makers of [[Kumortuli]] who traditionally produced clay idols have taken to making idols of sholapith and [[Fiberglass|fibreglass]]. While fibreglass products can cost around Rs 110,000-120,000, those prepared from sholapith cost Rs 90,000. The height of the idols can vary from four to nine feet. These are mostly purchased for Indian community [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] organizers abroad.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/Kolkata_/Idol_demand_grows_abroad/articleshow/3551285.cms |title = Idol demand grows abroad |accessdate = 2009-05-04|last =   |first =    |work =  |publisher =Times of India, 2 October 2009 |date=2008-10-02}}</ref>\n\n==Pith helmet==\n[[File:Aden Pattern Pith Helmet.jpg|thumb|left|An \"Aden\" or \"Cawnpore\" style of pith helmet. They were manufactured in India until about 1938.]]\nThe shola (sola)-style [[pith helmet]]\u2014also known as the sun helmet, topee, shola topee, salacot or topi, is a lightweight helmet made of shola pith, with a cloth cover and a particular design and thickness designed to shade and insulate the wearer\u2019s head from the sun. It was popular among Westerners in India, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, Iraq, Transjordan, Palestine, Sri Lanka, and other tropical and subtropical British colonies until the late 1960s.\n \nLater this style of hat became associated with colonial oppression and was slowly abandoned by Western visitors, but continues to be used by military units around the world. The Shola-style helmet has, however, recently gained popularity among traffic police in cities such as [[Chennai]] during the summer as they insulate the wearer from the heat.\n\n[[File:Shola Pith Helmet.jpg|thumb|An Indian made 'Bombay Bowler' shola style pith helmet from the WW II era.]]\nThe Shola-style pith helmet usually has a flattened top and thick brim with either square or rounded edges. It is easily confused with other styles of \"pith helmets\" that were manufactured outside India and are usually made from [[Cork (material)|cork]] or other materials. Some shola-style pith helmets feature a crisscross quilt-stitched cloth cover. The latter had more rounded edges at the brim. The cork-style pith helmets, contrary to their misleading name, are not made out of pith; they are much thinner, heavier, and more rounded on the top.\n\nBoth styles of hats feature [[wikt:puggree|puggree]]s, air vents, [[khaki]] or white covers and green inner brim liners. Some have chin straps made of leather, in others they are made of cloth. Some Shola-style pith helmets feature a thin leather belt that runs from under the puggaree across the top. The chin strap commonly runs across the front brim. Shola pith helmets are still sold in Indian, Pakistani and Nepali [[polo]]-equipment stores, though they are seldom used in matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hotnewsitems.blogspot.com//2007/11/pith-helment-coming-back-in-style.html|title=Case Study Blog|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Aeschynomene aspera]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Wood products}}\n{{Culture of West Bengal}}\n\n[[Category:Natural materials]]\n[[Category:Wood products]]\n[[Category:Artistic techniques]]\n[[Category:Culture of West Bengal]]\n[[Category:Hindu art]]\n[[Category:Indian art]]\n", "name_user": "Ludinev", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholapith"}
