In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence.  By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}} Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries.

Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. In 1539 he was elected [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]].\n\n=== Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 ===\nIn April 1540, Sadler was made [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] to the king, a position he held jointly with [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]].

In 1540 he tried to embarrass and undermine the authority of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]], an ally of France, with letters captured from his messenger [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] whose ship had been forced by a storm to put into England. However, [[James V of Scotland]] refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V said he was thankful to Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but still would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Solway Moss]], Sadler was sent to Scotland again, in March 1543, to arrange a marriage between the infant [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and [[Edward VI of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. He was a successful negotiator for the [[Treaty of Greenwich]], although the marriage was not concluded. On 22 March 1543 he rode from Edinburgh to [[Linlithgow Palace]] to see the queen for the first time. [[Mary of Guise]] showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\". Mary reminded him that in turn [[Regent Arran]] wanted his son [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]] to marry [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Mary tried to work on him to intercede for [[Regent Arran]] to release Cardinal Beaton from imprisonment, alleging the Cardinal's political expertise could be employed to mutual benefit.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statepaperslette01sadluoft#page/86/mode/2up/ Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 86-8].</ref> Henry VIII wanted English servants in Mary's household, and Sadler recommended \"Lady Edongcomb\" for this role, his friend the widow of [[Peter Edgecumbe (died 1539)|Peter Edgecumbe]] of [[Cotehele]].<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230.</ref>\n[[File:Queen's Inner Hall, Stirling Castle (5897535215).png|thumb|left|'''Ralph Sadler''' talked to [[Mary of Guise]] in her Audience Chamber at [[Stirling Castle]]]]\nOn 10 August 1543 Sadler wrote to Henry VIII describing another visit to [[Mary of Guise]] and the infant Queen, this time at [[Stirling Castle]];<blockquote>\"(Mary of Guise) is very glad that she is at Stirling, and much she praised there about the house, and told me, \"That her daughter did grow apace; and soon,\" she said, \"she would be a woman, if she took of her mother;\" who indeed, is of the largest stature of women.

Sadlier accompanied Hertford once more into Scotland, in the same role, in September 1545.  He accompanied Lord Hertford again, this time at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in the post of High Treasurer of the Army.  On 10 September 1547, in recognition of his services during the fighting, Sadler was made a [[knight banneret]],.{{sfn|Coros|1982}}  Sadlier was present when [[Stephen Gardiner]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], was arrested, and he also accompanied the force that put down [[Robert Kett]]'s [[Kett's Rebellion|Norfolk Rebellion]].\n\nWhen Henry VIII was preparing his will on Boxing Day 1546, he had already appointed Sadler onto the Council of Regency that was to rule England during Edward VI's minority and left him \u00a3200 in his will.<ref>Weir (2001), p.499</ref>\n\nIn 1550 Sadler sold his mansion at Hackney. He was one of the signatories of Edward VI's will in 1553, proving one of the radicals in a Protestant government.

In this role he handled Cromwell's household business and was also involved in drafting and writing his correspondence.  By 1529, he had become one of Cromwell's most trusted friends and was appointed as an executor of his will.{{sfn|Phillips|2004}} Between 1525 and 1529, his name appeared in Cromwell's correspondence in connection with suppression of monasteries.  It is probably around this time that his talents came to the attention of the king.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=993}} He was granted the manor and lands from the suppressed [[St Leonard's Priory, London|St Leonard's Priory]] in Bow.\n\nIt was probably soon after Cromwell's elevation to the peerage, on 9 July 1536, that Sadler was named a gentleman of the [[Privy Chamber]].{{sfn|Henderson|1897|p=109}}  In the same year, he became [[Member of Parliament|M.P.]] for [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon, Wiltshire]]{{sfn|Coros|1982}} and his name also appears in the list of administrators named for [[Catherine of Aragon]]'s will.{{sfn|Strype I(II)|1822|p=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0102stry#page/252/mode/2up 253]}}\n\nIn January 1537, Sadler was sent to [[Scotland]] to investigate complaints made by [[Margaret Tudor]], the King's sister, against her third husband, [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven]], and to improve Anglo-Scottish relations. He succeeded in both respects. On 1 April 1537, Ralph met [[James V of Scotland]], newly married to [[Madeleine of Valois]], at [[Rouen]].{{sfn|Paul|1907|p=[https://archive.org/stream/accountslordhig00treagoog#page/n78/mode/2up 21]}}\n\nThe King was pleased with Sadler's work, and sent him again to Scotland, this time to discourage the King of Scotland, James V, from accepting [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton's]] proposed Franco-Scottish alliance. Sadlier failed in that respect, but the King was nonetheless impressed with his work. In 1539 he was elected [[knight of the shire]] (MP) for [[Middlesex (UK Parliament constituency)|Middlesex]].\n\n=== Mr. Secretary: Henry VIII and Edward VI, 1540 to 1557 ===\nIn April 1540, Sadler was made [[Secretary of State (England)|principal secretary]] to the king, a position he held jointly with [[Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton|Thomas Wriothesley]].

In 1540 he tried to embarrass and undermine the authority of [[David Beaton|Cardinal Beaton]], an ally of France, with letters captured from his messenger [[Alexander Crichton of Brunstane]] whose ship had been forced by a storm to put into England. However, [[James V of Scotland]] refused to accept that the letters were compromising, and argued in favour of the Cardinal that he had a separate spiritual authority in Scotland apart from the King's own temporal powers. Later, when the Cardinal was present, James and Sadler compared the captured letters with Beaton's copies, and found a discrepancy. James V said he was thankful to Sadler and his uncle Henry VIII but still would not find fault in the Cardinal's actions.<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 25-28, 42-44.</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Solway Moss]], Sadler was sent to Scotland again, in March 1543, to arrange a marriage between the infant [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and [[Edward VI of England|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. He was a successful negotiator for the [[Treaty of Greenwich]], although the marriage was not concluded. On 22 March 1543 he rode from Edinburgh to [[Linlithgow Palace]] to see the queen for the first time. [[Mary of Guise]] showed him the queen out of her swaddling and Sadler wrote that the infant was \"as goodly a child I have seen, and like to live\". Mary reminded him that in turn [[Regent Arran]] wanted his son [[James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran|James Hamilton]] to marry [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Mary tried to work on him to intercede for [[Regent Arran]] to release Cardinal Beaton from imprisonment, alleging the Cardinal's political expertise could be employed to mutual benefit.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/statepaperslette01sadluoft#page/86/mode/2up/ Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), pp. 86-8].</ref> Henry VIII wanted English servants in Mary's household, and Sadler recommended \"Lady Edongcomb\" for this role, his friend the widow of [[Peter Edgecumbe (died 1539)|Peter Edgecumbe]] of [[Cotehele]].<ref>Arthur Clifford, ''Sadler State Papers'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1809), p. 230.</ref>\n[[File:Queen's Inner Hall, Stirling Castle (5897535215).png|thumb|left|'''Ralph Sadler''' talked to [[Mary of Guise]] in her Audience Chamber at [[Stirling Castle]]]]\nOn 10 August 1543 Sadler wrote to Henry VIII describing another visit to [[Mary of Guise]] and the infant Queen, this time at [[Stirling Castle]];<blockquote>\"(Mary of Guise) is very glad that she is at Stirling, and much she praised there about the house, and told me, \"That her daughter did grow apace; and soon,\" she said, \"she would be a woman, if she took of her mother;\" who indeed, is of the largest stature of women.

Sadlier accompanied Hertford once more into Scotland, in the same role, in September 1545.  He accompanied Lord Hertford again, this time at the [[Battle of Pinkie Cleugh]] in the post of High Treasurer of the Army.  On 10 September 1547, in recognition of his services during the fighting, Sadler was made a [[knight banneret]],.{{sfn|Coros|1982}}  Sadlier was present when [[Stephen Gardiner]], [[Bishop of Winchester]], was arrested, and he also accompanied the force that put down [[Robert Kett]]'s [[Kett's Rebellion|Norfolk Rebellion]].\n\nWhen Henry VIII was preparing his will on Boxing Day 1546, he had already appointed Sadler onto the Council of Regency that was to rule England during Edward VI's minority and left him \u00a3200 in his will.<ref>Weir (2001), p.499</ref>\n\nIn 1550 Sadler sold his mansion at Hackney. He was one of the signatories of Edward VI's will in 1553, proving one of the radicals in a Protestant government.

However, she is not that lucky when it comes to love. While working in a [[stock market prediction]] company, she meets Putti ([[Thanaboon Wanlopsirinun]]), a young business customer who is trying his best to get close to her.\n\nNott ([[Perawat Sangpotirat]]) is an aspiring musician who grew up to have met with several unlucky circumstances while growing up. In pursuit of his dream, he teamed up with Nueng ([[Purim Rattanaruangwattana]]) and GD ([[Harit Cheewagaroon]]) to form a band named \"The Comet\" under Mixx\u2019s ([[Witawat Singlampong]]) music label company \u201cMixx Musix\u201d but was disbanded abruptly after their first single failed to be a hit.\n\nDuring a party to celebrate one of \u201cMixx Musix\u201d\u2019s company artist, Jee came together with her close friend and co-employee Bono ([[Ployshompoo Supasap]]) who was wanting to find out what her flirtatious boyfriend Mixx was doing while she was not around. Nott also happened to be at the same event to convince Mixx to give their band another chance. Jee stumbled upon Nott alone and both of them got to talk to each other until they got drank and unknowingly got into a one night stand. This resulted into a change of their fortunes where Jee suddenly got into several problems while Nott, together with his band, became famous.\n\nFor Jee to regain her fortune, she needs to reconnect with Nott where she applied to become his band's manager.\n\n== Cast ==\nBelow are the cast of the series:<ref name=\"ONS\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=\u201c\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e19-\u0e04\u0e23\u0e34\u0e2a\u201d \u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1d\u0e35\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e23\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e41\u0e23\u0e01 \u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01\u0e04\u0e23\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e2a!!! \u0e43\u0e19\u0e0b\u0e35\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e4c \u201cOne Night Steal \u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07\u201d |url=https://www.newsplus.co.th/179258 |website=newsplus.co.th |accessdate=26 November 2019 |language=Thai}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e22\u0e48\u0e2d \"One Night Steal \u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e14\u0e27\u0e07\" |url=https://mgronline.com/drama/detail/9620000113522 |website=mgronline.com |accessdate=27 November 2019 |language=Thai}}</ref>\n=== Main ===\n* [[Perawat Sangpotirat]] (Krist) as Nott\n* [[Sutatta Udomsilp]] (Punpun) as Jee\n\n=== Supporting ===\n* [[Purim Rattanaruangwattana]] (Pluem) as Nueng\n* [[Harit Cheewagaroon]] (Sing) as GD\n* [[Ployshompoo Supasap]] (Jan) as Bono\n* [[Thanaboon Wanlopsirinun]] (Na) as Putti\n* [[Suphitcha Subannaphong]] (Jomjam) as Charm\n* [[Witawat Singlampong]] (Ball) as Mixx\n\n=== Guest role ===\n* [[Thanat Lowkhunsombat]] (Lee) as Himself\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{Episode table|background=#092a81 |overall=1 |airdate=10 |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 1\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|11|24|df=}}\n| ShortSummary        = Jee and Nott narrate how their life fortunes have been growing up where Jee, the lucky person, works in a [[stock market prediction]] company and Nott, the unlucky person, on the other hand is an amateur musician who performs on gigs together with Nueng, his school classmate. As GD joins them, they get a chance to form a band called \"The Comet\" under the music label company \"Mixx Musix\" owned by Mixx where they release their first single entitled \"No Fear\". After failing Mixx's expectations, he decides to tear up the band's contract. Nott tells Nueng and GD that he would find a way to let Mixx reconsider his decision.\n\nBono, who is Mixx's overprotective girlfriend, catches the attention of Jee when she was collecting several lucky charms. Jee then suggests that they join an online contest to a party where Mixx would be in attendance. Nott also attends the same party where he pleads to Mixx for another chance to prove their worth. Failing to convince Mixx, Nott ends up drinking alone disappointed until he meets Jee. Nott then shares about his misfortunes to Jee until they got drunk and ended up into a one night stand.

He later learns from GD and Nueng that their first single has hit 500,000 views thanks to a song cover from Charm, a rising young actress who has over 4 million followers. With this, Mixx decides to offer them a new contract. Their burst into the spotlight gives the band several media exposures and social media buzz which gets Nott perplexed after a series of lucky streaks in his life recently.\n\nJee on the other hand still can't believe that the one night stand she had with Nott resulted into a luck switch.

Nott tells Nueng and GD that he would find a way to let Mixx reconsider his decision.\n\nBono, who is Mixx's overprotective girlfriend, catches the attention of Jee when she was collecting several lucky charms. Jee then suggests that they join an online contest to a party where Mixx would be in attendance. Nott also attends the same party where he pleads to Mixx for another chance to prove their worth. Failing to convince Mixx, Nott ends up drinking alone disappointed until he meets Jee. Nott then shares about his misfortunes to Jee until they got drunk and ended up into a one night stand.

He later learns from GD and Nueng that their first single has hit 500,000 views thanks to a song cover from Charm, a rising young actress who has over 4 million followers. With this, Mixx decides to offer them a new contract. Their burst into the spotlight gives the band several media exposures and social media buzz which gets Nott perplexed after a series of lucky streaks in his life recently.\n\nJee on the other hand still can't believe that the one night stand she had with Nott resulted into a luck switch. After going through several unfortunate events, Bono urges Jee to seek advice from a \"5G fortune teller\" named Pam. Pam then tells Jee that her luck has been overshadowed by someone's misfortune.

He is a former [[List of Strikeforce champions#Heavyweight Championship|Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion]], [[List of Dream champions#Heavyweight Championship|DREAM Heavyweight Champion]], [[List of K-1 champions#K-1 World Grand Prix Champions|K-1 World Grand Prix Champion]], and one of only two fighters to hold world titles in both MMA and K-1 kickboxing at the same time. He holds dual victories over [[Fabricio Werdum]], [[Mark Hunt]] and [[Vitor Belfort]], and has also beaten former UFC champions [[Andrei Arlovski]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Frank Mir]] and [[Brock Lesnar]]. As of December 10, 2019, he is #8 in the [[List of current UFC fighters#Rankings|UFC heavyweight rankings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ufc.com/rankings|title=Rankings {{!}} UFC|website=www.ufc.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nOvereem was born in [[Hounslow]], England to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] father and a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] mother whose family tree connects him to King [[William III of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Overeems-Royal-Lineage-Uncovered-31499|title=Overeem\u2019s Royal Lineage Uncovered|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref> When he was six years old, his parents divorced and he moved with his mother and older brother to the [[Netherlands]]. As a child, Overeem competed in [[judo]], [[track and field]] and [[basketball]]. At the age of 15, Overeem's older brother [[Valentijn Overeem|Valentijn]] took him to [[Chris Dolman]]'s MMA gym to learn to defend himself.<ref name=Bleach>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1049921-alistair-overeem-the-new-biggest-and-baddest-man-on-the-planet|title=UFC: Why Alistair Overeem Is the New Biggest and Baddest Man on the Planet|work=Bleacher Report|date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2016 }}</ref> Alistair initially did not like the sport, but he dedicated fully to it after meeting [[Bas Rutten]] and [[Joop Kasteel]].<ref name=Bleach/>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nOvereem had his first MMA professional fight at 19 years old, defeating [[Ricardo Fyeet]] by submission on {{Start date|df=yes|1999|10|24}} at ''[[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]]'', the first event of the eponymously named promotion.\n\n===Early MMA career===\nAfter posting a 10\u20133 record in RINGS, [[M-1 Global|M-1]], [[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]], and 2 Hot 2 Handle, Overeem debuted in the [[Pride Fighting Championships]] on 20 July 2002, defeating Yusuke Imamura by TKO in 44 seconds.\n\n===PRIDE FC===\nOvereem won two more fights in Pride before entering the 2003 Pride Middleweight Grand Prix at [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|Pride Total Elimination 2003]] and losing to future [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light heavyweight Champion]] [[Chuck Liddell]] in the quarterfinal match. Overeem rebounded to defeat [[Tomohiko Hashimoto]] at the Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2003 in 36 seconds. On 31 October 2004, Overeem fought [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]], defeating him by TKO in the second round at [[Pride 28]]. Overeem lost his next fight against [[Brazilian Top Team]] fighter [[Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira]].\n\nIn 2005, Overeem entered the Pride Middleweight Grand Prix at [[Pride Total Elimination 2005]], in which he defeated [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light heavyweight Champion]] [[Vitor Belfort]] by submission in the opening round. Overeem moved on to fight [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] in the quarterfinals at [[Pride Critical Countdown 2005]] and won via submission in less than two minutes. Overeem lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion [[Maur\u00edcio Rua]].\n\nIn February 2006, Overeem fought Russian Top Team favourite [[Sergei Kharitonov]]. Overeem won, dislocating Kharitonov's shoulder in the process. With his win over Kharitonov, Overeem secured a spot in the PRIDE 2006 Openweight Grand Prix at [[Pride Total Elimination Absolute]]. He fought [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] specialist [[Fabr\u00edcio Werdum]], and lost via [[Armlock#Kimura|kimura]] in the second round.\n\n===Debut in Strikeforce===\nOn June 9, 2006, Overeem travelled to [[San Jose, California]] to win a rematch with [[Vitor Belfort]] by decision at [[Strikeforce: Revenge]].\n\n===Return to PRIDE===\nA month later Overeem returned to PRIDE for a highly anticipated rematch with [[Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira]]. Overeem entered the fight with a heavily taped neck. After controlling the first round and a half with his striking, Overeem was stumbled from a punch, and Nogueira followed with a flurry of strikes. Worried Overeem would be more severely injured, his corner threw in the towel.\n\nAt [[Pride Final Conflict Absolute]], Overeem lost to [[Ricardo Arona]]. Overeem was on the receiving end of a leg kick that caused a non-serious injury to his nerves, causing him to lose feeling in his foot and leg. Unable to mount an offence or defend against Arona, Overeem tapped out to avoid further injury.\n\nHe then suffered another KO loss to [[Maur\u00edcio Rua]] at [[Pride 33]], but returned in June 2007 with a submission win over Michael Knaap at [[K-1 GP 2007 in Amsterdam|K-1 Grand Prix in Amsterdam]] (despite [[K-1]] being a kickboxing promotion, the bout was fought under MMA rules).\n\nOn 17 September 2007, at the Hero's 10: Middleweight Tournament Final, Alistair faced [[Sergei Kharitonov]] again. Overeem showed solid movement as soon as the first round began, but he suffered a KO loss just before the end of the first round.\n\n===Return to Strikeforce/DREAM/Dynamite===\nOn 16 November 2007, Overeem defeated [[Paul Buentello]] for the vacant [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Heavyweight Championship]] by submission due to knee strikes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/strikeforce-results-santiago-tourney-champ-2 |title=Strikeforce Results, Santiago Tourney Champ |date=16 November 2007 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\nOn 15 June 2008 Overeem won by KO in the first round against Lee Tae-Hyun at DREAM 4.

martial artist]] and former [[kickboxer]]. He is a former [[List of Strikeforce champions#Heavyweight Championship|Strikeforce Heavyweight Champion]], [[List of Dream champions#Heavyweight Championship|DREAM Heavyweight Champion]], [[List of K-1 champions#K-1 World Grand Prix Champions|K-1 World Grand Prix Champion]], and one of only two fighters to hold world titles in both MMA and K-1 kickboxing at the same time. He holds dual victories over [[Fabricio Werdum]], [[Mark Hunt]] and [[Vitor Belfort]], and has also beaten former UFC champions [[Andrei Arlovski]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Frank Mir]] and [[Brock Lesnar]]. As of December 10, 2019, he is #8 in the [[List of current UFC fighters#Rankings|UFC heavyweight rankings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ufc.com/rankings|title=Rankings {{!}} UFC|website=www.ufc.com|access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nOvereem was born in [[Hounslow]], England to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] father and a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] mother whose family tree connects him to King [[William III of the Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Overeems-Royal-Lineage-Uncovered-31499|title=Overeem\u2019s Royal Lineage Uncovered|last=Sherdog.com|website=Sherdog|access-date=5 May 2018}}</ref> When he was six years old, his parents divorced and he moved with his mother and older brother to the [[Netherlands]]. As a child, Overeem competed in [[judo]], [[track and field]] and [[basketball]]. At the age of 15, Overeem's older brother [[Valentijn Overeem|Valentijn]] took him to [[Chris Dolman]]'s MMA gym to learn to defend himself.<ref name=Bleach>{{cite news|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1049921-alistair-overeem-the-new-biggest-and-baddest-man-on-the-planet|title=UFC: Why Alistair Overeem Is the New Biggest and Baddest Man on the Planet|work=Bleacher Report|date=12 February 2012 |accessdate=7 July 2016 }}</ref> Alistair initially did not like the sport, but he dedicated fully to it after meeting [[Bas Rutten]] and [[Joop Kasteel]].<ref name=Bleach/>\n\n==Mixed martial arts career==\nOvereem had his first MMA professional fight at 19 years old, defeating [[Ricardo Fyeet]] by submission on {{Start date|df=yes|1999|10|24}} at ''[[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]]'', the first event of the eponymously named promotion.\n\n===Early MMA career===\nAfter posting a 10\u20133 record in RINGS, [[M-1 Global|M-1]], [[It's Showtime (kickboxing)|It's Showtime]], and 2 Hot 2 Handle, Overeem debuted in the [[Pride Fighting Championships]] on 20 July 2002, defeating Yusuke Imamura by TKO in 44 seconds.\n\n===PRIDE FC===\nOvereem won two more fights in Pride before entering the 2003 Pride Middleweight Grand Prix at [[2003 in Pride FC#Pride Total Elimination 2003|Pride Total Elimination 2003]] and losing to future [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light heavyweight Champion]] [[Chuck Liddell]] in the quarterfinal match. Overeem rebounded to defeat [[Tomohiko Hashimoto]] at the Inoki Bom-Ba-Ye 2003 in 36 seconds. On 31 October 2004, Overeem fought [[Hiromitsu Kanehara]], defeating him by TKO in the second round at [[Pride 28]]. Overeem lost his next fight against [[Brazilian Top Team]] fighter [[Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira]].\n\nIn 2005, Overeem entered the Pride Middleweight Grand Prix at [[Pride Total Elimination 2005]], in which he defeated [[UFC Light Heavyweight Championship|UFC Light heavyweight Champion]] [[Vitor Belfort]] by submission in the opening round. Overeem moved on to fight [[Igor Vovchanchyn]] in the quarterfinals at [[Pride Critical Countdown 2005]] and won via submission in less than two minutes. Overeem lost in the semifinals to the eventual champion [[Maur\u00edcio Rua]].\n\nIn February 2006, Overeem fought Russian Top Team favourite [[Sergei Kharitonov]]. Overeem won, dislocating Kharitonov's shoulder in the process. With his win over Kharitonov, Overeem secured a spot in the PRIDE 2006 Openweight Grand Prix at [[Pride Total Elimination Absolute]]. He fought [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] specialist [[Fabr\u00edcio Werdum]], and lost via [[Armlock#Kimura|kimura]] in the second round.\n\n===Debut in Strikeforce===\nOn June 9, 2006, Overeem travelled to [[San Jose, California]] to win a rematch with [[Vitor Belfort]] by decision at [[Strikeforce: Revenge]].\n\n===Return to PRIDE===\nA month later Overeem returned to PRIDE for a highly anticipated rematch with [[Ant\u00f4nio Rog\u00e9rio Nogueira]]. Overeem entered the fight with a heavily taped neck. After controlling the first round and a half with his striking, Overeem was stumbled from a punch, and Nogueira followed with a flurry of strikes. Worried Overeem would be more severely injured, his corner threw in the towel.\n\nAt [[Pride Final Conflict Absolute]], Overeem lost to [[Ricardo Arona]]. Overeem was on the receiving end of a leg kick that caused a non-serious injury to his nerves, causing him to lose feeling in his foot and leg. Unable to mount an offence or defend against Arona, Overeem tapped out to avoid further injury.\n\nHe then suffered another KO loss to [[Maur\u00edcio Rua]] at [[Pride 33]], but returned in June 2007 with a submission win over Michael Knaap at [[K-1 GP 2007 in Amsterdam|K-1 Grand Prix in Amsterdam]] (despite [[K-1]] being a kickboxing promotion, the bout was fought under MMA rules).\n\nOn 17 September 2007, at the Hero's 10: Middleweight Tournament Final, Alistair faced [[Sergei Kharitonov]] again. Overeem showed solid movement as soon as the first round began, but he suffered a KO loss just before the end of the first round.\n\n===Return to Strikeforce/DREAM/Dynamite===\nOn 16 November 2007, Overeem defeated [[Paul Buentello]] for the vacant [[List of Strikeforce champions|Strikeforce Heavyweight Championship]] by submission due to knee strikes.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mmaweekly.com/strikeforce-results-santiago-tourney-champ-2 |title=Strikeforce Results, Santiago Tourney Champ |date=16 November 2007 |publisher=MMAWeekly.com |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\nOn 15 June 2008 Overeem won by KO in the first round against Lee Tae-Hyun at DREAM 4. On 21 July 2008, Overeem defeated [[K-1 World Grand Prix 2001|K-1 World Grand Prix Champion]] [[Mark Hunt]] in the first round by submission at [[Dream 5|Dream 5: Lightweight Grand Prix 2008 Final Round]].\n\nHis next fight was against [[Mirko Cro Cop]] at [[Dream 6]] on 23 September 2008.<ref>[http://dreamofficial.com/fightcard/dream6/ DREAM.6 official card]. Dreamofficial.com.
