The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the {{lang|it|[[Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali]]}} (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].  With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Italian East Africa===\n\n{{main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the formation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), from Ethiopia after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. (The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during the Second World War but the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].){{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to invasion but {{lang|it|Comando Supremo}} (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of [[Africa]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===={{lang|it|Regio Esercito}}====\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa.png|thumb|{{centre|The AOI in 1936.

About 70 per cent of Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=166}} (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali [[Dubats]] from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular {{lang|it|[[Bands (Italian Army irregulars)|bande]]}} were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with ''Shifta'', marauders who plundered and murdered at will.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nOnce Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company was formed from German residents of East Africa and stranded German sailors.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=263}} Italian forces in East Africa were equipped with about {{nowrap|3,313 heavy}} machine-guns, {{nowrap|5,313 machine-guns,}} 24 [[M11/39]] medium tanks, 39 [[L3/35]] tankettes, {{nowrap|126 armoured cars}} and {{nowrap|824 guns,}} twenty-four {{nowrap|20 mm}} anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one {{nowrap|81 mm mortars}} and {{nowrap|672,800 rifles.}}{{sfn|Marino|2009|p=31}} The Italians had little opportunity for reinforcement or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=14}} On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German [[merchant raider]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort.

Aircraft and engine maintenance was conducted at the main air bases and at the Caproni and Piaggio workshops, which could repair about fifteen seriously-damaged aircraft and engines each month, along with some moderately and lightly damaged aircraft and could also recycle scarce materials.{{sfn|Santoro|1957|p=146}} The Italians had reserves for 75 per cent of their front-line strength but lacked spare parts and many aircraft were cannibalised to keep others operational.{{sfn|Shores|1996|pp=7\u20138}} The quality of the units varied.

When the Mediterranean route was closed to Allied merchant ships in April 1940, the Italian naval bases in East Africa were well placed for attacks on convoys en route to Suez up the east coast of Africa and through the Red Sea. The finite resources in Italian East Africa were intended to last for a war of about six months' duration, the submarines denying the Red Sea route to the British.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=99}}\n\n===Mediterranean and Middle East===\n{{see also|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|l1=Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre}}\n[[File:Africa1940.png|thumb|{{centre|Africa in 1940}}]]\nThe British had based [[History of modern Egypt|forces in Egypt]] since 1882 but these were greatly reduced by the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936]]. A small British and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] force garrisoned the Suez Canal and the Red Sea route, which was vital to British communications with its Indian Ocean and Far Eastern territories. In mid-1939, General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]] was appointed [[General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] (GOC-in-C) of the new [[Middle East Command]], over the [[Mediterranean, Middle East and African theatres of World War II|Mediterranean and Middle East]] theatres.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June {{lang|fr|debacle}} in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\". [[Anthony Eden]], the [[Secretary of State for War]] communicated to Wavell that an Italian advance towards Khartoum should be destroyed. Wavell replied that the Italian attacks were not serious but went to Sudan and Kenya to see for himself and met the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] at Khartoum.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=67, 72\u201373}} Eden convened a conference in Khartoum at the end of October 1940, with Selassie, the South African General [[Jan Smuts]] (advisor to [[Winston Churchill]]), Wavell, Lieutenant-General [[William Platt]] and Lieutenant-General [[Alan Cunningham]]. A plan to attack Ethiopia, including Ethiopian irregular forces, was agreed.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=245}} In November 1940, the British gained an intelligence advantage when the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC & CS) at [[Bletchley Park]] broke the high grade cypher of the Italian army in East Africa. Later that month, the replacement cypher for the ''Regia Aeronautica'' was broken by the Combined Bureau, Middle East (CBME).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\nIn September 1940, Wavell ordered the commanders in Sudan and Kenya to make limited attacks once the rainy season ended. On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

Gaining control of Gojjam required the Italian garrisons to be isolated along the main road from Bahrdar Giorgis south of Lake Tana, to Dangila, Debra Markos and Addis Ababa to prevent them concentrating against the ''[[Patriots (Ethiopia)|Arbegnoch]]'' ([[Amharic]] for Patriots).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}}\n\nItalian reinforcements arrived in October and patrolled more frequently, just as dissensions among local potentates were reconciled by Sandford's diplomacy.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=403}} The Frontier Battalion of the Sudan Defence Force, set up in May 1940, was joined at Khartoum by the 2nd Ethiopian and 4th Eritrean battalions, raised from \u00e9migr\u00e9 volunteers in Kenya.

Major [[Orde Wingate]] was sent to Khartoum with an assistant to join the HQ of the SDF. On 20 November, Wingate was flown to Sakhala to meet Sandford; the RAF managed to bomb Dangila, drop propaganda leaflets and supply Mission 101, which raised Ethiopian morale, having suffered much from Italian air power since the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. Mission 101 managed to persuade the ''Arbegnoch'' north of Lake Tana to spring several ambushes on the Metemma\u2013Gondar road and the Italian garrison at [[Wolqayt|Wolkait]] was withdrawn in February 1941.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=404\u2013405}}\n\n==Northern front, 1940==\n\n{{main|Northern front, East Africa, 1940}}\n\n===British Somaliland 1940===\n{{Main article|Italian conquest of British Somaliland}}\n[[File:Somaliland Italian invasion.png|thumb|{{centre|Italian invasion of British Somaliland August 1940}}]]\nOn 3 August 1940, the Italians invaded with two colonial brigades, four cavalry squadrons, {{nowrap|24 [[Fiat M11/39|M11/39]] medium}} tanks and L3/35 tankettes, several armoured cars, {{nowrap|21 howitzer}} batteries, pack artillery and air support.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackenzie|1y=1951|1p=23|2a1=Playfair|2y=1959|2p=170}} The British had a garrison of two companies of the Sudan Defence Force, two motor machine-gun companies and a mounted infantry company.

After visiting from 8 to 13 January 1940, Wavell decided that Legentilhomme would command the military forces in both Somalilands should war with Italy come.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=75\u201376}} In June, an Italian force was assembled to capture the port city of [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]], the main military base.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=89}} After the [[fall of France]] in June, the neutralisation of [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonies allowed the Italians to concentrate on the more lightly defended British Somaliland.{{sfn|Mockler|1984|p=241}} On 23 July, Legentilhomme was ousted by the pro-Vichy naval officer [[Pierre Nouailhetas]] and left on 5 August for Aden, to join the [[Free French]]. In March 1941, the British enforcement of a strict contraband regime to prevent supplies being passed on to the Italians, lost its point after the conquest of the AOI. The British changed policy, with encouragement from the Free French, to \"rally French Somaliland to the Allied cause without bloodshed\". The Free French were to arrange a ''voluntary ralliement'' by propaganda ([[Operation Marie]]) and the British were to blockade the colony.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=322\u2013323}}\n\nWavell considered that if British pressure was applied, a rally would appear to have been coerced. Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiations with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn. On 2 January 1942, the Vichy government offered the use of the port and railway, subject to the lifting of the blockade but the British refused and ended the blockade unilaterally in March.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=323\u2013324}}\n\n==Northern front, 1941==\n===Operation Camilla===\n[[Operation Camilla]] was a deception concocted by Lieutenant-Colonel [[Dudley Clarke]], to deceive the Italians, making them believe that the British planned to re-conquer British Somaliland with the 4th and 5th Indian divisions, transferred from Egypt to [[Al Qadarif|Gedaref]] and Port Sudan. In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt. Bogus information was planted on the Japanese consul at Port Said and indiscreet wireless messages were transmitted. The operation began on 19 December 1940 and was to mature early in January 1941; the deception was a success. The plot backfired when the Italians began to evacuate British Somaliland instead of sending reinforcements. Troops were sent north into Eritrea, where the real attack was coming, instead of to the east. Part of the deception with misleading wireless transmissions, did convince the Italians that two Australian divisions were in Kenya, which did lead the Italians to reinforce the wrong area.{{sfn|Rankin|2009|pp=316\u2013317}}\n\n===Eritrea===\nIn November 1940, Gazelle Force operated from the [[Mareb River|Gash river]] delta against Italian advanced posts around Kassala on the Ethiopian plateau, where hill ranges from {{cvt|2000|\u2013|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} bound wide valleys and the rainfall makes the area malarial from July to October.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=172\u2013174}} On 11 December, Wavell ordered the 4th Indian Division to withdraw from Operation Compass in the Western Desert and move to Sudan.

British troops advancing from the south had captured Addis Ababa on 6 April. Wavell imposed a policy of avoiding big operations in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, that would impede the withdrawal of troops to Egypt. The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement. The main attack by the 5th Indian Division began on 4 May and made slow progress. On 10 May, the 1st South African Brigade arrived and completed the encirclement of the mountain. The Indian division attacked again on 13 May, with the South Africans attacking next day and forcing the Italians out of several defensive positions. Concerned about the care of his wounded and rumours of atrocities committed by the ''Arbegnoch'', Aosta offered to surrender, provided that the Italians were granted the [[honours of war]].

Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use.

Some three thousand Italian soldiers continued the guerrilla war until October 1943, as they were unaware of the agreement when Italy surrendered to the Allies.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|p=74}}\n\n====Post-war====\nIn January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. [[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s. In November 1949, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.{{sfn|Zolberg|Aguayo|Suhrke|1992|p=106}} British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the [[Somali Republic]].{{sfn|NEB|2002|p=835}}\n\n==Victoria Cross==\nThe following is a list of recipients of the Victoria Cross during this campaign:\n* [[Eric Charles Twelves Wilson]] (captain, Somaliland Camel Corps) \u2013 Received during the Italian invasion of British Somaliland.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n* [[Premindra Singh Bhagat]] (second lieutenant, Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners) \u2013 Received during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=401}}\n* [[Richhpal Ram]] (Subedar in 6th Rajputana Rifles) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=435}}\n* [[Nigel Leakey]] (sergeant in the 1/6 Battalion King's African Rifles and cousin of the paleoanthropologist [[Louis Leakey]]) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Southern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=308}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia]]\n* [[Italian Empire]]\n* [[Colonial heads of Italian East Africa]]\n* [[Military history of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Military production during World War II]]\n* [[Military history of Italy during World War II]]\n* [[North African campaign]]\n* [[Western Desert campaign]]\n* [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n* [[West Africa campaign (World War II)|West Africa campaign]]\n* [[Battle of Madagascar]]\n* [[German Motorized Company]]\n* [[MVSN Colonial Militia]]\n* [[South African Irish Regiment]]\n* [[81st (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[Royal Corps of Colonial Troops]]\n* [[Dubats]]\n* [[Zaptie]]\n* [[Armoured car regiment]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Barker|1971}}\n|first=A.

The Britsh [[Middle East Command]] with troops from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[British Raj|British India]], [[Uganda Protectorate]], [[British Kenya|Kenya]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[British West Africa|West Africa]], [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Nyasaland]] participated in the campaign. These were joined by the Allied {{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} of [[Belgian Congo]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Imperial Ethiopian]] [[Arbegnoch]] (resistance forces) and a small unit of [[Free French Forces|Free French]].\n\nItalian East Africa was defended by the {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command), with units from the {{lang|it|[[Royal Italian Army|Regio Esercito]]}} (Royal Army), {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (Royal Air Force) and {{lang|it|[[Regia Marina]]}} (Royal Navy). The Italian forces included about 250,000 soldiers of the {{lang|it|[[Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali]]}} (Royal Corps of Colonial Troops), led by Italian officers and [[Non-commissioned officer|NCOs]].  With Britain in control of the Suez Canal, the Italian forces were cut off from supplies and reinforcement once hostilities began.\n\nOn 13 June 1940 an Italian air raid took place on the base of [[No. 237 Squadron RAF|237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF]] at [[Wajir]] in [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]] and continued until Italian forces had been pushed back from Kenya and Sudan, through Somaliland, Eritrea and Ethiopia in 1940 and early 1941. The remnants of the Italian forces in the region surrendered after the [[Battle of Gondar]] in November 1941, except for small groups that fought a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]] against the British until the [[Armistice of Cassibile]] in September 1943, which ended the war between Italy and the Allies. The East African campaign was the first Allied strategic victory in the war; few Italian forces escaped the region to be used in other campaigns and the Italian defeat greatly eased the flow of supplies through the Red Sea to Egypt. Most of the Commonwealth forces were transferred to North Africa to participate in the [[Western Desert Campaign]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Italian East Africa===\n\n{{main article|Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Order of Battle, East African Campaign (World War II)}}\n\nOn 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], proclaimed the formation of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', AOI), from Ethiopia after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] and the colonies of [[Italian Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=2}} On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and [[French Third Republic|France]], which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in the AOI a danger to the British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British sea lanes along the coast of East Africa, the [[Gulf of Aden]], the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]]. (The [[Kingdom of Egypt]] remained [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] during the Second World War but the terms of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]] allowed the British to occupy Egypt and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].){{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=6\u20137, 69}} Egypt, the Suez Canal, [[French Somaliland]] and [[British Somaliland]] were also vulnerable to invasion but {{lang|it|Comando Supremo}} (Italian General Staff) had planned for a war after 1942; in the summer of 1940 Italy was far from ready for a long war or for the occupation of large areas of [[Africa]].{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=38\u201340}}\n\n===={{lang|it|Regio Esercito}}====\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa.png|thumb|{{centre|The AOI in 1936.

On 1 June 1940, as the commander in chief of {{lang|it|Comando Forze Armate dell'Africa Orientale Italiana}} (Italian East African Armed Forces Command) and {{lang|it|Generale d'Armata Aerea}} (General of the Air Force), Aosta had about {{nowrap|290,476 local}} and metropolitan troops (including naval and air force personnel). By 1 August, mobilisation had increased the number to {{nowrap|371,053 troops.}}{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=93}} On 10 June, the Italian army was organised in four commands:\n* Northern Sector, vicinity of [[Asmara]]\n** Eritrea, Lieutenant-General [[Luigi Frusci]]\n* Southern Sector, around [[Jimma]]\n** Ethiopia, General [[Pietro Gazzera]]\n* Eastern Sector, General [[Guglielmo Nasi]] (borders of French and British Somaliland)\n* Giuba Sector, Lieutenant-General [[Carlo De Simone]], southern [[Somalia]] near [[Kismayo]], Italian Somaliland\n\n[[File:Italian East Africa (1938\u20131941).svg|thumb|{{centre|[[Italian East Africa]], May 1940, before the conquest of [[British Somaliland]]}}]]\nAosta had two metropolitan divisions, the [[40 Infantry Division Cacciatori d'Africa|40th Infantry Division \"Cacciatori d'Africa\"]] and the [[65 Infantry Division Granatieri di Savoia|65th Infantry Division \"Granatieri di Savoia\"]], a battalion of {{lang|it|[[Alpini]]}} (elite mountain troops), a {{lang|it|[[Bersaglieri]]}} battalion of motorised infantry, several [[Blackshirt]] {{lang|it|[[Milizia Coloniale]]}} battalions and smaller units. About 70 per cent of Italian troops were locally recruited [[Askari]]. The regular Eritrean battalions and the {{lang|it|Regio Corpo Truppe Coloniali}} (RCTC [[Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops]]) were among the best Italian units in the AOI and included Eritrean cavalry {{lang|it|Penne di Falco}} (Falcon Feathers).{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=166}} (On one occasion a squadron of horse charged British and Commonwealth troops, throwing small hand grenades from the saddle.) Most colonial troops were recruited, trained and equipped for colonial repression, although the Somali [[Dubats]] from the borderlands were useful light infantry and skirmishers. Irregular {{lang|it|[[Bands (Italian Army irregulars)|bande]]}} were hardy and mobile, knew the country and were effective scouts and saboteurs, although sometimes confused with ''Shifta'', marauders who plundered and murdered at will.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=55\u201356}}\n\nOnce Italy entered the war, a 100-strong company was formed from German residents of East Africa and stranded German sailors.{{sfn|Schreiber|Stegemann|Vogel|1995|p=263}} Italian forces in East Africa were equipped with about {{nowrap|3,313 heavy}} machine-guns, {{nowrap|5,313 machine-guns,}} 24 [[M11/39]] medium tanks, 39 [[L3/35]] tankettes, {{nowrap|126 armoured cars}} and {{nowrap|824 guns,}} twenty-four {{nowrap|20 mm}} anti-aircraft guns, seventy-one {{nowrap|81 mm mortars}} and {{nowrap|672,800 rifles.}}{{sfn|Marino|2009|p=31}} The Italians had little opportunity for reinforcement or supply, leading to severe shortages, especially of ammunition.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=14}} On occasion, foreign merchant vessels captured by German [[merchant raider]]s in the [[Indian Ocean]] were brought to Somali ports but their cargoes were not always of much use to the Italian war effort. On 22 November 1940 the Yugoslav steamer ''Durmitor'', captured by the German auxiliary cruiser ''[[German auxiliary cruiser Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', put in at [[Warsheikh]] with a cargo of salt and several hundred prisoners.{{sfn|Mohr|Sellwood|2009|p=126}}\n\n===={{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}}====\n[[File:Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 flight in formation.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Savoia-Marchetti S.M.79 formation}}]]\nThe {{lang|it|Comando Aeronautica Africa Orientale Italiana}} (CAAOI) of the {{lang|it|[[Regia Aeronautica]]}} (General Pietro Pinna) based in Addis Ababa, had three sector commands corresponding to the land fronts,\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Nord}} (Air Sector Headquarters North)\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Est}} (Air Sector Headquarters West)\n* {{lang|it|Comando Settore Aeronautico Sud}} (Air Sector Headquarters South)\nIn June 1940, there were {{nowrap|323 aircraft}} in the AOI, in {{nowrap|23 bomber}} squadrons with {{nowrap|138 aircraft,}} comprising {{nowrap|14 squadrons}} with six aircraft each, six [[Caproni Ca.133]] light bomber squadrons, seven [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.81]] squadrons and two squadrons of [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79]]s.

In July 1939, Wavell devised a strategy to defend and then dominate the Mediterranean as a base to attack Germany, through eastern and south-east Europe. The conquest of Italian East Africa came second only to the defence of Egypt and the Suez Canal and in August Wavell ordered plans to be made quickly to gain control of the Red Sea. Wavell specified a concept of offensive operations from Djibouti to Harar and then Addis Ababa or Kassala to Asmara then Massawa, preferably on both lines simultaneously. Wavell reconnoitred East Africa in January 1940 and the theatre was formally added to his responsibilities; he expected that the Somalilands could be defended with minor reinforcement. If Italy joined the war Ethiopia would be invaded as soon as there were sufficient troops; Wavell also co-ordinated plans with South Africa in March. On 1 May 1940, Wavell ordered British Troops Egypt to discreetly mobilise for military operations in western Egypt but after the June {{lang|fr|debacle}} in France, Wavell had to follow a defensive strategy.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=169\u2013170, 67}}\n\nAfter Italian operations in Sudan at Kassala and Gallabat in June, Churchill blamed Wavell for a \"static policy\".

On the northern front, Platt was to attack Gallabat and vicinity and on the southern front, Cunningham was to advance northwards from Kenya, through Italian Somaliland into Ethiopia. At the start of November 1940, Cunningham had taken over the East African Force from Major-General D. P. Dickinson, who was in poor health. While Platt advanced from the north and Cunningham from the south, Wavell planned for a third force to be landed in British Somaliland by amphibious assault to re-take the colony, prior to advancing into Ethiopia; the three forces were to rendezvous at Addis Ababa. The conquest of the AOI would remove the land threat to supplies and reinforcements coming from Australia, New Zealand, India, South Africa and British East Africa via the Suez Canal for the [[Western Desert campaign]] and re-open the land route from [[Cape Town]] to Cairo.{{sfn|Raugh|1993|pp=168\u2013173}}\n\n====East Africa Force====\n[[File:Africa (Eastern region).png|thumb|{{centre|General definition of East Africa (2005)}}]]\nIn 1940, [[East Africa Force]] (Major-General D.

This prompted General [[Ugo Cavallero]], the new Italian Chief of the General [[Staff (military)|Staff]] in Rome, to adopt a new strategy in East Africa. In December 1940, Cavallero thought that Italian forces in East Africa should abandon offensive actions against the Sudan and the Suez Canal and concentrate on the defence of the AOI.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=42}} In response to Cavallero and Aosta, who had requested permission to withdraw from the Sudanese frontier, ''Comando Supremo'' ordered Italian forces in East Africa to withdraw to better defensive positions.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=394}}\n\nFrusci was ordered to withdraw from Kassala and Metemma in the lowlands along the Sudan\u2013Eritrea border and hold the more easily defended mountain passes on the Kassala\u2013[[Agordat]] and Metemma\u2013Gondar roads. Frusci chose not to withdraw from the lowlands, because withdrawal would involve too great a loss of prestige and because Kassala was an important railway junction; holding it prevented the British from using the railway to carry supplies from Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast to the base at Gedaref.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1951|p=42}} Information on the Italian withdrawal was quickly decrypted by the British and Platt was able to begin his offensive into Eritrea on 18 January 1941, three weeks ahead of schedule.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===War in the air===\n[[File:Hurricane.r4118.arp.jpg|thumb|{{centre|A restored Hawker Hurricane Mk1 (r4118.arp)}}]]\nIn Sudan, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Air Headquarters Sudan]] (Headquarters 203 Group from 17 August, [[Air Headquarters East Africa]] from 19 October), subordinate to the AOC-in-C Middle East, had [[No. 14 Squadron RAF|14 Squadron]], [[No. 47 Squadron RAF|47 Squadron]] and [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|223 Squadron]] (Wellesley bombers).{{sfn|Richards|1974|pp=409, 415}} A flight of [[Vickers Vincent]] biplanes from 47 Squadron performed Army Co-operation duties and were later reinforced from Egypt by [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 squadron]] ([[Bristol Blenheim]]s).

The same aircraft then proceeded to machine-gun from low level the nearby positions of the Italian Blackshirts and colonial infantry. A few days later, the same aircraft bombed the Italian base at [[Keru]], fifty miles east of Kassala. The Commonwealth pilots had the satisfaction of seeing supply dumps, stores and transport enveloped in flame and smoke as they flew away.

The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free French interference. In October the blockade was reviewed but the beginning of the war with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn.

In December 1940, Clarke constructed a model operation for Italian military intelligence to discover and set up administration offices at Aden. Clarke arranged for the Italian defences around Berbera to be softened up by air and sea raids from Aden and distributed maps and pamphlets on the climate, geography and population of British Somaliland; \"Sibs\" (''sibilare'', hisses or whistles), were circulated among civilians in Egypt.

The division pushed up the Juba River in Italian Somaliland towards the Ethiopian border town of [[Dolo, Ethiopia|Dolo]]. After a pause, caused by the lack of equipment to sweep Mogadishu harbour of British magnetic mines dropped earlier, the 11th (African) Division began a fighting pursuit of the retreating Italian forces north from Mogadishu on 1 March. The division pursued the Italians towards the Ogaden Plateau. By 17 March, the 11th (African) Division completed a 17-day dash along the Italian ''Strada Imperiale'' (Imperial Road) from Mogadishu to [[Jijiga]] in the [[Somali region]] of Ethiopia.

Wavell imposed a policy of avoiding big operations in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia, that would impede the withdrawal of troops to Egypt. The remaining Italian troops were no threat to Sudan or Eritrea but could trouble the British hold on the AOI. The 1st South African Division was needed in Egypt and Cunningham was ordered to send it north to capture the main road to Massawa and Port Sudan so the ports could be used for embarkation. Amba Alagi obstructed the road north and the 5th Indian Division advanced from southwards as the South Africans moved northwards in a pincer movement. The main attack by the 5th Indian Division began on 4 May and made slow progress. On 10 May, the 1st South African Brigade arrived and completed the encirclement of the mountain.

At {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}} the Civil Governor was taken to ''Dido'' and surrendered Assab to the Senior Officer [[Red Sea Station|Red Sea Force]] (Rear-Admiral [[R. H. C. Halifax|Ronald Halifax]]) and the army commander, Brigadier [[Harry Kenneth Dimoline|Harry Dimoline]]. During the evening, Captain Bolla, the Senior Naval Officer at Assab, was captured. Bolla disclosed the positions of three minefields in the approaches to the harbour and told the British that the channel to the east, north of Ras Fatma, was clear. The 3/15th Punjabis took {{nowrap|547 prisoners}} in the operation along with the two generals and {{nowrap|35 Germans.}} On 13 June, the Indian trawler ''Parvati'' struck a magnetic mine near Assab and became the last naval casualty of the campaign.{{sfn|Collins|1964|pp=64\u201365, 58\u201359}}\n\n===Kulkaber (Culqualber)===\n{{main article|Battle of Culqualber|Siege of Sa\u00efo}}\n\n[[File:Force Publique leaving for Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|{{centre|{{lang|fr|[[Force Publique]]}} soldiers leaving the Congo to participate in the East African campaign}}]]\nA force under General [[Pietro Gazzera]], the Governor of Galla-Sidama and the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI was faced with a growing irregular force of ''Arbegnoch'' and many local units melted away. On 21 June 1941, Gazzera abandoned Jimma and about {{nowrap|15,000 men}} surrendered. On 3 July, the Italians were cut off by the [[Free Belgian forces]] (Major-General [[Auguste Gilliaert]]) who had defeated the Italians at [[Asosa]] and [[Dembidolo|Sa\u00efo]].{{sfn|Weller|2010|p=117}} On 6 July, Gazzera and {{nowrap|2,944 Italian,}} {{nowrap|1,535 African}} and {{nowrap|2,000 ''bande''}} formally surrendered; the 79th Colonial Battalion changed sides and was renamed the 79th Foot as did a company of banda as the Wollo Banda.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|pp=309\u2013314}}{{sfn|Stewart|2016|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nWolchefit Pass was a position whose control was needed to launch the final attack on Gondar, was defended by a garrison of about {{nowrap|4,000 men}} (Colonel Mario Gonella) in localities distributed in depth for about {{cvt|3|mi|km|abbr=on}}. The stronghold had been besieged by irregular Ethiopian forces, led by Major B. J. Ringrose, since May and on 5 May the Italians retreated from Amba Giorgis. The besieging force was later augmented by the arrival of the 3/14th Punjab Battalion from the Indian Army and part of the 12th African Division. Several attacks, counter-attacks and sorties were launched between May and August 1941. On 28 September 1941, after losing {{nowrap|950 casualties}} and running out of provisions, Gonella surrendered with {{nowrap|1,629 Italian}} and {{nowrap|1,450 Ethiopian}} soldiers to the 25th East African Brigade (Brigadier W.

After Gazzera surrendered, Nasi, the acting Governor of Amhara, became the new acting Viceroy and Governor-General of the AOI. At Gondar, Nasi faced the British and a growing number of Ethiopian Patriots but held out for almost seven months. While the ''Regia Aeronautica'' in East Africa had been worn down quickly by attrition, the Italian pilots fought on to the end.{{sfn|Mollo|McGregor|Turner|1981|p=91}} After the death of his commander Tenente Malavolti on 31 October, Sergente Giuseppe Mottet became the last Italian fighter pilot in the AOI and on 20 November, flew the last ''Regia Aeronautica'' sortie, a ground-attack operation in the last CR.42 (MM4033) against British artillery positions at Culqualber. Mottet fired one burst and killed Lieutenant-Colonel Ormsby, the CRA.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=319}} On landing, Mottet destroyed the CR.42, joined the Italian troops and fought on until the surrender.{{sfn|Gustavsson|2014|nopp=y}} On 27 November, Nasi surrendered with {{nowrap|10,000 Italian}} and {{nowrap|12,000 African}} troops, British losses being {{nowrap|32 men}} killed, {{nowrap|182 wounded,}} six men missing and {{nowrap|15 aircraft}} shot down since 7 April.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=321}} In 1949, Maravigna recorded Italian casualties of {{nowrap|4,000 killed}} and {{nowrap|8,400 sick}} and wounded.{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nIn 2016, A. Stewart wrote that due to the British defeats in Greece and Crete the East African campaign has been overshadowed, although it was the first victory for the Allies in the Second World War.{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=ix}} In 2004, the American historian [[Douglas Porch]] wrote that the \"pearl of the fascist regime\" had lasted only five years, the performance of the Italian army exceeded that in North Africa but there had still been a high ratio of prisoners to casualties. Mass defections by local forces suggested that Fascist imperialism had made little impression on the East African public. The Italian navy at Massawa had shown a \"stunning\" lack of energy and failed to challenge British access to Mombasa and Port Sudan or the landing at Berbera. The army had failed to exploit British supply difficulties and had left stores behind for the British to use. The British had withdrawn the 4th Indian Division and RAF squadrons for North Africa in February 1941, despite the Italian forces remaining at Amba Alagi, which from 20 April to 15 May, were steadily pressed back until they surrendered on 19 May.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}}\n\nEthiopia, the Somalilands and Eritrea had been conquered by the British and the end of organised Italian resistance, led to the East Africa Force and Air Headquarters East Africa being reduced by the transfer of the South African and the two Indian divisions to Egypt, along with three fighter, three bomber and a reconnaissance squadron, followed by two more in late May. The 11th and 12th (African) divisions remained, supported by six RAF and SAAF squadrons.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=449\u2013450}} The Italians at Galla-Sidom and Gondar were mopped up and the final surrender was taken by the Belgian contingent from Congo. Mussolini blamed the disaster on the \"deficiency of the Italian race\" but the Fascist regime survived and the British victory had little influence on Japanese strategy in the Far East.{{sfn|Porch|2005|pp=137\u2013138}} With the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden cleared of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] forces, Roosevelt declared that the areas were no longer combat zones on 11 April 1941. Ships of the United States were able to proceed to the Suez Canal, which helped to relieve the strain on British shipping resources.{{sfn|Dear|Foot|2005|p=247}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\nThe Italians had replaced their ciphers in the AOI in November 1940 but by the end of the month, the GC&CS in England and the Cipher Bureau Middle East (CBME) in Cairo had broken the new {{lang|it|Regio Esercito}} and {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} ciphers. By 1941, sufficient low-grade ciphers had been broken to reveal the Italian order of battle and the supply situation, by the time that the British offensive began on 19 January 1941. Italian dependence on wireless communication, using frequencies on which it was easy for the British to eavesdrop, led to a flood of information, from the daily report from the Viceroy, to the operational plans of the {{lang|it|Regia Aeronautica}} and {{lang|it|Regia Esercito}} on the retreat from Keren.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}} On occasion, British commanders had messages before the recipients and it was reported later by the Deputy Director Military Intelligence in Cairo, that\n\n{{quote|...he could not believe that any army commander in the field had [ever] been better served by his intelligence....|DDMI (ME){{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=64\u201365}}}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOn 16 April 1941, the authorities in the AOI signalled to Rome that {{nowrap|426 officers}} had been killed, {{nowrap|703 wounded}} and {{nowrap|315 captured,}} during military operations before the surrender. Casualties among NCOs and other ranks were {{nowrap|4,785 killed,}} {{nowrap|6,244 wounded}} and {{nowrap|15,871 captured}} (inclusive). Casualties among locally recruited soldiers were {{nowrap|11,755 dead,}} {{nowrap|18,151 wounded}} and {{nowrap|3,076 captured}} before the surrender; the {{lang|it|Truppi coloniale}} figures did not include forces on the Giuba and eastern fronts.{{sfn|Rovighi|1988|p=476}} By May 1941, of the {{circa|350,000}} men in the AOI available for military operations in June 1940, only the {{circa|80,000 men}} in the garrisons near Gondar and the seven colonial divisions in Galla-Sidamo remained to be taken prisoner.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|pp=423, 447}}{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=303}} More casualties among the Italian and colonial troops occurred after April 1941, in the operations against Amba Alagi (3,500 casualties), Kulkaber/Culqualber (1,003 killed and 804 wounded) and Gondar (4,000 killed and 8,400 sick and wounded).{{sfn|Stewart|2016|p=187}}{{sfn|Maravigna|1949|p=191}} In 1959, I. S. O. Playfair, the British official historian, recorded that from June 1940 to May 1941, the East African Force had {{nowrap|1,154 battle}} casualties and {{nowrap|74,550 sickness}} or accident cases, including {{nowrap|10,000 dysentery}} and {{nowrap|10,000 malaria}} cases of which {{nowrap|744 were}} fatal.

[[Amedeo Guillet]] was one of the Italian officers who fought with the Italian guerrillas in Ethiopia. Another notable guerrilla leader was [[Hamid Idris Awate]], a father of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]].{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}}\n\nOther Italian officers were Captain [[Francesco De Martini]] in Eritrea, Colonel Calderari in western Ethiopia/Somalia, Colonel Di Marco in Ogaden/British Somaliland \"blackshirt centurion\" De Varda in Somalia/Ethiopia and Major Lucchetti in Ethiopia. Civilians participated and in August 1942, forces led by Dr. [[Rosa Dainelli]] sabotaged the main British ammunition dump in Addis Ababa.{{sfn|Roselli|2007|p=58}} Hostilities in East Africa officially ceased on 9 September 1943, when the Italian government signed the [[Armistice with Italy]]. Some three thousand Italian soldiers continued the guerrilla war until October 1943, as they were unaware of the agreement when Italy surrendered to the Allies.{{sfn|Cernuschi|1994|p=74}}\n\n====Post-war====\nIn January 1942, with the final official surrender of the Italians, the British, under American pressure, signed an interim [[Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement]] with Selassie, acknowledging Ethiopian sovereignty. [[Makonnen Endelkachew]] was named as Prime Minister and on 19 December 1944, the final Anglo-Ethiopian Agreement was signed. Eritrea was placed under British military administration for the duration and in 1950, it became part of Ethiopia. After 1945, Britain controlled both Somalilands, as [[protectorate]]s. In November 1949, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland under close supervision, on condition that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.{{sfn|Zolberg|Aguayo|Suhrke|1992|p=106}} British Somaliland became independent on 26 June 1960 as the [[State of Somaliland]], the [[Trust Territory of Somalia]] (ex-Italian Somaliland) became independent on 1 July 1960 and the territories united as the [[Somali Republic]].{{sfn|NEB|2002|p=835}}\n\n==Victoria Cross==\nThe following is a list of recipients of the Victoria Cross during this campaign:\n* [[Eric Charles Twelves Wilson]] (captain, Somaliland Camel Corps) \u2013 Received during the Italian invasion of British Somaliland.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=177}}\n* [[Premindra Singh Bhagat]] (second lieutenant, Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners) \u2013 Received during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=401}}\n* [[Richhpal Ram]] (Subedar in 6th Rajputana Rifles) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Northern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|1959|p=435}}\n* [[Nigel Leakey]] (sergeant in the 1/6 Battalion King's African Rifles and cousin of the paleoanthropologist [[Louis Leakey]]) \u2013 Received posthumously during fighting on the Southern Front.{{sfn|Playfair|2004|p=308}}\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia]]\n* [[Italian Empire]]\n* [[Colonial heads of Italian East Africa]]\n* [[Military history of Ethiopia]]\n* [[Military production during World War II]]\n* [[Military history of Italy during World War II]]\n* [[North African campaign]]\n* [[Western Desert campaign]]\n* [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]]\n* [[West Africa campaign (World War II)|West Africa campaign]]\n* [[Battle of Madagascar]]\n* [[German Motorized Company]]\n* [[MVSN Colonial Militia]]\n* [[South African Irish Regiment]]\n* [[81st (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[82nd (West Africa) Division]]\n* [[Royal Corps of Colonial Troops]]\n* [[Dubats]]\n* [[Zaptie]]\n* [[Armoured car regiment]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Barker|1971}}\n|first=A.
