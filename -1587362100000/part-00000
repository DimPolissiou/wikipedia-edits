She married [[Leland Stanford]] on September 30, 1850, and went to live with him in [[Port Washington, Wisconsin]], where he had practiced law since 1848.\n\nThe Stanfords lived in Port Washington until 1852 when his law library and other property were lost to fire; they then returned to Albany. Leland Stanford went to California to join his brothers in mercantile businesses related to the [[California Gold Rush]], while Jane remained in Albany with her family. He returned in 1855, and the following year they moved to [[San Francisco]], where he engaged in mercantile pursuits on a large scale. Stanford was a cofounder of the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], serving as its president from 1861 until his death in 1893.

The university opened in 1891. After Leland's death on June 21, 1893, Jane in effect took control of the university. The university suffered severe financial hardship because of Leland's death, and the trustees advocated a temporary closure of the university until tax and legal issues could be resolved, but she insisted it remain in operation. Until the estate left probate in 1898 she paid for the university  out of her personal resources (as the widow she was allowed $10,000/month while the estate was in probate and she also attempted to sell her personal jewels).<ref name=jane-stanford-bio/> As the remaining founder she wielded a great deal of legal control over the university until her death though she allowed the Board of Trustees greater authority after June 1, 1903.<ref name=jane-stanford-bio/>\n\nIt was at her direction that Stanford University gained an early focus on the arts.

The university suffered severe financial hardship because of Leland's death, and the trustees advocated a temporary closure of the university until tax and legal issues could be resolved, but she insisted it remain in operation.

At her high school graduation, Jennie gives her valedictorian speech at the ceremony while fellow band member, bass guitarist Daryle is accepting a marriage proposal from her high school sweetheart Frankie. Jennie and the band are planning to go to Florida to audition for a gig at a nightclub in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] for the summer. However, problems seem to plague their plans when, first Jennie's older brother (and caretaker) doesn't want to let Jennie go because he feels it will dissuade her from continuing her college plans; second, the band's keyboardist has unexpectedly left the band, and third, Mooch (the drummer) insulted a gang member who then in turn destroyed the band's van. Mooch tells the band that she borrowed another van from her friend but in fact, assisted by the help of guitarist Billy, she stole the gang member's personal van. \n\nAfter recruiting a male keyboard player Nicky, the band heads south to audition for the gig. Arriving at the nightclub after closing hours, the band fears they have missed their audition. Not wanting to have to return, the band finds the owner Martin Falcon's home address and decide to make him listen to them play. However, when they arrive at his beach house, they let themselves in and find Falcon is not home. They do find Hamlet, Falcon's pet Doberman Pincher dog, who, after Billy sings him a song, becomes fast friends with the band. Falcon arrives, drunk and assumes the band are thieves. Explaining who they are, Jennie pleads with Falcon to listen to their music, but Falcon informs them that they are in fact a day early, the auditions for the gig isn't until the next night. Having very little money and no place to stay, Falcon offers them the room that the winners are supposed to be staying at for the summer. The \"room\" turns out to be a tool shack with room enough for 5 beds. The next night, the band auditions and the overwhelming applauding crowd response convinces Falcon to hire the band for the summer.\n\nThe band members stick out like a sore thumb in the preppy beach side area they temporarily reside in, especially Mooch, who refuses to take off her black leather jacket, although the weather is hot. Daryle (who has broken up with Frankie) started dating a local rich boy and tried to get the band invited to his parties. Billy, outside her comfort zone, started taking more pills than usual to cope with her depression. Jennie encouraged Mooch to spend time with Nicky, who seemed to have a crush on her and Jennie began a romantic relationship with the older Falcon. Falcon tells Jennie he has a music agent friend who books bands for gigs all over Europe, and is going to be coming to the club to watch the band perform. Falcon, after learning from Jennie that she is considering moving in with him, breaks up with Jennie because he doesn't want her to give up any opportunities because of him. Billy nearly overdoses and Frankie causes a small riot when he goes to the club and sees Daryle on stage being ogled by the local guys.\n\nOn the night the music agent goes to the club, Jennie runs out just after performing a song written by Falcon especially for the band and the street gang finally catches up with Mooch for stealing their van. The band all help out Mooch as she fights off the leader and finally Hamlet the dog chases the gang from the club, who are then arrested. When asked about what the music agent said, Jennie implies that the agent loved their music but she turned down his offer for the band to play in European clubs. Upset with Jennie that she would turn down such a huge opportunity, Nicky explains to the rest of the band that the music agent did not want the band, he only wanted Jennie to stand in front of studio musicians. But Jennie decides that it wouldn't have been any fun without them. Jennie says goodbye to Falcon and the band heads home with Hamlet now a part of the band.\n\n==Main cast==\n*[[Justine Bateman]] as Jennie Lee\n*[[Liam Neeson]] as Martin Falcon\n*[[Trini Alvarado]] as Mooch\n*[[Scott Coffey]] as Nickie\n*[[Britta Phillips]] as Billy\n*[[Julia Roberts]] as Daryle\n*[[Debbie Harry]] as Tina\n* Chris Nash as Frankie\n*[[Michael DeLorenzo]] as Bunny Slotz\n*[[Tom O'Brien (actor)|Tom O'Brien]] as Hubba\n*[[Steve Cropper]] as Sal\n==Production==\nThe film was a theatrical film made by NBC Productions, an offshoot of the NBC network, then under [[Brandon Tartikoff]].

Bernard has four daughters, Deidre, Monica, Julie, and Peggy de Gastyne. \n\n==Biography==\nSerge de Gastyne (1930\u20131992) was born in Paris, France. Early in his teens, de Gastyne fought in the French Underground. He emigrated to the United States in 1947 where his dazzling piano-playing soon won him scholarship grants at the University of Portland and the Eastman School of Music. Between studies he sold encyclopedias, and earned enough to finance a cross-country trip by bus.\n\nIn 1952 he enlisted in the Air Force, which decided that it wanted him at the keyboard of a piano, not at the controls of a plane. He was assigned to the Composing and Arranging staff of the [[Air Force Band]] in Washington DC.\n\nAt [[Sampson Air Force Base]] near Rochester, New York (Major General Richard Lindsay commanding), he set out to compose a huge musical \"panorama\" celebrating the 50th anniversary of powered flight.<ref>'''Air Force Wonder''',http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,891687,00.html / '''Time Magazine''' article, Monday, January 30, 1956</ref>\n\nHis musical compositions include symphonies, operas, and many pieces for band, voice and organ. He won awards for his compositions from the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP).\n\nIn 1968 he became a citizen of the United States. After studies at Eastman, he received a Masters and a Doctorate in music from the University of Maryland.\n\nHe taught music at [[Northern Virginia Community College]] while serving in the Air Force. After retirement, he moved to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]], where he lived for three years before his death on July 24, 1992.<ref>'''Coda''',https://books.google.com/books?id=hBMKAQAAMAAJ&q=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&dq=Coda+air+force+gastyne+retired&hl=en&ei=Wk7RTai6Lqrk0gGw-oigDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CF8Q6AEwAA / '''Coda''', the newsletter of the Retired Air Force Bandleaders and Superintendents Society, Sep\u2013Oct 1992</ref>\n\nSerge was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n==Career==\nFrom 1953\u20131972, Serge was composer-in-residence with the U.S. Air Force Band and Orchestra in Washington, D.C. Concurrently he taught at Northern Virginia Community College, retiring in 1981. Serge was the Artistic Director and Resident Composer for the New Music Orchestra (Capitol Hill).\n\nHe wrote well over 100 original compositions, ranging from Chamber and Orchestral pieces (six commissioned Symphonies, a '''''Tone Poem''''' premiered by Leopold Stokowski, etc.), to many vocal works in different languages, compositions for band, ''chef d'oeuvre'' for organ and many mallet percussion pieces. He  also wrote for unusual instrumental combinations of the above, for example, including a significant part for organ in his '''''Symphony No. 4 for Band''''', reading of poetry in his '''''Symphony No. 6''''', etc.\n\nSerge's '''''Four Musical Moments ''''' and '''''Concerto for Trumpet''''' were premiered by Emerson Head and Roy Hamlin Johnson, both professors of music at the University of Maryland at College Park. Emerson Head also premiered his '''''Grand Duo Concertant''''' at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n\nHis symphony, '''''L'Ile Lumiere''''' (Island of Light) was commissioned by Thor Johnson, Director of the [[Cincinnati Symphony]], and performed by the orchestra in its 1956 season.<ref name=\"EndureInStrength\">\nhttp://www.endureinstrength.org/pages.asp?pageid=111854</ref>\n\nSerge was instrumental in the creation of the Music Department at the Bailey's Cross Roads campus of Northern Virginia Community College. He wrote seven symphonies as well as his '''''Eclogae''''' for soprano and orchestra.\n\nBecause of his professional position with the Air Force Symphony Orchestra in Washington, D.C. he is well known for his '''''American Weekend March''''', which was commissioned by the '''American Weekend''' magazine.  In addition, he also completed or collaborated on countless arrangements during his time in the Air Force.<ref name=\"International1956\">{{cite book|author=Rotary International|title=The Rotarian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA59|accessdate=May 16, 2011|date=December 1956|publisher=Rotary International|pages=59\u2013|issn=0035-838X}}</ref><ref name=\"SmithStoutamire1979\">{{cite book|author1=Norman E.

Serge exuded a generosity of spirit and ruthlessness in equal measure. He was open to share basic aesthetic tenets. In particular, '''''Cantique de Joie''''' displays a spiritual connection. He seems to have a foot in the next world \u2013 a creative colossus at the peak of his powers with a particular [[Catholic]] spirituality translated into a religious idiom.\n\n'''''Cantique de Joie''''', Opus 70, was dedicated to Peter Basch and performed by him at [[Notre Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, on the V/153 Cavaill\u00e9-Coll (modified) in 1973. He wrote of his experience playing there: \"The most exciting part for me was the entrance of the pedal triplets mid-way, like a pile driver pumping its way forward, a determined thrust and support to the upperwork that was crashing/exploding, aided by the dissonant chords cutting through the texture with a volcanic bombardment to the victorious final spread.

The Grauman Chinese Theater, the Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Athletic Club are all nearby and date from the same period. 1441 North McCadden was originally the home of the Hollywood Knights of Columbus, a fraternal organization affiliated with the Catholic church. The Knights were foreclosed during the depression of the 1930s. \n\nThe next owner was Radio Recorders, which converted the ground floor billiards room and half the lounge into a (then) state of the art recording studio. In turn it housed the Blue Network and other entertainment related companies. In the mid 1960s the building was leased by TTG and they converted the second story main hall into a mega studio that could accommodate up to 100 musicians. TTG was notable as the first to be equipped with a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder, devised by co-owner Hidley,  at a time when 4 or 8-track recording was still the norm.<ref name=\"McDermott\">{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=John|title=Jimi Hendrix: Sessions|year=1995|publisher=Little, Brown & Co.|isbn=0-316-55549-5|page=71}}</ref> \n\nMeticulously and innovatively built by partner Hidley, with a high decibel level threshold, their studio became popular with the up-and-coming rock musicians of that time, including [[The Monkees]], [[Eric Burdon]],<ref name=\"bb5-10\" /> [[Frank Zappa]] with [[The Mothers of Invention]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/master/view/36721 |title=Mothers Of Invention, The* \u2013 Absolutely Free |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=[[Discogs]] |publisher= |accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref> and [[Alice Cooper]].<ref name=\"Zimmerman\">{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Alice|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Kent|title=Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock 'n' Roller's Life and 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1I-lN2IAo_wC&pg=PA100&dq=%22two+terrible+guys%22&hl=en&ei=Nx4pTNTVD4O88gactJCgAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22two%20terrible%20guys%22&f=false|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-38291-7|page=100}}</ref> Burdon introduced [[Jimi Hendrix]] to the studio and Hendrix \"raved\" about the studio's sound.<ref name=\"Roby\">{{cite book|last=Roby|first=Steve|title=Black Gold: the Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpfUzwASj0YC&pg=PA98&dq=%22two+terrible+guys%22&hl=en&ei=Nx4pTNTVD4O88gactJCgAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22two%20terrible%20guys%22&f=false|year=2002|publisher=Watson-Guptill|isbn=978-0-8230-7854-7|page=98}}</ref>\n\nTTG went out of business in 1985, and the owner sold the building to Yoram and Peggy Kahana, owners and directors of Shooting Star International, a photo agency. It took them three years to retrofit the cinder block structure, restore the main hall and third floor balcony to their original state, and adapt it to the needs of the agency that moved in December 1990. However the Kahanas kept the ground floor recording studio and upgraded it. It is now occupied by their tenant WAX LTD, the multi-platinum production and songwriting record label of Wally Gagel and Xandy Barry. Other tenants are Fame, a talent agency, and WICK Studios, a photo and video rental space.\n\n==Tom Hidley==\nTTG Studios' co-founder was Tom Hidley.

The Grauman Chinese Theater, the Roosevelt Hotel and the Hollywood Athletic Club are all nearby and date from the same period. 1441 North McCadden was originally the home of the Hollywood Knights of Columbus, a fraternal organization affiliated with the Catholic church. The Knights were foreclosed during the depression of the 1930s. \n\nThe next owner was Radio Recorders, which converted the ground floor billiards room and half the lounge into a (then) state of the art recording studio. In turn it housed the Blue Network and other entertainment related companies. In the mid 1960s the building was leased by TTG and they converted the second story main hall into a mega studio that could accommodate up to 100 musicians. TTG was notable as the first to be equipped with a [[multitrack recording|16-track]] tape recorder, devised by co-owner Hidley,  at a time when 4 or 8-track recording was still the norm.<ref name=\"McDermott\">{{cite book|last=McDermott|first=John|title=Jimi Hendrix: Sessions|year=1995|publisher=Little, Brown & Co.|isbn=0-316-55549-5|page=71}}</ref> \n\nMeticulously and innovatively built by partner Hidley, with a high decibel level threshold, their studio became popular with the up-and-coming rock musicians of that time, including [[The Monkees]], [[Eric Burdon]],<ref name=\"bb5-10\" /> [[Frank Zappa]] with [[The Mothers of Invention]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/master/view/36721 |title=Mothers Of Invention, The* \u2013 Absolutely Free |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=[[Discogs]] |publisher= |accessdate=12 April 2014}}</ref> and [[Alice Cooper]].<ref name=\"Zimmerman\">{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Alice|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Kent|title=Alice Cooper, Golf Monster: A Rock 'n' Roller's Life and 12 Steps to Becoming a Golf Addict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1I-lN2IAo_wC&pg=PA100&dq=%22two+terrible+guys%22&hl=en&ei=Nx4pTNTVD4O88gactJCgAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22two%20terrible%20guys%22&f=false|year=2008|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-307-38291-7|page=100}}</ref> Burdon introduced [[Jimi Hendrix]] to the studio and Hendrix \"raved\" about the studio's sound.<ref name=\"Roby\">{{cite book|last=Roby|first=Steve|title=Black Gold: the Lost Archives of Jimi Hendrix|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpfUzwASj0YC&pg=PA98&dq=%22two+terrible+guys%22&hl=en&ei=Nx4pTNTVD4O88gactJCgAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22two%20terrible%20guys%22&f=false|year=2002|publisher=Watson-Guptill|isbn=978-0-8230-7854-7|page=98}}</ref>\n\nTTG went out of business in 1985, and the owner sold the building to Yoram and Peggy Kahana, owners and directors of Shooting Star International, a photo agency. It took them three years to retrofit the cinder block structure, restore the main hall and third floor balcony to their original state, and adapt it to the needs of the agency that moved in December 1990. However the Kahanas kept the ground floor recording studio and upgraded it. It is now occupied by their tenant WAX LTD, the multi-platinum production and songwriting record label of Wally Gagel and Xandy Barry. Other tenants are Fame, a talent agency, and WICK Studios, a photo and video rental space.\n\n==Tom Hidley==\nTTG Studios' co-founder was Tom Hidley.
