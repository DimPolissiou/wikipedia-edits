Through the mediation of [[Sakamoto Ry\u014dma]] of [[Tosa Domain]] (present day [[K\u014dchi Prefecture]]), Satsuma military leaders [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] and [[\u014ckubo Toshimichi]] were brought together with [[Katsura Kogor\u014d]] of [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]]. Although the two domains were traditionally fierce enemies, their leaders agreed that the time was right for a change, and agreed in principle to assist one another in the event that either would be attacked by a third party.<ref>Gordon 2003, p. 57.</ref> Also, Ch\u014dsh\u016b desperately needed modern weapons, but had very limited contacts with the western powers. Satsuma, on the other hand, had developed a substantial arms trade with [[Great Britain]] via [[Thomas Blake Glover|Thomas Glover]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] merchant affiliated with [[Jardine Matheson]]. At the suggestion of Sakamoto, Saigo helped broker an agreement to supply Ch\u014dsh\u016b with the weapons it needed to fight the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>Ravina 2004, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDespite this assistance, there was still considerable distrust between the two domains. On March 1, 1866, the Shogunate demanded the retirement and confinement of Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' [[M\u014dri Takachika]] and the reduction of domain revenues by 100,000 ''[[koku]]''. This enraged the Ch\u014dsh\u016b leadership, and led to a formal, six-point agreement with Satsuma. The scope of the agreement was fairly limited. Satsuma agreed to assist Ch\u014dsh\u016b in obtaining a pardon from the [[Komei Tenno|Imperial Court]]. If this failed and the Shogunate attacked, Satsuma would send 2000 troops to [[Kyoto]]; however, Satsuma would engage the Shogunate in combat only if [[Kuwana Domain|Kuwana]], [[Aizu Domain|Aizu]] or Tokugawa Yoshinobu's personal guard attempted to block Satsuma's access to the Emperor.<ref>Ravina 2004, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref>\n\nThe Alliance was crucial in enabling Ch\u014dsh\u016b to withstand a [[Second Ch\u014dsh\u016b expedition|punitive expedition]] mounted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the summer of 1866, which led to a stunning defeat for the Tokugawa armies. During the subsequent [[Boshin War]] of 1867\u20131868, the imperial armies which finally overthrew the Shogunate were primarily [[samurai]] from the Satch\u014d alliance. With the establishment of the [[Meiji Restoration]], men from these two domains dominated the new [[Meiji government]] into the 20th century.<ref>Jansen 2000, p. 396.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Andrew Gordon (historian)|Gordon, Andrew]].

Although the two domains were traditionally fierce enemies, their leaders agreed that the time was right for a change, and agreed in principle to assist one another in the event that either would be attacked by a third party.<ref>Gordon 2003, p. 57.</ref> Also, Ch\u014dsh\u016b desperately needed modern weapons, but had very limited contacts with the western powers. Satsuma, on the other hand, had developed a substantial arms trade with [[Great Britain]] via [[Thomas Blake Glover|Thomas Glover]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] merchant affiliated with [[Jardine Matheson]]. At the suggestion of Sakamoto, Saigo helped broker an agreement to supply Ch\u014dsh\u016b with the weapons it needed to fight the Tokugawa shogunate.<ref>Ravina 2004, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDespite this assistance, there was still considerable distrust between the two domains. On March 1, 1866, the Shogunate demanded the retirement and confinement of Ch\u014dsh\u016b ''[[daimy\u014d]]'' [[M\u014dri Takachika]] and the reduction of domain revenues by 100,000 ''[[koku]]''. This enraged the Ch\u014dsh\u016b leadership, and led to a formal, six-point agreement with Satsuma. The scope of the agreement was fairly limited. Satsuma agreed to assist Ch\u014dsh\u016b in obtaining a pardon from the [[Komei Tenno|Imperial Court]]. If this failed and the Shogunate attacked, Satsuma would send 2000 troops to [[Kyoto]]; however, Satsuma would engage the Shogunate in combat only if [[Kuwana Domain|Kuwana]], [[Aizu Domain|Aizu]] or Tokugawa Yoshinobu's personal guard attempted to block Satsuma's access to the Emperor.<ref>Ravina 2004, pp. 127\u2013128.</ref>\n\nThe Alliance was crucial in enabling Ch\u014dsh\u016b to withstand a [[Second Ch\u014dsh\u016b expedition|punitive expedition]] mounted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the summer of 1866, which led to a stunning defeat for the Tokugawa armies. During the subsequent [[Boshin War]] of 1867\u20131868, the imperial armies which finally overthrew the Shogunate were primarily [[samurai]] from the Satch\u014d alliance. With the establishment of the [[Meiji Restoration]], men from these two domains dominated the new [[Meiji government]] into the 20th century.<ref>Jansen 2000, p. 396.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Andrew Gordon (historian)|Gordon, Andrew]].

Van Ryn and Turner instantly dislike each other, and because of his views, Miranda is baffled when Nicholas asks the doctor to attend to his wife, who has a cold.

After their newborn son dies, the relationship between Miranda and her husband withers, and the bonds between Miranda and Dr. Turner strengthen. Miranda and Dr. Turner eventually discover that Nicholas poisoned his first wife, Johanna, with [[Nerium oleander|oleander]].

In addition to Patrick on vocals, the band featured brothers [[Dean DeLeo]] and [[Robert DeLeo]] on [[guitar]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] respectively, and [[Ray Luzier]], formerly of [[David Lee Roth]]'s band, on drums. The band released one [[Army of Anyone (album)|self-titled album]] in November 2006, which was well-received, but sold well short of the members' [[RIAA|multi-platinum]] selling releases of their other bands, even despite the success of their first single, \"[[Goodbye (Army of Anyone song)|Goodbye]]\", which peaked at number 3 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Songs]] chart. After releasing a second charting single, \"[[Father Figure (Army of Anyone song)|Father Figure]]\", and touring in support of the album, the band went into hiatus in mid-2007, with members returning to their respective bands, except Luzier, who joined [[Korn]]. Despite being relatively inactive since 2007, all members have stayed in contact, and have independently shown interest in working on a second album if the logistics and scheduling of their commitments to other bands ever aligned.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation (2002\u201304)===\nThe band's formation traces back to [[Richard Patrick]] and the DeLeo brothers taking breaks from their respective bands, [[Filter (band)|Filter]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]].

In a November 2011 interview, Patrick said of the future of the band: <blockquote>Those guys are amazing, it's basically this simple: Robert has a studio in his basement where he can totally do his old-fashioned kind of classic sound. They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it for a week or two and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like \"Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record\".

In addition to Patrick on vocals, the band featured brothers [[Dean DeLeo]] and [[Robert DeLeo]] on [[guitar]] and [[bass guitar|bass]] respectively, and [[Ray Luzier]], formerly of [[David Lee Roth]]'s band, on drums. The band released one [[Army of Anyone (album)|self-titled album]] in November 2006, which was well-received, but sold well short of the members' [[RIAA|multi-platinum]] selling releases of their other bands, even despite the success of their first single, \"[[Goodbye (Army of Anyone song)|Goodbye]]\", which peaked at number 3 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Songs]] chart. After releasing a second charting single, \"[[Father Figure (Army of Anyone song)|Father Figure]]\", and touring in support of the album, the band went into hiatus in mid-2007, with members returning to their respective bands, except Luzier, who joined [[Korn]]. Despite being relatively inactive since 2007, all members have stayed in contact, and have independently shown interest in working on a second album if the logistics and scheduling of their commitments to other bands ever aligned.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation (2002\u201304)===\nThe band's formation traces back to [[Richard Patrick]] and the DeLeo brothers taking breaks from their respective bands, [[Filter (band)|Filter]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]].
