In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82\u201385}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it.\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]]. Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism.\n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, defined \"sophisticated\" '''falsificationism'''\"<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> and contrasted it with weaker versions of falsificationism, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12\u201330}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine thesis#Example from Galilean astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory.\n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, a [[ceteris paribus]] clause must say that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path. Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that one relaxes the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\n\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section {{slink||Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability}}) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often one must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other. It is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" /> How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\" group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref name=\"splitlogicmethod\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref name=\"poppernoapriori\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that induction is actually never used in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, laws are conjectured, tested and the results are considered together with other aspects to decide which of these laws are applied in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the [[logical empiricism]] movement, which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]] and [[A.J. Ayer]] wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that \"where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned\" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}}{{sfn|Creath|2017}} In this logical positivism perspective, Popper's suggestion that we can only argue for the falsity of laws can be interpreted as if only falsifications, no confirmations, are possible in science. But, a criterion that accepts only laws that can be argued to be false is not useful. \n\nPopper explained that a demarcation criterion was still possible, but we have to use the ''logical'' possibility of \"falsifications\", not falsifications as such. He pointed out his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also.<ref name=\"OneThousandFoldAdler\" group=upper-alpha/> For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all. In the [[#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability|definition of falsifiability]], contradictions with observations are not used for actual falsifications, but for ''logical'' \"falsifications\" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different. \n\nOn the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\" group=upper-alpha/> The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc. When this distinction is applied to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\". Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/> He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications. Put differently, observations have two purposes in Popper's view. On the methodological side, observations can be used to show that a law is false, and we can speak of falsification and its problems. On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show any law false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and free from the problems of falsifications, these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated. He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}} The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements. They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.\n{{Annotated image\n| image = GuidoReni MichaelDefeatsSatan.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15\n| height = 198\n| annotations =\n| caption = Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though it is possible to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13\u201315, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\". He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:\n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section {{slink||Away from dogmatic falsificationism}}, an actual agreement is needed. This may require using a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples).\n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/> would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another,{{sfn|Kuhn|1996}} whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge, is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section {{slink||Away from naive falsificationism}}). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory. Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.{{sfn|Sokal|Bricmont|1998}} They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.

This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12\u201313}} and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12\u201313}} although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''.

In the [[philosophy of science]], it is the same, except that the observations used to show '''falsifiability''' (or '''refutability''') are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the philosopher of science [[Karl Popper]] in his book ''Logik der Forschung'' (1934, revised and translated into English in 1959 as ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''), as an attempt to solve both the [[problem of induction]] and the [[demarcation problem]]. He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82\u201385}}\n\nPopper opposed falsifiability to '''verifiability'''<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]-->. For example, in order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it.\n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, falsifiability has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]]. Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism.\n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, defined \"sophisticated '''falsificationism'''\"<!--boldface per [[WP:R#PLA]]--> and contrasted it with weaker versions of falsificationism, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12\u201330}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that it is unclear which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine thesis#Example from Galilean astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory.\n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, a [[ceteris paribus]] clause must say that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that it cannot be told if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path. Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | {{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=19}}: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that one relaxes the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\n\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section {{slink||Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability}}) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how scientific knowledge progresses. Very often one must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, it is not clear why one theory is chosen above the other. It is not clear why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism uses both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" /> How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\" group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref name=\"splitlogicmethod\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref name=\"poppernoapriori\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2020|small=y}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that induction is actually never used in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Instead, laws are conjectured, tested and the results are considered together with other aspects to decide which of these laws are applied in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the [[logical empiricism]] movement, which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]] and [[A.J. Ayer]] wanted to formalize the idea that, for a law to be scientific, it must be possible to argue on the basis of observations either in favor of its truth or its falsity. There was no consensus among these philosophers about how to achieve that, but the thought expressed by Mach's dictum that \"where neither confirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not concerned\" was accepted as a basic precept of critical reflection about science.{{sfn|Uebel|2019}}{{sfn|Creath|2017}} In this logical positivism perspective, Popper's suggestion that we can only argue for the falsity of laws can be interpreted as if only falsifications, no confirmations, are possible in science. But, a criterion that accepts only laws that can be argued to be false is not useful. \n\nPopper explained that a demarcation criterion was still possible, but we have to use the ''logical'' possibility of \"falsifications\", not falsifications as such. He pointed out his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also.<ref name=\"OneThousandFoldAdler\" group=upper-alpha/> For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if one finds an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true. A verification has no value in itself. But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, there is a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all. In the [[#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability|definition of falsifiability]], contradictions with observations are not used for actual falsifications, but for ''logical'' \"falsifications\" that show that the law makes risky predictions, which is completely different. \n\nOn the basic philosophical side of this issue, Popper argued that some philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless. In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\" group=upper-alpha/> The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which are used to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc. When this distinction is applied to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\". Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/> He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed in the context of actual falsifications. Put differently, observations have two purposes in Popper's view. On the methodological side, observations can be used to show that a law is false, and we can speak of falsification and its problems. On the logical side, observations, which are purely logical constructions, do not show any law false, but contradict a law to show its falsifiability. Unlike falsifications and free from the problems of falsifications, these contradictions establish the value of the law, which may eventually be corroborated. He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}} The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements. They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.\n{{Annotated image\n| image = GuidoReni MichaelDefeatsSatan.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15\n| height = 198\n| annotations =\n| caption = Even if it is accepted that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though it is possible to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because the position of the apple at different times can be measured. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though the absence of large wings can be observed, no technology (independent of the presence of wings<ref name=\"iftechnologyiswingsthentautology\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13\u201315, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\". He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:\n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if one can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section {{slink||Away from dogmatic falsificationism}}, an actual agreement is needed. This may require using a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples).\n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/> would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another,{{sfn|Kuhn|1996}} whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge, is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought, Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section {{slink||Away from naive falsificationism}}). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory. Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate.{{sfn|Feyerabend|1993}} For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.{{sfn|Sokal|Bricmont|1998}} They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism. Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.{{sfn|Miller|2000}}\n\n==Applications==\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982),{{sfn|McLean v. Arkansas|1982}} the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993){{sfn|Daubert|1993}} and other cases.

Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;\n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v.

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v.

Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered by [[William Rehnquist]] in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}. In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether a theory or technique is scientific knowledge that will assist the trier of fact will be whether it can be (and has been) tested.

Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs. This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12\u201313}} and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12\u201313}} although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''. Popper considered falsifiability a test of whether theories are scientific, not of whether propositions that they contain or support are true.\n\n===Mathematics===\n{{See also|Mathematical proof|Scientific method#Relationship with mathematics|Mathematics#Mathematics as science|Philosophy of mathematics#Popper's two senses of number statements}}\nLike all [[formal science]]s, mathematics is not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the [[Empiricism|empirical]] world, but rather, mathematics is occupied with the theoretical, abstract study of such topics as [[quantity]], [[structure]], [[space]] and [[Calculus|change]]. Methods of the mathematical sciences are, however, applied in constructing and testing scientific models dealing with observable [[reality]].

About Popper's view, Zahar wrote (see {{harvnb|Zahar|1983|p=169}}): \"To repeat: Popper offers a Darwinian account of the progress of knowledge.

It is located in the city of [[Rionegro]], {{convert|20|km}} south-east of [[Medell\u00edn]].\n\nIt is the most important airport in the [[Antioquia Department]], and in terms of infrastructure, it is the most important in western Colombia. It's also the main hub for low-cost airline [[Viva Colombia]]. It serves several international destinations, one of the busiest being the route to [[Miami International Airport]]. It also serves the most flown route within Colombia: Rionegro-Bogota, which is mainly operated by [[Avianca]], [[Viva Colombia]] and [[LATAM Colombia]]. In recent years, significant technology and infrastructure upgrades (like LCD screen signage) have been made, making it one of the most recognized airports in Colombia. It now has service to destinations in Europe and has added new destinations in South and Central America, and in the Caribbean.\n\nInternational destinations include the [[United States]], [[Panama]], [[El Salvador]], [[Venezuela]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Mexico]], [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Spain]]. The airport also serves domestic flights to most major Colombian cities such as Bogota, [[Cali]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], [[Santa Marta]] and [[San Andres Island]].\nFreight transport is also one of the strengths of the terminal, providing air transportation to most of the flower exports (and other products) from eastern Antioquia bound to South, Central and North America, and Europe.\n\nSince its inauguration in 1985 until 1990, the terminal had heavy passenger and cargo movement, in part because the [[Olaya Herrera Airport]], located in the center of Medell\u00edn, was closed during this time. When it reopened, traffic reduced. Since 1993, however, there has been a steady increase in traffic as well as an increase in the number of airlines flying into the airport, including [[American Airlines]], [[LATAM Colombia|LATAM]], [[TACA Airlines|TACA]], [[Aerogal]].\nAs for cargo airlines, [[Martinair]], [[Centurion Air Cargo]], [[ABSA Cargo Airline|ABSA]], and [[Florida West International Airways]] and national freight airlines such as [[Avianca Cargo]], [[LANCO]], [[AeroSucre]] have increased their flights to the terminal.

This is set to start next year{{when|date=August 2018}} according to the [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics]]. The airport is named after [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova]] (sometimes spelled \"C\u00f3rdoba\"), a Colombian army general who was a native of R\u00edonegro.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport is the second in Colombia in total passenger and cargo also in international and national after the [[El Dorado International Airport]] in Bogot\u00e1. The runway is also used by the nearby military base in the Air Force of Colombia located in Rionegro, named '''''Air Combat Command No. 5''''' ('''''CACOM 5'''''), where all types of military and national police aircraft arrive and depart.\n\nThe airport has air navigation aids such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[non-directional beacon|NDB]], and [[Instrument landing system|ILS]], which allow greater ease of operation for pilots making navigation and landings safer in bad weather.<ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/LI/Medellin_NDB_CO/ Medellin NDB]</ref><ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/MRN/Marinilla_VOR-DME_CO/ Marinilla VOR]</ref><ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/RNG/Rionegro_VOR-DME_CO/ Rionegro VOR]</ref>\n\nIn January 2006, an [[Airbus A380]] landed at the air terminal (first time on Colombian soil) to conduct technical tests of the engines.\n\nAntioquia's exports, mostly flowers and other products from the region, depart en route to international destinations from these terminals. The cargo operator Avianca Cargo has its main base at the airport, and operates flights to countries in South, Central and North America. Avianca Cargo has a ramp that can accommodate up to ten aircraft. All types of aircraft, including [[Boeing 747]], [[Douglas DC-10]], [[Boeing 767]] are among the most common arrivals at the terminal. In addition, the terminal is near the customs area and airline hangars.\n\nThe airport has three restaurants and a shopping area, where there are banks, ATM's, money exchange, and car rentals. [[Avianca]] also has a VIP room inside the facility serving domestic and international flights. There is also a VIP [[airport lounge]] \"The Lounge Medellin\"<ref>https://www.prioritypass.com/lounges/colombia/medellin-jm-cordova/mde1-the-lounge-medellin</ref> operated by Global Lounge Network.<ref>https://www.globalloungenetwork.com</ref> Outside the main building is a parking lot with a capacity for 250 cars and an area for motorcycles. Long term parking is also provided.\n\nIn 2016, the airport handled 7,376,160 passengers, and 6,892,104 in 2017.\n\n== History ==\nBetween 1930 and 1932, three wealthy families in the metropolitan area of Medell\u00edn began with the idea of providing the city with an airport, as they were part of the Colombian Air Navigation Company which sought to carry passengers and mail from the city of Medell\u00edn to Puerto Berrio, along the [[Magdalena River]] and ultimately connect the cities of Medell\u00edn and Bogot\u00e1. One of the most important was Gonzalo Mejia, who in a very colloquial manner determined what would be the only place where an airport could be built; this location was later confirmed by the Curtis Wright firm based in [[New York City]].\n\nAfter several obstacles, the city of Medell\u00edn finally approved the construction of an unpaved runway about 974 m long, which would later become Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport. Companies like Saco and Scadta from the cities of [[Barranquilla]] and Bogot\u00e1 soon began service. Then in the 70s the need for a larger airport for the province of Antioquia arose due to saturation and limitations of the Olaya Herrera Airport. Two sites were proposed for the new airport: one in the vicinity of the municipality of Barbosa northeast of the city, and another in the valley of San Nicolas in Rionegro, east of the city. The latter was selected and construction began.\n\nThe airport opened in 1985. During the same year, [[Avianca]] conducted test flights of its [[Boeing 747]], first on the original runway at Olaya Herrera Airport, and then at the new Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova. During this time the airport had significant movement of cargo and passengers, as the operations from the Olaya Herrera airport declined to almost zero (both airports today have traffic, but the Olaya Herrera airport only serves for domestic flights). Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova is now the main airport for cargo and international flights from Medell\u00edn.\n\n== Modernization ==\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova Airport anticipates that the modernization plan, which includes various infrastructure projects, will make this an airport terminal as attractive for tourists as for airlines.\n\nWithin the works, passengers will find security systems, flight information via digital displays, high-tech communication, passenger arrival lounges with shopping, improvement in health services, improvement in firefighting services, and improvement in baggage handling systems.\n\nThe objectives of the modernization and expansion plan are to ensure aviation safety and comfort of passengers and their companions, and to meet the requirements of [[ICAO]], [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|AEROCIVIL]] (the Colombian civil aviation authority) and [[IATA]].\n\nThe transformation of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport also seeks to contribute to the country's competitiveness through the creation of spaces that enable optimal connectivity with other cities in the world, the development of new areas that are attractive to airlines, the creation of zones that favor the encounter of citizens and compliance with new policies of quality for passengers to enjoy the best service at time of travel.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport. Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], all regular scheduled flights are currently suspended.\n\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[Aerom\u00e9xico]] | [[Mexico City International Airport|Mexico City]] (resumes May 1, 2020)<ref name=COVIDAMX>{{cite web|url=https://www.aeromexico.com/en-us/actions-covid19|title=Safety Precautions: COVID-19|website=Aerom\u00e9xico|date=April 2020|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n| [[Air Europa]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n| [[Albatros Airlines]] | [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport (Venezuela)|Caracas]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]]\n| [[Aruba Airlines]] | [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]]\n| [[Avianca]] | [[Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport|Barranquilla]], [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Cali]], [[Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport|Cartagena]], [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Los Garzones Airport|Monteria]], [[John F.

The runway is also used by the nearby military base in the Air Force of Colombia located in Rionegro, named '''''Air Combat Command No. 5''''' ('''''CACOM 5'''''), where all types of military and national police aircraft arrive and depart.\n\nThe airport has air navigation aids such as [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]], [[non-directional beacon|NDB]], and [[Instrument landing system|ILS]], which allow greater ease of operation for pilots making navigation and landings safer in bad weather.<ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/LI/Medellin_NDB_CO/ Medellin NDB]</ref><ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/MRN/Marinilla_VOR-DME_CO/ Marinilla VOR]</ref><ref>[http://ourairports.com/navaids/RNG/Rionegro_VOR-DME_CO/ Rionegro VOR]</ref>\n\nIn January 2006, an [[Airbus A380]] landed at the air terminal (first time on Colombian soil) to conduct technical tests of the engines.\n\nAntioquia's exports, mostly flowers and other products from the region, depart en route to international destinations from these terminals. The cargo operator Avianca Cargo has its main base at the airport, and operates flights to countries in South, Central and North America. Avianca Cargo has a ramp that can accommodate up to ten aircraft. All types of aircraft, including [[Boeing 747]], [[Douglas DC-10]], [[Boeing 767]] are among the most common arrivals at the terminal. In addition, the terminal is near the customs area and airline hangars.\n\nThe airport has three restaurants and a shopping area, where there are banks, ATM's, money exchange, and car rentals. [[Avianca]] also has a VIP room inside the facility serving domestic and international flights. There is also a VIP [[airport lounge]] \"The Lounge Medellin\"<ref>https://www.prioritypass.com/lounges/colombia/medellin-jm-cordova/mde1-the-lounge-medellin</ref> operated by Global Lounge Network.<ref>https://www.globalloungenetwork.com</ref> Outside the main building is a parking lot with a capacity for 250 cars and an area for motorcycles. Long term parking is also provided.\n\nIn 2016, the airport handled 7,376,160 passengers, and 6,892,104 in 2017.\n\n== History ==\nBetween 1930 and 1932, three wealthy families in the metropolitan area of Medell\u00edn began with the idea of providing the city with an airport, as they were part of the Colombian Air Navigation Company which sought to carry passengers and mail from the city of Medell\u00edn to Puerto Berrio, along the [[Magdalena River]] and ultimately connect the cities of Medell\u00edn and Bogot\u00e1. One of the most important was Gonzalo Mejia, who in a very colloquial manner determined what would be the only place where an airport could be built; this location was later confirmed by the Curtis Wright firm based in [[New York City]].\n\nAfter several obstacles, the city of Medell\u00edn finally approved the construction of an unpaved runway about 974 m long, which would later become Enrique Olaya Herrera Airport. Companies like Saco and Scadta from the cities of [[Barranquilla]] and Bogot\u00e1 soon began service. Then in the 70s the need for a larger airport for the province of Antioquia arose due to saturation and limitations of the Olaya Herrera Airport. Two sites were proposed for the new airport: one in the vicinity of the municipality of Barbosa northeast of the city, and another in the valley of San Nicolas in Rionegro, east of the city. The latter was selected and construction began.\n\nThe airport opened in 1985. During the same year, [[Avianca]] conducted test flights of its [[Boeing 747]], first on the original runway at Olaya Herrera Airport, and then at the new Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova. During this time the airport had significant movement of cargo and passengers, as the operations from the Olaya Herrera airport declined to almost zero (both airports today have traffic, but the Olaya Herrera airport only serves for domestic flights). Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova is now the main airport for cargo and international flights from Medell\u00edn.\n\n== Modernization ==\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova Airport anticipates that the modernization plan, which includes various infrastructure projects, will make this an airport terminal as attractive for tourists as for airlines.\n\nWithin the works, passengers will find security systems, flight information via digital displays, high-tech communication, passenger arrival lounges with shopping, improvement in health services, improvement in firefighting services, and improvement in baggage handling systems.\n\nThe objectives of the modernization and expansion plan are to ensure aviation safety and comfort of passengers and their companions, and to meet the requirements of [[ICAO]], [[Special Administrative Unit of Civil Aeronautics|AEROCIVIL]] (the Colombian civil aviation authority) and [[IATA]].\n\nThe transformation of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda C\u00f3rdova International Airport also seeks to contribute to the country's competitiveness through the creation of spaces that enable optimal connectivity with other cities in the world, the development of new areas that are attractive to airlines, the creation of zones that favor the encounter of citizens and compliance with new policies of quality for passengers to enjoy the best service at time of travel.\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n===Passenger===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights at the airport:\n\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[Aerom\u00e9xico]] | [[Mexico City International Airport|Mexico City]] (resumes June 1, 2020)<ref name=COVIDAMX>{{cite web|url=https://www.aeromexico.com/en-us/actions-covid19|title=Safety Precautions: COVID-19|website=Aerom\u00e9xico|date=April 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n| [[Air Europa]] | [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]]\n| [[Albatros Airlines]] | [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar International Airport (Venezuela)|Caracas]]\n| [[American Airlines]] | [[Miami International Airport|Miami]]\n| [[Aruba Airlines]] | [[Queen Beatrix International Airport|Aruba]]\n| [[Avianca]] | [[Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport|Barranquilla]], [[El Dorado International Airport|Bogot\u00e1]], [[Alfonso Bonilla Arag\u00f3n International Airport|Cali]], [[Rafael N\u00fa\u00f1ez International Airport|Cartagena]], [[Adolfo Su\u00e1rez Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport|Madrid]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], [[Los Garzones Airport|Monteria]], [[John F.
