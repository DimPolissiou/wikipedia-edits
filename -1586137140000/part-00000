{"title_page": "Bette Davis filmography", "text_new": "{{short description|Every movie Bette Davis was in.}}\n[[File:Bette Davis in Now Voyager trailer 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bette Davis]] in a shot from the trailer of ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), one of ten films for which she received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]]]\n\nThis is a complete '''filmography of [[Bette Davis]]'''. Davis began acting in films in 1931, initially as a contract player with [[Universal Studios]], where she made her film debut in ''[[Bad Sister (1931 film)|Bad Sister]]'' (1931). Davis was initially seen as unappealing by studio executives, and was assigned to a string of [[B-movies]] early in her career.\n\nDavis made a transition to [[Warner Brothers]] in 1932, and made her breakthrough performance in ''[[The Man Who Played God (1932 film)|The Man Who Played God]]'' (1932), opposite [[George Arliss]]. She continued in a succession of films, but did not gain further recognition until she agreed to star in [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]]'s adaptation of the [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) on a loan-out to [[RKO Radio Pictures|RKO]]. The role of Mildred Rogers had been rejected by several actresses, but Davis achieved critical acclaim for her performance. ''[[Dangerous (film)|Dangerous]]'' (1935) became the first time she won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\nIn 1936, convinced her career would be ruined by appearing in mediocre films, Davis walked out on her Warner Brothers contract, and decided to make films in [[England]]. Davis explained her viewpoint to a journalist, saying: \"I knew that, if I continued to appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for.\" She eventually settled her disagreements with Warner Brothers, and returned to the studio in 1937. During the time, she was one of the numerous actresses considered for the part of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in [[David O. Selznick]]'s film version of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but she was not tested. Warner Brothers cast her in ''[[Jezebel (1938 film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938) as a reward for being turned down by Selznick. It was a critical and box office success, and earned her another Best Actress Academy Award.\n\n[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bette Davis in the acclaimed melodrama ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941)]]\nDavis was at the peak of her career in the late 1930s and early-to-mid 1940s, at a time when she was one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood and turned down parts she found inferior. She received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (1939), and earned acclaim for her performances in ''[[The Old Maid (1939 film)|The Old Maid]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940). Davis earned acclaim for her portrayal of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), with [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Davis later appeared in the [[melodrama]] ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941), and in the [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942 film)|The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1942).\n\nOne of Davis' biggest successes at Warner Brothers was ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), which earned her another Academy Award nomination. Her later films for the studio, including ''[[Winter Meeting]]'' (1948) and ''[[Beyond the Forest]]'' (1949), failed at the box office.<ref>Spada, James (1993). More Than a Woman. Little, Brown, and Company. {{ISBN|0-316-90880-0}}.</ref> She turned down leading roles in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' and ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' - both films eventually went to [[Joan Crawford]]. As her popularity waned, Warner Brothers dropped her contract in 1949, and from thereafter on, she occupied a freelance career.\n\nDavis received a career revival in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950) for [[20th Century-Fox]]. She played an aging [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star, Margo Channing, who is manipulated by an obsessed fan. The film was one of the biggest hits of 1950, and she was again nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to [[Judy Holliday]]. Although Davis earned strong reviews for her performance in ''[[The Star (1952 film)|The Star]]'' (1952), her career waned throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\n[[File:Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane trailer.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bette Davis with [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]] \nBeginning in the 1960s, Davis received yet another revival in popularity. Although her appearance in ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961) was negatively received, she earned praise for her portrayal of the faded child star, Jane Hudson, in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), which garnered her a final nomination for an Academy Award. She retained a [[Cult following|cult status]] throughout the remainder of her career, and appeared in several other [[thriller film]]s, such as ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'' (1965). She also appeared on television later in her career.\n\nDavis agreed to star in the spoof film ''[[Wicked Stepmother]]'' (1989), although she felt the script was poor. The film was marked with production problems from the beginning, with Davis often quarreling with director [[Larry Cohen]], and she withdrew from the film shortly after production began. After 58 years of acting, it became her final film appearance.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n! Director\n! Studio \n!

Davis began acting in films in 1931, initially as a contract player with [[Universal Studios]], where she made her film debut in ''[[Bad Sister (1931 film)|Bad Sister]]'' (1931). Davis was initially seen as unappealing by studio executives, and was assigned to a string of [[B-movies]] early in her career.\n\nDavis made a transition to [[Warner Brothers]] in 1932, and made her breakthrough performance in ''[[The Man Who Played God (1932 film)|The Man Who Played God]]'' (1932), opposite [[George Arliss]]. She continued in a succession of films, but did not gain further recognition until she agreed to star in [[John Cromwell (director)|John Cromwell]]'s adaptation of the [[W. Somerset Maugham]]'s ''[[Of Human Bondage (1934 film)|Of Human Bondage]]'' (1934) on a loan-out to [[RKO Radio Pictures|RKO]]. The role of Mildred Rogers had been rejected by several actresses, but Davis achieved critical acclaim for her performance. ''[[Dangerous (film)|Dangerous]]'' (1935) became the first time she won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]].\n\nIn 1936, convinced her career would be ruined by appearing in mediocre films, Davis walked out on her Warner Brothers contract, and decided to make films in [[England]]. Davis explained her viewpoint to a journalist, saying: \"I knew that, if I continued to appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for.\" She eventually settled her disagreements with Warner Brothers, and returned to the studio in 1937. During the time, she was one of the numerous actresses considered for the part of [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in [[David O. Selznick]]'s film version of ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', but she was not tested. Warner Brothers cast her in ''[[Jezebel (1938 film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938) as a reward for being turned down by Selznick. It was a critical and box office success, and earned her another Best Actress Academy Award.\n\n[[File:Bette davis the little foxes.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Bette Davis in the acclaimed melodrama ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941)]]\nDavis was at the peak of her career in the late 1930s and early-to-mid 1940s, at a time when she was one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood and turned down parts she found inferior. She received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in ''[[Dark Victory]]'' (1939), and earned acclaim for her performances in ''[[The Old Maid (1939 film)|The Old Maid]]'' (1939) and ''[[The Letter (1940 film)|The Letter]]'' (1940). Davis earned acclaim for her portrayal of [[Elizabeth I of England]] in ''[[The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex]]'' (1939), with [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Davis later appeared in the [[melodrama]] ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' (1941), and in the [[comedy film]] ''[[The Man Who Came to Dinner (1942 film)|The Man Who Came to Dinner]]'' (1942).\n\nOne of Davis' biggest successes at Warner Brothers was ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), which earned her another Academy Award nomination. Her later films for the studio, including ''[[Winter Meeting]]'' (1948) and ''[[Beyond the Forest]]'' (1949), failed at the box office<ref>Spada, James (1993). More Than a Woman. Little, Brown, and Company. {{ISBN|0-316-90880-0}}.</ref>. She turned down leading roles in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' and ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' - both films eventually went to [[Joan Crawford]]. As her popularity waned, Warner Brothers dropped her contract in 1949, and from thereafter on, she occupied a freelance career.\n\nDavis received a career revival in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950) for [[20th Century-Fox]]. She played an aging [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star, Margo Channing, who is manipulated by an obsessed fan. The film was one of the biggest hits of 1950, and she was again nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to [[Judy Holliday]]. Although Davis earned strong reviews for her performance in ''[[The Star (1952 film)|The Star]]'' (1952), her career waned throughout the remainder of the decade.\n\n[[File:Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane trailer.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bette Davis with [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]] \nBeginning in the 1960s, Davis received yet another revival in popularity. Although her appearance in ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961) was negatively received, she earned praise for her portrayal of the faded child star, Jane Hudson, in ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), which garnered her a final nomination for an Academy Award. She retained a [[Cult following|cult status]] throughout the remainder of her career, and appeared in several other [[thriller film]]s, such as ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Nanny (1965 film)|The Nanny]]'' (1965). She also appeared on television later in her career.\n\nDavis agreed to star in the spoof film ''[[Wicked Stepmother]]'' (1989), although she felt the script was poor. The film was marked with production problems from the beginning, with Davis often quarreling with director [[Larry Cohen]], and she withdrew from the film shortly after production began. After 58 years of acting, it became her final film appearance.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n=== 1930s ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Year\n! Title\n! Role\n! Director\n! Studio \n!

The constant of proportionality of this relationship is the [[natural logarithm]] of the base {{mvar|b}}:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\frac{d}{dx} b^x = b^x \\log_e b.</math>}}\n\nFor {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1}} the real exponential function is a constant and the derivative is zero because <math>\\log_e b = 0,</math> for positive {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''b'' > 1}} the real exponential functions are monotonically increasing (as depicted for {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''e''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2}}), because the derivative is greater than zero for all arguments, and for {{math|''b'' < 1}} they are monotonically decreasing (as depicted for {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}), because the derivative is less than zero for all arguments.\n\nThe constant [[e (mathematical constant)|{{math|1=''e'' = 2.71828...}}]] is the unique base for which the constant of proportionality is 1, so that the function's derivative is itself:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x \\log_e e = e^x.</math>}}\n\nSince changing the base of the exponential function merely results in the appearance of an additional constant factor, it is computationally convenient to reduce the study of exponential functions in mathematical analysis to the study of this particular function, conventionally called the \"natural exponential function\",<ref name=\"Goldstein_2006\"/><ref name=\"Courant_1996\"/> or simply, \"the exponential function\" and denoted by\n\n{{block indent|<math>x\\mapsto e^x</math> or <math>x\\mapsto \\exp x.</math>}}\n\nWhile both notations are common, the former notation is generally used for simpler exponents, while the latter tends to be used when the exponent is a complicated expression.\n\nThe exponential function satisfies the fundamental multiplicative identity\n\n{{block indent|<math>e^{x+y} = e^x e^y,</math> for all <math>x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}.</math>}}\n\nThis identity extends to complex-valued exponents. It can be shown that every continuous, nonzero solution of the functional equation <math>f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)</math> is an exponential function, <math>f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R},\\ x\\mapsto b^x,</math> with <math>b>0.</math>  The fundamental multiplicative identity, along with the definition of the number {{mvar|e}} as {{math|''e''<sup>1</sup>}}, shows that <math>e^n=\\underbrace{ e\\times\\cdots\\times e }_{n\\text{ terms}}</math> for positive integers {{mvar|n}} and relates the exponential function to the elementary notion of exponentiation.\n\nThe argument of the exponential function can be any [[Real number|real]] or [[complex number]] or even an entirely different kind of [[mathematical object]] (for example, a matrix).\n\nIts ubiquitous occurrence in [[Pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] has led mathematician [[Walter Rudin|W. Rudin]] to opine that the exponential function is \"the most important function in mathematics\".<ref name=\"Rudin_1987\"/> In applied settings, exponential functions model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (that is, percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. This occurs widely in the natural and social sciences; thus, the exponential function also appears in a variety of contexts within [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[mathematical biology]], and [[economics]]. \n\nThe [[graph of a function|graph]] of <math>y=e^x</math> is upward-sloping, and increases faster as {{mvar|x}} increases. The graph always lies above the {{mvar|x}}-axis but can be arbitrarily close to it for negative {{mvar|x}}; thus, the {{mvar|x}}-axis is a horizontal [[asymptote]]. The [[slope]] of the [[tangent]] to the graph at each point is equal to its {{mvar|y}}-coordinate at that point, as implied by its derivative function (''see above''). Its [[inverse function]] is the [[natural logarithm]], denoted <math>\\log,</math><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Logx\"/> <math>\\ln,</math><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"lnx\"/> or <math>\\log_e;</math> because of this, some old texts<ref name=\"Durell_1911\"/> refer to the exponential function as the '''antilogarithm'''.\n{{E (mathematical constant)}}\n\n==Formal definition==\n{{main|Characterizations of the exponential function}}\n[[Image:Exp series.gif|right|thumb|The exponential function (in blue), and the sum of the first {{math|''n'' + 1}} terms of its power series (in red).]]\n\nThe real exponential function <math>\\exp:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> can be characterized in a variety of equivalent ways. Most commonly, it is defined by the following [[power series]]:<ref name=\"Rudin_1987\"/>\n\n:<math>\\exp x := \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\frac{x^4}{24} + \\cdots</math>\n\nSince the [[radius of convergence]] of this power series is infinite, this definition is, in fact, applicable to all complex numbers <math>z \\in \\mathbb{C}</math> (see [[Exponential function#Complex plane|below]] for the extension of <math>\\exp x</math> to the complex plane). The constant {{mvar|e}} can then be defined as <math display=\"inline\">e=\\exp 1=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty(1/k!).</math>\n\nThe term-by-term differentiation of this power series reveals that <math>(d/dx) (\\exp x) = \\exp x</math> for all real {{mvar|x}}, leading to another common characterization of <math>\\exp x</math> as the unique solution of the [[differential equation]]\n:<math>y'(x)=y(x),</math>\n\nsatisfying the initial condition <math>y(0)=1.</math>\n\nBased on this characterization, the [[chain rule]] shows that its inverse function, the [[natural logarithm]], satisfies <math>(d/dy) (\\log_e y) = 1/y</math> for <math>y>0,</math> or <math display=\"inline\">\\log_e y=\\int_1^y \\frac{1}{t}\\,dt.</math>  This relationship leads to a less common definition of the real exponential function <math>\\exp x</math> as the solution <math>y</math> to the equation\n: <math>x = \\int_1^y \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt.</math>\n\nBy way of the [[binomial theorem]] and the power series definition, the exponential function can also be defined as the following limit:<ref name=\"Maor\"/>\n\n: <math>\\exp x = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n.</math>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Animation of exponential function.gif|thumb|The red curve is the exponential function.  The black horizontal lines show where it crosses the green vertical lines.]]\nThe exponential function arises whenever a quantity [[exponential growth|grows]] or [[exponential decay|decays]] at a rate [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its current value.  One such situation is [[continuously compounded interest]], and in fact it was this observation that led [[Jacob Bernoulli]] in 1683<ref name=\"O'Connor_2001\"/> to the number\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}</math>\n\nnow known as {{math|''e''}}.  Later, in 1697, [[Johann Bernoulli]] studied the calculus of the exponential function.<ref name=\"O'Connor_2001\"/>\n\nIf a principal amount of 1 earns interest at an annual rate of {{math|''x''}} compounded monthly, then the interest earned each month is {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|12}}}} times the current value, so each month the total value is multiplied by {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|12}})}}, and the value at the end of the year is {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|12}})<sup>12</sup>}}.  If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|365}})<sup>365</sup>}}.  Letting the number of time intervals per year grow without bound leads to the [[limit of a function|limit]] definition of the exponential function,\n\n:<math>\\exp x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{n}</math>\n\nfirst given by [[Leonhard Euler]].<ref name=\"Maor\"/>\nThis is one of a number of [[characterizations of the exponential function]]; others involve [[series (mathematics)|series]] or [[differential equation]]s.\n\nFrom any of these definitions it can be shown that the exponential function obeys the basic [[exponentiation]] identity,\n:<math>\\exp(x + y) = \\exp x \\cdot \\exp y</math>\n\nwhich justifies the notation {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}.\n\nThe [[derivative]] (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, a function with a rate of change ''proportional'' to the function itself (rather than equal to it) is expressible in terms of the exponential function. This function property leads to [[exponential growth]] or [[exponential decay]].\n\nThe exponential function extends to an [[entire function]] on the [[complex plane]]. [[Euler's formula]] relates its values at purely imaginary arguments to [[trigonometric functions]].  The exponential function also has analogues for which the argument is a [[matrix exponential|matrix]], or even an element of a [[Banach algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Derivatives and differential equations==\n[[Image:Exp tangent.svg|thumb|250px|right |The derivative of the exponential function is equal to the value of the function. From any point {{math|''P''}} on the curve (blue), let a tangent line (red), and a vertical line (green) with height {{math|''h''}} be drawn, forming a right triangle with a base {{math|''b''}} on the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Since the slope of the red tangent line (the derivative) at {{math|''P''}} is equal to the ratio of the triangle's height to the triangle's base (rise over run), and the derivative is equal to the value of the function, {{math|''h''}} must be equal to the ratio of {{math|''h''}} to {{math|''b''}}. Therefore, the base ''b'' must always be&nbsp;1.]]\n\nThe importance of the exponential function in mathematics and the sciences stems mainly from its definition as the unique function which is equal to its derivative and is equal to 1 when {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. That is,\n: <math>\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad e^0=1.</math>\n\nFunctions of the form {{math|''ce''<sup>''x''</sup>}} for constant {{math|''c''}} are the only functions that are equal to their derivative (by the [[Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem]]). Other ways of saying the same thing include:\n* The slope of the graph at any point is the height of the function at that point.\n* The rate of increase of the function at {{math|''x''}} is equal to the value of the function at {{math|''x''}}.\n* The function solves the [[differential equation]] {{math|1=''y''\u2032 = ''y''}}.\n* {{math|exp}} is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of derivative as a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]].\n\nIf a variable's growth or decay rate is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its size\u2014as is the case in unlimited population growth (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]), continuously compounded [[interest]], or [[radioactive decay]]\u2014then the variable can be written as a constant times an exponential function of time.  Explicitly for any real constant {{math|''k''}}, a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} satisfies {{math|1=''f''\u2032 = ''kf''}} if and only if {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''ce''<sup>''kx''</sup>}} for some constant {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFurthermore, for any differentiable function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, we find, by the [[chain rule]]:\n\n: <math>\\frac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)} = f'(x)e^{f(x)}.</math>\n\n==Continued fractions for {{small|{{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}}}==\nA [[continued fraction]] for {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be obtained via [[Euler's continued fraction formula|an identity of Euler]]:\n\n:<math>  e^x = 1 + \\cfrac{x}{1 - \\cfrac{x}{x + 2 - \\cfrac{2x}{x + 3 - \\cfrac{3x}{x + 4 - \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nThe following [[generalized continued fraction]] for {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} converges more quickly:<ref name=\"Lorentzen_2008\"/>\n:<math>  e^z = 1 + \\cfrac{2z}{2 - z + \\cfrac{z^2}{6 + \\cfrac{z^2}{10 + \\cfrac{z^2}{14 + \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nor, by applying the substitution {{math|''z'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}:\n:<math>  e^\\frac{x}{y} = 1 + \\cfrac{2x}{2y - x + \\cfrac{x^2} {6y + \\cfrac{x^2} {10y + \\cfrac{x^2} {14y + \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nwith a special case for {{math|''z'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>  e^2 = 1 + \\cfrac{4}{0 + \\cfrac{2^2}{6 + \\cfrac{2^2}{10 + \\cfrac{2^2}{14 + \\ddots\\,}}}} = 7 + \\cfrac{2}{5 + \\cfrac{1}{7 + \\cfrac{1}{9 + \\cfrac{1}{11 + \\ddots\\,}}}}</math>\n\nThis formula also converges, though more slowly, for {{math|''z'' > 2}}. For example:\n\n:<math>  e^3 = 1 + \\cfrac{6}{-1 + \\cfrac{3^2}{6 + \\cfrac{3^2}{10 + \\cfrac{3^2}{14 + \\ddots\\,}}}} = 13 + \\cfrac{54}{7 + \\cfrac{9}{14 + \\cfrac{9}{18 + \\cfrac{9}{22 + \\ddots\\,}}}}</math>\n\n{{anchor|On the complex plane}}<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] -->\n\n==Complex plane==\n[[Image:Complex exp.jpg|thumb|right|Exponential function on the complex plane. The transition from dark to light colors shows that the magnitude of the exponential function is increasing to the right. The periodic horizontal bands indicate that the exponential function is [[periodic function|periodic]] in the [[imaginary part]] of its argument.]]\n\nAs in the [[real number|real]] case, the exponential function can be defined on the [[complex plane]] in several equivalent forms. The most common definition of the complex exponential function parallels the power series definition for real arguments, where the real variable is replaced by a complex one:\n\n:<math>\\exp z := \\sum_{k = 0}^\\infty\\frac{z^k}{k!} </math>\n\nTerm-wise multiplication of two copies of these power series in the [[Cauchy product|Cauchy]] sense, permitted by [[Cauchy product|Mertens' theorem]], shows that the defining multiplicative property of exponential functions continues to hold for all complex arguments:\n\n:<math>\\exp(w+z)=\\exp w\\exp z</math> for all <math>w,z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex exponential function in turn leads to the appropriate definitions extending the [[trigonometric functions]] to complex arguments.\n\nIn particular, when <math>z=it</math> (<math>t</math> real), the series definition yields the expansion\n\n:<math>\\exp(it) = \\left( 1-\\frac{t^2}{2!}+\\frac{t^4}{4!}-\\frac{t^6}{6!}+\\cdots \\right) + i\\left(t - \\frac{t^3}{3!} + \\frac{t^5}{5!} - \\frac{t^7}{7!}+\\cdots\\right).</math>\n\nIn this expansion, the rearrangement of the terms into real and imaginary parts is justified by the absolute convergence of the series.  The real and imaginary parts of the above expression in fact correspond to the series expansions of {{math|cos ''t''}} and {{math|sin ''t''}}, respectively. \n\nThis correspondence provides motivation for {{em|defining}} cosine and sine for all complex arguments in terms of <math>\\exp(\\pm iz)</math> and the equivalent power series:<ref name=\"Rudin_1976\"/>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\cos z &:= \\frac{\\exp(iz)+\\exp(-iz)}{2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^k \\frac{z^{2k}}{(2k)!} ,\\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n   \\sin z &:= \\frac{\\exp(iz)-\\exp(-iz)}{2i} =\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^k\\frac{z^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}\n \\end{align}</math>\nfor all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C}.</math>\n\nThe functions {{math|exp}}, {{math|cos}}, and {{math|sin}} so defined have infinite [[Radius of convergence|radii of convergence]] by the [[ratio test]] and are therefore [[Entire function|entire functions]] (''i.e.'', [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>).  The range of the exponential function is <math>\\mathbb{C}\\setminus \\{0\\}</math>, while the ranges of the complex sine and cosine functions are both <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> in its entirety, in accord with [[Picard theorem|Picard's theorem]], which asserts that the range of a nonconstant entire function is either all of <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> excluding one [[lacunary value]].\n\nThese definitions for the exponential and trigonometric functions lead trivially to [[Euler's formula]]:\n\n:<math>\\exp(iz)=\\cos z+i\\sin z</math> for all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>\n\nWe could alternatively define the complex exponential function based on this relationship.  If <math>z=x+iy</math>, where <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are both real, then we could define its exponential as\n\n:<math>\\exp z = \\exp(x+iy) :=  (\\exp x)(\\cos y + i \\sin y)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|exp}}, {{math|cos}}, and {{math|sin}} on the right-hand side of the definition sign are to be interpreted as functions of a real variable, previously defined by other means.<ref name=\"Apostol_1974\"/>\n\nFor <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R} </math>, the relationship <math>\\overline{\\exp(it)}=\\exp(-it)</math> holds, so that <math>|\\exp(it)|=1</math> for real <math>t</math> and <math>t\\mapsto\\exp(it)</math> maps the real line (mod <math>2\\pi</math>) to the unit circle.  Based on the relationship between <math>\\exp(it)</math> and the unit circle, it is easy to see that, restricted to real arguments, the definitions of sine and cosine given above coincide with their more elementary definitions based on geometric notions.\n\nThe complex exponential function is periodic with period <math>2\\pi i</math> and <math>\\exp(z+2\\pi i k)=\\exp z</math> holds for all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C},k\\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>. \n\nWhen its domain is extended from the real line to the complex plane, the exponential function retains the following properties:\n* <math>e^{z + w} = e^z e^w\\,</math>\n* <math>e^0 = 1\\,</math>\n* <math>e^z \\ne 0</math>\n* <math>\\tfrac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z</math>\n* <math>\\left(e^z\\right)^n = e^{nz}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}</math>\nfor all <math>w,z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nExtending the natural logarithm to complex arguments yields the [[complex logarithm]] {{math|log ''z''}}, which is a [[multivalued function]].\n\nWe can then define a more general exponentiation:\n: <math>z^w = e^{w \\log z}</math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''w''}}. This is also a multivalued function, even when {{math|''z''}} is real. This distinction is problematic, as the multivalued functions {{math|log ''z''}} and {{math|''z''<sup>''w''</sup>}} are easily confused with their single-valued equivalents when substituting a real number for {{math|''z''}}. The rule about multiplying exponents for the case of positive real numbers must be modified in a multivalued context:\n: {{math|(''e{{sup|z}}''){{su|p=''w''}} \u2260 ''e{{sup|zw}}''}}, but rather {{math|(''e{{sup|z}}''){{su|p=''w''}} {{=}} ''e''{{sup|(''z'' + 2\u03c0''in'')''w''}}}} multivalued over integers {{math|''n''}}\n\nSee [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]] for more about problems with combining powers.\n\nThe exponential function maps any [[line (mathematics)|line]] in the complex plane to a [[logarithmic spiral]] in the complex plane with the center at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Two special cases exist: when the original line is parallel to the real axis, the resulting spiral never closes in on itself; when the original line is parallel to the imaginary axis, the resulting spiral is a circle of some radius.\n\n<gallery caption=\"3D-Plots of Real Part, Imaginary Part, and Modulus of the exponential function\" class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\" heights=\"150px\">\n Image:ExponentialAbs_real_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} Re(''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>)}}\n Image:ExponentialAbs_image_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} Im(''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>)}}\n Image:ExponentialAbs_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} {{abs|''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>}}}}\n</gallery>\n\nConsidering the complex exponential function as a function involving four real variables:\n: <math>v+iw = \\exp(x+iy)</math>\nthe graph of the exponential function is a two-dimensional surface curving through four dimensions.\n\nStarting with a color-coded portion of the <math>xy</math> domain, the following are depictions of the graph as variously projected into two or three dimensions.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Graphs of the complex exponential function\" class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile: Complex exponential function graph domain xy dimensions.svg|Checker board key:<br> <math>x> 0:\\; \\text{green}</math><br> <math>x< 0:\\; \\text{red}</math><br><math> y> 0:\\; \\text{yellow}</math><br><math> y< 0:\\; \\text{blue}</math>\nFile: Complex exponential function graph range vw dimensions.svg|Projection onto the range complex plane (V/W).

In this setting, {{math|''e''<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} is invertible with inverse {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''x''</sup>}} for any {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''B''}}.  If {{math|''xy'' {{=}} ''yx''}}, then {{math|''e''<sup>''x'' + ''y''</sup> {{=}} ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>''e''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, but this identity can fail for noncommuting {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.\n\nSome alternative definitions lead to the same function.

In fact, since {{math|'''R'''}} is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group {{math|GL(''n'','''R''')}} of invertible {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices has as Lie algebra {{math|M(''n'','''R''')}}, the space of all {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.\n\nThe identity {{math|exp(''x'' + ''y'') {{=}} exp ''x'' exp ''y''}} can fail for Lie algebra elements {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} that do not commute; the [[Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula]] supplies the necessary correction terms.\n\n==Transcendency==\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is not in {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}} (i.e., is not the quotient of two polynomials with complex coefficients).\n\nFor {{math|''n''}} distinct complex numbers {{math|{''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}}, the set {{math|{''e''<sup>''a''<sub>1</sub>''z''</sup>, \u2026, ''e''<sup>''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''z''</sup>}}} is linearly independent over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is [[transcendental function|transcendental]] over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\n=={{anchor|exp|expm1}}Computation==\nWhen computing (an approximation of) the exponential function near the argument {{math|0}}, the result will be close to 1, and computing the value of the difference <math>\\exp x-1</math> with [[floating-point arithmetic]] may lead to the loss of (possibly all) [[significant figures]], producing a large calculation error, possibly even a meaningless result. \n\nFollowing a proposal by [[William Kahan]], it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called <code>expm1</code>, for computing  {{math|''e<sup>x</sup>'' \u2212 1}} directly, bypassing computation of {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}.

For real numbers {{mvar|c}} and {{mvar|d,}} a function of the form <math>f(x)=ab^{cx+d}</math> is also an exponential function, as it can be rewritten as \n:<math>ab^{cx+d}=\\left(ab^d\\right) \\left(b^c\\right)^x.</math>\n\nAs functions of a real variable, exponential functions are uniquely [[characterization (mathematics)|characterized]] by the fact that the growth rate of such a function (that is, its [[derivative]]) is [[Proportionality (mathematics)#Direct proportionality|directly proportional]] to the value of the function.  The constant of proportionality of this relationship is the [[natural logarithm]] of the base {{mvar|b}}:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\frac{d}{dx} b^x = b^x \\log_e b.</math>}}\n\nFor {{math|''b'' {{=}} 1}} the real exponential function is a constant and the derivative is zero because <math>\\log_e b = 0,</math> for positive {{mvar|a}} and {{math|''b'' > 1}} the real exponential functions are monotonically increasing (as depicted for {{math|''b'' {{=}} ''e''}} and {{math|''b'' {{=}} 2}}), because the derivative is greater than zero for all arguments, and for {{math|''b'' < 1}} they are monotonically decreasing (as depicted for {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}}}), because the derivative is less than zero for all arguments.\n\nThe constant [[e (mathematical constant)|{{math|1=''e'' = 2.71828...}}]] is the unique base for which the constant of proportionality is 1, so that the function's derivative is itself:\n\n{{block indent|<math>\\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x \\log_e e = e^x.</math>}}\n\nSince changing the base of the exponential function merely results in the appearance of an additional constant factor, it is computationally convenient to reduce the study of exponential functions in mathematical analysis to the study of this particular function, conventionally called the \"natural exponential function\",<ref name=\"Goldstein_2006\"/><ref name=\"Courant_1996\"/> or simply, \"the exponential function\" and denoted by\n\n{{block indent|<math>x\\mapsto e^x</math> or <math>x\\mapsto \\exp x.</math>}}\n\nWhile both notations are common, the former notation is generally used for simpler exponents, while the latter tends to be used when the exponent is a complicated expression.\n\nThe exponential function satisfies the fundamental multiplicative identity\n\n{{block indent|<math>e^{x+y} = e^x e^y,</math> for all <math>x,y\\in\\mathbb{R}.</math>}}\n\nThis identity extends to complex-valued exponents. It can be shown that every continuous, nonzero solution of the functional equation <math>f(x+y)=f(x)f(y)</math> is an exponential function, <math>f:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R},\\ x\\mapsto b^x,</math> with <math>b>0.</math>  The fundamental multiplicative identity, along with the definition of the number {{mvar|e}} as {{math|''e''<sup>1</sup>}}, shows that <math>e^n=\\underbrace{ e\\times\\cdots\\times e }_{n\\text{ terms}}</math> for positive integers {{mvar|n}} and relates the exponential function to the elementary notion of exponentiation.\n\nThe argument of the exponential function can be any [[Real number|real]] or [[complex number]] or even an entirely different kind of [[mathematical object]] (for example, a matrix).\n\nIts ubiquitous occurrence in [[Pure mathematics|pure]] and [[applied mathematics]] has led mathematician [[Walter Rudin|W. Rudin]] to opine that the exponential function is \"the most important function in mathematics\".<ref name=\"Rudin_1987\"/> In applied settings, exponential functions model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change (that is, percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. This occurs widely in the natural and social sciences; thus, the exponential function also appears in a variety of contexts within [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], [[mathematical biology]], and [[economics]]. \n\nThe [[graph of a function|graph]] of <math>y=e^x</math> is upward-sloping, and increases faster as {{mvar|x}} increases. The graph always lies above the {{mvar|x}}-axis but can be arbitrarily close to it for negative {{mvar|x}}; thus, the {{mvar|x}}-axis is a horizontal [[asymptote]]. The [[slope]] of the [[tangent]] to the graph at each point is equal to its {{mvar|y}}-coordinate at that point, as implied by its derivative function (''see above''). Its [[inverse function]] is the [[natural logarithm]], denoted <math>\\log,</math><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Logx\"/> <math>\\ln,</math><ref group=\"nb\" name=\"lnx\"/> or <math>\\log_e;</math> because of this, some old texts<ref name=\"Durell_1911\"/> refer to the exponential function as the '''antilogarithm'''.\n{{E (mathematical constant)}}\n\n==Formal definition==\n{{main|Characterizations of the exponential function}}\n[[Image:Exp series.gif|right|thumb|The exponential function (in blue), and the sum of the first {{math|''n'' + 1}} terms of its power series (in red).]]\n\nThe real exponential function <math>\\exp:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}</math> can be characterized in a variety of equivalent ways. Most commonly, it is defined by the following [[power series]]:<ref name=\"Rudin_1987\"/>\n\n:<math>\\exp x := \\sum_{k = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!} = 1 + x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\frac{x^4}{24} + \\cdots</math>\n\nSince the [[radius of convergence]] of this power series is infinite, this definition is, in fact, applicable to all complex numbers <math>z \\in \\mathbb{C}</math> (see [[Exponential function#Complex plane|below]] for the extension of <math>\\exp x</math> to the complex plane). The constant {{mvar|e}} can then be defined as <math display=\"inline\">e=\\exp 1=\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty(1/k!).</math>\n\nThe term-by-term differentiation of this power series reveals that <math>(d/dx) (\\exp x) = \\exp x</math> for all real {{mvar|x}}, leading to another common characterization of <math>\\exp x</math> as the unique solution of the [[differential equation]]\n:<math>y'(x)=y(x),</math>\n\nsatisfying the initial condition <math>y(0)=1.</math>\n\nBased on this characterization, the [[chain rule]] shows that its inverse function, the [[natural logarithm]], satisfies <math>(d/dy) (\\log_e y) = 1/y</math> for <math>y>0,</math> or <math display=\"inline\">\\log_e y=\\int_1^y \\frac{1}{t}\\,dt.</math>  This relationship leads to a less common definition of the real exponential function <math>\\exp x</math> as the solution <math>y</math> to the equation\n: <math>x = \\int_1^y \\frac{1}{t} \\, dt.</math>\n\nBy way of the [[binomial theorem]] and the power series definition, the exponential function can also be defined as the following limit:<ref name=\"Maor\"/>\n\n: <math>\\exp x = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n.</math>\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Animation of exponential function.gif|thumb|The red curve is the exponential function.  The black horizontal lines show where it crosses the green vertical lines.]]\nThe exponential function arises whenever a quantity [[exponential growth|grows]] or [[exponential decay|decays]] at a rate [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its current value.  One such situation is [[continuously compounded interest]], and in fact it was this observation that led [[Jacob Bernoulli]] in 1683<ref name=\"O'Connor_2001\"/> to the number\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n}\\right)^{n}</math>\n\nnow known as {{math|''e''}}.  Later, in 1697, [[Johann Bernoulli]] studied the calculus of the exponential function.<ref name=\"O'Connor_2001\"/>\n\nIf a principal amount of 1 earns interest at an annual rate of {{math|''x''}} compounded monthly, then the interest earned each month is {{math|{{sfrac|''x''|12}}}} times the current value, so each month the total value is multiplied by {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|12}})}}, and the value at the end of the year is {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|12}})<sup>12</sup>}}.  If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|365}})<sup>365</sup>}}.  Letting the number of time intervals per year grow without bound leads to the [[limit of a function|limit]] definition of the exponential function,\n\n:<math>\\exp x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n}\\right)^{n}</math>\n\nfirst given by [[Leonhard Euler]].<ref name=\"Maor\"/>\nThis is one of a number of [[characterizations of the exponential function]]; others involve [[series (mathematics)|series]] or [[differential equation]]s.\n\nFrom any of these definitions it can be shown that the exponential function obeys the basic [[exponentiation]] identity,\n:<math>\\exp(x + y) = \\exp x \\cdot \\exp y</math>\n\nwhich justifies the notation {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}.\n\nThe [[derivative]] (rate of change) of the exponential function is the exponential function itself. More generally, a function with a rate of change ''proportional'' to the function itself (rather than equal to it) is expressible in terms of the exponential function. This function property leads to [[exponential growth]] or [[exponential decay]].\n\nThe exponential function extends to an [[entire function]] on the [[complex plane]]. [[Euler's formula]] relates its values at purely imaginary arguments to [[trigonometric functions]].  The exponential function also has analogues for which the argument is a [[matrix exponential|matrix]], or even an element of a [[Banach algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Derivatives and differential equations==\n[[Image:Exp tangent.svg|thumb|250px|right |The derivative of the exponential function is equal to the value of the function. From any point {{math|''P''}} on the curve (blue), let a tangent line (red), and a vertical line (green) with height {{math|''h''}} be drawn, forming a right triangle with a base {{math|''b''}} on the {{math|''x''}}-axis. Since the slope of the red tangent line (the derivative) at {{math|''P''}} is equal to the ratio of the triangle's height to the triangle's base (rise over run), and the derivative is equal to the value of the function, {{math|''h''}} must be equal to the ratio of {{math|''h''}} to {{math|''b''}}. Therefore, the base ''b'' must always be&nbsp;1.]]\n\nThe importance of the exponential function in mathematics and the sciences stems mainly from its definition as the unique function which is equal to its derivative and is equal to 1 when {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}. That is,\n: <math>\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x \\quad\\text{and}\\quad e^0=1.</math>\n\nFunctions of the form {{math|''ce''<sup>''x''</sup>}} for constant {{math|''c''}} are the only functions that are equal to their derivative (by the [[Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem]]). Other ways of saying the same thing include:\n* The slope of the graph at any point is the height of the function at that point.\n* The rate of increase of the function at {{math|''x''}} is equal to the value of the function at {{math|''x''}}.\n* The function solves the [[differential equation]] {{math|1=''y''\u2032 = ''y''}}.\n* {{math|exp}} is a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of derivative as a [[Functional (mathematics)|functional]].\n\nIf a variable's growth or decay rate is [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to its size\u2014as is the case in unlimited population growth (see [[Malthusian catastrophe]]), continuously compounded [[interest]], or [[radioactive decay]]\u2014then the variable can be written as a constant times an exponential function of time.  Explicitly for any real constant {{math|''k''}}, a function {{math|''f'': '''R''' \u2192 '''R'''}} satisfies {{math|1=''f''\u2032 = ''kf''}} if and only if {{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''ce''<sup>''kx''</sup>}} for some constant {{math|''c''}}.\n\nFurthermore, for any differentiable function {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, we find, by the [[chain rule]]:\n\n: <math>\\frac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)} = f'(x)e^{f(x)}.</math>\n\n==Continued fractions for {{small|{{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}}}==\nA [[continued fraction]] for {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be obtained via [[Euler's continued fraction formula|an identity of Euler]]:\n\n:<math>  e^x = 1 + \\cfrac{x}{1 - \\cfrac{x}{x + 2 - \\cfrac{2x}{x + 3 - \\cfrac{3x}{x + 4 - \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nThe following [[generalized continued fraction]] for {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} converges more quickly:<ref name=\"Lorentzen_2008\"/>\n:<math>  e^z = 1 + \\cfrac{2z}{2 - z + \\cfrac{z^2}{6 + \\cfrac{z^2}{10 + \\cfrac{z^2}{14 + \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nor, by applying the substitution {{math|''z'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''|''y''}}}}:\n:<math>  e^\\frac{x}{y} = 1 + \\cfrac{2x}{2y - x + \\cfrac{x^2} {6y + \\cfrac{x^2} {10y + \\cfrac{x^2} {14y + \\ddots}}}}</math>\n\nwith a special case for {{math|''z'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>  e^2 = 1 + \\cfrac{4}{0 + \\cfrac{2^2}{6 + \\cfrac{2^2}{10 + \\cfrac{2^2}{14 + \\ddots\\,}}}} = 7 + \\cfrac{2}{5 + \\cfrac{1}{7 + \\cfrac{1}{9 + \\cfrac{1}{11 + \\ddots\\,}}}}</math>\n\nThis formula also converges, though more slowly, for {{math|''z'' > 2}}.

The periodic horizontal bands indicate that the exponential function is [[periodic function|periodic]] in the [[imaginary part]] of its argument.]]\n\nAs in the [[real number|real]] case, the exponential function can be defined on the [[complex plane]] in several equivalent forms. The most common definition of the complex exponential function parallels the power series definition for real arguments, where the real variable is replaced by a complex one:\n\n:<math>\\exp z := \\sum_{k = 0}^\\infty\\frac{z^k}{k!} </math>\n\nTerm-wise multiplication of two copies of these power series in the [[Cauchy product|Cauchy]] sense, permitted by [[Cauchy product|Mertens' theorem]], shows that the defining multiplicative property of exponential functions continues to hold for all complex arguments:\n\n:<math>\\exp(w+z)=\\exp w\\exp z</math> for all <math>w,z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>\n\nThe definition of the complex exponential function in turn leads to the appropriate definitions extending the [[trigonometric functions]] to complex arguments.\n\nIn particular, when <math>z=it</math> (<math>t</math> real), the series definition yields the expansion\n\n:<math>\\exp(it) = \\left( 1-\\frac{t^2}{2!}+\\frac{t^4}{4!}-\\frac{t^6}{6!}+\\cdots \\right) + i\\left(t - \\frac{t^3}{3!} + \\frac{t^5}{5!} - \\frac{t^7}{7!}+\\cdots\\right).</math>\n\nIn this expansion, the rearrangement of the terms into real and imaginary parts is justified by the absolute convergence of the series.  The real and imaginary parts of the above expression in fact correspond to the series expansions of {{math|cos ''t''}} and {{math|sin ''t''}}, respectively. \n\nThis correspondence provides motivation for {{em|defining}} cosine and sine for all complex arguments in terms of <math>\\exp(\\pm iz)</math> and the equivalent power series:<ref name=\"Rudin_1976\"/>\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n   \\cos z &:= \\frac{\\exp(iz)+\\exp(-iz)}{2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^k \\frac{z^{2k}}{(2k)!} ,\\quad \\text{and} \\\\\n   \\sin z &:= \\frac{\\exp(iz)-\\exp(-iz)}{2i} =\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}(-1)^k\\frac{z^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}\n \\end{align}</math>\nfor all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C}.</math>\n\nThe functions {{math|exp}}, {{math|cos}}, and {{math|sin}} so defined have infinite [[Radius of convergence|radii of convergence]] by the [[ratio test]] and are therefore [[Entire function|entire functions]] (''i.e.'', [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>).  The range of the exponential function is <math>\\mathbb{C}\\setminus \\{0\\}</math>, while the ranges of the complex sine and cosine functions are both <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> in its entirety, in accord with [[Picard theorem|Picard's theorem]], which asserts that the range of a nonconstant entire function is either all of <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> excluding one [[lacunary value]].\n\nThese definitions for the exponential and trigonometric functions lead trivially to [[Euler's formula]]:\n\n:<math>\\exp(iz)=\\cos z+i\\sin z</math> for all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>\n\nWe could alternatively define the complex exponential function based on this relationship.  If <math>z=x+iy</math>, where <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are both real, then we could define its exponential as\n\n:<math>\\exp z = \\exp(x+iy) :=  (\\exp x)(\\cos y + i \\sin y)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|exp}}, {{math|cos}}, and {{math|sin}} on the right-hand side of the definition sign are to be interpreted as functions of a real variable, previously defined by other means.<ref name=\"Apostol_1974\"/>\n\nFor <math>t\\in\\mathbb{R} </math>, the relationship <math>\\overline{\\exp(it)}=\\exp(-it)</math> holds, so that <math>|\\exp(it)|=1</math> for real <math>t</math> and <math>t\\mapsto\\exp(it)</math> maps the real line (mod <math>2\\pi</math>) to the unit circle.  Based on the relationship between <math>\\exp(it)</math> and the unit circle, it is easy to see that, restricted to real arguments, the definitions of sine and cosine given above coincide with their more elementary definitions based on geometric notions.\n\nThe complex exponential function is periodic with period <math>2\\pi i</math> and <math>\\exp(z+2\\pi i k)=\\exp z</math> holds for all <math>z\\in\\mathbb{C},k\\in\\mathbb{Z}</math>. \n\nWhen its domain is extended from the real line to the complex plane, the exponential function retains the following properties:\n* <math>e^{z + w} = e^z e^w\\,</math>\n* <math>e^0 = 1\\,</math>\n* <math>e^z \\ne 0</math>\n* <math>\\tfrac{d}{dz} e^z = e^z</math>\n* <math>\\left(e^z\\right)^n = e^{nz}, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}</math>\nfor all <math>w,z\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>.\n\nExtending the natural logarithm to complex arguments yields the [[complex logarithm]] {{math|log ''z''}}, which is a [[multivalued function]].\n\nWe can then define a more general exponentiation:\n: <math>z^w = e^{w \\log z}</math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{math|''z''}} and {{math|''w''}}. This is also a multivalued function, even when {{math|''z''}} is real. This distinction is problematic, as the multivalued functions {{math|log ''z''}} and {{math|''z''<sup>''w''</sup>}} are easily confused with their single-valued equivalents when substituting a real number for {{math|''z''}}. The rule about multiplying exponents for the case of positive real numbers must be modified in a multivalued context:\n: {{math|(''e{{sup|z}}''){{su|p=''w''}} \u2260 ''e{{sup|zw}}''}}, but rather {{math|(''e{{sup|z}}''){{su|p=''w''}} {{=}} ''e''{{sup|(''z'' + 2\u03c0''in'')''w''}}}} multivalued over integers {{math|''n''}}\n\nSee [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]] for more about problems with combining powers.\n\nThe exponential function maps any [[line (mathematics)|line]] in the complex plane to a [[logarithmic spiral]] in the complex plane with the center at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]]. Two special cases exist: when the original line is parallel to the real axis, the resulting spiral never closes in on itself; when the original line is parallel to the imaginary axis, the resulting spiral is a circle of some radius.\n\n<gallery caption=\"3D-Plots of Real Part, Imaginary Part, and Modulus of the exponential function\" class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\" heights=\"150px\">\n Image:ExponentialAbs_real_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} Re(''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>)}}\n Image:ExponentialAbs_image_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} Im(''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>)}}\n Image:ExponentialAbs_SVG.svg| {{math|''z'' {{=}} {{abs|''e''<sup>''x'' + ''iy''</sup>}}}}\n</gallery>\n\nConsidering the complex exponential function as a function involving four real variables:\n: <math>v+iw = \\exp(x+iy)</math>\nthe graph of the exponential function is a two-dimensional surface curving through four dimensions.\n\nStarting with a color-coded portion of the <math>xy</math> domain, the following are depictions of the graph as variously projected into two or three dimensions.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Graphs of the complex exponential function\" class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"text-align:left\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile: Complex exponential function graph domain xy dimensions.svg|Checker board key:<br> <math>x> 0:\\; \\text{green}</math><br> <math>x< 0:\\; \\text{red}</math><br><math> y> 0:\\; \\text{yellow}</math><br><math> y< 0:\\; \\text{blue}</math>\nFile: Complex exponential function graph range vw dimensions.svg|Projection onto the range complex plane (V/W).

It shows the graph is a surface of revolution about the <math>x</math> axis of the graph of the real exponential function, producing a horn or funnel shape.\n\nThe fourth image shows the graph extended along the imaginary <math>y</math> axis.  It shows that the graph's surface for positive and negative <math>y</math> values doesn't really meet along the negative real <math>v</math> axis, but instead forms a spiral surface about the <math>y</math> axis.  Because its <math>y</math> values have been extended to \u00b12\u03c0, this image also better depicts the 2\u03c0 periodicity in the imaginary <math>y</math> value.\n\n===Computation of {{math|''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}} where both {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} are complex===\n{{Main|Exponentiation}}\nComplex exponentiation {{math|''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}} can be defined by converting {{math|''a''}} to polar coordinates and using the identity {{math|(''e''<sup>ln ''a''</sup>){{su|p=''b''}} {{=}} ''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}}:\n: <math>a^b = \\left(re^{\\theta i}\\right)^b = \\left(e^{(\\ln r) + \\theta i}\\right)^b = e^{\\left((\\ln r) + \\theta i\\right)b}</math>\n\nHowever, when {{math|''b''}} is not an integer, this function is [[multivalued function|multivalued]], because {{math|''\u03b8''}} is not unique (see [[exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]).\n\n==Matrices and Banach algebras==\nThe power series definition of the exponential function makes sense for square [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] (for which the function is called the [[matrix exponential]]) and more generally in any unital [[Banach algebra]] {{math|''B''}}.  In this setting, {{math|''e''<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} is invertible with inverse {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''x''</sup>}} for any {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''B''}}.  If {{math|''xy'' {{=}} ''yx''}}, then {{math|''e''<sup>''x'' + ''y''</sup> {{=}} ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>''e''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, but this identity can fail for noncommuting {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.\n\nSome alternative definitions lead to the same function.  For instance, {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be defined as\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right)^n .</math>\n\nOr {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be defined as {{math|''f''<sub>''x''</sub>(1)}}, where {{math|''f''<sub>''x''</sub>: '''R'''\u2192''B''}} is the solution to the differential equation {{math|{{sfrac|''df<sub>x</sub>''|''dt''}}(''t'') {{=}} ''x{{space|hair}}f''<sub>''x''</sub>(''t'')}}, with initial condition {{math|''f''<sub>''x''</sub>(0) {{=}} 1}}; it follows that {{math|''f''<sub>''x''</sub>(''t'') {{=}} ''e''<sup>''tx''</sup>}} for every {{mvar|t}} in {{math|'''R'''.}}\n\n==Lie algebras==\nGiven a [[Lie group]] {{math|''G''}} and its associated [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is a map <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> {{math|\u21a6 ''G''}} satisfying similar properties. In fact, since {{math|'''R'''}} is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group {{math|GL(''n'','''R''')}} of invertible {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices has as Lie algebra {{math|M(''n'','''R''')}}, the space of all {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.\n\nThe identity {{math|exp(''x'' + ''y'') {{=}} exp ''x'' exp ''y''}} can fail for Lie algebra elements {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} that do not commute; the [[Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula]] supplies the necessary correction terms.\n\n==Transcendency==\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is not in {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}} (i.e., is not the quotient of two polynomials with complex coefficients).\n\nFor {{math|''n''}} distinct complex numbers {{math|{''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}}, the set {{math|{''e''<sup>''a''<sub>1</sub>''z''</sup>, \u2026, ''e''<sup>''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''z''</sup>}}} is linearly independent over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is [[transcendental function|transcendental]] over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\n=={{anchor|exp|expm1}}Computation==\nWhen computing (an approximation of) the exponential function near the argument {{math|0}}, the result will be close to 1, and computing the value of the difference <math>\\exp x-1</math> with [[floating-point arithmetic]] may lead to the loss of (possibly all) [[significant figures]], producing a large calculation error, possibly even a meaningless result. \n\nFollowing a proposal by [[William Kahan]], it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called <code>expm1</code>, for computing  {{math|''e<sup>x</sup>'' \u2212 1}} directly, bypassing computation of {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}. For example, if the exponential is computed by using its [[Taylor series]]\n:<math>e^x=1+x+\\frac {x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}6+\\cdots +\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\cdots,</math>\none may use the Taylor series of <math>e^x-1:</math>\n:<math>e^x-1=x+\\frac {x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}6+\\cdots +\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nThis was first implemented in 1979 in the [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP-41C]] calculator, and provided by several calculators,<ref name=\"HP48_AUR\"/><ref name=\"HP50_AUR\"/> [[operating system]]s (for example [[Berkeley UNIX 4.3BSD]]<ref name=\"Beebe_2017\"/>), [[computer algebra system]]s, and programming languages (for example [[C99]]).<ref name=\"Beebe_2002\"/>\n\nIn addition to base {{math|''e''}}, the [[IEEE 754-2008]] standard defines similar exponential functions near 0 for base 2 and 10: <math>2^x - 1</math> and <math>10^x - 1</math>.\n\nA similar approach has been used for the logarithm (see [[lnp1]]).<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Alternative_funcs\"/>\n\nAn identity in terms of the [[hyperbolic tangent]],\n:<math>\\operatorname{expm1} (x) = \\exp x - 1 = \\frac{2 \\tanh(x/2)}{1 - \\tanh(x/2)},</math>\ngives a high-precision value for small values of {{math|''x''}} on systems that do not implement {{math|expm1(''x'')}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mental calculation#nat-exp|Approximating natural exponents (log base {{math|''e''}})]]\n* [[Carlitz exponential]], a characteristic {{math|''p''}} analogue\n* [[Double exponential function]]\n* [[Exponential field]]\n* [[Half-exponential function]], a compositional square root of an exponential function\n* [[Linear function]]\n* [[List of exponential topics]]\n* [[List of integrals of exponential functions]]\n* [[Mittag-Leffler function]], a generalization of the exponential function\n* [[p-adic exponential function|{{math|''p''}}-adic exponential function]]\n* [[Polynomial function]]\n* [[Pad\u00e9 table for exponential function]] \u2013 [[Pad\u00e9 approximation]] of exponential function by a fraction of polynomial functions\n* [[Tetration]]\n* [[Unrestricted algorithm]] for the computation of the exponential function\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"nb\"|refs=\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Alternative_funcs\">A similar approach to reduce [[round-off error]]s of calculations for certain input values of [[trigonometric function]]s consists of using the less common trigonometric functions [[versine]], [[vercosine]], [[coversine]], [[covercosine]], [[haversine]], [[havercosine]], [[hacoversine]], [[hacovercosine]], [[exsecant]] and [[excosecant]].</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"Logx\">In pure mathematics, the notation {{math|log ''x''}} generally refers to the natural logarithm of {{mvar|x}} or a logarithm in general if the base is immaterial.</ref>\n<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"lnx\">The notation {{math|ln ''x''}} is the ISO standard and is prevalent in the natural sciences and secondary education (US).

He is best known for establishing the field of [[African-American art]] history and was influential in the [[Black Arts Movement|African American Art movement]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPorter was born  in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on Dec 22, 1905. His father was an [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal minister]] and his mother was a teacher. His brother John taught him to paint. He attended schools in [[Washington D.C.]] between 1918 and 1923, and later attended [[Howard University]]. Under the direction of [[James V. Herring]], head of the Art Department at [[Howard University]], Porter studied painting, drawing, and art history.<ref name=\"African American Art book\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Samella |title=African American Art and Arrtists |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |page=104}}</ref> Porter graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1926.

He later studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Porter received a scholarship in 1935 from the [[Institute of International Education]] and was the recipient of a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant that allowed him to study art in Europe. He studied [[Baroque]] art  at the [[Sorbonne University|Institute of Art and Archeology at the Sorbonne]]. He returned to the United States where he attended [[New York University]], graduating in 1937 with a master's degree in [[art history]]. Porter's master's thesis, later the subject for his influential book, ''Modern Negro Art'', focused on African-American art and artists.<ref name=\"African American Art book\" /><ref name=\"DC Library\">{{Cite web|url=http://dclibrarylabs.org/blkren/bios/porterja.html|title=James A.

He headed the Art Department, and served as Director of the Art Gallery from 1953 through 1970.\n\nHe published ''Modern Negro Art'' in 1943, the first comprehensive study in the United States of African-American art. Porter decisively placed African-American artists within the framework of American art.  He was the first to recognize and document the significant contributions these artists made to the history of American art. With Porter's systematic approach, ''Modern Negro Art'' became and still is the foundation of African-American art history and for later texts.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" /> Porter's interest in nearly forgotten and often ignored artists of African descent was sparked by reading a brief article on African-American landscape artist [[Robert Scott Duncanson]]. Due to the account's brevity, Porter followed his curiosity to research Duncanson and other artists of African descent.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\">{{cite book |last1=Dover |first1=Cedrick |title=American Negro Art |url=https://archive.org/details/americannegroart00dove_0 |url-access=registration |date=1960 |publisher=New York Graphic Society |location=Greenwich, Connecticut |pages=[https://archive.org/details/americannegroart00dove_0/page/19 19\u201329]}}</ref>\n\nPorter was the recipient of a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1945. He took a leave of absence from teaching and spent a year in [[Cuba]] from 1945 to 1946, studying art and culture in [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]].  His thorough research on these countries and West Africa stimulated his creating courses at Howard in \"Latin American Art\" and \"African Art and Architecture\".<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" /> In 1955, he was awarded a fellowship by the Belgium-American Art Seminar and studied Flemish and Dutch Art of the sixteenth thru the eighteenth century while in Belgium. With a grant from the newspaper, the [[Washington Star|Evening Star]], Porter traveled to [[South Africa]] in 1963 to study West African architecture. He completed twenty-five paintings with South African themes during his time in the country.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web |title=James A Porter |url=https://americanart.si.edu/artist/james-porter-3843 |website=Smithsonian Art Museum |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nPorter's work was shown in many group exhibitions during his forty year career. In 1940 his work was displayed at the  American Negro Exposition in Chicago, and in 1948, he mounted a one-man exhibition of his work with the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nDuring his studies, Porter met [[Dorothy B. Porter|Dorothy Burnett]], a librarian at the Harlem branch of the [[New York Public Library]], where he did research. On December 27, 1929, Porter and Burnett were married.  They had one daughter, Constance Porter. They became professional as well as personal partners. Dorothy worked with Porter, providing bibliographic information critical to his investigations. Both worked at [[Howard University]]. Dorothy Porter was the director of Moorland Foundation, later known as the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]]. She developed and catalogued information about African-American artists.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" />\n\n== Honors and legacy ==\n{{quote box \n|quote= James A. Porter left a cultural and educational legacy to those passionately involved in the area of African American art. The drive to explore and firmly document artists of the Diaspora continues today.

He is best known for establishing the field of [[African-American art]] history and was influential in the [[Black Arts Movement|African American Art movement]].\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPorter was born  in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on Dec 22, 1905. His father was an [[African Methodist Episcopal Church|African Methodist Episcopal minister]] and his mother was a teacher. His brother John taught him to paint. He attended schools in [[Washington D.C.]] between 1918 and 1923, and later attended [[Howard University]]. Under the direction of [[James V. Herring]], head of the Art Department at [[Howard University]], Porter studied painting, drawing, and art history.<ref name=\"African American Art book\">{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Samella |title=African American Art and Arrtists |date=2003 |publisher=University of California Press |page=104}}</ref> Porter graduated from [[Howard University]] in 1926.

He later became chairman of the art department, a position he held until his death in 1970.<ref name=\"Howard University Porter bio\">{{cite web |last1=Hayes |first1=Jefreen |title=James A.

He later studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]]. Porter received a scholarship in 1935 from the [[Institute of International Education]] and was the recipient of a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] grant that allowed him to study art in Europe. He studied [[Baroque]] art  at the [[Sorbonne University|Institute of Art and Archeology at the Sorbonne]]. He returned to the United States where he attended [[New York University]], graduating in 1937 with a master's degree in [[art history]]. Porter's master's thesis, later the subject for his influential book, ''Modern Negro Art'', focused on African-American art and artists.<ref name=\"African American Art book\" /><ref name=\"DC Library\">{{Cite web|url=http://dclibrarylabs.org/blkren/bios/porterja.html|title=James A. Porter - The Black Renaissance in Washington, DC|website=dclibrarylabs.org|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nPorter taught at [[Howard University]] for more than forty years, together with artists such as [[James Lesesne Wells]] and [[Lois Mailou Jones]]. He headed the Art Department, and served as Director of the Art Gallery from 1953 through 1970.\n\nHe published ''Modern Negro Art'' in 1943, the first comprehensive study in the United States of African-American art. Porter decisively placed African-American artists within the framework of American art.  He was the first to recognize and document the significant contributions these artists made to the history of American art. With Porter's systematic approach, ''Modern Negro Art'' became and still is the foundation of African-American art history and for later texts.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" /> Porter's interest in nearly forgotten and often ignored artists of African descent was sparked by reading a brief article on African-American landscape artist [[Robert Scott Duncanson]]. Due to the account's brevity, Porter followed his curiosity to research Duncanson and other artists of African descent.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\">{{cite book |last1=Dover |first1=Cedrick |title=American Negro Art |url=https://archive.org/details/americannegroart00dove_0 |url-access=registration |date=1960 |publisher=New York Graphic Society |location=Greenwich, Connecticut |pages=[https://archive.org/details/americannegroart00dove_0/page/19 19\u201329]}}</ref>\n\nPorter was the recipient of a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] in 1945. He took a leave of absence from teaching and spent a year in [[Cuba]] from 1945 to 1946, studying art and culture in [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]].  His thorough research on these countries and West Africa stimulated his creating courses at Howard in \"Latin American Art\" and \"African Art and Architecture\".<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" /> In 1955, he was awarded a fellowship by the Belgium-American Art Seminar and studied Flemish and Dutch Art of the sixteenth thru the eighteenth century while in Belgium. With a grant from the newspaper, the [[Washington Star|Evening Star]], Porter traveled to [[South Africa]] in 1963 to study West African architecture. He completed twenty-five paintings with South African themes during his time in the country.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web |title=James A Porter |url=https://americanart.si.edu/artist/james-porter-3843 |website=Smithsonian Art Museum |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nPorter's work was shown in many group exhibitions during his forty year career. In 1940 his work was displayed at the  American Negro Exposition in Chicago, and in 1948, he mounted a one-man exhibition of his work with the Barnett-Aden Gallery in Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nDuring his studies, Porter met [[Dorothy B. Porter|Dorothy Burnett]], a librarian at the Harlem branch of the [[New York Public Library]], where he did research. On December 27, 1929, Porter and Burnett were married.  They had one daughter, Constance Porter. They became professional as well as personal partners. Dorothy worked with Porter, providing bibliographic information critical to his investigations. Both worked at [[Howard University]]. Dorothy Porter was the director of Moorland Foundation, later known as the [[Moorland-Spingarn Research Center]]. She developed and catalogued information about African-American artists.<ref name=\"American Negro Art by Dover\" />\n\n== Honors and legacy ==\n{{quote box \n|quote= James A. Porter left a cultural and educational legacy to those passionately involved in the area of African American art. The drive to explore and firmly document artists of the Diaspora continues today.

His writings and designs stress the need to create meaningful, vital, and inclusive spaces that enhance community, with special attention to the essence of a particular locale, geography, and culture.\n\nHe is a self-described modernist.\n\n==Awards and recognition==\n* Gold Medal, [[American Institute of Architects]]\n* Companion of the [[Order of Canada]]\n* Gold Medal, [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]]\n* Richard Neutra Award for Professional Excellence\n* Mt.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemy of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers. <ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is the tournament organized by the professional darts organisation, [[PDC]]. Tha main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has its winner and loser. Each match starts with a [[bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shooutout continues in the reversed order until the decision. \n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition. \n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also first to 10 legs (best of 19).\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[Dartboard|dartboards]] at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].   \n   \n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of Czech Darts Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]]. <ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Czech Darts Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]] World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] or the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]].

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemy of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers. <ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is the tournament organized by the professional darts organisation, [[PDC]]. Tha main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has its winner and loser. Each match starts with a [[bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shooutout continues in the reversed order until the decision. \n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition. \n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also first to 10 legs (best of 19).\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[Dartboard|dartboards]] at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].   \n   \n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of Czech Darts Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]]. <ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Czech Darts Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]] World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] or the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have usually experience from international tournaments and belong to the best players in Czech republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[PDC]]. <ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.

Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first to construct and demonstrate powered flight.  Although the first flight was in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], their Wright Flyer was built in and returned to Dayton for improvements and further flights at [[Huffman Field]], a cow pasture eight miles (13&nbsp;km) northeast of Dayton, near the current Wright Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nWhen the government tried to move development to Langley field in southern Virginia, six Dayton businessmen including Edward A. Deeds, formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company in Moraine and established a flying field.  Deeds also opened a field to the north in the flood plain of the Great Miami River between the confluences of that river, the Stillwater River, and the Mad River, near downtown Dayton.  Later named [[McCook Field]] for Alexander McDowell McCook, an American Civil War general, this became the Army Signal Corps' primary aviation research and training location. Wilbur Wright also purchased land near Huffman prairie to continue their research.\n\nDuring World War I, the Army purchased 40 acres adjacent to Huffman Prairie for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot.  As airplanes developed more capability, they needed more runway space than McCook could offer, and a new location was sought. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km2) northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.  Wright Field was \"formally dedicated\" on 12 October 1927.  After World War II, Wright Field and the adjacent Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and Clinton Army Air Field were merged as the Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base. On 13 January 1948, the facility was renamed [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].\n\n=== The Dayton Flood ===\nA catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], led to the creation of the [[Miami Conservancy District]], a series of dams as well as hydraulic pumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|title=Flood Protection|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817150122/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II.

Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the [[Interstate Highway System]] allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbadayton.com/site/publisher/files/ohio_modern.pdf|title=Dayton Modern History|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Ohio Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s, however, Dayton's population has declined, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national [[United States housing bubble|housing crisis]] that began in 2008.<ref name=\"Dayton's decline \u2013 Hampton Inst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/bigeight.html#.Uuq1A_ldXA0|title=Ohio's Cloudy Future: The Decline of the \"Big Eight\" and the Buckeye State|last=Posey|first=Sean|date=August 22, 2013|publisher=The Hampton Institute|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most.

Unlike the population of, say, New York City, [[Geneva]] or [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the \"temporary center of international peace.\" The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. [[Warren Christopher]] was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the airbase placed \"candles of peace\" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a \"peace chain,\" although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.<ref>[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p. 234</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nDayton is known as the \"Gem City.\" The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known [[racehorse]] named Gem hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the ''Cincinnati Daily Chronicle'' by an author known as T stated:\n{{quote|In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns.

Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve,<ref>{{cite book |title=Early Dayton |author=Robert W. Steele and Mary Davies Steele |year=1896 |publisher=W.J.

Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first to construct and demonstrate powered flight.  Although the first flight was in [[Kitty Hawk, North Carolina]], their Wright Flyer was built in Dayton, and was returned to Dayton for improvements and further flights at [[Huffman Field]], a cow pasture eight miles (13&nbsp;km) northeast of Dayton, near the current Wright Patterson Air Force Base.\n\nWhen the government tried to move development to Langley field in southern Virginia, six Dayton businessmen including Edward A. Deeds, formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company in Moraine and established a flying field.  Deeds also opened a field to the north in the flood plain of the Great Miami River between the confluences of that river, the Stillwater River, and the Mad River, near downtown Dayton.  Later named [[McCook Field]] for Alexander McDowell McCook, an American Civil War general, this became the Army Signal Corps' primary aviation research and training location. Wilbur Wright also purchased land near Huffman prairie to continue their research.\n\nDuring World War I, the Army purchased 40 acres adjacent to Huffman Prairie for the Fairfield Aviation General Supply Depot.  As airplanes developed more capability, they needed more runway space than McCook could offer, and a new location was sought. The Patterson family formed the Dayton Air Service Committee, Inc which held a campaign that raised $425,000 in two days and purchased 4,520.47 acres (18.2937 km2) northeast of Dayton, including Wilbur Wright Field and the Huffman Prairie Flying Field.  Wright Field was \"formally dedicated\" on 12 October 1927.  After World War II, Wright Field and the adjacent Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and Clinton Army Air Field were merged as the Headquarters, Air Force Technical Base. On 13 January 1948, the facility was renamed [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].\n\n=== The Dayton Flood ===\nA catastrophic flood in March 1913, known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], led to the creation of the [[Miami Conservancy District]], a series of dams and hydraulic pumps installed around Dayton, in 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|title=Flood Protection|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817150122/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/flood/index.asp|archivedate=August 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Like other cities across the country, Dayton was heavily involved in the war effort during World War II.

At one point, emergency housing was put into place due to a housing shortage in the region, much of which is still in use today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daytonology.blogspot.com/2008/11/world-war-ii-housing-daytonfairborn.html|title=WWII Emergency Housing|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Daytonology Blogspot|date=November 11, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Post-War Dayton ===\nBetween the 1940s and the 1970s, the city saw significant growth in suburban areas from population migration. Veterans were returning from military service in large numbers seeking industrial and manufacturing jobs, a part of the local industry that was expanding rapidly. Advancements in architecture also contributed to the suburban boom. New, modernized shopping centers and the [[Interstate Highway System]] allowed workers to commute greater distances and families to live further from the downtown area. More than 127,000 homes were built in Montgomery County during the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbadayton.com/site/publisher/files/ohio_modern.pdf|title=Dayton Modern History|accessdate=August 25, 2011|publisher=Ohio Historical Society}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1980s, however, Dayton's population has declined, mainly due to the loss of manufacturing jobs and decentralization of metropolitan areas, as well as the national [[United States housing bubble|housing crisis]] that began in 2008.<ref name=\"Dayton's decline \u2013 Hampton Inst\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/bigeight.html#.Uuq1A_ldXA0|title=Ohio's Cloudy Future: The Decline of the \"Big Eight\" and the Buckeye State|last=Posey|first=Sean|date=August 22, 2013|publisher=The Hampton Institute|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> While much of the state has suffered for similar reasons, the impact on Dayton has been greater than most.

Unlike the population of, say, New York City, [[Geneva]] or [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the \"temporary center of international peace.\" The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded around, saying that they were praying for us. [[Warren Christopher]] was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed \"candles of peace\" in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a \"peace chain,\" although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.<ref>[[Richard Holbrooke]], ''To End a War'', p. 234</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Nickname ===\nDayton is known as the \"Gem City.\" The nickname's origin is uncertain, but several theories exist. In the early 19th century, a well-known [[racehorse]] named Gem hailed from Dayton. In 1845, an article published in the ''Cincinnati Daily Chronicle'' by an author known as T stated:\n{{quote|In a small bend of the Great Miami River, with canals on the east and south, it can be fairly said, without infringing on the rights of others, that Dayton is the gem of all our interior towns.

Bickham of the ''Dayton Journal'' began a campaign to nickname Dayton the \"Gem City.\" The name was adopted by the city's Board of Trade several years later.<ref name=\"Dayton FAQs\" /> [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] referred to the nickname in his poem, \"Toast to Dayton,\" as noted in the following excerpt:\n<blockquote><poem>\nShe shall ever claim our duty,\nFor she shines\u2014the brightest gem\nThat has ever decked with beauty\n     Dear Ohio's diadem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |title=Toast to Dayton |accessdate=March 19, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718091359/http://www.dunbarsite.org/gallery/AToasttoDayton.asp |archivedate=July 18, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nDayton also plays a role in a nickname given to the state of Ohio, \"Birthplace of Aviation.\" Dayton is the hometown of the [[Wright brothers]], aviation pioneers who are credited with inventing and building the world's first successful airplane.

The galleries currently showcase collections of art from Africa; works by established and emerging contemporary artists; European and American paintings, sculpture, and decorative arts; ancient Antioch mosaics; art from Asia, and textiles from around the world.\n\nThe 210,000-square-foot museum is distinguished by a neoclassical building designed in the 1920s by renowned American architect [[John Russell Pope]] and two landscaped gardens with 20th-century sculpture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artbma.org/about/index.html|title=About the BMA|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The museum is located between [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Charles Village]], to the east, [[Remington, Baltimore|Remington]], to the south, [[Hampden, Baltimore|Hampden]], to the west; and south of the [[Roland Park, Baltimore|Roland Park]] neighborhoods, immediately adjacent to the [[Homewood House|Homewood]] campus of [[Johns Hopkins University]], though the museum is an independent institution and not affiliated with the university.\n\nThe highlight of the museum is the [[Cone sisters|Cone Collection]], brought together by Baltimore sisters [[Claribel Cone|Dr. Claribel]] (1864&ndash;1929) and [[Etta Cone]] (1870&ndash;1949). Accomplished collectors, the sisters amassed a wealth of works by artists including [[Matisse|Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso|Pablo Picasso]], [[C\u00e9zanne|Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Degas|Edgar Degas]], [[Gauguin|Paul Gauguin]], [[van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Pierre-August Renoir]], nearly all of which were donated to the museum. The museum is also home to 18,000 works of French mid-19th-century art from the [[George A. Lucas]] collection, which has been acclaimed by the museum as a cultural \"treasure\" and \"among the greatest single holdings of French art in the country.\"<ref>Stanley Mazaroff, ''A Paris Life, A Baltimore Treasure'', Chapter Fourteen, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2018.</ref>\n\nThe BMA is currently led by Director Christopher Bedford, who was appointed in May 2016, after a year-long search. Prior to joining the BMA, Bedford led the [[Rose Art Museum]] at Brandeis University in Massachusetts for four years.

In response, the municipal government established a city-wide congress to develop a master plan for the city's recovery and future growth and development. The congress, headed by Dr. A.R.L. Dohme, decided that a major deficiency of the city was the lack of an art museum. This decision led to the formation of an 18-person Committee on the Art Museum, with art dealer and industrialist Henry H. Wiegand as chairman. Ten years later, the museum was officially incorporated on November 16, 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-bma-20141123-story.html|title=The BMA turns 100|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> Along with Minneapolis and Cleveland, Baltimore's museum was \"modeled after two prominent 1870s predecessors, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/four-museums-plan-their-centennials.html|title=Four Museums Plan Their Centennials|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> According to a booklet published at the time of incorporation, it was stated that Baltimore lagged behind other cities \u201cin regard to matters of aesthetic interest.\u201d\n\nStill without a permanent site, the fledgling museum was founded with but a single painting, [[William Kendall (painter)|William-Sergeant Kendall]]'s ''Mischief'', which was donated by Dr. Dohme himself. As the museum's founders were confident that more art would eventually be acquired, the nearby [[Peabody Institute]] agreed to hold the collection for a time until a permanent home was established.<ref name=\"baltimoremagazine.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2014/10/20/fall-arts-preview-bma-turns-100|title=Fall Arts Preview: BMA Turns 100|first=Baltimore|last=magazine|date=20 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> The committee began planning a permanent home for the museum's holdings.\n\nIn 1916, a building was purchased on the southwest corner of [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles]] and West Biddle Streets as a possible location for the museum. Although an architect was employed to remodel it, it was never occupied. By 1915 the group had decided to permanently house the museum in the [[Wyman Park]] area, west of the then named [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Peabody Heights (later Charles Village)]] neighborhood. By 1917, the group had received a promise from [[Johns Hopkins University]] for the land further south of the new [[Georgian Revival architecture]]-[[Federal architecture|Federal styled]] campus they were in the process of moving to. This prospective plot was near the old [[Homewood House|Homewood Mansion]] of 1800 and the later [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] mansion of \"Wyman Villa\" of a Hopkins donor and trustee, William Wyman, which would see them leave their downtown site at [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|North Howard Street]] and West Centre, which they had occupied since 1876.\n\nHowever, before finally moving into its permanent home in 1929, the museum was temporarily moved in July 1922 to the former home of their prime benefactor and foundress, [[Mary Garrett|Mary Elizabeth Garrett]] (1857\u20131915), at 101 West Monument Street, on the southwest corner with Cathedral Street (facing West Mount Vernon Place and the [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]]). Garrett, a famous philanthropist in her own right who also further endowed the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], was the only daughter of [[John Work Garrett]] (1820\u20131884), the [[American Civil War|Civil War-era]] President of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], supporter of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], and scion of the noted [[Robert Garrett]] banking firm in the city. In 1923, the museum's inaugural exhibition opened there with attendance topping 6,775 during its first \nweek.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artbma.org/documents/press/BMAHistoryHighlights_1914-2014_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220235252/https://artbma.org/documents/press/BMAHistoryHighlights_1914-2014_final.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The house was offered by Miss M. Cary as a home for the \"collections\" and a meeting place for the board of trustees. The old Garrett mansion was acquired in 1925 by the group of art enthusiasts who bought the property for the purpose of keeping the museum intact. Despite having limited space, the museum offered accommodations to art associations and a hall for meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, back at [[Wyman Park]], prominent architect [[John Russell Pope]] (1874\u20131937) was engaged to design the museum's permanent home. With his years of study in Europe, Pope is considered to be the main examplar of the classical revival style that proved so popular with traditional American architects. He is credited with a number of major buildings along the American east coast and abroad, including the National Archives Building in Washington, New York's American Museum of Natural History, and the Tate Gallery Sculpture Hall in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/john-russell-pope|title=John Russell Pope Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> His distinct brand of classicism, both serene and monolithic, was perhaps the perfect choice for such an ambitious project.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid on October 20, 1927, facing the future Art Museum Drive running diagonally from North Charles Street. The systems engineering for the building's original design was completed by [[Henry Adams (mechanical engineer)|Henry Adams]], noted local mechanical engineer. The building consists of three floors and includes several rooms that were reconstructed and/or replicated from six local [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] historic houses before their loss or razing.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/59462,0,2882861.venue ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe building phase was marked by controversy over its location, cost, and the quality of workmanship, but on April 19, 1929, it opened on schedule without much fanfare. The first visitors were greeted by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]'' in the Sculpture Court, and most of the objects on display were lent by Baltimore and Maryland collectors. An average of 584 visitors attended the museum each day during its first two months.\n\nBy the 1930s, the public reception was such that director Roland McKinney, in a letter to board chairman Henry Treide, noted, \"People seem to feel that the Museum belongs to them and show that they are sincerely proud of it and its activities.\" Unfortunately, these people were mostly upper-crust, privileged, and white, a fact noted in a 1937 Carnegie Corporation report. \"[Baltimore] cultural institutions (outside of the library and the schools) have appealed to, been intended for, and been supported by a pretty small minority... they need to be opened up, for the viewpoint of the entire community and its needs\", it concluded. Local artists were feeling slighted, as well. \u201cWe, the living, resent being left to work in a vacuum of indifference and neglect while so much of the dead past is exhausted [by the BMA],\u201d the president of the Artists\u2019 Union of Baltimore complained to ''The Evening Sun'' in 1937. The writer of the letter was Morris Louis, whose work, decades later, would be in the BMA's contemporary collection. Treide responded with an extensive community outreach survey and, in 1939, presented the city's first exhibition of African-American art. The show drew over 12,000 visitors in two weeks.<ref name=\"baltimoremagazine.net\"/>\n\nMany of the objects lent to the museum when it opened were eventually donated to it. Among the donors who have shaped the museum's collection are Blanche Adler, [[Cone sisters|Dr. Claribel Cone and Etta Cone]], Jacob Epstein, Edward J. Gallagher, Jr., John W. and Robert Garrett, [[Mary Frick Jacobs]], Ryda H. and Robert H. Levi, [[Saidie May|Saidie Adler May]], Dorothy McIlvain Scott, Elsie C. Woodward, and [[Alan Wurtzburger|Alan and Janet Wurtzburger]]. The growing collection is reflected in the three major expansions: the Saidie A. May Wing in 1950, the Woodward Wing in 1956, and the Cone Wing in 1957. These additions were all designed by local architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks to harmonize with the original Pope Building.\n\nToday, the BMA's collection includes more than 95,000 objects, making it the largest art museum in Maryland. It is governed by a private board of trustees and receives funding from the City of Baltimore; [[Baltimore County]], [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties; the State of Maryland; various corporations and foundations; federal agencies; individual Trustees; and many private citizens. The BMA welcomes more than 200,000 visitors annually. In addition to its art collection, it organizes and hosts traveling exhibitions and serves as a major arts center for the region through its programs.\n\n==Recent developments==\n\n=== Art acquisitions and commissions ===\nIn 2018, the BMA announced its intention to sell seven works by artists already well-represented in the collection in order to acquire more contemporary works by women and artists of color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-fe-bma-sells-artworks-20180413-story.html|title=Sun, Baltimore \"BMA Sells Artworks\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This initiative led to the addition of works by [[Mark Bradford]], [[Isaac Julien|Isaac Julian]], [[Wangechi Mutu]], [[Amy Sherald]], [[Carrie Mae Weems]], [[Jack Whitten]], [[Lynette Yiadom-Boakye]], and other notable contemporary artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/features/baltimore-insider-blog/bs-fe-bma-20180626-story.html|title=Sun, Baltimore  \"Painting by Michelle Obama portraitist Amy Sherald among 23 BMA acquires after deaccession sale\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artbma.org/documents/press/New_Acquisitions_Release_final.pdf|title=BMA Announces Second Round of Acquisitions|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  Many of these works will be on view in a major reinstallation of the Contemporary Wing that focuses on the creativity of 20th- and 21st-century black artists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artbma.org/documents/press/every_day.pdf|title=Every Day Selections from the Collection|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> In fall 2019, the BMA will also transform the East Lobby with a major new work by internationally acclaimed artist [[Mickalene Thomas]] as part of the Robert E.

A large part of the collection was donated by Janet and Alan Wurtzburger in 1954. It contains more than 2,000 objects whose sources range from ancient [[Egypt]] to contemporary [[Zimbabwe]], and includes works from many other cultures, including [[Bambara people|Bamana]], [[Yoruba culture|Yoruba]], [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]], [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]. The collection includes many different forms of art, including [[headdress]]es, [[mask]]s, [[figurine|figures]], [[royal staffs]], [[textiles]], [[jewelry]], [[ceremonial weapons]], and [[pottery]]. Several of the pieces are known for their use in royal courts, performances, and religious contexts, and many are internationally known.\n\nHighlights of the collection include works by carvers [[Zlan]] and [[Sonzanlwon]], and figures by the legendary brasscaster [[Ldamie]]. Also on display are a [[Lozi people|Lozi]] throne (c. 1900) most likely carved in the court of [[King Lewanika]] of western [[Zambia]], a 20th-century [[Hausa Koranic]] [[prayer board]], and a 2006 video work by [[Theo Eshetu]]. At least several of the masks and figurative sculptures are recognized internationally as the best of their type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-ae-bma-african-asian-20150425-story.html#page=1|title=Baltimore Museum of Art opens renovated African and Asian galleries|first=Mary Carole|last=McCauley|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American art===\n\nThe BMA's American art collection includes paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts spanning from the colonial era to the late 20th century. The museum has several works of art from the Baltimore area, including portraiture by [[Charles Willson Peale]], [[Rembrandt Peale]], and other members of the Peale family; silver from Baltimore's prominent silver manufacturing company [[Samuel Kirk & Son]]; [[Baltimore album quilts]]; and painted furniture by [[John Finlay (furniture maker)|John Finlay]] and [[Hugh Finlay]] of Baltimore.\n\nThe American painting collection at the museum ranges from 18th-century portraits and 19th-century landscape painting to American Impressionism and modernism, with works by artists [[John Singleton Copley]], [[Thomas Sully]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Notable canvases include ''A Wild Scene'' (1831\u20131832) by [[Thomas Cole]], ''La Vach\u00e8re'' (1888) by [[Theodore Robinson]], and ''Pink Tulip'' (1926) by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]. These are complemented by holdings of prints and drawings, as well as modern photographs from the Gallagher/Dalsheimer Collection. Artists represented include [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Strand]], and [[Alfred Stieglitz]].\n\nThe BMA has a long record of collecting works by [[African-American|African American]] artists that began in 1939 with one of the first exhibitions of African American art in the country. This collection has grown with the addition of works by 19th- and 20th-century African-American artists [[Joshua Johnson (painter)|Joshua Johnson]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Edmonia Lewis]], [[Horace Pippin]], and [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], as well as numerous works by contemporary artists.\n\nThe BMA's holdings of American decorative arts include an extensive furniture collection that represents the major historic cabinetmaking centers of Baltimore, [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], and [[Boston]]. Many of these objects came from Dorothy McIlvain Scott, a generous Baltimore philanthropist and collector.\n\nA gift in 1933 by Mrs. Miles White, Jr. of over 200 pieces of Maryland silver formed the nucleus of a silver collection that now encompasses objects by leading 18th- and early 19th-century silversmiths in Annapolis and Baltimore, as well as examples of early English silver owned by Maryland families during the Federal era. Among them is the [[Annapolis Subscription Plate]], made by Annapolis silver smith John Inch and the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland. Later masterworks by artists from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] to [[Georg Jensen]] are also on view.\n\nOther notable aspects of the decorative arts collection include a rare set of five clerestory windows and two mosaic-clad architectural columns that represent Tiffany's contribution to 20th-century ornament. Period rooms from six historic Maryland houses, along with architectural elements from other historic buildings, illustrate town and country building styles from the 18th and 19th centuries, and miniature rooms made by Chicago miniaturist [[Eugene Kupjack]] that invite scrutiny of a variety of decorative styles at close range.\n\n===Antioch mosaics===\n\nThe BMA exhibits a collection of [[Antioch mosaics]], the result of its participation in excavations of this ancient city, known today as [[Antakya]] in southeastern [[Turkey]], near the border of [[Syria]].\n\nWith the support of BMA Trustee Robert Garrett, the Baltimore Museum of Art joined the [[Mus\u00e9es Nationaux de France]], [[Worcester Art Museum]], and [[Princeton University]] during the excavations of 1932 to 1939, discovering 300 mosaic pavements in and around the lost city. The BMA received some of the mosaics from the excavation, totaling 34 pavements, 28 of which are on display in the museum's sunlit atrium court.\n\nDiscovered in the affluent suburb of [[Daphne]] and the nearby port city of [[Seleucia Pieria]], the mosaics date from the days of the emperor [[Hadrian]] in the 2nd century A.D. to the Christian empire of [[Justinian]] in the 6th century, bridging the [[Classical world]] and the early [[Middle Ages]]. The mosaics illustrate how the classical art of [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] evolved into the art of the early Christian era, and tell the story of how people lived in this ancient city prior to its destruction by catastrophic earthquakes in 526 and 528 A.D. The mosaics are notable for their grand scale and elaborately patterned borders, and the brilliance of their decorative and naturalistic effects.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Art of the Ancient Americas===\n[[File:Mayan woman with child.jpg|alt=|thumb|260x260px|Ancient woman with child.

The collection includes works from 2500 BC to AD 1521. The core collection of 120 objects was given to the museum by Alan Wurtzburger in 1958, which significantly expanded the scope of the existing collection and provided momentum for a traveling exhibition of Peruvian ceramics titled ''Myths of Ancient Peru'' (1969).\n\nThe collection is particularly admired for its West [[Mexico]] ceramics, including an important Nayarit house model and an enthroned chief. Also on display is a unique assemblage of 23 figures in dance regalia which celebrates ancient performance and highlights the diversity of Colima art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artbma.org/collections/ancient.html|title=BMA Ancient American collection description|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther notable pieces include a finely worked serpentine figure of [[Olmec]] mastery, elegant portrayals of Maya and Aztec noblewomen showcasing the integral roles women played in the social, political, economic, and spiritual realms of society, and miniature gold votives in the Muisca tradition.\n\n===Art of the Pacific Islands===\n[[File:New Guinea Helmet Mask.jpg|alt=|thumb|229x229px|Unidentified Abelam Artist.

Works in collection include jewelry, ornaments, and [[tapa cloths]].\n\nOf notable interest is a finely carved lizard of dark wood and shell from [[Easter Island]]; a battle pectoral created from hundreds of [[Nassa shells]], which highlights [[Middi]] art of [[New Britain]]; and an 18th-century royal [[Hawaii]]an necklace.\n\nOther highlights of the collection include a breast ornament embellished with small birds and stars that figured as insignia of prestige for the [[Tonga]] of the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. Featuring whale ivory and pearl shell design, it is recognized as one of the largest of its kind.\n\n===Asian art===\n\nThe museum's [[Asian art]] collection includes works from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Tibet]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Near East]]. The collection is particularly known for its [[Chinese ceramics]], with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and utilitarian stoneware from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Although more than 1,000 objects are comprised in this collection, because of limited space, only a portion of the pieces are on display at one time. Works are on view in rotating installations in the museum's Julius Levy Memorial Gallery.\n\nSome notable works in the collection include the life-sized early-15th-century bronze [[Guanyin]], known widely as \"Goddess of Mercy\"; the robust figure of a horse from a [[Han dynasty]] tomb; a 39-piece mortuary retinue, a rare example of the quantities of clay figures that were placed in tombs during the early Tang dynasty; and an outstanding foliate-shaped brush washer that represents the mastery of Chinese blue-and-white [[porcelain]]. Asian art is also represented in other areas of the museum's collection, including 475 Japanese prints and 1,000 textiles from across Asia.\n\n===European art===\n[[File:Anthony van Dyck Rinaldo and Armida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sir Anthony van Dyck.

Most of the collection was formed through donations made by private citizens of the city of Baltimore, notably Mary Frick Jacobs, George A. Lucas, and Jacob Epstein. The collection contains a large selection of 19th-century French art, including more than 140 bronze animal sculptures by [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] and several paintings by [[Barbizon]] artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]].\n\nThe collection includes a wide array of decorative arts, including jeweled snuff boxes, porcelain, and silver. The museum also exhibits a large collection of works on paper from the 15th through the 19th century.\n\nHighlights of the European art exhibit include [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Rinaldo and Armida'' (1629), which was commissioned by King [[Charles I of England]]. It is considered one of the artist's finest paintings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rinaldo and Armida |url=https://www.artble.com/artists/anthony_van_dyck/paintings/rinaldo_and_armida |website=Artble |accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> Other items of northern European and French art include [[Frans Hals]]' portrait ''Dorothea Berck'' (1644), [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]'s painting of his son ''Titus'' (1660), [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]]\u2019s portrayal of a lovely maiden tossing a ball in ''The Game of Knucklebones'' (c. 1734), and French court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]'s exotic ''Princess Anna Alexandrovna Galitzin'' (c. 1797). Medieval and Renaissance works include a 14th-century ''Burgundian Virgin and Child'' carved of limestone and [[Titian]]'s ''Portrait of a Gentleman'' (1561). There are also late-medieval and Renaissance paintings by Giovanni dal Ponte, Biagio D'Antonio, Sandro Botticelli and Workshop, Bernardino Luini, Francesco Ubertini, and Master of View of Saint Gudule.{{clarify|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Paysage Bords de Seine]]'', a Renoir stolen from the museum, resurfaced after being lost for 63 years. The painting then became the subject of a dramatic legal dispute involving the FBI, the woman who said she found the painting, an insurance company's rights to the artwork, and the intentions of Saidie May, an art collector who bought the painting in Paris in 1925 and lent it to the Baltimore museum. In 2014, a judge deemed it to be the property of the BMA after reviewing related documentation from its archives. At the time of the theft, Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. paid the museum about $2,500 for the loss. The company considered whether to make a claim for the painting when it resurfaced, but decided it \"belonged\" at the museum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.att.net/s/editorial.dll?fromspage=ch%2Fc.htm&categoryid=&only=y&pnum=42&bfromind=5099&eeid=10434353&_sitecat=3572&dcatid=1916&eetype=article&render=y&ac=7&ck=&ch=ne&_lid=575&_lnm=news.all.ap.articles |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175949/http://www.att.net/s/editorial.dll?fromspage=ch%2Fc.htm&categoryid=&only=y&pnum=42&bfromind=5099&eeid=10434353&_sitecat=3572&dcatid=1916&eetype=article&render=y&ac=7&ck=&ch=ne&_lid=575&_lnm=news.all.ap.articles |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Cone Collection===\n[[File:La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue de la carri\u00e8re Bib\u00e9mus, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|left|thumb|Paul C\u00e9zanne.

BMA 1950.196|alt=]]\nBaltimore sisters Claribel and Etta Cone amassed one of the most important collections of modern art in the U.S. and gave it to the BMA in 1949. Etta Cone began the Cone Collection in 1898 with the purchase of five paintings by American Impressionist [[Theodore Robinson]] to decorate their Baltimore home. Soon after, the sisters began to make annual trips to Paris where they visited museums, salons, and the studios of emerging artists. In 1906, Etta purchased her first work by [[Henri Matisse]] during a visit with the artist arranged by [[Gertrude Stein]]\u2019s sister-in-law, [[Sarah Stein]]. The Cone sisters were among the artist's first patrons and Etta, in particular, collected works throughout his entire career. Their collection of approximately 3,000 objects included 500 works by Matisse, as well as masterworks by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], which were displayed in their Baltimore apartments prior to coming to the museum.\n\n===Contemporary art===\nThe BMA's Contemporary Wing was built and opened in 1994, closed in January 2011 for renovations, and reopened in November 2012 with new wall and floor finishes; a gallery dedicated to light, sound, and moving image-based art; a dedicated gallery for prints, drawings and photographs; and BMA Go Mobile, a mobile website guide.\n\nThe renovated wing houses a two-part architectural intervention that made the BMA the first museum in the United States to commission and acquire a site-specific installation by artist [[Sarah Oppenheimer]]. The collection features works by [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz West]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Donald Judd]], and other eminent artists alongside new acquisitions from 21st-century artists such as [https://artbma.org/exhibitions/guyton-walker Guyton \\ Walker], [[Josephine Meckseper]], [[Sarah Sze]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The works of American artist [[Bruce Nauman]], known for his work with neon lights, can be seen both in the contemporary collection and adorning the outside of the museum itself with his piece ''Violins, Violence, Silence''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.artbma.org/tag/bruce-nauman/|title=Bruce Nauman - BMA Blog|website=blog.artbma.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> The BMA has the second largest collection of [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] late work in the U.S.\n\nThe Contemporary Wing will be reinstalled again in summer 2019 with a new presentation of 20th- and 21st-century art that focuses on the creativity of black artists such as [[Roy DeCarava]], [[David Driskell]], [[Joyce J.

Accomplished collectors, the sisters amassed a wealth of works by artists including [[Matisse|Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso|Pablo Picasso]], [[C\u00e9zanne|Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Degas|Edgar Degas]], [[Gauguin|Paul Gauguin]], [[van Gogh|Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Pierre-August Renoir]], nearly all of which were donated to the museum. The museum is also home to 18,000 works of French mid-19th-century art from the [[George A.

In response, the municipal government established a city-wide congress to develop a master plan for the city's recovery and future growth and development. The congress, headed by Dr. A.R.L. Dohme, decided that a major deficiency of the city was the lack of an art museum. This decision led to the formation of an 18-person Committee on the Art Museum, with art dealer and industrialist Henry H. Wiegand as chairman. Ten years later, the museum was officially incorporated on November 16, 1914.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-bma-20141123-story.html|title=The BMA turns 100|first=Baltimore|last=Sun|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> Along with Minneapolis and Cleveland, Baltimore's museum was \"modeled after two prominent 1870s predecessors, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/arts/artsspecial/four-museums-plan-their-centennials.html|title=Four Museums Plan Their Centennials|date=16 March 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> According to a booklet published at the time of incorporation, it was stated that Baltimore lagged behind other cities \u201cin regard to matters of aesthetic interest.\u201d\n\nStill without a permanent site, the fledgling museum was founded with but a single painting, [[William Kendall (painter)|William-Sergeant Kendall]]'s ''Mischief'', which was donated by Dr. Dohme himself. As the museum's founders were confident that more art would eventually be acquired, the nearby [[Peabody Institute]] agreed to hold the collection for a time until a permanent home was established.<ref name=\"baltimoremagazine.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2014/10/20/fall-arts-preview-bma-turns-100|title=Fall Arts Preview: BMA Turns 100|first=Baltimore|last=magazine|date=20 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> The committee began planning a permanent home for the museum's holdings.\n\nIn 1916, a building was purchased on the southwest corner of [[Charles Street (Baltimore)|North Charles]] and West Biddle Streets as a possible location for the museum. Although an architect was employed to remodel it, it was never occupied. By 1915 the group had decided to permanently house the museum in the [[Wyman Park]] area, west of the then named [[Charles Village, Baltimore|Peabody Heights (later Charles Village)]] neighborhood. By 1917, the group had received a promise from [[Johns Hopkins University]] for the land further south of the new [[Georgian Revival architecture]]-[[Federal architecture|Federal styled]] campus they were in the process of moving to. This prospective plot was near the old [[Homewood House|Homewood Mansion]] of 1800 and the later [[Italianate architecture|Italianate style]] mansion of \"Wyman Villa\" of a Hopkins donor and trustee, William Wyman, which would see them leave their downtown site at [[Howard Street (Baltimore)|North Howard Street]] and West Centre, which they had occupied since 1876.\n\nHowever, before finally moving into its permanent home in 1929, the museum was temporarily moved in July 1922 to the former home of their prime benefactor and foundress, [[Mary Garrett|Mary Elizabeth Garrett]] (1857\u20131915), at 101 West Monument Street, on the southwest corner with Cathedral Street (facing West Mount Vernon Place and the [[Washington Monument (Baltimore)|Washington Monument]]). Garrett, a famous philanthropist in her own right who also further endowed the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], was the only daughter of [[John Work Garrett]] (1820\u20131884), the [[American Civil War|Civil War-era]] President of the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], supporter of President [[Abraham Lincoln]], and scion of the noted [[Robert Garrett]] banking firm in the city. In 1923, the museum's inaugural exhibition opened there with attendance topping 6,775 during its first \nweek.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://artbma.org/documents/press/BMAHistoryHighlights_1914-2014_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220235252/https://artbma.org/documents/press/BMAHistoryHighlights_1914-2014_final.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The house was offered by Miss M. Cary as a home for the \"collections\" and a meeting place for the board of trustees. The old Garrett mansion was acquired in 1925 by the group of art enthusiasts who bought the property for the purpose of keeping the museum intact. Despite having limited space, the museum offered accommodations to art associations and a hall for meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, back at [[Wyman Park]], prominent architect [[John Russell Pope]] (1874\u20131937) was engaged to design the museum's permanent home. With his years of study in Europe, Pope is considered to be the main examplar of the classical revival style that proved so popular with traditional American architects. He is credited with a number of major buildings along the American east coast and abroad, including the National Archives Building in Washington, New York's American Museum of Natural History, and the Tate Gallery Sculpture Hall in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/john-russell-pope|title=John Russell Pope Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> His distinct brand of classicism, both serene and monolithic, was perhaps the perfect choice for such an ambitious project.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid on October 20, 1927, facing the future Art Museum Drive running diagonally from North Charles Street. The systems engineering for the building's original design was completed by [[Henry Adams (mechanical engineer)|Henry Adams]], noted local mechanical engineer. The building consists of three floors and includes several rooms that were reconstructed and/or replicated from six local [[History of Maryland|Maryland]] historic houses before their loss or razing.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/features/59462,0,2882861.venue ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe building phase was marked by controversy over its location, cost, and the quality of workmanship, but on April 19, 1929, it opened on schedule without much fanfare. The first visitors were greeted by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin's]] ''[[The Thinker]]'' in the Sculpture Court, and most of the objects on display were lent by Baltimore and Maryland collectors. An average of 584 visitors attended the museum each day during its first two months.\n\nBy the 1930s, the public reception was such that director Roland McKinney, in a letter to board chairman Henry Treide, noted, \"People seem to feel that the Museum belongs to them and show that they are sincerely proud of it and its activities.\" Unfortunately, these people were mostly upper-crust, privileged, and white, a fact noted in a 1937 Carnegie Corporation report. \"[Baltimore] cultural institutions (outside of the library and the schools) have appealed to, been intended for, and been supported by a pretty small minority... they need to be opened up, for the viewpoint of the entire community and its needs\", it concluded. Local artists were feeling slighted, as well. \u201cWe, the living, resent being left to work in a vacuum of indifference and neglect while so much of the dead past is exhausted [by the BMA],\u201d the president of the Artists\u2019 Union of Baltimore complained to ''The Evening Sun'' in 1937. The writer of the letter was Morris Louis, whose work, decades later, would be in the BMA's contemporary collection. Treide responded with an extensive community outreach survey and, in 1939, presented the city's first exhibition of African-American art. The show drew over 12,000 visitors in two weeks.<ref name=\"baltimoremagazine.net\"/>\n\nMany of the objects lent to the museum when it opened were eventually donated to it. Among the donors who have shaped the museum's collection are Blanche Adler, [[Cone sisters|Dr. Claribel Cone and Etta Cone]], Jacob Epstein, Edward J. Gallagher, Jr., John W. and Robert Garrett, [[Mary Frick Jacobs]], Ryda H. and Robert H. Levi, [[Saidie May|Saidie Adler May]], Dorothy McIlvain Scott, Elsie C. Woodward, and [[Alan Wurtzburger|Alan and Janet Wurtzburger]]. The growing collection is reflected in the three major expansions: the Saidie A. May Wing in 1950, the Woodward Wing in 1956, and the Cone Wing in 1957. These additions were all designed by local architects Wrenn, Lewis and Jencks to harmonize with the original Pope Building.\n\nToday, the BMA's collection includes more than 95,000 objects, making it the largest art museum in Maryland. It is governed by a private board of trustees and receives funding from the City of Baltimore; [[Baltimore County]], [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties; the State of Maryland; various corporations and foundations; federal agencies; individual Trustees; and many private citizens. The BMA welcomes more than 200,000 visitors annually.

The architect for this phase of the renovation was the Baltimore-based architecture firm Ziger/Snead, with construction completed by Whiting-Turner Contracting Company of [[Towson, Maryland]]. The project manager was Synthesis, Inc., of [[Columbia, Maryland]]. The BMA also greatly expanded galleries for its African and Asian art collections, which opened in April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoremagazine.net/2015/4/21/bma-showcases-newly-renovated-african-and-asian-art-galleries|title=BMA showcases newly renovated African and Asian art galleries|first=Baltimore|last=magazine|date=21 April 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> The culmination of the renovation was the opening of the new $4.5 million, 5,000 sq. ft.

A large part of the collection was donated by Janet and Alan Wurtzburger in 1954. It contains more than 2,000 objects whose sources range from ancient [[Egypt]] to contemporary [[Zimbabwe]], and includes works from many other cultures, including [[Bambara people|Bamana]], [[Yoruba culture|Yoruba]], [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]], [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]]. The collection includes many different forms of art, including [[headdress]]es, [[mask]]s, [[figurine|figures]], [[royal staffs]], [[textiles]], [[jewelry]], [[ceremonial weapons]], and [[pottery]]. Several of the pieces are known for their use in royal courts, performances, and religious contexts, and many are internationally known.\n\nHighlights of the collection include works by carvers [[Zlan]] and [[Sonzanlwon]], and figures by the legendary brasscaster [[Ldamie]]. Also on display are a [[Lozi people|Lozi]] throne (c. 1900) most likely carved in the court of [[King Lewanika]] of western [[Zambia]], a 20th-century [[Hausa Koranic]] [[prayer board]], and a 2006 video work by [[Theo Eshetu]]. At least several of the masks and figurative sculptures are recognized internationally as the best of their type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/arts/bs-ae-bma-african-asian-20150425-story.html#page=1|title=Baltimore Museum of Art opens renovated African and Asian galleries|first=Mary Carole|last=McCauley|publisher=|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American art===\n\nThe BMA's American art collection includes paintings, sculptures, and decorative arts spanning from the colonial era to the late 20th century. The museum has several works of art from the Baltimore area, including portraiture by [[Charles Willson Peale]], [[Rembrandt Peale]], and other members of the Peale family; silver from Baltimore's prominent silver manufacturing company [[Samuel Kirk & Son]]; [[Baltimore album quilts]]; and painted furniture by [[John Finlay (furniture maker)|John Finlay]] and [[Hugh Finlay]] of Baltimore.\n\nThe American painting collection at the museum ranges from 18th-century portraits and 19th-century landscape painting to American Impressionism and modernism, with works by artists [[John Singleton Copley]], [[Thomas Sully]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Notable canvases include ''A Wild Scene'' (1831\u20131832) by [[Thomas Cole]], ''La Vach\u00e8re'' (1888) by [[Theodore Robinson]], and ''Pink Tulip'' (1926) by [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]. These are complemented by holdings of prints and drawings, as well as modern photographs from the Gallagher/Dalsheimer Collection. Artists represented include [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Man Ray]], [[Paul Strand]], and [[Alfred Stieglitz]].\n\nThe BMA has a long record of collecting works by [[African-American|African American]] artists that began in 1939 with one of the first exhibitions of African American art in the country. This collection has grown with the addition of works by 19th- and 20th-century African-American artists [[Joshua Johnson (painter)|Joshua Johnson]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Edmonia Lewis]], [[Horace Pippin]], and [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], as well as numerous works by contemporary artists.\n\nThe BMA's holdings of American decorative arts include an extensive furniture collection that represents the major historic cabinetmaking centers of Baltimore, [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City]], and [[Boston]]. Many of these objects came from Dorothy McIlvain Scott, a generous Baltimore philanthropist and collector.\n\nA gift in 1933 by Mrs. Miles White, Jr. of over 200 pieces of Maryland silver formed the nucleus of a silver collection that now encompasses objects by leading 18th- and early 19th-century silversmiths in Annapolis and Baltimore, as well as examples of early English silver owned by Maryland families during the Federal era. Among them is the [[Annapolis Subscription Plate]], made by Annapolis silver smith John Inch and the oldest surviving silver object made in Maryland. Later masterworks by artists from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] to [[Georg Jensen]] are also on view.\n\nOther notable aspects of the decorative arts collection include a rare set of five clerestory windows and two mosaic-clad architectural columns that represent Tiffany's contribution to 20th-century ornament. Period rooms from six historic Maryland houses, along with architectural elements from other historic buildings, illustrate town and country building styles from the 18th and 19th centuries, and miniature rooms made by Chicago miniaturist [[Eugene Kupjack]] that invite scrutiny of a variety of decorative styles at close range.\n\n===Antioch mosaics===\n\nThe BMA exhibits a collection of [[Antioch mosaics]], the result of its participation in excavations of this ancient city, known today as [[Antakya]] in southeastern [[Turkey]], near the border of [[Syria]].\n\nWith the support of BMA Trustee Robert Garrett, the Baltimore Museum of Art joined the [[Mus\u00e9es Nationaux de France]], [[Worcester Art Museum]], and [[Princeton University]] during the excavations of 1932 to 1939, discovering 300 mosaic pavements in and around the lost city. The BMA received some of the mosaics from the excavation, totaling 34 pavements, 28 of which are on display in the museum's sunlit atrium court.\n\nDiscovered in the affluent suburb of [[Daphne]] and the nearby port city of [[Seleucia Pieria]], the mosaics date from the days of the emperor [[Hadrian]] in the 2nd century A.D. to the Christian empire of [[Justinian]] in the 6th century, bridging the [[Classical world]] and the early [[Middle Ages]]. The mosaics illustrate how the classical art of [[Greece]] and [[Rome]] evolved into the art of the early Christian era, and tell the story of how people lived in this ancient city prior to its destruction by catastrophic earthquakes in 526 and 528 A.D. The mosaics are notable for their grand scale and elaborately patterned borders, and the brilliance of their decorative and naturalistic effects.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n===Art of the Ancient Americas===\n[[File:Mayan woman with child.jpg|alt=|thumb|260x260px|Ancient woman with child.

The collection includes works from 2500 BC to AD 1521. The core collection of 120 objects was given to the museum by Alan Wurtzburger in 1958, which significantly expanded the scope of the existing collection and provided momentum for a traveling exhibition of Peruvian ceramics titled ''Myths of Ancient Peru'' (1969).\n\nThe collection is particularly admired for its West [[Mexico]] ceramics, including an important Nayarit house model and an enthroned chief. Also on display is a unique assemblage of 23 figures in dance regalia which celebrates ancient performance and highlights the diversity of Colima art.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://artbma.org/collections/ancient.html|title=BMA Ancient American collection description|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOther notable pieces include a finely worked serpentine figure of [[Olmec]] mastery, elegant portrayals of Maya and Aztec noblewomen showcasing the integral roles women played in the social, political, economic, and spiritual realms of society, and miniature gold votives in the Muisca tradition.\n\n===Art of the Pacific Islands===\n[[File:New Guinea Helmet Mask.jpg|alt=|thumb|229x229px|Unidentified Abelam Artist.

Works in collection include jewelry, ornaments, and [[tapa cloths]].\n\nOf notable interest is a finely carved lizard of dark wood and shell from [[Easter Island]]; a battle pectoral created from hundreds of [[Nassa shells]], which highlights [[Middi]] art of [[New Britain]]; and an 18th-century royal [[Hawaii]]an necklace.\n\nOther highlights of the collection include a breast ornament embellished with small birds and stars that figured as insignia of prestige for the [[Tonga]] of the [[Fiji|Fiji Islands]]. Featuring whale ivory and pearl shell design, it is recognized as one of the largest of its kind.\n\n===Asian art===\n\nThe museum's [[Asian art]] collection includes works from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[Tibet]], [[Southeast Asia]], and the [[Near East]]. The collection is particularly known for its [[Chinese ceramics]], with a particular depth in mortuary wares from the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618\u2013907) and utilitarian stoneware from the 11th through the 13th centuries. Although more than 1,000 objects are comprised in this collection, because of limited space, only a portion of the pieces are on display at one time. Works are on view in rotating installations in the museum's Julius Levy Memorial Gallery.\n\nSome notable works in the collection include the life-sized early-15th-century bronze [[Guanyin]], known widely as \"Goddess of Mercy\"; the robust figure of a horse from a [[Han dynasty]] tomb; a 39-piece mortuary retinue, a rare example of the quantities of clay figures that were placed in tombs during the early Tang dynasty; and an outstanding foliate-shaped brush washer that represents the mastery of Chinese blue-and-white [[porcelain]]. Asian art is also represented in other areas of the museum's collection, including 475 Japanese prints and 1,000 textiles from across Asia.\n\n===European art===\n[[File:Anthony van Dyck Rinaldo and Armida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Sir Anthony van Dyck.

Most of the collection was formed through donations made by private citizens of the city of Baltimore, notably Mary Frick Jacobs, George A. Lucas, and Jacob Epstein. The collection contains a large selection of 19th-century French art, including more than 140 bronze animal sculptures by [[Antoine-Louis Barye]] and several paintings by [[Barbizon]] artists such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and impressionist [[Camille Pissarro]].\n\nThe collection includes a wide array of decorative arts, including jeweled snuff boxes, porcelain, and silver. The museum also exhibits a large collection of works on paper from the 15th through the 19th century.\n\nHighlights of the European art exhibit include [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Rinaldo and Armida'' (1629), which was commissioned by King [[Charles I of England]]. It is considered one of the artist's finest paintings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rinaldo and Armida |url=https://www.artble.com/artists/anthony_van_dyck/paintings/rinaldo_and_armida |website=Artble |accessdate=21 May 2019}}</ref> Other items of northern European and French art include [[Frans Hals]]' portrait ''Dorothea Berck'' (1644), [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]'s painting of his son ''Titus'' (1660), [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]]\u2019s portrayal of a lovely maiden tossing a ball in ''The Game of Knucklebones'' (c. 1734), and French court portraitist [[Louise \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun]]'s exotic ''Princess Anna Alexandrovna Galitzin'' (c. 1797). Medieval and Renaissance works include a 14th-century ''Burgundian Virgin and Child'' carved of limestone and [[Titian]]'s ''Portrait of a Gentleman'' (1561). There are also late-medieval and Renaissance paintings by Giovanni dal Ponte, Biagio D'Antonio, Sandro Botticelli and Workshop, Bernardino Luini, Francesco Ubertini, and Master of View of Saint Gudule.{{clarify|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 2012, ''[[Paysage Bords de Seine]]'', a Renoir stolen from the museum, resurfaced after being lost for 63 years. The painting then became the subject of a dramatic legal dispute involving the FBI, the woman who said she found the painting, an insurance company's rights to the artwork, and the intentions of Saidie May, an art collector who bought the painting in Paris in 1925 and lent it to the Baltimore museum. In 2014, a judge deemed it to be the property of the BMA after reviewing related documentation from its archives. At the time of the theft, Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. paid the museum about $2,500 for the loss. The company considered whether to make a claim for the painting when it resurfaced, but decided it \"belonged\" at the museum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.att.net/s/editorial.dll?fromspage=ch%2Fc.htm&categoryid=&only=y&pnum=42&bfromind=5099&eeid=10434353&_sitecat=3572&dcatid=1916&eetype=article&render=y&ac=7&ck=&ch=ne&_lid=575&_lnm=news.all.ap.articles |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923175949/http://www.att.net/s/editorial.dll?fromspage=ch%2Fc.htm&categoryid=&only=y&pnum=42&bfromind=5099&eeid=10434353&_sitecat=3572&dcatid=1916&eetype=article&render=y&ac=7&ck=&ch=ne&_lid=575&_lnm=news.all.ap.articles |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Cone Collection===\n[[File:La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue de la carri\u00e8re Bib\u00e9mus, par Paul C\u00e9zanne.jpg|left|thumb|Paul C\u00e9zanne.

BMA 1950.196|alt=]]\nBaltimore sisters Claribel and Etta Cone amassed one of the most important collections of modern art in the U.S. and gave it to the BMA in 1949. Etta Cone began the Cone Collection in 1898 with the purchase of five paintings by American Impressionist [[Theodore Robinson]] to decorate their Baltimore home. Soon after, the sisters began to make annual trips to Paris where they visited museums, salons, and the studios of emerging artists. In 1906, Etta purchased her first work by [[Henri Matisse]] during a visit with the artist arranged by [[Gertrude Stein]]\u2019s sister-in-law, [[Sarah Stein]]. The Cone sisters were among the artist's first patrons and Etta, in particular, collected works throughout his entire career. Their collection of approximately 3,000 objects included 500 works by Matisse, as well as masterworks by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], which were displayed in their Baltimore apartments prior to coming to the museum.\n\n===Contemporary art===\nThe BMA's Contemporary Wing was built and opened in 1994, closed in January 2011 for renovations, and reopened in November 2012 with new wall and floor finishes; a gallery dedicated to light, sound, and moving image-based art; a dedicated gallery for prints, drawings and photographs; and BMA Go Mobile, a mobile website guide.\n\nThe renovated wing houses a two-part architectural intervention that made the BMA the first museum in the United States to commission and acquire a site-specific installation by artist [[Sarah Oppenheimer]]. The collection features works by [[Olafur Eliasson]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Franz West]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Donald Judd]], and other eminent artists alongside new acquisitions from 21st-century artists such as [https://artbma.org/exhibitions/guyton-walker Guyton \\ Walker], [[Josephine Meckseper]], [[Sarah Sze]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]]. The works of American artist [[Bruce Nauman]], known for his work with neon lights, can be seen both in the contemporary collection and adorning the outside of the museum itself with his piece ''Violins, Violence, Silence''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.artbma.org/tag/bruce-nauman/|title=Bruce Nauman - BMA Blog|website=blog.artbma.org|accessdate=4 May 2018}}</ref> The BMA has the second largest collection of [[Andy Warhol|Andy Warhol's]] late work in the U.S.\n\nThe Contemporary Wing will be reinstalled again in summer 2019 with a new presentation of 20th- and 21st-century art that focuses on the creativity of black artists such as [[Roy DeCarava]], [[David C.
