Some Pakistani artists began experimenting with [[rap]] and [[hip hop]] as early as 1993 when [[Fakhar-e-Alam]] released his first album ''Rap Up'', where his single ''Bhangra Pao'' is commonly acknowledged as the \"first rap song in Pakistan\". In particular, the rise in popularity of [[Eminem]] in the late 1990s and [[50 Cent]] in the early 2000s influenced many of today's hip hop artists in Pakistan such as \"Party Wrecker\" (Mustafa Khan) of the Pashto rap group Fortitude, Qzer (Qasim Naqvi) and DirtJaw.<ref name=Muftah>https://muftah.org/pakistani-hip-hop/ {{unreliable?|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first Pakistani rap song was \"Bhangra Rap\" (1993) by Yatagaan ([[Fakhar-e-Alam]]), which became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horn |first1=David |last2=Laing |first2=Dave |title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 2 Locations (5 Vol Set): Volumes III to VII |date=2005 |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=9780826474360 |page=126 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShUKAQAAMAAJ |quote=The styles associated with rap, hip-hop and house all make their appearance in Pakistani popular music.

The song became a major headliner on Pakistani music charts.}}</ref> The hit 1995 song \"[[Billo De Ghar]]\" by [[Abrar-ul-Haq]] also featured rapping.\n\nHip hop and rap culture in Pakistan during the 1990s and early 2000s was mainly centered around those with a good grasp of [[English language|English]] (a socioeconomically privileged group). Pakistani hip hop and rap artists at this time were mainly underground English acts and were dismissed by the media and mainstream as \"''Eminem ki aolad''\" (Eminem's children) and \"''yo-bache''\" (yo-kids).\n\n==Genre development==\nPakistani hip hop music is still an emerging genre. Since the early 90s, hip hop music has trended slowly from underground English scenes to regional Punjabi rap in the early 2000s, before branching out into various other languages.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Punjabi rap began influencing non-Punjabi speakers to experiment with hip hop in other [[Language of Pakistan|Pakistani languages]], thus leading to new Sindhi and Pashto hip hop scenes. Urdu rap artists tried initially but failed to make a mark on the Pakistan hip hop scene. This was due to class and linguistic politics dictated in the mid-nineteenth century by the [[British Raj]], who had replaced [[Persian language|Persian]] with [[Urdu]] as the official language. Combined with Pakistan's own tendency to privilege Urdu over indigenous languages a dichotomy was created in the country whereby Urdu is associated with urbanity, power, privilege and sophistication, while other Pakistani languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi and Pashto were considered \"crass vernacularism\". Although the genre has grown considerably in recent years, it is still considered fringe and underground by the older generation who tend to stick to traditional Pakistani music or [[Pakistani pop music]].\n\n===Languages===\n====Punjabi rap====\nIn February 2006, [[Universal Music]] produced the first commercially backed album of [[Pakistani American]] rapper, [[Bohemia]]. A [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] [[Christians|Christian]], born in [[Karachi]], schooled in [[Peshawar]], and brought up in the working class minority communities of [[San Francisco]], Bohemia's music emerged from personal experiences, such as seeing his best friend murdered and several others sent to jail. ''[[Pesa Nasha Pyar]]'' (Punjabi for \"Money Drugs Love\") was Bohemia's second album and stood out as lyrically groundbreaking. With Universal's distribution network, Bohemia found a ready market among Pakistanis, both in the [[Overseas Pakistanis|diaspora]] and in Pakistan itself.\n\n====Pashto Rap====\nIn 2011, A rap group from [[Peshawar]], released a track named ''[[Pukhtoon Core]]'' by Fortitude, Which instantly became popular amongst [[Pakistanis]]. This was the first time anyone made a rap in [[Pashto]], language. Soon the band started making hits like ''No Borders'', ''Lewani'', ''Outrageous'', Alongside Rap Demon and in 2019 they finally dropped ''[[Era of Pushto]]'' which was a comeback music and it made waves across [[Tiktok]], Recently [[Fortitude Pukhtoon Core]], Released the official Anthem of [[Peshawar Zalmi]], for [[HBL PSL]], and it made an instant 2 Million views in a week. They are the most famous mainstream Pashto Rap group from [[Pakistan]].\n\n====Sindhi rap====\nThe Sindhi hip hop scene draws on a history of linguistic nationalism of Sindhis. Many Sindhi rap artists are attempting to resurrect and mainstream Sindhi culture in Pakistan using hip hop. Many Sindhi rap artists are also continuing the long Sindhi tradition of Sufi poetry, by including them into rhymes. [[Ali Gul Pir]]'s ''[[Waderai Ka Beta]]'', Meer Janweri \"''Piyar Jo Siphai''\" and are recent Sindhi rap songs that have gone mainstream and shows signs of the genre expanding beyond Punjabi.\n\n====Balochi rap====\nLyari Underground (L.U.G.) & breakout artists like Sami Amiri, Anas Baloch & Eva B are promoting the Lyari/Balochi culture through hip-hop.<ref>https://tribune.com.pk/story/1298067/baloch-rapper-anas-baloch-aims-conquer-coke-studio/</ref>\n\n====Urdu rap====\nDespite early unsuccessful acts, the Urdu rap scene genre is arguably the fastest growing in the country e.g Young Stunners , Faris Shafi , Rap Demon\n\n====Saraiki rap====\nStill very young, Saraiki hip hop scene is limited due to the fact the language is a dialect of western Punjabi lahnda but can be easily distinguished due to the poetic nature of language\n\n==Artists==\n{{main|List of Pakistani hip hop musicians}}\n\n===Urdu rappers===\nchen k\n*'''Faris shafi'''\n*'''Young Stunners'''\n**Talha Anjum\n**Talhah Yunus\n*'''Rap Demon'''\n\n===Baloch rappers===\n* Lyari Underground\n* Asif Bali\n* Sami Amiri\n\n===Punjabi rappers===\n* [[Bohemia]]\n* [[Fakhar-e-Alam]]\n* [[Young Desi]]\n* Starshah\n\n===Pashto rappers===\n* Fortitude PukhtoonCore\n**Mustafa Kamal\n\n===Sindhi rappers===\n*[[Ali Gul Pir]]\n\n===Saraiki rapper===\n* [[Mochi - Mohsin Hassan]]\n\n===Bilingual rappers===\n* [[Lazarus (rapper)|Lazarus]](English & Urdu) \n* [[Osama Com Laude]] (Urdu & English)\n* [[Adil Omar]] (English & Urdu)\n* [[Frenzo Harami]] (Punjabi & English)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Music of Pakistan]]\n* [[List of Pakistani Hip Hop Musicians]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{hiphop}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani music|Hip hop]]\n[[Category:Pakistani hip hop]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n{{POV|date=January 2020}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox music genre\n| name = {{Flagicon|Pakistan}} Pakistani hip hop music\n| color = white\n| bgcolor = darkblue\n| stylistic_origins = {{flatlist|\n*[[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]\n*[[Pakistani music]]\n*[[Urdu]]\n}}\n| cultural_origins = Early 1990s\n| instruments = [[Rapping|Vocals]] \u2013 [[Turntablism|turntables]] \u2013 [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]\n| popularity = Underground\n| derivatives = \n| subgenrelist = Second Languages\n| subgenres = Punjabi Rap, Sindhi Rap, Pashto Rap, Balochi Rap\n| other_topics = [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]]\n}}\n\n{{Music of Pakistan}}\n \n'''Pakistani hip hop''' is a music genre in Pakistan influenced heavily from merging [[American hip hop]] style beats with [[Pakistani poetry]].<ref>https://muftah.org/pakistani-hip-hop/</ref> The genre was initially dominated in [[English language|English]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], but in recent years has expanded to [[Urdu]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Pashto]], and [[Balochi language|Balochi]].<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2012/05/23/in-pakistan-adil-omar-breaks-new-ground-in-hip-hop/ A Pakistani Rapper Breaks New Ground] ''The Wall Street Journal''</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe contemporary hip hop and rap movement in Pakistan grew out of the globalization of [[American hip hop]] in the early 1990s.

As of 2019, the band consists of lead vocalist [[Michael Tait]] (formerly of [[DC Talk]]), drummer and percussionist Duncan Phillips, keyboardist and bassist Jeff Frankenstein, and guitarist Jody Davis. In addition to performing music, the band has appeared in the films ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]],'' ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', and ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nThe band was formed in [[Mooloolaba]], Queensland, Australia in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribdem.com/features/christian-bands-to-rock-war-memorial-in-big-church-night/article_94aa0fdc-d69c-11e7-aa12-672f9a34a19a.html|title=Christian bands to rock War Memorial in Big Church Night Out|first=KELLY URBAN|last=KURBAN@TRIBDEM.COM|website=The Tribune-Democrat|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> by two young men: [[Peter Furler]] and his school mate George Perdikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/21/i-co-founded-one-of-the-most-popular-christian-rock-bands-ever-and-im-now-an-atheist/|title=I Co-Founded One of the Most Popular Christian Rock Bands Ever\u2026 and I'm Now An Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/newsboys-co-founder-im-now-an-atheist-richard-dawkins-had-an-influence-on-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=Newsboys Co-Founder: I'm Now an Atheist, Richard Dawkins' Had an Influence on My Spiritual Journey|website=The Christian Post|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> Furler and Perdikis practised in a garage in on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a \"surfer's paradise\". Two other teens were added soon after: Furler's best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. The band's original name was ''The News''. They changed it to The Newsboys to avoid conflict with the US-based band ''[[Huey Lewis and the News]]''. The band came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album ''Read All About It'' in 1988 in the United States.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: ''[[Hell Is for Wimps]]'' and ''[[Boys Will Be Boyz]]'', with its first self-titled video. None of the band's first three albums garnered much attention, and the band's line-up changed with every release.\n\nIt wasn't until their 1992 album, ''[[Not Ashamed]]'' (containing a cover of the [[DeGarmo & Key]] song \"Boycott Hell\"), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. [[Steve Taylor]], a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band's record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band's primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James' departure.\n\nIn 1994, amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released ''[[Going Public (Newsboys album)|Going Public]]'', their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 [[Dove Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 1995 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020023036/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> It also produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Spirit Thing\", \"Real Good Thing\", \"Truth and Consequences\", and, most notably, \"[[Shine (Newsboys song)|Shine]]\". \"Shine\" won the 1995 Dove for \"Rock Recorded Song of the Year\". In 2006, [[CCM Magazine]] listed \"Shine\" in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music.\n\nThe 1996 follow-up album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist [[Phil Joel]] and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Reality\", \"Let It Go\", and the title track, two rock No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Cup O' Tea\" and \"Breathe\", as well as fan favourite and concert staple \"Breakfast\". This album also won the group's third Dove, this time for \"Recorded Music Packaging of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 1997 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022843/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> This album spawned the Newsboys' first movie, ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'' (1996), which was based on the song \"Reality\".\n\nIn late 1997, James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007, he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/print.php?Article_ID=25790 |title=John James: The Newsboys Ex-lead Singer Speaks About His Fall And Restoration |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band's line-up of Furler, bassist [[Phil Joel]], guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and Phillips stayed constant.\n\nThe first post-James record, ''[[Step Up to the Microphone]]'', sold well and produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Entertaining Angels\", \"WooHoo\", \"Believe\", and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys' live video, \"Live One Night In Pennsylvania\" a year later. \"Entertaining Angels\" won the 1999 Dove for \"Short Form Music Video of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 1999 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe band returned in 1999 with ''[[Love Liberty Disco]]'', the band's only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No.&nbsp;1 hits \"Beautiful Sound\" and \"Good Stuff\", as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album.

That same year, Newsboys released a greatest hits compilation, ''[[Shine: The Hits]]'', which did not include any songs from the ''Love Liberty Disco'' album, but included four new songs, two of which (\"Joy\" and \"Who?\") went to No.&nbsp;1. After this album, the band did not release any new material until the 2002 release of ''[[Thrive (Newsboys album)|Thrive]]'', a record that produced two No.&nbsp;1 singles: \"Million Pieces (Kissin' Your Cares Goodbye)\" and the praise and worship-driven \"It Is You\", which proved to be the biggest hit of their career up to that point also with its video, ''Thrive: From The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame''. Also in 2002, The Newsboys recorded the track \"In the Belly of the Whale\" for the end credits of the 2002 movie ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''.\n\nAfter the success of \"It Is You\", the Newsboys then followed with two praise and worship albums: ''[[Adoration: The Worship Album]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Devotion (Newsboys album)|Devotion]]'' in 2004. Late in 2003, Davis departed and was replaced by [[Bryan Olesen]] on guitar.

On 31 October 2006, The Newsboys released a pop/rock record entitled ''[[Go (Newsboys album)|GO]]''.

The band has released 17 studio albums, 6 of which have been certified gold. As of 2019, the band consists of lead vocalist [[Michael Tait]] (formerly of [[DC Talk]]), drummer and percussionist Duncan Phillips, keyboardist and bassist Jeff Frankenstein, and guitarist Jody Davis. In addition to performing music, the band has appeared in the films ''[[God's Not Dead (film)|God's Not Dead]],'' ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', and ''[[God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1980s ===\n\nThe band was formed in [[Mooloolaba]], Queensland, Australia in 1985<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribdem.com/features/christian-bands-to-rock-war-memorial-in-big-church-night/article_94aa0fdc-d69c-11e7-aa12-672f9a34a19a.html|title=Christian bands to rock War Memorial in Big Church Night Out|first=KELLY URBAN|last=KURBAN@TRIBDEM.COM|website=The Tribune-Democrat|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> by two young men: [[Peter Furler]] and his school mate George Perdikis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2015/01/21/i-co-founded-one-of-the-most-popular-christian-rock-bands-ever-and-im-now-an-atheist/|title=I Co-Founded One of the Most Popular Christian Rock Bands Ever\u2026 and I'm Now An Atheist|work=Friendly Atheist}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/newsboys-co-founder-im-now-an-atheist-richard-dawkins-had-an-influence-on-my-spiritual-journey.html|title=Newsboys Co-Founder: I'm Now an Atheist, Richard Dawkins' Had an Influence on My Spiritual Journey|website=The Christian Post|accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> Furler and Perdikis practised in a garage in on the Sunshine Coast, well known for being a \"surfer's paradise\". Two other teens were added soon after: Furler's best friend, John James, and bassist Sean Taylor. The band's original name was ''The News''. They changed it to The Newsboys to avoid conflict with the US-based band ''[[Huey Lewis and the News]]''. The band came to the United States in late 1987 after getting signed with Refuge Communications and released the album ''Read All About It'' in 1988 in the United States.\n\n=== 1990s ===\n\nAfter signing with Star Song Communications, they released two more albums in 1990 and 1991: ''[[Hell Is for Wimps]]'' and ''[[Boys Will Be Boyz]]'', with its first self-titled video. None of the band's first three albums garnered much attention, and the band's line-up changed with every release.\n\nIt wasn't until their 1992 album, ''[[Not Ashamed]]'' (containing a cover of the [[DeGarmo & Key]] song \"Boycott Hell\"), that the band gained notice in the Christian music scene with its second self-titled video that followed a year later. [[Steve Taylor]], a singer-songwriter and producer, began a partnership with the band, producing the band's record and writing most of the lyrics for their songs. Furler remained the band's primary songwriter and beginning with this album began sharing lead vocal duties with James and continued to do so until James' departure.\n\nIn 1994, amidst continued line-up changes (which included the addition of mainstays Jody Davis and Duncan Phillips), the band released ''[[Going Public (Newsboys album)|Going Public]]'', their fifth album and first real success. The record proved to be a watershed for the group, winning a 1995 [[Dove Award]] for \"Rock Album of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 1995 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020023036/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1995 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> It also produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Spirit Thing\", \"Real Good Thing\", \"Truth and Consequences\", and, most notably, \"[[Shine (Newsboys song)|Shine]]\". \"Shine\" won the 1995 Dove for \"Rock Recorded Song of the Year\". In 2006, [[CCM Magazine]] listed \"Shine\" in the top 10 in its ranking of the 100 Greatest Songs in Christian music.\n\nThe 1996 follow-up album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (Newsboys album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'' was recorded with an expanded line up with new additions bassist [[Phil Joel]] and keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein. The album produced three more pop No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Reality\", \"Let It Go\", and the title track, two rock No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Cup O' Tea\" and \"Breathe\", as well as fan favourite and concert staple \"Breakfast\". This album also won the group's third Dove, this time for \"Recorded Music Packaging of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 1997 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022843/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1997 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref> This album spawned the Newsboys' first movie, ''[[Down Under the Big Top]]'' (1996), which was based on the song \"Reality\".\n\nIn late 1997, James announced he would be leaving the band to start a preaching ministry. In 2007, he revealed the actual reason was due to a drug and alcohol addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/print.php?Article_ID=25790 |title=John James: The Newsboys Ex-lead Singer Speaks About His Fall And Restoration |publisher=Crossrhythms.co.uk |date=26 January 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> With his departure, Furler moved from drums to vocals and auditions were held for the now-vacant drum position. Eventually, Duncan Phillips, who had previously played keyboards and percussion for the band moved over to the drum kit. From 1998 to 2003, the band's line-up of Furler, bassist [[Phil Joel]], guitarist Jody Davis, keyboardist Jeff Frankenstein, and Phillips stayed constant.\n\nThe first post-James record, ''[[Step Up to the Microphone]]'', sold well and produced four No.&nbsp;1 hits: \"Entertaining Angels\", \"WooHoo\", \"Believe\", and the title track. It also spawned the Newsboys' live video, \"Live One Night In Pennsylvania\" a year later. \"Entertaining Angels\" won the 1999 Dove for \"Short Form Music Video of the Year\".<ref>[http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 1999 Dove Awards] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020022952/http://www.doveawards.com/history/browse.cfm?year=1999 |date=20 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe band returned in 1999 with ''[[Love Liberty Disco]]'', the band's only album to significantly deviate from their pop rock sound. Instead, this particular album featured more of a disco sound. Still, it produced several hits, including the No.&nbsp;1 hits \"Beautiful Sound\" and \"Good Stuff\", as well as the title track. The LLD tour was significantly more popular than the album. This tour featured an inflatable arena, called the Air Dome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/newsboys/features/newsboys-love-libery-disco-tour-the-stats/ |title=Newsboys' Love Libery Disco Tour: The Stats |publisher=Today's Christian Music |accessdate=27 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, [[Peter Furler|Furler]] co-founded [[Inpop Records]] with Wes Campbell as an independent contemporary Christian music record label.\n\n=== 2000s ===\n[[File:Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering.jpg|thumb|Newsboys at the 2001 National Lutheran Youth Gathering, with Phil Joel in the foreground]]\nIn 2000, Newsboys headlined the annual, travelling [[Contemporary Christian Music|CCM]] concert, Festival Con Dios, with [[Audio Adrenaline]] and [[The O.C. Supertones]]. That same year, Newsboys released a greatest hits compilation, ''[[Shine: The Hits]]'', which did not include any songs from the ''Love Liberty Disco'' album, but included four new songs, two of which (\"Joy\" and \"Who?\") went to No.&nbsp;1. After this album, the band did not release any new material until the 2002 release of ''[[Thrive (Newsboys album)|Thrive]]'', a record that produced two No.&nbsp;1 singles: \"Million Pieces (Kissin' Your Cares Goodbye)\" and the praise and worship-driven \"It Is You\", which proved to be the biggest hit of their career up to that point also with its video, ''Thrive: From The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame''. Also in 2002, The Newsboys recorded the track \"In the Belly of the Whale\" for the end credits of the 2002 movie ''[[Jonah: A VeggieTales Movie]]''.\n\nAfter the success of \"It Is You\", the Newsboys then followed with two praise and worship albums: ''[[Adoration: The Worship Album]]'' in 2003 and ''[[Devotion (Newsboys album)|Devotion]]'' in 2004. Late in 2003, Davis departed and was replaced by [[Bryan Olesen]] on guitar. In 2005, The Newsboys co-authored a book of devotions with Jim Laffoon entitled ''Our Daily Blog'' which was published by Inspiro and released on 1 November.<ref>{{cite book|title=Our Daily Blog: Devotions by Pastor Jim Laffoon: Books: Jim Laffoon, Newsboys |date= |id={{ASIN|0310811694|country=uk}} }}</ref> They also recorded their Creation 2005 set for a live DVD to be released with their upcoming album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 2006, Oleson left the band to focus on his own band [[VOTA|Casting Pearls]] and was replaced by [[Paul Colman]], formerly of [[Paul Colman Trio]].\n\nMore radio hits came in 2006 with a live version of \"I Am Free\" (originally written by Jon Egan of the [[Desperation Band]]), and \"Wherever We Go\". On 31 October 2006, The Newsboys released a pop/rock record entitled ''[[Go (Newsboys album)|GO]]''.

It also began to regularly feature pictorials of [[female]] models [[Urolagnia|urinating]], which, until then, had been considered a defining limit of illegal obscenity as distinguished from legal pornography.\n\nA different approach to restoring sales was attempted by the UK version of the magazine in 1997. Under the editorship of [[Tom Hilditch]], the magazine was rebranded as PH.UK and relaunched as middle-shelf \"adult magazine for grown-ups\". Fashion photographers (such as [[Corinne Day]] of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine) were hired to produce images that merged sex and fashion. The magazine's editorial content included celebrity interviews and tackled issues of sexual politics. The experiment attracted a great deal of press interest, but failed to generate a significant increase in sales. PH.UK closed in late 1998.\n\nThe new owners significantly softened the content of the magazine starting with the January 2005 issue. ''Penthouse'' no longer showed male genitalia, real or simulated male-female sex, or any form of explicit hardcore content (it does still feature female-female simulated sex on occasion, however).  While this change allowed the return of a limited number of mainstream advertisers to the magazine, it has not significantly raised the number of subscribers; total circulation is still below 350,000.<ref>Latest figures from the Audited Bureau of Circulation</ref>\n\nSome of ''Penthouse''{{-'}}s secondary publications, such as ''Girls of Penthouse'', continue to feature occasional images of explicit sex, either classic sets from the 1990s issues or stills of adult video shoots staged by the company's Digital Media division.\n\n==Other ventures==\n\n===Film===\nIn 1976, Guccione used about [[United States dollar|US]] $17.5 million of his personal fortune to finance the controversial [[historical film|historical epic]] [[pornographic film]] ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]''<!-- Proper principal title, check IMDb for confirmation. -->, with [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the [[Caligula|title role]] and a supporting cast including [[Helen Mirren]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Teresa Ann Savoy]], and [[Peter O'Toole]]. The film, which was eventually released in late 1979, was produced in Italy (made at the Dear Studios in Rome) and was directed by [[Tinto Brass]]. In 2001, ''Penthouse Presents'' began running on [[Hot Choice]].\n\n===Other publications===\nGuccione also created the magazines  ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', ''[[Viva (magazine)|Viva]]'', and ''Longevity''.<ref name = Observer/> Later Guccione started ''[[Penthouse Forum]]'', which predominantly featured erotic writing and stories. In 1993, ''Penthouse'' published an adult [[comic book]] spin-off entitled ''[[Penthouse Comix]]'', featuring sexually explicit stories. After an initial success, ''Penthouse Comix'' expanded into a line of four illustrated magazines with the addition of ''Penthouse Max'', ''Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix'' and ''Omni Comix''.\n\n''Penthouse Variations'' is a monthly magazine containing ostensibly reader-generated [[erotic stories]] (primarily) and some pictures and reviews. It is a spin-off magazine from ''Penthouse Letters''.

The article indicated that the [[La Costa Resort and Spa]] in [[Carlsbad, California]] was developed by [[Mervyn Adelson]] and [[Irwin Molasky]] using loans from the [[Teamsters]] Pension Fund and that the resort was a playground for organized crime figures.  The owners, along with two officials of the resort, Morris B. [[Moe Dalitz]] and Allard Roen, filed a libel lawsuit for $522 million against the magazine and the writers. In 1982, a jury absolved the magazine of any liability against the lawsuit from the owners. The plaintiffs appealed, but in December 1985, before a new trial could begin, the two sides settled. ''Penthouse'' issued a statement that they did not mean to imply that Adelson and Molaskey are or were members of organized crime. In turn the plaintiffs issued a statement lauding ''Penthouse'' publisher Guccione and his magazine for their \"personal and professional awards\". Total litigation costs were estimated to exceed $20 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-23/local/me-8091_1_la-costa |title=Court Revives La Costa Spa's Penthouse Suit |first=Myrna |last=Oliver |date=May 23, 1985 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-21/local/me-3043_1_la-costa-resort-owners |title=Penthouse, Resort End Legal Battle in a Draw |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Armando |last=Acuna |date=December 21, 1985 |accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Guccione v.

It also began to regularly feature pictorials of [[female]] models [[Urolagnia|urinating]], which, until then, had been considered a defining limit of illegal obscenity as distinguished from legal pornography.\n\nA different approach to restoring sales was attempted by the UK version of the magazine in 1997. Under the editorship of [[Tom Hilditch]], the magazine was rebranded as PH.UK and relaunched as middle-shelf \"adult magazine for grown-ups\". Fashion photographers (such as Corinne Day of ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine) were hired to produce images that merged sex and fashion. The magazine's editorial content included celebrity interviews and tackled issues of sexual politics. The experiment attracted a great deal of press interest, but failed to generate a significant increase in sales. PH.UK closed in late 1998.\n\nThe new owners significantly softened the content of the magazine starting with the January 2005 issue. ''Penthouse'' no longer showed male genitalia, real or simulated male-female sex, or any form of explicit hardcore content (it does still feature female-female simulated sex on occasion, however).  While this change allowed the return of a limited number of mainstream advertisers to the magazine, it has not significantly raised the number of subscribers; total circulation is still below 350,000.<ref>Latest figures from the Audited Bureau of Circulation</ref>\n\nSome of ''Penthouse''{{-'}}s secondary publications, such as ''Girls of Penthouse'', continue to feature occasional images of explicit sex, either classic sets from the 1990s issues or stills of adult video shoots staged by the company's Digital Media division.\n\n==Other ventures==\n\n===Film===\nIn 1976, Guccione used about [[United States dollar|US]] $17.5 million of his personal fortune to finance the controversial [[historical film|historical epic]] [[pornographic film]] ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]''<!-- Proper principal title, check IMDb for confirmation. -->, with [[Malcolm McDowell]] in the [[Caligula|title role]] and a supporting cast including [[Helen Mirren]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Teresa Ann Savoy]], and [[Peter O'Toole]].

In 1993, ''Penthouse'' published an adult [[comic book]] spin-off entitled ''[[Penthouse Comix]]'', featuring sexually explicit stories. After an initial success, ''Penthouse Comix'' expanded into a line of four illustrated magazines with the addition of ''Penthouse Max'', ''Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix'' and ''Omni Comix''.\n\n''Penthouse Variations'' is a monthly magazine containing ostensibly reader-generated [[erotic stories]] (primarily) and some pictures and reviews.

The article indicated that the [[La Costa Resort and Spa]] in [[Carlsbad, California]] was developed by [[Mervyn Adelson]] and [[Irwin Molasky]] using loans from the [[Teamsters]] Pension Fund and that the resort was a playground for organized crime figures.  The owners, along with two officials of the resort, Morris B. [[Moe Dalitz]] and Allard Roen, filed a libel lawsuit for $522 million against the magazine and the writers. In 1982, a jury absolved the magazine of any liability against the lawsuit from the owners. The plaintiffs appealed, but in December 1985, before a new trial could begin, the two sides settled. ''Penthouse'' issued a statement that they did not mean to imply that Adelson and Molaskey are or were members of organized crime. In turn the plaintiffs issued a statement lauding ''Penthouse'' publisher Guccione and his magazine for their \"personal and professional awards\". Total litigation costs were estimated to exceed $20 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-23/local/me-8091_1_la-costa |title=Court Revives La Costa Spa's Penthouse Suit |first=Myrna |last=Oliver |date=May 23, 1985 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-21/local/me-3043_1_la-costa-resort-owners |title=Penthouse, Resort End Legal Battle in a Draw |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Armando |last=Acuna |date=December 21, 1985 |accessdate=August 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===''Guccione v.

In late 1985 the group began to focus on the printer of ''Penthouse'', [[Meredith Corporation]]. They bought shares in the company and attended their annual stockholder's meeting.
