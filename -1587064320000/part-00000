They used it as a fishing camp for the summer period, and called it by several different names: Klawerak, Tlevak, Clevak, and Klawak. The name \"Klawock\" is derived from the [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] name {{lang|tli|\u026cawa:k}}, a subgroup of the Tlingit nation. In 1853 a Russian navigator referred to the village as \"Klyakkhan\", and in 1855 as \"Thlewakh\".<ref name=\"Bright2004\">{{cite book|last=Bright|first=William|authorlink=William Bright|title=Native American Placenames of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&pg=PA229|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4|page=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, European Americans opened a [[trading post]] and a [[salmon]] saltery; some years later, in 1878, a San Francisco firm opened the first cannery in Alaska. In the following decades, several others were established. A United States [[post office]] was established in 1882. The 1890 census recorded the town's population as 260.\n\nThe [[Alaska Native Brotherhood]] (ANB) and [[Alaska Native Sisterhood]] (ANS), nonprofit organizations working for civil rights of [[Alaska Natives]], were established by residents in 1912. Its founders and many volunteers built the Town Hall and a community center in 1939, during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nIn 1929 the town incorporated as a city, and in 1934 [[United States Congress|Congress]] awarded federal funding for the expansion of the cannery, on the condition that the community remain liquor-free. At the same time, the Klawock Cooperative Association (a nonprofit organization) was formed to manage the cannery.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Frank Peratrovich]], then-mayor of Klawock and later president of the ANB, became one of the 55 delegates to the [[Alaska Constitution]]al Convention in 1955.\n* Both he and his wife{{Dubious|date=November 2013|reason=She was actually married to Roy Peratrovich, Frank's brother}} [[Elizabeth Peratrovich]], president of the [[Alaska Native Sisterhood]] (ANS), worked in the 1940s on anti-discrimination legislation.

Census Area]], in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]], on the west coast of [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]], on [[Klawock Inlet]], across from [[Klawock Island]].  The population was 755 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], down from 854 in 2000.\n\nIt is {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Ketchikan, Alaska|Ketchikan]], 11&nbsp;km (seven mi) from [[Craig, Alaska|Craig]], and {{convert|39|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Hollis, Alaska|Hollis]].\n\n==History==\nKlawock's first settlers were [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] who came from the northern winter village of Tuxekan. They used it as a fishing camp for the summer period, and called it by several different names: Klawerak, Tlevak, Clevak, and Klawak. The name \"Klawock\" is derived from the [[Tlingit language|Tlingit]] name ''\u026cawa:k'', a subgroup of the Tlingit nation. In 1853 a Russian navigator referred to the village as \"Klyakkhan\", and in 1855 as \"Thlewakh\".<ref name=\"Bright2004\">{{cite book|last=Bright|first=William|authorlink=William Bright|title=Native American Placenames of the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&pg=PA229|accessdate=12 June 2013|year=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4|page=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1868, European Americans opened a [[trading post]] and a [[salmon]] saltery; some years later, in 1878, a San Francisco firm opened the first cannery in Alaska. In the following decades, several others were established. A United States [[post office]] was established in 1882. The 1890 census recorded the town's population as 260.\n\nThe [[Alaska Native Brotherhood]] (ANB) and [[Alaska Native Sisterhood]] (ANS), nonprofit organizations working for civil rights of [[Alaska Natives]], were established by residents in 1912. Its founders and many volunteers built the Town Hall and a community center in 1939, during the [[Great Depression]].\n\nIn 1929 the town incorporated as a city, and in 1934 [[United States Congress|Congress]] awarded federal funding for the expansion of the cannery, on the condition that the community remain liquor-free. At the same time, the Klawock Cooperative Association (a nonprofit organization) was formed to manage the cannery.\n\n==Notable people==\n* [[Frank Peratrovich]], then-mayor of Klawock and later president of the ANB, became one of the 55 delegates to the [[Alaska Constitution]]al Convention in 1955.\n* Both he and his wife{{Dubious|date=November 2013|reason=She was actually married to Roy Peratrovich, Frank's brother}} [[Elizabeth Peratrovich]], president of the [[Alaska Native Sisterhood]] (ANS), worked in the 1940s on anti-discrimination legislation.  She is credited with gaining Senate approval in 1945 due to her passionate testimony about the effects of discrimination. The state has recognized her contribution, naming February 16 and Gallery B of the State Capitol in her honor.\n\n==Geography==\nKlawock is located at {{coord|55|33|18|N|133|5|7|W|type:city}} (55.554961, -133.085139).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|0.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it (34.83%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\nKlawock has a warm summer [[humid continental climate|humid continental]]/[[oceanic climate]]. \nAverage temperature in January is 1.9&nbsp;\u00b0C (35.5&nbsp;\u00b0F), and 13.8&nbsp;\u00b0C (57.5&nbsp;\u00b0F) in July; yearly [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is 234&nbsp;cm (92.4&nbsp;in).\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Klawock, Alaska (averages from 1981-2010)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 40\n|Feb high F = 42\n|Mar high F = 45\n|Apr high F = 51\n|May high F = 56\n|Jun high F = 61\n|Jul high F = 64\n|Aug high F = 65\n|Sep high F = 60\n|Oct high F = 52\n|Nov high F = 43\n|Dec high F = 41\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 31\n|Feb low F = 31\n|Mar low F = 32\n|Apr low F = 36\n|May low F = 41\n|Jun low F = 47\n|Jul low F = 51\n|Aug low F = 51\n|Sep low F = 46\n|Oct low F = 40\n|Nov low F = 34\n|Dec low F = 32\n|year low F =\n|source 1 = https://www.weatherforyou.com/reports/index.php?forecast=pass&pass=normals&zipcode=99925&place=klawock&state=ak&country=us&hwvRMon=Jan\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 27\n|1890= 287\n|1900= 131\n|1910= 241\n|1920= 19\n|1930= 437\n|1940= 455\n|1950= 404\n|1960= 251\n|1970= 213\n|1980= 318\n|1990= 722\n|2000= 854\n|2010= 755\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=815\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nKlawock first appeared on the 1880 U.S. Census as the unincorporated Tlingit village of \"Klawak.\" It continued to report as Klawak in 1890\u20131910, with the alternative spelling of \"Klawock\" first appearing in the latter census.

The city also sponsors a summer festival, the \"Celebration by the Sea.\"\n\nA Totem Park has 21 [[totem pole]]s, one of the largest collections in Alaska: it displays original and replica totems from the old village of ''Tuxekan''.
