The movement emerged in the [[Progressive Era]] along with calls for [[Temperance movement|temperance]], women's education, [[suffrage]] and moral purity. Dress reform called for emancipation from the \"dictates of fashion\", expressed a desire to \u201ccover the limbs as well as the torso adequately,\u201d and promoted \"rational dress\".<ref>\u201cFashion, Emancipation, Reform and the Rational Undergarment\u201d Deborah Jean Waugh \u2018Dress\u2019 Vol 4, 1978\"</ref> The movement had its greatest success in the reform of women's [[undergarment]]s, which could be modified without exposing the wearer to social ridicule. Dress reformers were also influential in persuading women to adopt simplified garments for athletic activities such as bicycling or swimming. The movement was much less concerned with men's clothing, although it initiated the widespread adoption of knitted wool [[union suit]]s or [[long underwear|long johns]].\n\nSome proponents of the movement established '''dress reform parlors''', or storefronts, where women could buy sewing patterns for the garments, or buy them directly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bryan|first1=C.W.|title=Good Housekeeping, Vols. 5-6|date=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xNIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA410}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Downtown Walk|url=http://bwht.org/downtown/#8|website=[[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]]}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of tightlacing ==\n\nFashion in the 1850s through 1880s accented large [[crinoline]]s, cumbersome [[bustle]]s and padded busts with tiny waists laced into \u2018steam-moulded corsetry\u2019.<ref name=\"auto1\">Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986) p. 134</ref> \u2018[[Tight-lacing]]\u2019 became part of the [[corset controversy]]: dress reformists claimed that the corset was prompted by vanity and foolishness, and harmful to health.

Skirts weighed from the hips, high collars chaffed the neck, and the whole costume prevented natural movement, harmed internal organs and threatened childbearing potential.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> Invariably, the ideal image of feminine attractiveness that a Victorian woman saw around her (in fashion plates, advertisements, etc.) was of a wasp-waisted, firmly-corseted lady.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== \"Emancipation waists\" and undergarment reform ==\n\n[[Image:Reformkleidung ausFigaro illustre1891.gif|thumb|An attempt at dress reform in 1891, but keeping a fashionable silhouette.]]\n[[Image:Fig12Femme normale avec le corsetGaches-Sarraute.jpg|thumb|left|{{ill|In\u00e8s Gaches-Sarraute|fr}} in her (not fashionable) reform corset from about 1892.

The emancipation bodice was a tight sleeveless vest, buttoning up the front, with rows of buttons along the bottom to which could be attached [[petticoat]]s and a skirt. The entire torso would support the weight of the petticoats and skirt, not just the waist (since the undesirability of hanging the entire weight of full skirts and petticoats from a constricted waist\u2014rather than hanging the garments from the shoulders\u2014was another point often discussed by dress reformers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiana.org/view/91023/0008|title=Woman's dress, a question of the day|work=Early Canadiana Online|date=|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> The bodices had to be fitted by a [[dressmaker]]; patterns could be ordered through the mail. Physician [[Alice Bunker Stockham]] railed against the [[corset]] and said of the pregnancy corset, \"The Best pregnancy corset is no corset at all.\"<ref>Alice Bunker Stockham. '''Tokology''' 1898.</ref>  The \"emancipation union under flannel\" was first sold in America in 1868. It combined a waist (shirt) and drawers (leggings) in the form we now know as the [[union suit]]. While first designed for women, the union suit was also adopted by men. Indeed, it is still sold and worn today, by both men and women, as winter underclothing\n\nIn 1878, a German professor named [[Gustav J\u00e4ger (naturalist)|Gustav Jaeger]] published a book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaeger's Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted wool union suits. These were soon called \"Jaegers\"; they were widely popular.\n\nIt is not clear how many women, in either [[the Americas]] or on [[Europe|the Continent]], wore these so-called  \"reform\" bodices.  However, contemporary [[portrait photography]], [[fashion]] [[magazine|literature]], and surviving examples of the undergarments themselves, all suggest that the corset was almost universal as daily wear by women and young ladies (and numerous [[dandy|fashionable men]]) throughout much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n==Bloomer suit ==\n{{main|Bloomers (clothing)}}\n[[Image:Bloomers.jpg|right|thumb|Bloomer Suit]]\n\nThe most famous product of the dress reform era is the [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] suit. In 1851, a New England [[Temperance movement|temperance activist]] named [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]] (Libby Miller) adopted what she considered a more rational costume: loose trousers gathered at the ankles, like the trousers worn by Middle Eastern and Central Asian women, topped by a short dress or skirt and vest (waistcoat). She displayed her new clothing to temperance activist and [[suffragist]] [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who found it sensible and becoming, and adopted it immediately. In this garb, she visited yet another activist, [[Amelia Bloomer]], the editor of the temperance magazine ''[[The Lily (newspaper)| The Lily]]''. Bloomer not only wore the costume, she promoted it enthusiastically in her magazine. More women wore the fashion and were promptly dubbed \"Bloomers\". They put up a fight for a few years, but were subjected to ridicule in the press<ref>''The New York Times'', October 5, 1851: 'Bloomerism in London:...One journal hints very ill-naturedly that the new dress is best adapted for a particular class of \"ladies\", who, poor things, having a deal of \"street-walking\", would find the Bloomer costume quite a blessing..'</ref><ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, Aug 20, 1851; pg. 5; Issue 20885; col A:  \u2018DEBUT OF THE \u201cBLOOMER\u201d COSTUME IN BELFAST:...Three ladies... made their appearance in full \u201cBloomer\u201d costume...Others, and these most numerous, expressed an opinion the reverse of complimentary to the rank and character of the ladies, identifying them with persons whose overdressed gaiety of appearance in public stamps the class to which they belong.\u2019</ref> and harassment on the street.<ref>The Times, Thursday, Aug 28, 1851; pg. 7; Issue 20892; col B: (A report from the ''Caledonian Mercury'' of two women appearing in Edinburgh in reformed dress)'BLOOMERISM IN EDINBURGH:...The singular spectacle thus presented attracted considerable attention even in the retired quarter of the town where it was witnessed, and comments, characterized by freedom more than politeness, were now and again made by urchins who followed the unblushing Bloomers...we learn that the ladies are Americans;...\u2019</ref> The more conservative of society protested that women had \u2018lost the mystery and attractiveness as they discarded their flowing robes.\u201d<ref>\"Women's Clothes and Women's Right\", Robert E. Riegel,  American Quarterly, 15 (1963):393</ref>\n\nAmelia Bloomer herself dropped the fashion in 1859, saying that a new invention, the [[crinoline]], was a sufficient reform that she could return to conventional dress. The bloomer costume died\u2014temporarily. It was to return much later (in a different form), as a women's athletic costume in the 1890s and early 1900s.\n\n== Aesthetic Dress movement ==\n{{main|Artistic Dress movement}}\n\nIn the 1870s, a largely English movement led by [[Mary Eliza Haweis]] sought dress reform to enhance and celebrate the natural shape of the body, preferring the looser lines of the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] eras.  A historic nostalgia for more forgiving fashions, the aesthetic dress movement critiqued fashionable dress for its immovable shapes, and sought the \u2018fashioning and adorning of a robe\u2019 as tastefully complementary to the natural body.<ref>Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986): 139</ref>\n\nThe [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and other artistic reformers objected to the elaborately [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] confections of Victorian fashion with their unnatural silhouette based on a rigid [[corset]] and hoops as both ugly and dishonest. Some women associated with the movement adopted a revival style based on romanticised [[medieval]] influences such as puffed [[sleeve|juliette sleeves]] and trailing skirts. These styles were made in the soft colors of vegetable [[dye]]s, ornamented with hand [[embroidery]] in the [[art needlework]] style, featured silks, [[oriental]] designs, muted colors, natural and frizzed hair and lacked definitive waist emphasis.<ref>The Visual History of Costume. Aileen Ribeiro and Valerie Cumming, (Costume & Fashion Press, New York, 1989):188</ref>\n\nThe style spread as an \"anti-fashion\" called [[Artistic Dress movement|Artistic dress]] in the 1860s in literary and artistic circles, died back in the [[1870s in fashion|1870s]], and reemerged as ''Aesthetic dress'' in the [[1880s in fashion|1880s]], where the emphasis was not so much on honesty and purity as sensuality and languor.\n\n==Eventual shifts in fashion==\n\nAlthough the Victorian dress reform movement itself failed to enact widespread [[Women's Suffrage and Western Women's Fashion through the early 1900's|change in women\u2019s fashion]], social, political and cultural shifts into the 1920s brought forth an organic relaxation of dress standards.<ref name=\"auto\">\u201cWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,\u201d Robert E. Riegel,  American Quarterly, 15 (1963): 399</ref>\n\nWith new opportunities for [[women's college]], the national [[suffrage]] amendment of 1920 and women\u2019s increased public career options during and after [[World War I]], fashion and undergarment structures relaxed, along with the improved social standing of women.<ref>\u201cWomen's Clothes and Women's Rights,\u201d Robert E.

Riegel,  American Quarterly, 15 (1963): 399</ref> As [[Lady Duff Gordon]] remarked, in the 1920s \u201cwomen took off their corsets, reduced their clothing to the minimum tolerated by conventions and wore clothes which wrapped round them rather than fitted.\u201d <ref>(\u201cFashion, Emancipation, Reform and the Rational Undergarment\u201d Deborah Jean Waugh \u2018Dress\u2019 Vol 4, 1978: 238 Quote by Lady Duff Gordon (Lucile) from \u201cDiscretions and Indiscretions\u201d)</ref>\n\nAlthough forms of corsets, [[girdles]] and [[bra]]s were worn well into the 1960s, as Riegel states, \u201cFeminine emancipation had brought greater dress reform than the most visionary of the early feminists had advocated.\u201d<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Girl athletes and working women ==\nIn the 19th century, poor women were known to wear corsets \"boned\" with rope, rather than steel or bone, to facilitate work in the field.\n\n==The rational dress movement by country==\n\nThe dress reform movement spread from the United States and Great Britain to the Nordic countries in the 1880s and from Germany to Austria and the Netherlands. The issue was internationally adressed at the [[International Congress for Women's Work and Women's Endeavors]] in Berlin 1896, in which Germany, America, Belgium, Denmark, England, Finland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland and Hungary participated.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\">Cunningham, Patricia A (2003).

While there were no separate dress reform society founded in Denmark, the women's rights society ''[[Dansk Kvindesamfund]]'' actively adressed the issue under the influence of [[Svenska dr\u00e4gtreformf\u00f6reningen|the Swedish Dress Reform Society]] in the 1880s; they published their own [[brochure]], ''Om Sundheden og Kyindedraegten'' by J.

While the issue was adopted and discussed by several of the excisting French women's rights organisations, the issue was not given priority and it was not until the great enthusiasm for bicycling in France in the 1890s that women in general adopted the bloomer costume with throuses and no corsets as sports wear.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>\n\nIn the early 20th-century, however, the French fashion industry was finnally influenced by the reform dress movement, which abolished the corset by the 1910s. \n\n===Germany===\n\nGermany was a leading country of the dress reform in the 19th-century, as it was an integrated part of the great health reform movement ''[[Lebensreform]]'', which spoke for a health reform in clothing for both women and men supported by medical professionals and scientists such as [[Gustav Jaeger]] and [[Heinrich Lahmann]], and throusers for women was advocated already on.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>\n\nThe women's movement, however, did not engage in the issue until after the [[International Congress for Women's Work and Women's Endeavors]] in Berlin 1896, and the following year the German dress reform society, ''Allgemeine Verein f\u00fcr Verbesserung der Frauenkleidung'', was founded. As their equivalents in Austria, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, the German dress reform society, focused on a reform of women's underwear ad the most realistic goal, mainly focused on the use of corsets. The German movement managed to affect public oppinion to such a degree that one of its leading figures, [[Minna Cauer]], was able to report in 1907 that the German corset industry experienced hardships because of a sinking use of corsets.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/> \n\n===The Netherlands===\n\nIn the Netherlands, interest for the issue was aroused after the foundation of a dress reform society in neighboring Germany, and in 1899 the Dutch dress reform society ''Veereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleeding'' (V.v.V.V.v.).<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>  The dress reform society helt lectures, participated in exhibitions and worked with designed to produce a new fashion for women which could be not only attractive but also comfortable and healthy at the same time.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>\n\n===Norway===\n\nWhile there were no separate dress reform society founded in Norway the women's rights society ''[[Norsk Kvinnesaksforening]]'' actively adressed the issue under the influence of [[Svenska dr\u00e4gtreformf\u00f6reningen|the Swedish Dress Reform Society]] in the 1880s; they collaborated with Stockholm and Copenhagen with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the [[Nordic Exhibition of 1888]].<ref name=\"Hazelius-Berg, Gunnel\"/> \n\nNorway is in fact described as one of the countries were the interest and success for the issue was greatest.

The movement emerged in the [[Progressive Era]] along with calls for [[Temperance movement|temperance]], women's education, [[suffrage]] and moral purity. Dress reform called for emancipation from the \"dictates of fashion\", expressed a desire to \u201ccover the limbs as well as the torso adequately,\u201d and promoted \"rational dress\".<ref>\u201cFashion, Emancipation, Reform and the Rational Undergarment\u201d Deborah Jean Waugh \u2018Dress\u2019 Vol 4, 1978\"</ref> The movement had its greatest success in the reform of women's [[undergarment]]s, which could be modified without exposing the wearer to social ridicule. Dress reformers were also influential in persuading women to adopt simplified garments for athletic activities such as bicycling or swimming. The movement was much less concerned with men's clothing, although it initiated the widespread adoption of knitted wool [[union suit]]s or [[long underwear|long johns]].\n\nSome proponents of the movement established '''dress reform parlors''', or storefronts, where women could buy sewing patterns for the garments, or buy them directly.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bryan|first1=C.W.|title=Good Housekeeping, Vols. 5-6|date=1887|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xNIAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA410}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Downtown Walk|url=http://bwht.org/downtown/#8|website=[[Boston Women's Heritage Trail]]}}</ref>\n\n== Criticisms of tightlacing ==\n\nFashion in the 1850s through 1880s accented large [[crinoline]]s, cumbersome [[bustle]]s and padded busts with tiny waists laced into \u2018steam-moulded corsetry\u2019.<ref name=\"auto1\">Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986) p. 134</ref> \u2018[[Tight-lacing]]\u2019 became part of the [[corset controversy]]: dress reformists claimed that the corset was prompted by vanity and foolishness, and harmful to health.

The emancipation bodice was a tight sleeveless vest, buttoning up the front, with rows of buttons along the bottom to which could be attached [[petticoat]]s and a skirt. The entire torso would support the weight of the petticoats and skirt, not just the waist (since the undesirability of hanging the entire weight of full skirts and petticoats from a constricted waist\u2014rather than hanging the garments from the shoulders\u2014was another point often discussed by dress reformers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiana.org/view/91023/0008|title=Woman's dress, a question of the day|work=Early Canadiana Online|date=|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref> The bodices had to be fitted by a [[dressmaker]]; patterns could be ordered through the mail. Physician [[Alice Bunker Stockham]] railed against the [[corset]] and said of the pregnancy corset, \"The Best pregnancy corset is no corset at all.\"<ref>Alice Bunker Stockham. '''Tokology''' 1898.</ref>  The \"emancipation union under flannel\" was first sold in America in 1868. It combined a waist (shirt) and drawers (leggings) in the form we now know as the [[union suit]]. While first designed for women, the union suit was also adopted by men. Indeed, it is still sold and worn today, by both men and women, as winter underclothing\n\nIn 1878, a German professor named [[Gustav J\u00e4ger (naturalist)|Gustav Jaeger]] published a book claiming that only clothing made of animal hair, such as wool, promoted health. A British accountant named Lewis Tomalin translated the book, then opened a shop selling Dr Jaeger's Sanitary Woollen System, including knitted wool union suits. These were soon called \"Jaegers\"; they were widely popular.\n\nIt is not clear how many women, in either [[the Americas]] or on [[Europe|the Continent]], wore these so-called  \"reform\" bodices.  However, contemporary [[portrait photography]], [[fashion]] [[magazine|literature]], and surviving examples of the undergarments themselves, all suggest that the corset was almost universal as daily wear by women and young ladies (and numerous [[dandy|fashionable men]]) throughout much of the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n==Bloomer suit ==\n{{main|Bloomers (clothing)}}\n[[Image:Bloomers.jpg|right|thumb|Bloomer Suit]]\n\nThe most famous product of the dress reform era is the [[Bloomers (clothing)|bloomers]] suit. In 1851, a New England [[Temperance movement|temperance activist]] named [[Elizabeth Smith Miller]] (Libby Miller) adopted what she considered a more rational costume: loose trousers gathered at the ankles, like the trousers worn by Middle Eastern and Central Asian women, topped by a short dress or skirt and vest (waistcoat). She displayed her new clothing to temperance activist and [[suffragist]] [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who found it sensible and becoming, and adopted it immediately. In this garb, she visited yet another activist, [[Amelia Bloomer]], the editor of the temperance magazine ''[[The Lily (newspaper)| The Lily]]''. Bloomer not only wore the costume, she promoted it enthusiastically in her magazine. More women wore the fashion and were promptly dubbed \"Bloomers\". They put up a fight for a few years, but were subjected to ridicule in the press<ref>''The New York Times'', October 5, 1851: 'Bloomerism in London:...One journal hints very ill-naturedly that the new dress is best adapted for a particular class of \"ladies\", who, poor things, having a deal of \"street-walking\", would find the Bloomer costume quite a blessing..'</ref><ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, Aug 20, 1851; pg. 5; Issue 20885; col A:  \u2018DEBUT OF THE \u201cBLOOMER\u201d COSTUME IN BELFAST:...Three ladies... made their appearance in full \u201cBloomer\u201d costume...Others, and these most numerous, expressed an opinion the reverse of complimentary to the rank and character of the ladies, identifying them with persons whose overdressed gaiety of appearance in public stamps the class to which they belong.\u2019</ref> and harassment on the street.<ref>The Times, Thursday, Aug 28, 1851; pg. 7; Issue 20892; col B: (A report from the ''Caledonian Mercury'' of two women appearing in Edinburgh in reformed dress)'BLOOMERISM IN EDINBURGH:...The singular spectacle thus presented attracted considerable attention even in the retired quarter of the town where it was witnessed, and comments, characterized by freedom more than politeness, were now and again made by urchins who followed the unblushing Bloomers...we learn that the ladies are Americans;...\u2019</ref> The more conservative of society protested that women had \u2018lost the mystery and attractiveness as they discarded their flowing robes.\u201d<ref>\"Women's Clothes and Women's Right\", Robert E. Riegel,  American Quarterly, 15 (1963):393</ref>\n\nAmelia Bloomer herself dropped the fashion in 1859, saying that a new invention, the [[crinoline]], was a sufficient reform that she could return to conventional dress. The bloomer costume died\u2014temporarily. It was to return much later (in a different form), as a women's athletic costume in the 1890s and early 1900s.\n\n== Aesthetic Dress movement ==\n{{main|Artistic Dress movement}}\n\nIn the 1870s, a largely English movement led by [[Mary Eliza Haweis]] sought dress reform to enhance and celebrate the natural shape of the body, preferring the looser lines of the [[medieval]] and [[renaissance]] eras.  A historic nostalgia for more forgiving fashions, the aesthetic dress movement critiqued fashionable dress for its immovable shapes, and sought the \u2018fashioning and adorning of a robe\u2019 as tastefully complementary to the natural body.<ref>Dress and Morality by Aileen Ribeiro, (Homes and Meier Publishers Inc: New York. 1986): 139</ref>\n\nThe [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] and other artistic reformers objected to the elaborately [[trim (sewing)|trimmed]] confections of Victorian fashion with their unnatural silhouette based on a rigid [[corset]] and hoops as both ugly and dishonest. Some women associated with the movement adopted a revival style based on romanticised [[medieval]] influences such as puffed [[sleeve|juliette sleeves]] and trailing skirts. These styles were made in the soft colors of vegetable [[dye]]s, ornamented with hand [[embroidery]] in the [[art needlework]] style, featured silks, [[oriental]] designs, muted colors, natural and frizzed hair and lacked definitive waist emphasis.<ref>The Visual History of Costume. Aileen Ribeiro and Valerie Cumming, (Costume & Fashion Press, New York, 1989):188</ref>\n\nThe style spread as an \"anti-fashion\" called [[Artistic Dress movement|Artistic dress]] in the 1860s in literary and artistic circles, died back in the [[1870s in fashion|1870s]], and reemerged as ''Aesthetic dress'' in the [[1880s in fashion|1880s]], where the emphasis was not so much on honesty and purity as sensuality and languor.\n\n==Eventual shifts in fashion==\n\nAlthough the Victorian dress reform movement itself failed to enact widespread [[Women's Suffrage and Western Women's Fashion through the early 1900's|change in women\u2019s fashion]], social, political and cultural shifts into the 1920s brought forth an organic relaxation of dress standards.<ref name=\"auto\">\u201cWomen's Clothes and Women's Right,\u201d Robert E.

As their equivalents in Austria, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, the German dress reform society, focused on a reform of women's underwear ad the most realistic goal, mainly focused on the use of corsets. The German movement managed to affect public oppinion to such a degree that one of its leading figures, [[Minna Cauer]], was able to report in 1907 that the German corset industry experienced hardships because of a sinking use of corsets.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/> \n\n===The Netherlands===\n\nIn the Netherlands, interest for the issue was aroused after the foundation of a dress reform society in neighboring Germany, and in 1899 the Dutch dress reform society ''Veereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleeding'' (V.v.V.V.v.).<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>  The dress reform society helt lectures, participated in exhibitions and worked with designed to produce a new fashion for women which could be not only attractive but also comfortable and healthy at the same time.<ref name=\"Cunningham, Patricia A\"/>\n\n===Norway===\n\nWhile there were no separate dress reform society founded in Norway the women's rights society ''[[Norsk Kvinnesaksforening]]'' actively adressed the issue under the influence of [[Svenska dr\u00e4gtreformf\u00f6reningen|the Swedish Dress Reform Society]] in the 1880s; they collaborated with Stockholm and Copenhagen with the design of reform costumes and the exposition of them, notably during the [[Nordic Exhibition of 1888]].<ref name=\"Hazelius-Berg, Gunnel\"/> \n\nNorway is in fact described as one of the countries were the interest and success for the issue was greatest.
