There are twenty fist forms, which include twelve Baji Small Structure Fists, Baji Black Tiger Fist, Baji Dan Zhai, Baji Dan Da/Dui Da, Baji Luohan Gong, and Baji Si Lang Kuan. There are eight weapons forms, including Liu He Da [[Qiang (spear)|Qiang]] (spear), Chun Yang [[Jian]] (sword), San Yin [[Dao (sword)|Dao]] (sabre), Xing Zhe Bang (staff), [[Pudao]], and Chun Qiu [[Dao (sword)|Da Dao]] (a long two-handed heavy blade, used by Generals sitting on their horses).\n\nMost schools focus on a much smaller curriculum. Standard across almost all groups are Xiaobaji and Dabaji; two weapons forms, the sabre and the spear; a two-man training routine called Baji Duijie or Baji Duida and a series of 8 short attacking methods called the \"Ba Shi\" (Eight Postures), which are derived from the art of Shaolin Jingang Bashi.\n\n=== Power generation and expression ===\nThe major features of baji include elbow strikes, arm/fist punches, hip checks and strikes with the shoulder. All techniques are executed with a short power, developed through training; among Chinese martial artists, baji is known for its fast movements. Baji focuses on infighting, entering from a longer range with a distinctive charging step (''zhen jiao'').\n\nThe essence of baji quan lies in [[Neijin|jin]], or power-issuing methods, particularly [[fa jin]] (explosive power). The style contains six types of ''jin'', eight different ways to hit and several principles of power usage. Most of baji quan's moves utilize a one-hit push-strike method from very close range. The bulk of the damage is dealt through the momentary acceleration that travels up from the waist to the limb and further magnified by the charging step known as ''zhen jiao''.\n\nThe mechanics of ''jin'' are developed through many years of practice and baji quan is known for its strenuous lower-body training and its emphasis on the [[horse stance]].<ref name=\"Bajiquan\"/> Its horse stance is higher than that of typical [[Changquan|Long Fist]] styles. Like other styles, there is also \"the arrow-bow stance\", \"the one-leg stance\", \"the empty stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u865b\u6b65|p=x\u016bb\u00f9}}), \"the drop stance\" ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u4ec6\u6b65|p=p\u016bb\u00f9}}), etc. There are eight different hand poses, in addition to different types of breathing and ''zhen jiao''.\n\n== Influences ==\nBaji focuses on being more direct, culminating in powerful, fast strikes that will render an opponent unable to continue. Even so, there are some styles that are derived from Baji's main principles or concepts on how to hit the opponent:\n* Eight postures (''Ba shi'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi gong'')\n* Eight movements method (''Ba shi chui'')\n* Double Eight Postures (''Shuang ba shi'')\n* Eight postures of the dragon style (''Longxing ba shi'')\n\nMany of these forms are also based or mixed with [[Luohan (martial arts)|Luohan fist]], a [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolin]] style.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The term ''ba shi'' may also refer to baji.

The name was considered to be rather crude in its native tongue, so it was changed to ''baji quan''. The term ''baji'' comes from the Chinese classic, the [[Yijing]] (I-Ching), and signifies an \u201cextension of all directions\u201d. In this case, it means \u201cincluding everything\u201d or \u201cthe universe\u201d.\n\nThe first recorded baji quan teacher was Wu Zhong ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u5433\u937e}}) (1712\u20131802).

She is the ninth [[Disney Princess]]. Tiana made history as the first [[African American]] princess in the Disney Princess franchise. \n\nTiana has been mostly positively received, with critics praising her personality and values.

As a result, Tiana has become absorbed with her work and doesn't have time for anything else. Tiana finds hope when her wealthy childhood best friend Charlotte pays her a lump sum of money to make and serve [[beignet]]s at a masquerade ball she is hosting for the handsome but disinherited Prince Naveen.\n\nThat night, Tiana's hopes are crushed when the realtors of the mill tell her that she was outbid by someone for the sugar mill and that it is probably a good thing given her 'background'. When Tiana accidentally ruins her costume, Charlotte is kind enough to replace it with one of her own. Out of desperation, Tiana wishes on a star, only to be greeted by a talking frog, who claims to be Prince Naveen. Mistaking her for a princess because of her costume, Naveen promises to give Tiana the money she needs if she turns him human again by kissing him. After some persuasion, Tiana succumbs, but becomes a frog instead.\n\nWhile on the run from hungry gators, Tiana strikes a deal with Naveen, demanding that once he marries Charlotte, he will use the money he gets from her to help Tiana buy the restaurant. Things change, however, on their journey to end the spell. They both meet a jazz-playing alligator named [[Louis the Alligator|Louis]] and a Cajun firefly named Ray, who help them reach the voodoo priestess Mama Odie. Tiana and Naveen help each other escape from frog hunters and Tiana teaches Naveen to help her cook. As Ray sings an ode to his true love \"Evangeline\", Naveen shows Tiana how to dance, something that she has never done before because she was afraid to. Both frogs find themselves falling in love with one another, but are unsure how to say it.\n\nEventually Tiana comes face to face with Facilier himself, who promises to make her dream of \"Tiana's Place\" a reality if she hands over a voodoo charm which plays a significant role in his plans. After reminding her of all the work she has done and the people who held her back, he shows her an image of her late father, telling her that she can make sure the dream he never lived to see come true. Seeing her family together, Tiana finally realizes what her father had meant that he never got what he wanted but he had love, what he needed. Tiana is able to smash the charm and leaves Facilier at the mercy of the angry voodoo spirits.\n\nTiana finds Naveen, who is promising Charlotte that he will marry her but only if she will give Tiana her restaurant. Tiana stops him and finally admits that she loves him. Moved, Charlotte says she will kiss Naveen, \"no marriage required\", but it is already midnight and she is too late to break the spell. Tiana and Naveen get married in the bayou. Once they kiss, they finally become human again because Tiana is finally now a princess and is shown wearing her princess ball gown. Louis \"terrifies\" the realtors into accepting Tiana's offer. Together, Naveen and Tiana open the restaurant, now named \"Tiana's Palace\" and dance under the stars. Tiana's singing voice is also provided by [[Anika Noni Rose]].\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Mickey and the Magical Map - 1.jpg|thumb|Tiana in ''Mickey and the Magical Map'' at Disneyland in 2014.]]\nOn October 26, 2009, \"Tiana's Showboat Jubilee!\" debuted with appearances from Tiana, Naveen, [[Louis the Alligator|Louis]], and Dr. Facilier, at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]; and later at the [[Disneyland Resort]].

As a result, Tiana has become absorbed with her work and doesn't have time for anything else. Tiana finds hope when her wealthy childhood best friend Charlotte pays her a lump sum of money to make and serve [[beignet]]s at a masquerade ball she is hosting for the handsome but disinherited Prince Naveen.\n\nThat night, Tiana's hopes are crushed when the realtors of the mill tell her that she was outbid by someone for the sugar mill and that it is probably a good thing given her 'background'. When Tiana accidentally ruins her costume, Charlotte is kind enough to replace it with one of her own. Out of desperation, Tiana wishes on a star, only to be greeted by a talking frog, who claims to be Prince Naveen. Mistaking her for a princess because of her costume, Naveen promises to give Tiana the money she needs if she turns him human again by kissing him. After some persuasion, Tiana succumbs, but becomes a frog instead.\n\nWhile on the run from hungry gators, Tiana strikes a deal with Naveen, demanding that once he marries Charlotte, he will use the money he gets from her to help Tiana buy the restaurant. Things change, however, on their journey to end the spell. They both meet a jazz-playing alligator named [[Louis the Alligator|Louis]] and a Cajun firefly named Ray, who help them reach the voodoo priestess Mama Odie. Tiana and Naveen help each other escape from frog hunters and Tiana teaches Naveen to help her cook. As Ray sings an ode to his true love \"Evangeline\", Naveen shows Tiana how to dance, something that she has never done before because she was afraid to. Both frogs find themselves falling in love with one another, but are unsure how to say it.\n\nEventually Tiana comes face to face with Facilier himself, who promises to make her dream of \"Tiana's Place\" a reality if she hands over a voodoo charm which plays a significant role in his plans. After reminding her of all the work she has done and the people who held her back, he shows her an image of her late father, telling her that she can make sure the dream he never lived to see come true. Seeing her family together, Tiana finally realizes what her father had meant that he never got what he wanted but he had love, what he needed. Tiana is able to smash the charm and leaves Facilier at the mercy of the angry voodoo spirits.\n\nTiana finds Naveen, who is promising Charlotte that he will marry her but only if she will give Tiana her restaurant. Tiana stops him and finally admits that she loves him. Moved, Charlotte says she will kiss Naveen, \"no marriage required\", but it is already midnight and she is too late to break the spell. Tiana and Naveen get married in the bayou. Once they kiss, they finally become human again because Tiana is finally now a princess and is shown wearing her princess ball gown. Louis \"terrifies\" the realtors into accepting Tiana's offer. Together, Naveen and Tiana open the restaurant, now named \"Tiana's Palace\" and dance under the stars. Tiana's singing voice is also provided by [[Anika Noni Rose]].\n\n===In other media===\n[[File:Mickey and the Magical Map - 1.jpg|thumb|Tiana in ''Mickey and the Magical Map'' at Disneyland in 2014.]]\nOn October 26, 2009, \"Tiana's Showboat Jubilee!\" debuted with appearances from Tiana, Naveen, [[Louis the Alligator|Louis]], and Dr. Facilier, at the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]; and later at the [[Disneyland Resort]].

Virtual museums can perform as the digital footprint of a physical museum, or can act independently, while maintaining the authoritative status as bestowed by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in its definition of a museum. In tandem with the ICOM mission of a physical museum, the virtual museum is also committed to public access; to both the knowledge systems imbedded in the collections and the systematic, and coherent organization of their display, as well as to their long-term preservation.\n\nAs with a traditional museum, a virtual museum can be designed around specific objects (such as an art museum or a natural history museum), or can consist of online exhibitions created from primary or secondary resources (as, for example in a science museum). Moreover, a virtual museum can refer to the mobile or [[World Wide Web]] offerings of traditional museums (e.g., displaying digital representations of its collections or exhibits); or can be [[born digital]] content such as, [[3D modeling|3D environments]],  [[net art]], [[virtual reality]] and [[digital art]]. Often, discussed in conjunction with other cultural institutions, a museum by definition, is essentially separate from its sister institutions such as a library or an archive. Virtual museums are usually, but not exclusively delivered electronically when they are denoted as online museums, hypermuseum, digital museum, cybermuseums or web museums.\n\n==Off-line pioneers (CD-ROM and digital media before 2000)==\nThe following museums were created with digital technology before the web gained any form of popularity or mass usability. CD-ROM and postal mail distribution made these museums available world-wide, before web browsers, fast connections and ubiquitous web usage.\n\n* The Virtual Museum, Apple Computer. Released as a CD-ROM in 1992, and distributed free worldwide to 1000 schools, universities and museums, The Virtual Museum was an interactive, electronic museum where users moved from room to room, and selected any exhibit in a room for more detailed examination. The exhibits in the museum were educational, encompassing topics such as medicine, plant growth, the environment, and space. To facilitate interaction with the museum, a new method for navigating through a prerendered 3D space, and interacting with objects in that space had been developed, called 'virtual navigation'. Virtual navigation employed real-time video decompression for the display of, and interaction with, high-quality computer animation. In addition, a representation for 3D objects in animated sequences was used which permitted pixel-accurate, frame-accurate object picking, so that a viewer was able to select any 3D object to trigger movement within the 3D space, to examine an exhibit in animated form, or to play a digital movie or soundtrack. The use of precomputed video permitted 3D navigation in a realistic-looking space, without requiring special-purpose graphics hardware.

For the last few years, there have been projects related to [[Information Society Technologies]] dealing with: preservation of [[cultural heritage]], restoration and learning resources. Some examples of contributions in the field of digital and virtual museography: Euromuse.net (EU), DigiCULT (EU), Musings, Digital Museums Projects. European Community has founded various projects to support this filed, like V-Must, the Virtual Museum Transnational Network that aims to provide the heritage sector with the tools and support to develop Virtual Museums that are educational, enjoyable, long-lasting and easy to maintain.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.v-must.net/ |title= V-MUST: Virtual Museum Transnational Network; a EU FP7-funded Network of Excellence |accessdate= 2013-03-21 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130428035401/http://v-must.net/ |archivedate= 2013-04-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Virtual Multimodal Museum continues to explore the core concept of the virtual museum where the Working group 1.1 is actively working towards re-defining the definition of the virtual museum in order to keep up with current research.\n\nAn international conference in the field of museums and their websites is the annual ''[[Museums and the Web]]'' conference.\n\nIn 2004, Roy Hawkey of [[King's College London]] reported that \"Virtual visitors to museum websites already out-number physical (on-site) visitors, and many of these are engaged in dedicated learning\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/literature-reviews/Literature-Review205 | title = Learning with digital technologies in museums, science centres and galleries | accessdate = 2011-08-25 | last = Hawkey | first = Roy | date = September 2004 | publisher = Futurelab | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225002902/http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/literature-reviews/Literature-Review205 | archivedate = 2012-02-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn establishing virtuality and promoting cultural development, the goal is not merely to reproduce existing objects, but to actualize new ones.

One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides a sense of place using various spatial references. They usually use [[3D computer graphics|3D modelling]], VRML ([[VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language]]) and now [[X3D]](successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, [[X-ray]] imaging, 3D [[laser scanning]], IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of EU-funded projects, the [[ViHAP3D]], a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is [[QTVR]]. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited.\n\n==Mobile telepresence==\nIn 2013, the [[National Museum of Australia]] and the Australian [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) trialled a virtual museum tour system that uses mobile [[telepresence]] technology and requires a high-speed broadband connection. The technology allows remote visitors, for example school students from regional and remote Australia, to interact with a museum facilitator through a robot equipped with an omni-directional camera. Each remote visitor is able to control their own view of the museum gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/mobile-telepresence|title=National Museum of Australia \u2013 Robot tours|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420044316/http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/mobile-telepresence|archivedate=2013-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/ICT-Centre/Museum-Robot.aspx|title=Museum Robot: CSIRO|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316145657/http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/ICT-Centre/Museum-Robot.aspx|archivedate=2013-03-16|access-date=2013-04-15}}</ref><ref>[http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/456904/csiro_telepresence_robots_connect_students_national_museum/ 'CSIRO telepresence robots connect students with National Museum', ''Computerworld'', 21 March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420071250/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/456904/csiro_telepresence_robots_connect_students_national_museum/ |date=20 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Domain names==\nMuseums have a variety of [[top-level domain]] names. In the United States, many are [[.org]]. Some are [[.gov]], or governmental domains for other countries. A few are [[.edu]] in the US, either as part of a larger educational institution, or grandfathered in when .edu regulations changed (e.g., as with the [[Exploratorium]]).

Virtual museums can perform as the digital footprint of a physical museum, or can act independently, while maintaining the authoritative status as bestowed by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in its definition of a museum. In tandem with the ICOM mission of a physical museum, the virtual museum is also committed to public access; to both the knowledge systems imbedded in the collections and the systematic, and coherent organization of their display, as well as to their long-term preservation.\n\nAs with a traditional museum, a virtual museum can be designed around specific objects (such as an art museum or a natural history museum), or can consist of online exhibitions created from primary or secondary resources (as, for example in a science museum). Moreover, a virtual museum can refer to the mobile or [[World Wide Web]] offerings of traditional museums (e.g., displaying digital representations of its collections or exhibits); or can be [[born digital]] content such as, [[3D modeling|3D environments]],  [[net art]], [[virtual reality]] and [[digital art]]. Often, discussed in conjunction with other cultural institutions, a museum by definition, is essentially separate from its sister institutions such as a library or an archive. Virtual museums are usually, but not exclusively delivered electronically when they are denoted as online museums, hypermuseum, digital museum, cybermuseums or web museums.\n\n==Off-line pioneers (CD-ROM and digital media before 2000)==\nThe following museums were created with digital technology before the web gained any form of popularity or mass usability. CD-ROM and postal mail distribution made these museums available world-wide, before web browsers, fast connections and ubiquitous web usage.\n\n* The Virtual Museum, Apple Computer. Released as a CD-ROM in 1992, and distributed free worldwide to 1000 schools, universities and museums, The Virtual Museum was an interactive, electronic museum where users moved from room to room, and selected any exhibit in a room for more detailed examination. The exhibits in the museum were educational, encompassing topics such as medicine, plant growth, the environment, and space. To facilitate interaction with the museum, a new method for navigating through a prerendered 3D space, and interacting with objects in that space had been developed, called 'virtual navigation'. Virtual navigation employed real-time video decompression for the display of, and interaction with, high-quality computer animation. In addition, a representation for 3D objects in animated sequences was used which permitted pixel-accurate, frame-accurate object picking, so that a viewer was able to select any 3D object to trigger movement within the 3D space, to examine an exhibit in animated form, or to play a digital movie or soundtrack. The use of precomputed video permitted 3D navigation in a realistic-looking space, without requiring special-purpose graphics hardware. This was designed as a project to showcase new techniques in computer graphics at the time, particularly to push the envelope of what [[QuickTime]] was capable of, as it was still in [[Betaware|beta]]. This project was the grandfather of [[QuickTime VR]], which made sense given Eric Chen's role in the project. The Virtual Museum was a product of Apple Computer, Inc.'s 3D graphics group and was created by Gavin Miller, Eric Hoffert, Shenchang Eric Chen, Elizabeth Patterson, Dean Blackketter, Steve Rubin, Sally Applin, Derrick Yim and Jim Hanan under the leadership of Frank Crow.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The virtual museum: Interactive 3D navigation of a multimedia database|doi=10.1002/vis.4340030305|volume=3|issue=3|journal=The Journal of Visualization and Computer Animation|pages=183\u2013197|df=|year = 1992|last1 = Miller|first1 = Gavin|last2=Hoffert|first2=Eric|last3=Chen|first3=Shenchang Eric|last4=Patterson|first4=Elizabeth|last5=Blackketter|first5=Dean|last6=Rubin|first6=Steve|last7=Applin|first7=Sally Ann|last8=Yim|first8=Derrick|last9=Hanan|first9=Jim}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorgavin.com/Apple/Virtual_Museum.html|title=Virtual Museum|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232522/http://www.doctorgavin.com/Apple/Virtual_Museum.html|archivedate=2016-03-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Virtual-Museum/dp/B003RFDH8W|title=The Virtual Museum: Amazon.com: Books|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305032317/http://www.amazon.com/The-Virtual-Museum/dp/B003RFDH8W|archivedate=2016-03-05}}</ref>\n* Guggenheim Virtual Museum.

In the period, [[web page]]s were simpler, [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] was slower, the concepts of the online museum were still developing, and there were limited [[multimedia]] technologies available within [[web browser]]s. Some online museums began in non-website electronic forms and not all were established by existing physical museums. Many online museums have become significant sources of scholarly information, including extensive [[citation]]s within [[Wikipedia]].\n\n* Museum of Computer Art (MOCA) \u2013 Founded 1993.

For the last few years, there have been projects related to [[Information Society Technologies]] dealing with: preservation of [[cultural heritage]], restoration and learning resources. Some examples of contributions in the field of digital and virtual museography: Euromuse.net (EU), DigiCULT (EU), Musings, Digital Museums Projects. European Community has founded various projects to support this filed, like V-Must, the Virtual Museum Transnational Network that aims to provide the heritage sector with the tools and support to develop Virtual Museums that are educational, enjoyable, long-lasting and easy to maintain.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.v-must.net/ |title= V-MUST: Virtual Museum Transnational Network; a EU FP7-funded Network of Excellence |accessdate= 2013-03-21 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130428035401/http://v-must.net/ |archivedate= 2013-04-28 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, Virtual Multimodal Museum continues to explore the core concept of the virtual museum where the Working group 1.1 is actively working towards re-defining the definition of the virtual museum in order to keep up with current research.\n\nAn international conference in the field of museums and their websites is the annual ''[[Museums and the Web]]'' conference.\n\nIn 2004, Roy Hawkey of [[King's College London]] reported that \"Virtual visitors to museum websites already out-number physical (on-site) visitors, and many of these are engaged in dedicated learning\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/literature-reviews/Literature-Review205 | title = Learning with digital technologies in museums, science centres and galleries | accessdate = 2011-08-25 | last = Hawkey | first = Roy | date = September 2004 | publisher = Futurelab | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120225002902/http://archive.futurelab.org.uk/resources/publications-reports-articles/literature-reviews/Literature-Review205 | archivedate = 2012-02-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn establishing virtuality and promoting cultural development, the goal is not merely to reproduce existing objects, but to actualize new ones.

One is to re-create 3D space with visual representations of the museum by a 3D architectural metaphor, which provides a sense of place using various spatial references. They usually use [[3D computer graphics|3D modelling]], VRML ([[VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language]]) and now [[X3D]](successor to VRML) for viewing. There have been introduced various kinds of imaging techniques for building virtual museums, such as infrared reflectography, [[X-ray]] imaging, 3D [[laser scanning]], IBMR (Image Based Rendering and Modeling) techniques. In the case of EU-funded projects, the [[ViHAP3D]], a new virtual reality system for scanning museum artifacts, has been developed by EU researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Another interactive three-dimensional spatial environment is [[QTVR]]. Being a pre-rendered, fixed environment it is more restricted in regards to moving freely around in 3D space but the image quality can be superior to that of real-time rendered environments. This was especially the case in the mid-1990s when computing power and online speeds were limited.\n\n==Mobile telepresence==\nIn 2013, the [[National Museum of Australia]] and the Australian [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) trialled a virtual museum tour system that uses mobile [[telepresence]] technology and requires a high-speed broadband connection. The technology allows remote visitors, for example school students from regional and remote Australia, to interact with a museum facilitator through a robot equipped with an omni-directional camera. Each remote visitor is able to control their own view of the museum gallery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/mobile-telepresence|title=National Museum of Australia \u2013 Robot tours|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420044316/http://www.nma.gov.au/education-kids/mobile-telepresence|archivedate=2013-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/ICT-Centre/Museum-Robot.aspx|title=Museum Robot: CSIRO|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316145657/http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/ICT-Centre/Museum-Robot.aspx|archivedate=2013-03-16|access-date=2013-04-15}}</ref><ref>[http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/456904/csiro_telepresence_robots_connect_students_national_museum/ 'CSIRO telepresence robots connect students with National Museum', ''Computerworld'', 21 March 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420071250/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/456904/csiro_telepresence_robots_connect_students_national_museum/ |date=20 April 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Domain names==\nMuseums have a variety of [[top-level domain]] names. In the United States, many are [[.org]]. Some are [[.gov]], or governmental domains for other countries.
