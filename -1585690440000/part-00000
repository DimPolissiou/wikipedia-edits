Nuclear reactors are used at [[nuclear power plant]]s for [[electricity generation]] and in [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. Heat from [[nuclear fission]] is passed to a [[working fluid]] (water or gas), which in turn runs through [[steam turbine]]s. These either drive a ship's [[propeller]]s or turn [[electrical generator]]s' shafts. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for [[district heating]]. Some reactors are used to produce [[isotope]]s for [[Nuclear medicine|medical]] and [[industrial radiography|industrial]] use, or for production of [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]].  As of early 2019, the IAEA reports there are 454 nuclear power reactors and 226 nuclear research reactors in operation around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pris.iaea.org/pris/|title=PRIS \u2013 Home|website=pris.iaea.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nucleus.iaea.org/RRDB/RR/ReactorSearch.aspx?rf=1|title=RRDB Search|website=nucleus.iaea.org}}</ref>\n\n==How a nuclear reactor works==\n{{Main|Nuclear reactor physics}}\n\n[[File:Nuclear fission.svg|upright=1.15|thumb|An example of an induced nuclear fission event.

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nReactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]].

A common method of harnessing this [[thermal energy]] is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will then drive a [[steam turbine]] that turns an [[alternator]] and generates electricity.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\"/>\n\n==Early reactors==\n{{See also|Nuclear fission#History}}\n[[File:Stagg Field reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile]], the first nuclear reactor, built in secrecy at the University of Chicago in 1942 during World War II as part of the US's [[Manhattan project]]. ]]\n[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in their laboratory.]]\n[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|right|thumb|Some of the [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile Team]], including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]].]]\nThe [[neutron]] was discovered in 1932 by British physicist [[James Chadwick]]. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons.

They generally use [[uranium]] and its product [[plutonium]] as [[nuclear fuel]], though a [[thorium fuel cycle]] is also possible. Fission reactors can be divided roughly into two classes, depending on the energy of the neutrons that sustain the fission [[chain reaction]]:\n* [[Thermal reactor|Thermal neutron reactor]]s (the most common type of nuclear reactor) use slowed or [[thermal neutron]]s to keep up the fission of their fuel. Almost all current reactors are of this type. These contain [[neutron moderator]] materials that slow neutrons until their [[neutron temperature]] is ''thermalized'', that is, until their [[kinetic energy]] approaches the average kinetic energy of the surrounding particles. Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see [[fast breeder]] or [[Generation IV reactor#Fast reactors|generation IV reactors]]).\n\nIn principle, [[fusion power]] could be produced by [[nuclear fusion]] of elements such as the [[deuterium]] isotope of [[hydrogen]].  While an ongoing rich research topic since at least the 1940s, no self-sustaining fusion reactor for power generation has ever been built.\n\n====By moderator material====\nUsed by thermal reactors:\n* [[Graphite-moderated reactor]]s\n* Water moderated reactors\n**[[Heavy-water reactor]]s (Used in Canada,<ref name=\"hyperphysics\">{{cite web|last1=Nave|first1=R|title=Light Water Nuclear Reactors|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/NucEne/ligwat.html |website=Hyperphysics |publisher = Georgia State University|accessdate=5 March 2018}}</ref> India, Argentina, China, Pakistan, Romania and South Korea).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Joyce|first=Malcolm|date=2018|title=Nuclear Engineering|journal=Elsevier|chapter=10.6|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1016/c2015-0-05557-5|isbn=9780081009628}}</ref>\n** [[Light-water reactor|Light-water-moderated reactors]] (LWRs).

That [[negative feedback]] stabilizes the reaction rate. Graphite and heavy-water reactors tend to be more thoroughly thermalized than light water reactors. Due to the extra thermalization, these types can use [[natural uranium]]/unenriched fuel.\n* Light-element-moderated reactors.\n** [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are moderated by light elements such as lithium or beryllium, which are constituents of the coolant/fuel matrix salts LiF and BeF<sub>2</sub>.\n** [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]]s, such as those whose coolant is a mixture of lead and bismuth, may use BeO as a moderator.\n* Organically moderated reactors (OMR) use [[biphenyl]] and [[terphenyl]] as moderator and coolant.\n\n====By coolant====\n[[File:RIAN archive 450312 Treatment of interior part of reactor frame.jpg|thumb|Treatment of the interior part of a [[VVER|VVER-1000]] reactor frame on [[Atommash]].]]\n[[File:Thermal reactor diagram.png|thumb|In thermal nuclear reactors (LWRs in specific), the coolant acts as a moderator that must slow down the neutrons before they can be efficiently absorbed by the fuel.]]\n* Water cooled reactor. These constitute the great majority of operational nuclear reactors: as of 2014, 93% of the world's nuclear reactors are water cooled, providing about 95% of the world's total nuclear generation capacity.<ref name=\"IAEA_reactors_stats\" />\n** [[Pressurized water reactor]] (PWR) Pressurized water reactors constitute the large majority of all Western nuclear power plants.\n*** A primary characteristic of PWRs is a pressurizer, a specialized [[pressure vessel]]. Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.\n*** [[Pressurized heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.\n** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)\n*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses <sup>235</sup>U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\">{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.\n** [[Pool-type reactor]]\n* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]].

Some reactors run hot enough that the gas can directly power a gas turbine. Older designs usually run the gas through a [[heat exchanger]] to make steam for a steam turbine.\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]s (MSRs) are cooled by circulating a molten salt, typically a eutectic mixture of fluoride salts, such as [[FLiBe]].

The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian [[VVER-1200]], Japanese [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]], American [[AP1000]], Chinese [[Hualong One|Hualong Pressurized Reactor]] and the Franco-German [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. All the [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.\n* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]\n\n:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].\n[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]\n* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]\n\n:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), very similar to PWRs but using [[heavy water]]. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater [[neutron economy]] (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without [[Isotope separation|fuel enrichment facilities]]. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010. The [[EBR-I]], the first reactor to have a core meltdown, in 1955, was also a sodium-cooled reactor. \n* [[Pebble-bed reactor]]s (PBR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: helium]\n:: These use fuel molded into ceramic balls, and then circulate gas through the balls. The result is an efficient, low-maintenance, very safe reactor with inexpensive, standardized fuel. The prototype was the [[AVR reactor|AVR]] and the [[HTR-10]] is operating in China, where the [[HTR-PM]] is being developed.

As a breeder reactor type, it reprocesses the spent fuel, extracting both Uranium and transuranics, leaving [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|only 0.1% of transuranic waste]] compared to conventional once-through uranium-fueled light water reactors currently in use.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3).

These designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction before 2030. Current reactors in operation around the world are generally considered second- or third-generation systems, with the first-generation systems having been retired some time ago. Research into these reactor types was officially started by the Generation&nbsp;IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals. The primary goals being to improve nuclear safety, improve proliferation resistance, minimize waste and natural resource utilization, and to decrease the cost to build and run such plants.<ref name=\"UIC1\">{{cite web |title=Generation IV Nuclear Reactors |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf77.html |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Gas-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Lead-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Molten salt reactor]]\n* [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor]]\n* [[Supercritical water reactor]]\n* [[Very-high-temperature reactor]]\n\n====Generation V+ reactors====\nGeneration V reactors are designs which are theoretically possible, but which are not being actively considered or researched at present.

In theory, using UF<sub>6</sub> as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done now) would mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable [[neutron flux]], weakening most [[IFMIF|reactor materials]], and therefore as the flux would be similar to that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the [[IFMIF|International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility]].\n** Gas core EM reactor.

A fission fragment reactor is a nuclear reactor that generates electricity by decelerating an ion beam of fission byproducts instead of using nuclear reactions to generate heat. By doing so, it bypasses the [[Carnot cycle]] and can achieve efficiencies of up to 90% instead of 40\u201345% attainable by efficient turbine-driven thermal reactors. The fission fragment ion beam would be passed through a [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]] to produce electricity.\n* [[Hybrid nuclear fusion]]. Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.\n\n====Fusion reactors====\n{{Main|Fusion power}}\nControlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.<ref name=globen/> Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013    }}</ref> despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}</ref> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.<ref name=globen>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005\u20132055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear accidents and controversy==\n{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}\n[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]] overheated, causing the coolant water to [[Water splitting|dissociate]] and led to the hydrogen explosions.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years.

Nuclear reactors are used at [[nuclear power plant]]s for [[electricity generation]] and in [[nuclear marine propulsion]]. Heat from [[nuclear fission]] is passed to a [[working fluid]] (water or gas), which in turn runs through [[steam turbine]]s. These either drive a ship's [[propeller]]s or turn [[electrical generator]]s' shafts. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for [[district heating]]. Some reactors are used to produce [[isotope]]s for [[Nuclear medicine|medical]] and [[industrial radiography|industrial]] use, or for production of [[weapons-grade]] [[plutonium]].

The heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, (the [[Nuclear fission product|fission products]]), releasing [[kinetic energy]], [[gamma rays|gamma radiation]], and [[free neutron]]s. A portion of these [[neutron]]s may be absorbed by other fissile atoms and trigger further fission events, which release more neutrons, and so on.

The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most reactor systems employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the [[turbines]], like the [[pressurized water reactor]]. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the [[reactor core]]; for example the [[boiling water reactor]].<ref name=\"HSWCOOLANT\">{{cite web | title=How nuclear power works |publisher=HowStuffWorks.com | url= http://science.howstuffworks.com/nuclear-power3.htm | accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Reactivity control===\n{{main|Nuclear reactor control|Nuclear reactor physics|Passive nuclear safety|Delayed neutron|Iodine pit|SCRAM|Decay heat}}\nThe rate of fission reactions within a reactor core can be adjusted by controlling the quantity of neutrons that are able to induce further fission events. Nuclear reactors typically employ several methods of neutron control to adjust the reactor's power output. Some of these methods arise naturally from the physics of radioactive decay and are simply accounted for during the reactor's operation, while others are mechanisms engineered into the reactor design for a distinct purpose.\n\nThe fastest method for adjusting levels of fission-inducing neutrons in a reactor is via movement of the [[control rod]]s. Control rods are made of [[neutron poison]]s and therefore absorb neutrons. When a control rod is inserted deeper into the reactor, it absorbs more neutrons than the material it displaces\u2014often the moderator. This action results in fewer neutrons available to cause fission and reduces the reactor's power output. Conversely, extracting the control rod will result in an increase in the rate of fission events and an increase in power.\n\nThe physics of radioactive decay also affects neutron populations in a reactor. One such process is [[delayed neutron]] emission by a number of neutron-rich fission isotopes. These delayed neutrons account for about 0.65% of the total neutrons produced in fission, with the remainder (termed \"[[prompt neutron]]s\") released immediately upon fission. The fission products which produce delayed neutrons have half-lives for their [[Radioactive decay|decay]] by [[neutron emission]] that range from milliseconds to as long as several minutes, and so considerable time is required to determine exactly when a reactor reaches the [[critical mass (nuclear)|critical]] point. Keeping the reactor in the zone of chain reactivity where delayed neutrons are ''necessary'' to achieve a [[critical mass]] state allows mechanical devices or human operators to control a chain reaction in \"real time\"; otherwise the time between achievement of [[critical mass (nuclear)|criticality]] and [[nuclear meltdown]] as a result of an exponential power surge from the normal nuclear chain reaction, would be too short to allow for intervention. This last stage, where delayed neutrons are no longer required to maintain criticality, is known as the [[prompt critical]] point. There is a scale for describing criticality in numerical form, in which bare criticality is known as ''zero [[dollar (reactivity)|dollars]]'' and the prompt critical point is ''one dollar'', and other points in the process interpolated in cents.\n\nIn some reactors, the [[coolant]] also acts as a [[neutron moderator]]. A moderator increases the power of the reactor by causing the fast neutrons that are released from fission to lose energy and become thermal neutrons. [[Thermal neutron]]s are more likely than [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission. If the coolant is a moderator, then temperature changes can affect the density of the coolant/moderator and therefore change power output. A higher temperature coolant would be less dense, and therefore a less effective moderator.\n\nIn other reactors the coolant acts as a poison by absorbing neutrons in the same way that the control rods do. In these reactors power output can be increased by heating the coolant, which makes it a less dense poison. Nuclear reactors generally have automatic and manual systems to [[scram]] the reactor in an emergency shut down. These systems insert large amounts of poison (often [[boron]] in the form of [[boric acid]]) into the reactor to shut the fission reaction down if unsafe conditions are detected or anticipated.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\">{{cite web |title=Reactor Protection & Engineered Safety Feature Systems |work=The Nuclear Tourist |url= http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/rp.htm |accessdate=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMost types of reactors are sensitive to a process variously known as xenon poisoning, or the [[iodine pit]]. The common [[fission product]] [[Xenon-135]] produced in the fission process acts as a neutron poison that absorbs neutrons and therefore tends to shut the reactor down. Xenon-135 accumulation can be controlled by keeping power levels high enough to destroy it by neutron absorption as fast as it is produced. Fission also produces [[iodine-135]], which in turn decays (with a half-life of 6.57 hours) to new xenon-135. When the reactor is shut down, iodine-135 continues to decay to xenon-135, making restarting the reactor more difficult for a day or two, as the xenon-135 decays into cesium-135, which is not nearly as poisonous as xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.2 hours. This temporary state is the \"iodine pit.\" If the reactor has sufficient extra reactivity capacity, it can be restarted. As the extra xenon-135 is transmuted to xenon-136, which is much less a neutron poison, within a few hours the reactor experiences a \"xenon burnoff (power) transient\". Control rods must be further inserted to replace the neutron absorption of the lost xenon-135. Failure to properly follow such a procedure was a key step in the [[Chernobyl disaster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |title=Chernobyl: what happened and why? by CM Meyer, technical journalist. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211073343/http://www.eepublishers.co.za/images/upload/Meyer%20Chernobyl%205.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 }}</ref>\n\nReactors used in [[nuclear marine propulsion]] (especially [[nuclear submarine]]s) often cannot be run at continuous power around the clock in the same way that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition often need to have a very long core life without [[Reactor refueling|refueling]].

A common method of harnessing this [[thermal energy]] is to use it to boil water to produce pressurized steam which will then drive a [[steam turbine]] that turns an [[alternator]] and generates electricity.<ref name=\"TOURISTRP\"/>\n\n==Early reactors==\n{{See also|Nuclear fission#History}}\n[[File:Stagg Field reactor.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile]], the first nuclear reactor, built in secrecy at the University of Chicago in 1942 during World War II as part of the US's [[Manhattan project]]. ]]\n[[File:Otto Hahn und Lise Meitner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in their laboratory.]]\n[[File:ChicagoPileTeam.png|right|thumb|Some of the [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile Team]], including [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]].]]\nThe [[neutron]] was discovered in 1932 by British physicist [[James Chadwick]]. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by [[nuclear reaction]]s mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]], in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the [[Admiralty]] in London.<ref>L. Szil\u00e1rd, [http://v3.espacenet.com/textdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=GB630726 \"Improvements in or relating to the transmutation of chemical elements,\"] British patent number: GB630726 (filed: 28 June 1934; published: 30 March 1936).</ref> However, Szil\u00e1rd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szil\u00e1rd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved unworkable.\n\nInspiration for a new type of reactor using uranium came from the discovery by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Fritz Strassmann]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1938 that bombardment of uranium with neutrons (provided by an alpha-on-beryllium fusion reaction, a \"[[neutron howitzer]]\") produced a [[barium]] residue, which they reasoned was created by the fissioning of the uranium nuclei. Subsequent studies in early 1939 (one of them by Szil\u00e1rd and Fermi) revealed that several neutrons were also released during the fissioning, making available the opportunity for the nuclear [[chain reaction]] that Szil\u00e1rd had envisioned six years previously.\n\nOn 2 August 1939 [[Albert Einstein]] signed a letter to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (written by Szil\u00e1rd) suggesting that the discovery of uranium's fission could lead to the development of \"extremely powerful bombs of a new type\", giving impetus to the study of reactors and fission. Szil\u00e1rd and Einstein knew each other well and had worked together years previously, but Einstein had never thought about this possibility for nuclear energy until Szilard reported it to him, at the beginning of his quest to produce the [[Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter]] to alert the U.S. government.\n\nShortly after, [[Hitler]]'s Germany invaded Poland in 1939, starting [[World War II]] in Europe. The U.S. was not yet officially at war, but in October, when the Einstein-Szil\u00e1rd letter was delivered to him, Roosevelt commented that the purpose of doing the research was to make sure \"the Nazis don't blow us up.\" The U.S. nuclear project followed, although with some delay as there remained skepticism (some of it from Fermi) and also little action from the small number of officials in the government who were initially charged with moving the project forward.\n\nThe following year the U.S. Government received the [[Frisch\u2013Peierls memorandum]] from the UK, which stated that the amount of [[uranium]] needed for a [[chain reaction]] was far lower than had previously been thought. The memorandum was a product of the [[MAUD Committee]], which was working on the UK atomic bomb project, known as [[Tube Alloys]], later [[British contribution to the Manhattan Project|to be subsumed]] within the [[Manhattan Project]].\n\nEventually, the first artificial nuclear reactor, [[Chicago Pile-1]], was constructed at the [[University of Chicago]], by a team led by [[Italians|Italian]] physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], in late 1942. By this time, the program had been pressured for a year by U.S. entry into the war. The Chicago Pile achieved [[critical mass|criticality]] on 2 December 1942<ref>The First Reactor, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Division of Technical Information</ref> at 3:25&nbsp;PM. The reactor support structure was made of wood, which supported a pile (hence the name) of graphite blocks, embedded in which was natural uranium oxide 'pseudospheres' or 'briquettes'.\n\nSoon after the Chicago Pile, the U.S. military developed a number of nuclear reactors for the [[Manhattan Project]] starting in 1943. The primary purpose for the largest reactors (located at the [[Hanford Site]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]), was the mass production of [[plutonium]] for nuclear weapons. Fermi and Szilard applied for a patent on reactors on 19 December 1944.

Thermal neutrons have a far higher [[Nuclear cross section|cross section]] (probability) of fissioning the [[fissile]] nuclei [[uranium-235]], [[plutonium-239]], and [[plutonium-241]], and a relatively lower probability of [[neutron capture]] by [[uranium-238]] (U-238) compared to the faster neutrons that originally result from fission, allowing use of [[low-enriched uranium]] or even [[natural uranium]] fuel. The moderator is often also the [[coolant]], usually water under high pressure to increase the [[boiling point]]. These are surrounded by a [[reactor vessel]], instrumentation to monitor and control the reactor, [[radiation shielding]], and a [[containment building]].\n* [[Fast neutron reactor]]s use [[fast neutron]]s to cause fission in their fuel. They do not have a [[neutron moderator]], and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly [[isotope separation|enriched]] in [[fissile]] material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less [[transuranic]] waste because all [[actinides]] are fissionable with fast neutrons,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/BF00750983| title = Fast-reactor actinoid transmutation| journal = Atomic Energy| volume = 74| page = 83| year = 1993| last1 = Golubev | first1 = V.

Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units.

Most commercial PWRs and naval reactors use pressurizers. During normal operation, a pressurizer is partially filled with water, and a steam bubble is maintained above it by heating the water with submerged heaters. During normal operation, the pressurizer is connected to the primary reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the pressurizer \"bubble\" provides an expansion space for changes in water volume in the reactor. This arrangement also provides a means of pressure control for the reactor by increasing or decreasing the steam pressure in the pressurizer using the pressurizer heaters.\n*** [[Pressurized heavy water reactor]]s are a subset of pressurized water reactors, sharing the use of a pressurized, isolated heat transport loop, but using [[heavy water]] as coolant and moderator for the greater neutron economies it offers.\n** [[Boiling water reactor]] (BWR)\n*** BWRs are characterized by boiling water around the fuel rods in the lower portion of a primary reactor pressure vessel. A boiling water reactor uses <sup>235</sup>U, enriched as uranium dioxide, as its fuel. The fuel is assembled into rods housed in a steel vessel that is submerged in water. The nuclear fission causes the water to boil, generating steam. This steam flows through pipes into turbines. The turbines are driven by the steam, and this process generates electricity.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\">{{cite web|last1=Lipper |first1=Ilan |first2=Jon |last2=Stone |url=http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |title=Nuclear Energy and Society |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=3 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401172451/http://www.umich.edu/~gs265/society/nuclear.htm |archivedate=1 April 2009 }}</ref> During normal operation, pressure is controlled by the amount of steam flowing from the reactor pressure vessel to the turbine.\n** [[Pool-type reactor]]\n* [[Liquid metal cooled reactor]].

The hot radioactive water that leaves the pressure vessel is looped through a steam generator, which in turn heats a secondary (nonradioactive) loop of water to steam that can run turbines. They represent the majority (around 80%) of current reactors. This is a [[thermal neutron]] reactor design, the newest of which are the Russian [[VVER-1200]], Japanese [[Advanced Pressurized Water Reactor]], American [[AP1000]], Chinese [[Hualong One|Hualong Pressurized Reactor]] and the Franco-German [[European Pressurized Reactor]]. All the [[United States Naval reactor]]s are of this type.\n* [[Boiling water reactor]]s (BWR) [moderator: low-pressure water; coolant: low-pressure water]\n\n:: A BWR is like a PWR without the steam generator. The lower pressure of its cooling water allows it to boil inside the pressure vessel, producing the steam that runs the turbines. Unlike a PWR, there is no primary and secondary loop. The thermal efficiency of these reactors can be higher, and they can be simpler, and even potentially more stable and safe. This is a thermal neutron reactor design, the newest of which are the [[Advanced Boiling Water Reactor]] and the [[Economic Simplified Boiling Water Reactor]].\n[[File:CANDU at Qinshan.jpg|thumb|The [[CANDU]] [[Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant]]]]\n* [[Pressurised heavy water reactor|Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor]] (PHWR) [moderator: high-pressure heavy water; coolant: high-pressure heavy water]\n\n:: A Canadian design (known as [[CANDU]]), very similar to PWRs but using [[heavy water]]. While heavy water is significantly more expensive than ordinary water, it has greater [[neutron economy]] (creates a higher number of thermal neutrons), allowing the reactor to operate without [[Isotope separation|fuel enrichment facilities]]. Instead of using a single large pressure vessel as in a PWR, the fuel is contained in hundreds of pressure tubes. These reactors are fueled with natural [[uranium]] and are thermal neutron reactor designs. PHWRs can be refueled while at full power, which makes them very efficient in their use of uranium (it allows for precise flux control in the core). CANDU PHWRs have been built in Canada, [[Argentina]], China, [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Romania]], and [[South Korea]]. India also operates a number of PHWRs, often termed 'CANDU derivatives', built after the Government of Canada halted nuclear dealings with India following the 1974 [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear weapon test.\n:[[File:Elektrownia Ignalina.jpg|thumb|The [[Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant]] \u2014 a RBMK type (closed 2009)]]\n* Reaktor Bolshoy Moschnosti Kanalniy (High Power Channel Reactor) ([[RBMK]]) [moderator: graphite; coolant: high-pressure water]\n\n:: A Soviet design, RBMKs are in some respects similar to CANDU in that they are refuelable during power operation and employ a pressure tube design instead of a PWR-style pressure vessel. However, unlike CANDU they are very unstable and large, making [[containment building]]s for them expensive. A series of critical safety flaws have also been identified with the RBMK design, though some of these were corrected following the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Their main attraction is their use of light water and unenriched uranium. As of 2019, 10 remain open, mostly due to safety improvements and help from international safety agencies such as the DOE. Despite these safety improvements, RBMK reactors are still considered one of the most dangerous reactor designs in use. RBMK reactors were deployed only in the former [[Soviet Union]].\n[[File:Sizewell A.jpg|thumb|The [[Magnox]] [[Sizewell A]] nuclear power station]]\n[[File:Torness Nuclear Power Station, Scotland.JPG|thumb|The [[Torness nuclear power station]] \u2014 an AGR]]\n* [[Gas-cooled reactor]] (GCR) and [[advanced gas-cooled reactor]] (AGR) [moderator: graphite; coolant: carbon dioxide]\n\n:: These designs an have a high thermal efficiency compared with PWRs due to higher operating temperatures. There are a number of operating reactors of this design, mostly in the United Kingdom, where the concept was developed. Older designs (i.e. [[Magnox]] stations) are either shut down or will be in the near future. However, the AGRs have an anticipated life of a further 10 to 20&nbsp;years. This is a thermal neutron reactor design. Decommissioning costs can be high due to large volume of reactor core.\n* [[Breeder reactor|Liquid metal]] [[Fast breeder reactor#Fast breeder reactor|fast-breeder reactor]] (LMFBR) [moderator: none; coolant: liquid metal]\n[[File:Topaz nuclear reactor.jpg|thumb|right| Scaled \u2013 down model of [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor]]]]\n\n:: This totally unmoderated reactor design produces more fuel than it consumes. They are said to \"breed\" fuel, because they produce fissionable fuel during operation because of [[neutron capture]]. These reactors can function much like a PWR in terms of efficiency, and do not require much high-pressure containment, as the liquid metal does not need to be kept at high pressure, even at very high temperatures. These reactors are [[fast neutron]], not thermal neutron designs. These reactors come in two types:\n[[File:Superph\u00e9nix.jpg|thumb|The [[Superph\u00e9nix]], closed in 1998, was one of the few FBRs]]\n\n:::[[Lead-cooled fast reactor|Lead-cooled]]\n:::: Using lead as the liquid metal provides excellent radiation shielding, and allows for operation at very high temperatures. Also, lead is (mostly) transparent to neutrons, so fewer neutrons are lost in the coolant, and the coolant does not become radioactive. Unlike sodium, lead is mostly inert, so there is less risk of explosion or accident, but such large quantities of lead may be problematic from toxicology and disposal points of view. Often a reactor of this type would use a [[lead-bismuth eutectic]] mixture. In this case, the bismuth would present some minor radiation problems, as it is not quite as transparent to neutrons, and can be transmuted to a radioactive isotope more readily than lead. The Russian [[Alfa class submarine]] uses a lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor as its main power plant.\n::: [[Sodium-cooled fast reactor|Sodium-cooled]]\n:::: Most LMFBRs are of this type. The [[TOPAZ nuclear reactor|TOPAZ]], [[BN-350]] and [[BN-600]] in USSR; [[Superph\u00e9nix]] in France; and [[Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station|Fermi-I]] in the United States were reactors of this type. The sodium is relatively easy to obtain and work with, and it also manages to actually prevent corrosion on the various reactor parts immersed in it. However, sodium explodes violently when exposed to water, so care must be taken, but such explosions would not be more violent than (for example) a leak of superheated fluid from a pressurized-water reactor. The [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant|Monju reactor]] in Japan suffered a sodium leak in 1995 and could not be [[Monju Nuclear Power Plant#Restart|restarted]] until May 2010.

It uses ceramic fuels so its safe operating temperatures exceed the power-reduction temperature range. Most designs are cooled by inert helium. Helium is not subject to steam explosions, resists neutron absorption leading to radioactivity, and does not dissolve contaminants that can become radioactive. Typical designs have more layers (up to 7) of passive containment than light water reactors (usually&nbsp;3). A unique feature that may aid safety is that the fuel balls actually form the core's mechanism, and are replaced one by one as they age.

Would use the neutrons emitted by fusion to fission a [[breeder reactor|blanket]] of [[fertile material]], like [[Uranium-238|U-238]] or [[thorium|Th-232]] and [[Nuclear transmutation|transmute]] other reactor's [[spent nuclear fuel]]/nuclear waste into relatively more benign isotopes.\n\n====Fusion reactors====\n{{Main|Fusion power}}\nControlled [[nuclear fusion]] could in principle be used in [[fusion power]] plants to produce power without the complexities of handling [[actinides]], but significant scientific and technical obstacles remain. Several fusion reactors have been built, but only recently reactors have been able to release more energy than the amount of energy used in the process. Despite research having started in the 1950s, no commercial fusion reactor is expected before 2050. The [[ITER]] project is currently leading the effort to harness fusion power.\n\n==Nuclear fuel cycle==\n{{Main|Nuclear fuel cycle}}\nThermal reactors generally depend on refined and [[enriched uranium]]. Some nuclear reactors can operate with a mixture of plutonium and uranium (see [[MOX]]). The process by which uranium ore is mined, processed, enriched, used, possibly [[nuclear reprocessing|reprocessed]] and disposed of is known as the [[nuclear fuel cycle]].\n\nUnder 1% of the uranium found in nature is the easily fissionable U-235 [[isotope]] and as a result most reactor designs require enriched fuel.\nEnrichment involves increasing the percentage of U-235 and is usually done by means of [[gaseous diffusion]] or [[gas centrifuge]]. The enriched result is then converted into [[uranium dioxide]] powder, which is pressed and fired into pellet form. These pellets are stacked into tubes which are then sealed and called [[Nuclear fuel|fuel rods]]. Many of these fuel rods are used in each nuclear reactor.\n\nMost BWR and PWR commercial reactors use uranium enriched to about 4% U-235, and some commercial reactors with a high [[neutron economy]] do not require the fuel to be enriched at all (that is, they can use natural uranium). According to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] there are at least 100 [[research reactor]]s in the world fueled by highly enriched (weapons-grade/90% enrichment) uranium. Theft risk of this fuel (potentially used in the production of a nuclear weapon) has led to campaigns advocating conversion of this type of reactor to low-enrichment uranium (which poses less threat of proliferation).<ref>{{cite web | work=IAEA | url=http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/heu_symposium.html | title=Improving Security at World's Nuclear Research Reactors: Technical and Other Issues Focus of June Symposium in Norway | date=7 June 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[Fissile]] U-235 and non-fissile but [[fissionable]] and [[Fertile material|fertile]] U-238 are both used in the fission process. U-235 is fissionable by thermal (i.e. slow-moving) neutrons. A thermal neutron is one which is moving about the same speed as the atoms around it. Since all atoms vibrate proportionally to their absolute temperature, a thermal neutron has the best opportunity to fission U-235 when it is moving at this same vibrational speed. On the other hand, U-238 is more likely to capture a neutron when the neutron is moving very fast. This U-239 atom will soon decay into plutonium-239, which is another fuel. Pu-239 is a viable fuel and must be accounted for even when a highly enriched uranium fuel is used. Plutonium fissions will dominate the U-235 fissions in some reactors, especially after the initial loading of U-235 is spent. Plutonium is fissionable with both fast and thermal neutrons, which make it ideal for either nuclear reactors or nuclear bombs.\n\nMost reactor designs in existence are thermal reactors and typically use water as a neutron moderator (moderator means that it slows down the neutron to a thermal speed) and as a coolant. But in a [[fast breeder reactor]], some other kind of coolant is used which will not moderate or slow the neutrons down much. This enables fast neutrons to dominate, which can effectively be used to constantly replenish the fuel supply. By merely placing cheap unenriched uranium into such a core, the non-fissionable U-238 will be turned into Pu-239, \"breeding\" fuel.\n\nIn [[thorium fuel cycle]] [[thorium-232]] absorbs a [[neutron]] in either a fast or thermal reactor. The thorium-233 [[beta decay]]s to [[protactinium]]-233 and then to [[uranium-233]], which in turn is used as fuel. Hence, like [[uranium-238]], thorium-232 is a [[fertile material]].\n\n===Fueling of nuclear reactors===\nThe amount of energy in the reservoir of [[nuclear fuel]] is frequently expressed in terms of \"full-power days,\" which is the number of 24-hour periods (days) a reactor is scheduled for operation at full power output for the generation of heat energy. The number of full-power days in a reactor's operating cycle (between refueling outage times) is related to the amount of [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] (U-235) contained in the fuel assemblies at the beginning of the cycle. A higher percentage of U-235 in the core at the beginning of a cycle will permit the reactor to be run for a greater number of full-power days.\n\nAt the end of the operating cycle, the fuel in some of the assemblies is \"spent\", having spent 4 to 6 years in the reactor producing power.  This spent fuel is discharged and replaced with new (fresh) fuel assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Though considered \"spent,\" these fuel assemblies contain a large quantity of fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  In practice it is economics that determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor.  Long before all possible fission has taken place, the reactor is unable to maintain 100%, full output power, and therefore, income for the utility lowers as plant output power lowers.  Most nuclear plants operate at a very low profit margin due to operating overhead, mainly regulatory costs, so operating below 100% power is not economically viable for very long.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The fraction of the reactor's fuel core replaced during refueling is typically one-third, but depends on how long the plant operates between refueling.  Plants typically operate on 18 month refueling cycles, or 24 month refueling cycles.  This means that 1 refueling, replacing only one-third of the fuel, can keep a nuclear reactor at full power for nearly 2 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  The disposition and storage of this spent fuel is one of the most challenging aspects of the operation of a commercial nuclear power plant.  This nuclear waste is highly radioactive and its toxicity presents a danger for thousands of years.<ref name=\"nuclear_energy\"/>  After being discharged from the reactor, spent nuclear fuel is transferred to the on-site spent fuel pool.  The spent fuel pool is a large pool of water that provides cooling and shielding of the spent nuclear fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}  Once the energy has decayed somewhat (approximately 5 years), the fuel can be transferred from the fuel pool to dry shielded casks, that can be safely stored for thousands of years.  After loading into dry shielded casks, the casks are stored on-site in a specially guarded facility in impervious concrete bunkers.  On-site fuel storage facilities are designed to withstand the impact of commercial airliners, with little to no damage to the spent fuel.  An average on-site fuel storage facility can hold 30 years of spent fuel in a space smaller that a football field.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nNot all reactors need to be shut down for refueling; for example, [[pebble bed reactor]]s, [[RBMK|RBMK reactors]], [[molten salt reactor]]s, [[Magnox]], [[Advanced gas-cooled reactor|AGR]] and [[CANDU]] reactors allow fuel to be shifted through the reactor while it is running. In a CANDU reactor, this also allows individual fuel elements to be situated within the reactor core that are best suited to the amount of U-235 in the fuel element.\n\nThe amount of energy extracted from nuclear fuel is called its [[burnup]], which is expressed in terms of the heat energy produced per initial unit of fuel weight. Burn up is commonly expressed as megawatt days thermal per metric ton of initial heavy metal.\n\n==Nuclear safety concerns and controversy==\n{{Main|Nuclear safety}}\nNuclear safety covers the actions taken to prevent [[nuclear and radiation accidents and incidents]] or to limit their consequences. The nuclear power industry has improved the safety and performance of reactors, and has proposed new safer (but generally untested) reactor designs but there is no guarantee that the reactors will be designed, built and operated correctly.<ref name=globen/> Mistakes do occur and the designers of reactors at [[Timeline of the Fukushima nuclear accidents|Fukushima]] in Japan did not anticipate that a tsunami generated by an earthquake would disable the backup systems that were supposed to stabilize the reactor after the earthquake,<ref>{{cite web  |url=http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |title=The lessons of Fukushima  |author=Gusterson, Hugh  |date=16 March 2011  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists  |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606023005/http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/columnists/hugh-gusterson/the-lessons-of-fukushima  |archivedate=6 June 2013    }}</ref> despite multiple warnings by the NRG and the Japanese nuclear safety administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} According to [[UBS]] AG, the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] have cast doubt on whether even an advanced economy like Japan can master nuclear safety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |title=Fukushima Crisis Worse for Atomic Power Than Chernobyl, UBS Says |author=Paton, James |date=4 April 2011 |work=Bloomberg Businessweek |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515064305/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-04-04/fukushima-crisis-worse-for-atomic-power-than-chernobyl-ubs-says.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 }}</ref> Catastrophic scenarios involving terrorist attacks are also conceivable.<ref name=globen>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/efmh/jacobson/Articles/I/WWSEnergyPolicyPtI.pdf |title=Providing all Global Energy with Wind, Water, and Solar Power, Part I: Technologies, Energy Resources, Quantities and Areas of Infrastructure, and Materials |author1=Jacobson, Mark Z.  |author2=Delucchi, Mark A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2010 |work=Energy Policy |page=6 }}{{dead link|date=December 2015}}</ref> An interdisciplinary team from [[MIT]] has estimated that given the expected growth of nuclear power from 2005\u20132055, at least four serious nuclear accidents would be expected in that period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/nuclearpower/pdf/nuclearpower-full.pdf |title=The Future of Nuclear Power |author=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |year=2003 |page=48 }}</ref>\n\n==Nuclear accidents and controversy==\n{{See also|Lists of nuclear disasters and radioactive incidents}}\n[[File:Fukushima I by Digital Globe.jpg|thumb|Three of the reactors at [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|Fukushima I]] overheated, causing the coolant water to [[Water splitting|dissociate]] and led to the hydrogen explosions.

Radioactive decay of formerly more abundant uranium-235 over the time span of hundreds of millions of years has reduced the proportion of this naturally occurring fissile isotope to below the amount required to sustain a chain reaction with only plain water as a moderator.\n\nThe natural nuclear reactors formed when a uranium-rich mineral deposit became inundated with groundwater that acted as a neutron moderator, and a strong chain reaction took place. The water moderator would boil away as the reaction increased, slowing it back down again and preventing a meltdown. The fission reaction was sustained for hundreds of thousands of years, cycling on the order of hours to a few days.\n\nThese natural reactors are extensively studied by scientists interested in geologic radioactive waste disposal. They offer a case study of how radioactive isotopes migrate through the Earth's crust. This is a significant area of controversy as opponents of geologic waste disposal fear that isotopes from stored waste could end up in water supplies or be carried into the environment.\n\n== Emissions ==\nNuclear reactors produce [[tritium]] as part of normal operations, which is eventually released into the environment in trace quantities.\n\nAs an [[isotope]] of [[hydrogen]], tritium (T) frequently binds to oxygen and forms [[tritiated water|T<sub>2</sub>O]]. This molecule is chemically identical to [[water|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and so is both colorless and odorless, however the additional neutrons in the hydrogen nuclei cause the tritium to undergo [[beta decay]] with a [[half-life]] of 12.3 years. Despite being measurable, the tritium released by nuclear power plants is minimal. The United States [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|NRC]] estimates that a person drinking water for one year out of a well contaminated by what they would consider to be a significant tritiated water spill would receive a radiation dose of 0.3 millirem.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder>{{cite report|date=February 2016|title=Backgrounder: Tritium, Radiation Protection Limits, and Drinking Water Standards|url=https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0620/ML062020079.pdf|publisher=United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission|access-date=17 August 2017}}</ref> For comparison, this is an order of magnitude less than the 4 millirem a person receives on a round trip flight from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, a consequence of less atmospheric protection against highly energetic [[cosmic ray]]s at high altitudes.<ref name=NRC_Tritium_Backgrounder />\n\nThe amounts of [[strontium-90]] released from nuclear power plants under normal operations is so low as to be undetectable above natural background radiation.

The population is currently estimated at 300\u2013650 mature individuals though a survey  in 2009\u20132010 suggests the species has suffered a severe population decline in extent of its habitat and its population may now be as low as 60\u2013130 individuals. Most of the original forest has been cultivated or reforested with non-native timbers. Though little is known about this population crash as [[illegal logging]] and disturbance in the taita hills have been significantly reduced. However a serious drought in 2009  may have been a factor.  The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] considers this species to be [[critically endangered]] due to its tiny occupied range of {{convert|1.5|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is severely fragmented.<ref name=iucn/>\n\nThis is a medium\u2013sized arboreal warbler at {{cvt|14|\u2013|16|cm}} long and {{cvt|10|\u2013|12|g}} in weight with dark grey upperparts slightly darker shade on wings and tail. The throat and breast is black and the underparts are white to off-white. The eye is silvery white. Call is a repeated ''pillipp, pillippp'' similar to that of the bar\u2013throated apalis while the song of the male is a loud ''chwee, chwee'' or ''chewk, chewk, chewk'', with which the female may duet, giving a high pitched song cheek.<ref>[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]] [[Lynx Edicions]], [[Barcelona]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/species/index.html?action=SpcHTMDetails.asp&sid=7398&m=0 BirdLife Species Factsheet.]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1513955}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:apalis, Taita}}\n[[Category:Apalis|Taita apalis]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Kenya]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1938|Taita apalis]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n\n\n{{Cisticolidae-stub}}\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taita_apalis"}

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened.

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane. The musical went on to win the most Tony Awards in history with 12 wins.<ref>https://www.tonyawards.com/en_US/history/facts/index.html</ref> Broderick and Lane reprised their roles in the 2005 film adaptation of [[The Producers (2005 film)|the same name]].\n\nBroderick was reunited with his co-star from ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', [[Nathan Lane]], in ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', which opened on Broadway in October 2005.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

He had a fractured leg and ribs, a concussion, and a collapsed lung. Grey received minor injuries, including whiplash.\n\nBroderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he was in the wrong lane: \"I don't remember the day.

This was followed by a supporting role as [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay adopted son, David, in the [[Off-Broadway]] production of Fierstein's ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''; then, a good review by ''[[The New York Times]]'' theater critic [[Mel Gussow]] brought him to the attention of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Broderick commented on the effects of that review in a 2004 ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' interview:\n\n<blockquote>Before I knew it, I was like this guy in a hot play. And suddenly, all these doors opened. And it's only because Mel Gussow happened to come by right before it closed and happened to like it. It's just amazing. All these things have to line up that are out of your control.</blockquote>\n\nHe followed that with the role of Eugene Morris Jerome in the [[Neil Simon]] ''[[Eugene Trilogy]]'' including the plays ''[[Brighton Beach Memoirs]]'' and ''[[Biloxi Blues]]''. He won the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] for his role in ''Brighton Beach Memoirs''.\n\nHis first film role was also written by Neil Simon. Broderick debuted in ''[[Max Dugan Returns]]'' (1983).

At the age of 23, Broderick played a high school student who, with his girlfriend and best friend, [[truant|plays hooky]] and explores [[Chicago]]. The film is a 1980s comedy favorite, and is one of Broderick's best known roles (particularly with teenage audiences).  Also in 1987, he played Air Force research assistant Jimmy Garrett in ''[[Project X (1987 film)|Project X]]''. In 1988, Broderick played [[Harvey Fierstein]]'s gay lover, Alan, in the screen adaptation of ''[[Torch Song Trilogy]]''.\n\nHe starred in the 1989 film ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' alongside [[Cary Elwes]], [[Morgan Freeman]], and [[Denzel Washington]], where he received favorable reviews for his portrayal of the [[American Civil War]] officer [[Robert Gould Shaw]], whom Broderick incidentally physically resembled at the time.\n\nIn the 1990s, Broderick was the voice of the adult [[Simba]], in Disney's successful animated film ''[[The Lion King]]'', and also voiced Tack the Cobbler in [[Miramax]]'s controversial version of ''[[The Thief and the Cobbler]]'', which had originally been intended as a silent role. He won recognition for two [[black comedy|dark comedy]] roles. The first was that of a bachelor in ''[[The Cable Guy]]'' with [[Jim Carrey]]. The second was that of a high school teacher in Alexander Payne's ''[[Election (1999 film)|Election]]'' with [[Reese Witherspoon]].\n\nBroderick returned to Broadway as a [[musical theatre|musical]] star in the 1990s, winning a [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] for his performance in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''. Broderick then starred alongside [[Nathan Lane]] in the [[Mel Brooks]] 2001 stage version of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' which was a critical and financial success. He played Leopold \"Leo\" Bloom, an accountant who co-produces a musical designed to fail, but which turns out to be successful. Broderick was nominated for another [[Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical|Tony Award]] but lost to his fellow co-star Nathan Lane.

(U.S. TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]''. Broderick stated that his participation in the ancestry research program emotionally reconnected him with the role he played in ''Glory'' 22 years earlier, as he discovered a paternal great-great-grandfather, Robert Martindale, was a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] soldier. A veteran of the [[Battle of Gettysburg]], Martindale, who belonged to the [[20th Connecticut Infantry Regiment|20th Connecticut]], was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and was eventually interred in an unnamed grave at the [[Marietta National Cemetery]]. Having identified the grave with the help of historian Brad Quinlin, Broderick's research enabled him to give his ancestor his name back. In the same program, Broderick discovered that his paternal grandfather, James Joseph Broderick II, whom he had never known, had been a highly decorated combat medic in [[World War I]], having earned his distinctions during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].<ref name=\"huffingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n===1987 car crash===\nOn August 5, 1987, while driving a rented [[BMW 316]] in [[Enniskillen]], [[Northern Ireland]], Broderick crossed into the wrong lane and collided head-on with a [[Volvo]] driven by Anna Gallagher, 28,<ref>{{cite web |title=Broderick To Be Tried in Car Crash Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/08/arts/broderick-to-be-tried-in-car-crash-death.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=23 August 2019 |date=8 September 1987}}</ref> accompanied by her mother, Margaret Doherty, 63, killing both instantly.

Grey received minor injuries, including whiplash.\n\nBroderick told police he had no recollection of the crash and did not know why he was in the wrong lane: \"I don't remember the day.
