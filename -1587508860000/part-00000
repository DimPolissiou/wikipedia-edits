The red, white and blue colour scheme has traditionally been the colour combination of sporting teams representing Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tricolours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic design has always been maintained.\n\nDuring World War II, the design of the jersey was modified because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=12246|title=War Jersey In-Store NOW|accessdate=14 April 2009|publisher=Sydney Roosters|date=31 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314064903/http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=12246|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref> This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.<ref name=cw23/>\n\nFacing design clashes with other teams in the 1990s, the club adopted a jersey with a similar design to what became known as the \"away jersey\", replacing the blue backing with white, and the outer red stripe with blue. As the club entered the new century, the team began to wear a \"foundation jersey\". Although the design differs slightly from the jersey worn in the inaugural 1908 season, it did feature the traditional horizontal striped-design. This jersey is normally worn when the Sydney Roosters face traditional rivals, such as the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], or on special occasions such as [[Anzac Day]] when the team meets the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], the product of a team partly formed by the [[St. George Dragons]].\n\n==Rivals==\n\nMain: [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]], [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]].\n\nMinor: [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]], [[Melbourne Storm]], [[Brisbane Broncos]], [[Canberra Raiders]], [[New Zealand Warriors]].\n\n==Geographic area==\nThe Sydney Roosters, namely the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club was formed, under its articles of association with the NSWRL, to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, Paddington, Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities, as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD. Despite some junior Rugby League boundaries being redrawn over the 107-year history of the code in Australia, these articles of association remain unchanged. As such, the Roosters represent a small area of Sydney.  The Roosters home turf is also home to a large number of supporters of rival codes and thus is the most competitive sporting market in Australia, with the Roosters flying the flag for Rugby League in Sydney's east.\n\n==Stadium==\nMost sources suggest that the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Royal Agricultural Ground]] was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] from 1911 onwards.<ref name=cw16/><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/nb/coop/bryce/records.html The Australian Rugby League records] ''Co-op'' Retrieved 6 October 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/timeline_iframe.php  |title=Timeline |publisher=Sydney Roosters |accessdate=6 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070501131823/http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/timeline_iframe.php |archivedate = 1 May 2007}}</ref> It was here that the team played all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was demolished with the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] No. 2 to make way for Sydney's main rectangular field, the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.cricinfo.com/australia/content/ground/56546.html |title=Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=6 October 2006}}</ref> In 1987, games were moved away to the [[Newtown Jets]]' home ground, [[Henson Park]], temporarily to await the completion of the Sydney Football Stadium.

Sydney]]. The club competes in the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) competition and is one of the oldest and most successful clubs. The Roosters have won fifteen [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|New South Wales Rugby League]] (NSWRL) and National Rugby League titles, and several other competitions. As a franchise, the Eastern Suburbs/Sydney City/Sydney Roosters have won 15 premierships, tying them with the St George Dragons. Only [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]] have won more premierships. The club holds the record for having the most wins and the second greatest margin of victory in a match in Australian rugby league history, and has won more minor premierships than any other club. The Roosters is one of only two clubs (the other being the [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]] in 1999) to finish runners-up in its inaugural season. The Eastern Suburbs DRLFC is the only club to have played in each and every season at the elite level, and since the 1970s has often been dubbed the \"glamour club\" of the league.<ref>{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Rakic|title=There's still reason to hate those Roosters: Champion|url=http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-league/league-news/theres-still-reason-to-hate-those-roosters-champion-20100313-q55o.html|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=14 March 2010|accessdate=13 May 2015}}</ref> Coached by [[Trent Robinson]] along with captains [[Boyd Cordner]] and [[Jake Friend]], the Roosters play their home games at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n\nThe club was founded in 1908 in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], Sydney, as Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club; in 1995 the club's name was changed to the Sydney City Roosters, and in 2000 to the Sydney Roosters. The [[Bondi Junction, New South Wales|Bondi Junction]] and [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]]-based Roosters have a long-standing and fierce rivalry with other Sydney-based clubs, especially the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], a fellow foundation club based in neighbouring [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].<ref>In Australia, a foundation club is one that played in the first season of a competition. Eastern Suburbs played in the first season of the New South Wales Rugby League premiership in 1908, the predecessor to the National Rugby League competition. Notwithstanding its branding as the Sydney Roosters, the official name of the club, holder of the NRL licence, remains the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club, the same licensee since 1908. As such, much of the club's merchandise and paraphernalia, especially those marketed directly to long-serving and dedicated members, includes the insignia ESDRLFC.</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Sydney Roosters}}\nThe Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC) was formed on 24 January 1908<ref name=\"rl1908\" /> at a meeting at the Paddington Town Hall in Sydney<ref name=cw16>Collis and Whiticker, p. 16.</ref> after it was decided that the district should enter a team in the newly formed [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]].<ref name=cw12>Collis and Whiticker, p. 12.</ref> The ESDRLFC was formed, under its articles of association with the NSWRL, to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, Paddington, Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities, as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD.

The red, white and blue colour scheme has traditionally been the colour combination of sporting teams representing Sydney's Eastern Suburbs. Eastern Suburbs Rugby League club adopted these colours in 1908, with its predecessor Rugby Union club, also known as Eastern Suburbs in the Sydney club Rugby Union, having played in the tricolours. The jersey worn in the first premiership season consisted of several hoops; red stripes dominated over consecutive smaller white and blue stripes. Although the width and the order of these stripes have changed, the basic design has always been maintained.\n\nDuring World War II, the design of the jersey was modified because the dye used to colour jerseys was needed for the war effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=12246|title=War Jersey In-Store NOW|accessdate=14 April 2009|publisher=Sydney Roosters|date=31 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314064903/http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=12246|archivedate=14 March 2012}}</ref> This saw Eastern Suburbs playing in different colours and an altered design. Instead of using the traditional hoops, the side used a sky-blue based jersey and a red and white V-strip around the collar. This is the only noted time in the club's history where the traditional deep blue, red and white combination was absent from the jersey. After the war, the V-strip design reverted to the original blue that had been present in the original jerseys, and the single red and white stripes around the shirt's chest were incorporated with a single white stripe surrounded by a red stripe on either side. This jersey appeared in the 1950s and remains the team's base design.<ref name=cw23/>\n\nFacing design clashes with other teams in the 1990s, the club adopted a jersey with a similar design to what became known as the \"away jersey\", replacing the blue backing with white, and the outer red stripe with blue. As the club entered the new century, the team began to wear a \"foundation jersey\". Although the design differs slightly from the jersey worn in the inaugural 1908 season, it did feature the traditional horizontal striped-design. This jersey is normally worn when the Sydney Roosters face traditional rivals, such as the [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], or on special occasions such as [[Anzac Day]] when the team meets the [[St George Illawarra Dragons]], the product of a team partly formed by the [[St. George Dragons]].\n\n==Rivals==\n\nMain: [[South Sydney Rabbitohs]], [[St. George Illawarra Dragons]], [[Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs]].\n\nMinor: [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Manly Warringah Sea Eagles]], [[Melbourne Storm]], [[Brisbane Broncos]], [[Canberra Raiders]], [[New Zealand Warriors]].\n\n==Geographic area==\nThe Sydney Roosters, namely the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club was formed, under its articles of association with the NSWRL, to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, Paddington, Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities, as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD. Despite some junior Rugby League boundaries being redrawn over the 107-year history of the code in Australia, these articles of association remain unchanged. As such, the Roosters represent a small area of Sydney.  The Roosters home turf is also home to a large number of supporters of rival codes and thus is the most competitive sporting market in Australia, with the Roosters flying the flag for Rugby League in Sydney's east.\n\n==Stadium==\nMost sources suggest that the [[Sydney Showground (Moore Park)|Royal Agricultural Ground]] was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the [[Sydney Sports Ground]] from 1911 onwards.<ref name=cw16/><ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/nb/coop/bryce/records.html The Australian Rugby League records] ''Co-op'' Retrieved 6 October 2006.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/timeline_iframe.php  |title=Timeline |publisher=Sydney Roosters |accessdate=6 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070501131823/http://www.sydneyroosters.com.au/100years/timeline_iframe.php |archivedate = 1 May 2007}}</ref> It was here that the team played all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was demolished with the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] No. 2 to make way for Sydney's main rectangular field, the [[Sydney Football Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://content.cricinfo.com/australia/content/ground/56546.html |title=Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 |publisher=[[ESPNcricinfo]] |accessdate=6 October 2006}}</ref> In 1987, games were moved away to the [[Newtown Jets]]' home ground, [[Henson Park]], temporarily to await the completion of the Sydney Football Stadium.

By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

Netflix capitalized on the success of the DVD and its rapid expansion into United States homes, integrating the potential of the Internet and e-commerce to provide services and catalogs that bricks-and-mortar retailers could not compete with. Netflix also operates an online affiliate program which has helped to build online sales for DVD rentals as well.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now.

This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the media service}}\n{{short description|Internet video streaming and DVD-by-mail service with original and licensed content}}\n{{Use American English|date=May 2019}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox dot-com company\n| name = Netflix, Inc.\n| logo = [[File:Netflix 2015 logo.svg|frameless|upright]]\n| screenshot =Netflix -

The original idea was a \"Netflix box\" that could download movies overnight, and be ready to watch the next day. By 2005, they had acquired movie rights and designed the box and service, and were ready to go public with it. But after discovering YouTube, and witnessing how popular streaming services were despite the lack of high-definition content, the concept of using a hardware device was scrapped and replaced with a streaming concept instead, a project that was completed in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|title=The inside story of how Netflix transitioned to digital video after seeing the power of YouTube|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223044036/https://www.recode.net/2017/9/13/16288364/streampunks-book-excerpt-youtube-netflix-pivot-video|archivedate=December 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nNetflix developed and maintains an extensive personalized video-recommendation system based on ratings and reviews by its customers.

But when they started to offer streaming content for free to its subscribers in 2007, it could offer no more than about 1000 movies and TV-shows, just 1% compared to its more than 100,000 different DVD titles. Yet as the popularity kept growing, the number of titles available for streaming was increasing as well and had reached 12,000 movies and shows in June 2009. One of the key things about Netflix was that it had a recommendation system known as cinematch, which not only got viewers to remain attached to the service, by creating a switching cost, but it also brought out those movies which were underrated so that customers could view those movies too from their recommendations. This was an attribute that not only benefited Netflix but also benefited its viewers and those studios which were minor compared to others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profkenhoma.wordpress.com/2009/06/23/netflix-managing-a-still-hot-business-as-its-time-runs-out/|title=Netflix \u2013 Managing a still-hot business as its time runs out.|date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2013, Netflix reported that it had added two million United States customers during the fourth quarter of 2012, with a total of 27.1&nbsp;million United States streaming customers, and 29.4&nbsp;million total streaming customers.

If the film had been in theaters it would have made the equivalent of $556&nbsp;million based on a $9 ticket price. Critics cast doubt that this number of people would have watched the film given that it would have made the film more popular than the finale of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/06/netflix-adam-sandler-jennifer-aniston-viewer-data?verso=true|title=A Mystery Indeed Netflix Claims New Adam Sandler, Jennifer Aniston Movie Drew Record Views|work=Vanity Fair|date=June 19, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, Netflix changed the method it used to estimate viewers for a show. Prior to this, Netflix counted a viewer towards viewership if they watched 70% of the show; with the new change, a viewer need only watch two minutes of the show to count. Netflix stated the two-minute metric indicated that the viewer chose to watch the show, and thus counted in its viewership. This also eliminated factors such as length of the work, so that both short and long works would be treated equally. In a statement to shareholders, Netflix estimated this increased viewership by 35% on average.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/6-underground-viewed-by-83-million-members-netflix-says-1271794 | title = Michael Bay's '6 Underground' Viewed by 83 Million Members, Netflix Says | first = Pamela | last = McClintock | date = January 21, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> This new metric was criticized as commentators felt two minutes was far too little of any show to engage a viewer, and instead the move by Netflix was to artificially increase viewership to put their numbers on par with television networks and movie ticket sales, such as trying to compare viewership of ''[[The Witcher (TV series)|The Witcher]]'' with that of HBO's ''[[Game of Thrones (TV series)|Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/story/netflix-viewership-two-minutes/ | title = Netflix's Big Viewership Numbers Mean Very Little | first = Tyler | last = Coates | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnet.com/news/netflix-viewership-stats-just-got-more-meaningless-witcher-6-underground/ | title = Netflix viewership stats just got more meaningless | first= Joan | last =Solsman | date = January 22, 2020 | accessdate = January 23, 2020  |work = [[CNet]] }}</ref>\n\n== Effects and legacy ==\nThe rise of Netflix has affected the way that audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt points out that the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, so an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week because they can just continue into the next episode.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt/|title=What Television Will Look Like in 2025, According to Netflix|work=Wired|accessdate=July 11, 2014|date=May 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706052711/http://www.wired.com/2014/05/neil-hunt|archivedate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30-minute or 60-minute time slots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform which allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, eliminates the need for a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a \"season\". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Netflix|url=http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|title=Netflix's Long Term View|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606120536/http://ir.netflix.com/long-term-view.cfm|archivedate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>\n\nNetflix has strayed from the traditional necessary production of a pilot episode to establish the characters and create arbitrary cliffhangers to prove to the network that the concept of the show will be successful. Kevin Spacey spoke at the [[Edinburgh International Television Festival]] about how the new Netflix model was effective for the production of ''House of Cards'': \"Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series.'\" Traditional networks are unwilling to risk millions of dollars on shows without first seeing a pilot, but Spacey points out that 113 pilots were made in 2012; 35 of them were chosen to go to air, 13 were renewed, and most are gone now. The total cost of this is somewhere between $300&nbsp;million and $400&nbsp;million, which makes Netflix's deal for ''House of Cards'' extremely cost effective, according to Spacey.<ref>{{cite web|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703195214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ukYf_xvgc|archivedate=July 3, 2015}}</ref> Netflix's subscription fee also eliminates the need for commercials, so they do not need to appease advertisers to fund their original content, a model similar to pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.\n\nThe Netflix model has also affected viewers' expectations. According to a 2013 Nielsen survey, more than 60-percent of Americans said that they binge-watch shows, and nearly 8 out of 10 Americans have used technology to watch their favorite shows on their own schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=February 14, 2014|title=House of Cards|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302041456/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/2/14/house-of-cards-netflixtelevision.html|archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref> Netflix has continued to release its original content by making the whole season available at once, acknowledging changing viewer habits. This allows audiences to watch episodes at a time of their choosing rather than having to watch just one episode a week at a specific scheduled time; this effectively gives its subscribers freedom and control over when to watch the next episode at their own pace.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|San Francisco Bay Area|Companies|Film}}\n* [[Hulu]]\n* [[List of original programs distributed by Netflix]]\n* [[Streaming television]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=McDonald |first1=Kevin |last2=Smith- Rowsey |first2=Daniel |title=The Netflix Effect |publisher=Bloomsbury Academic & Professional |isbn=9781501309441 |pages=270 |edition=1st}}\n{{Refend}}\n; Videos:\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0FlrveCts|title=Why Netflix Is Struggling In India|publisher=[[CNBC]]|date=December 11, 2018}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* {{Official website|name=Netflix}}\n*[[List of accolades received by Netflix]]\n{{Finance links\n| name = Netflix\n| symbol = NFLX\n| sec_cik = NFLX\n| yahoo = NFLX\n| google = NFLX\n}}\n{{Netflix|state=collapsed}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Netflix programming\n|titlestyle=background:#ccccff\n|list1=\n{{Netflix original current series|state=collapsed}}\n{{Netflix original continuation series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original ended series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix original upcoming series|state=autocollapse}}\n{{Netflix specials|state=collapsed}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes|list1=\n{{VOD services}}\n{{NASDAQ-100}}\n{{Video rental shops}}\n{{CATV USA|state=collapsed}}\n{{Major Internet companies}}\n{{Film Studio}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Netflix| ]]\n[[Category:1997 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:2002 initial public offerings]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California]]\n[[Category:Technology companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Software companies based in the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n[[Category:Los Gatos, California]]\n[[Category:Companies in the NASDAQ-100 Index]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on NASDAQ]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 1997]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1997]]\n[[Category:Members of the Motion Picture Association of America]]\n[[Category:Online retailers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Recommender systems]]\n[[Category:TvOS software]]\n[[Category:Universal Windows Platform apps]]\n[[Category:Video rental services]]\n[[Category:Internet television streaming services]]\n[[Category:Subscription video on demand services]]\n[[Category:PlayStation 4 software]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Srblackbird", "label": "safe", "comment": "link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix"}
