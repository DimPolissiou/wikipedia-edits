It is located to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston]] and [[Montreal]], among other destinations. Ottawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. \n\nIt was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa Station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa Station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967. In 2000, the [[Royal Architectural Institute of Canada]] named the station as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium.<ref name=\"RAIC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|title=Cultural consequence|last=Cook|first=Maria|work=Ottawa Citizen|publisher=Canwest|date=11 May 2000|accessdate=11 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090211/http://www.ty-a.ca/Citizen/top500.htm|archivedate=30 May 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Union Station Ottawa a034379.jpg|thumb|Ottawa's former Union Station in the 1920's]]\nOttawa's trains once came into the large downtown [[Senate of Canada Building|Union Station]] (active 1912-1966), a short distance from the [[Parliament Hill|Parliament buildings]] and south of the [[Ch\u00e2teau Laurier]] Hotel.

It was published at the end of this year.\nIt is, together with [[Leopoldo Alas y Ure\u00f1a]]'s ''[[La Regenta]]'' (The Judge's Wife), one of the most popular and representative novels of Spanish literary [[Literary realism|realism]]. Born in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Canary Islands]], the author went to [[Madrid]], the capital, to study law at age 18. There he would create a literary world that was present in almost all his writings. The novel created a sensation upon its release because of its scathing critique of the Spanish middle class, and for its frank sexuality. While criticized by political and religious leaders, it was praised by peers of Gald\u00f3s for its realistic depiction of life amongst all classes in 19th century Madrid.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe story revolves around Fortunata and Jacinta, two women of different classes who claim Juanito Santa Cruz as their husband. Juanito, the scion of a wealthy family, goes around carousing and womanizing with his friends. In one of these episodes, he is taken with Fortunata, a young woman of the lower class. This encounter ends when Juanito grows bored of Fortunata and disappears from her life leaving her pregnant. Worried about Juanito's lifestyle, his mother decides to marry him to his cousin Jacinta and arranges a series of meetings between them that end in marriage. During their honeymoon, he tells her about his experiences in the poor neighbourhoods of Madrid and talks to her about Fortunata and how sorry he is for mistreating her. Jacinta forgives him, but remains curious about his infidelity.\n\nTime passes and Jacinta fails to get pregnant. She and the rest of the family become obsessed with this.\n\nIdo del Sagrario is a poor man whom Juanito invites to the house with the intention of humiliating him for his own amusement. He shows up at the Santa Cruz home one day and informs Jacinta that he knows of a son that Juanito had with Fortunata. Jacinta becomes very excited about the idea of having her husband's child. After consulting with Guillermina Pacheco (a saintly neighbour), the two women go to one of Madrid's poor neighbourhoods to see the boy, \"Pitus\u00edn\". The baby's guardian is Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo, uncle of Fortunata, from whom they end up buying the wild boy.\n\n[[File:FortunatayJacinta.jpg|thumb|First edition by La Guindalera editors, 1887 ([[Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a]]).]]\nWhen Jacinta talks to her husband about the \"adoption\", the discussion turns farcical. Juanito tells her that Pitus\u00edn cannot be his son, since his baby died years ago. Fortunata herself had asked for his help when the baby got sick but it was too late and they could only watch him die. Pitus\u00edn is then Jos\u00e9 Izquierdo's step-grandson. Jacinta rallies and tries to raise Pitus\u00edn, but her despair from the deception and the wild manners of the boy are too much for her and she ends up sending him to an orphanage.\n\nMeanwhile, Fortunata has been living with various men, and living badly. If one man did not deceive her, he beat her, or abandoned her at the first opportunity. She was in Barcelona for a time, and on her return she moved in with Feliciana, an acquaintance of hers. Feliciana's boyfriend usually came to her house to visit with a friend of his, Maximiliano (\"Maxi\") Rub\u00edn. It is there that Rub\u00edn falls hopelessly in love with Fortunata. Soon the young man proposes to maintain her, and Fortunata, seeing this as an opportunity to escape her situation, accepts his offer.\n\nMaxi lives with his aunt, Do\u00f1a Lupe and works in a pharmacy while he studies chemistry. He is also delicate and prone to sicknesses, and Fortunata realises that they will never have children together. As his relationship with Fortunata progresses, he wants to marry her and consults his aunt and brothers. Everyone agrees that Fortunata should spend some time at Las Micaelas, a convent that houses and tries to reform \"fallen\" women. There Fortunata becomes friends with Mauricia \"La Dura\", an alcoholic seamstress. She also sees Jacinta, one of the convent's wealthy patronesses, for the first time.\n\nAfter the prescribed time passes, Fortunata and Maxi marry. However, a trap awaits Fortunata in her new home: Juanito Santa Cruz has bought the apartment next door, and he bribes the newlyweds' servant to sow discord between the couple. It does not take long before Fortunata takes the bait and leaves her husband. Maxi returns to his aunt's house, and Fortunata moves into the apartment paid for by Juanito.\n\nWith time, Juanito grows tired of Fortunata again and leaves, this time leaving her a small sum to live on for a while. Fortunata bumps into Don Evaristo Feijoo, friend of her brother-in-law Juan Pablo. Feijoo proposes to become Fortunata's protector and lover and pays for her lodging and upkeep. He also instructs her, and she becomes wiser and more cultured under his influence. This works out until Feijoo begins to think he is too old and fears that once he is dead Fortunata will find herself once again in the gutter. Feijoo advises her to return to her husband's house, and, after Feijoo subtly prepares the ground for her, she does.\n\nSeeing Fortunata reformed and back with her husband makes Juanito Santa Cruz want her once again. Fortunata, without even fleeing from the house, falls for him once more. Fortunata and Jacinta finally meet face to face and confront each other. Jacinta tries to dismiss Fortunata as a nobody but Fortunata declares herself to be the true wife of Juanito, since she met him first and had a child by him. Jacinta is hurt by this and Fortunata decides to have another child with Juanito.\n\nMaxi gradually loses his mind and develops a fatalistic desire to kill himself and Fortunata, as well as other members of the family, to \"free\" them from what he sees as the \"beast\", i.e. life and its associated suffering. Meanwhile, Juanito begins to tire of Fortunata yet again. One day, in his state of insanity, Maxi realises that his wife is pregnant. Rather than explain to Do\u00f1a Lupe what has happened, Fortunata simply gets out of the house and returns to her Aunt Segunda, at the place she was raised. She has there her second child, attended by a doctor who is a friend of the Rub\u00edns and of Segismundo Ballester, a co-worker of Maxi's from the pharmacy who is also in love with her. Jacinta soon learns this and sends an emissary to Fortunata to ask her for her child, in adoption. Fortunata adamantly refuses.\n\nMaxi is told that Fortunata is dead. He refuses to believe this and is able to figure out where she is following Segismundo. He meets her and her baby and, out of spite, tells her that Juanito Santa Cruz was and is still betraying her with Aurora, a family friend of the Rub\u00edns and an intimate friend of Fortunata. As soon as she finds herself alone at home, Fortunata goes to Aurora's shop and has a fight with her. The fight causes Fortunata a haemorrhage. Seeing that she is dying, Fortunata arranges to give the custody of her child to Jacinta.\n\nJacinta receives the child gladly and also learns the true reason of Fortunata's death and of her husband's many betrayals. She will not forgive him any longer and their marriage will be in name only hereafter. The same day of Fortunata's funeral, they also bury Feijoo.\nAfter finally being convinced Fortunata is dead Maxi asks to be sent to a monastery. Maxi is in fact finally sent to the insane asylum at [[Legan\u00e9s]] by his family, who attempt to convince him it is in fact the monastery he wished to enter; despite seeing through their deception he is now too apathetic and fatalistic to object to such treatment and is resigned to his fate.\n\n==Main characters==\n* Fortunata \u2013 Young woman of the lower class, she is essentially illiterate and ignorant.\n* Juanito Santa Cruz \u2013 Pampered only child of a wealthy bourgeois Madrid family\n* Jacinta \u2013 Wife and cousin of Juanito Santa Cruz.

The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC-Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian-values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based-education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila. During this time, several of the De La Salle boys along with the Ateneo boys had to set their school rivalry aside and share their classrooms with each other along with several other students from various neighboring schools. Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

On February 7, 1945, Brother Egbert Xavier Kelly FSC was abducted by Japanese soldiers, and was never seen again; he was believed to have been mercilessly tortured and killed.

The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC-Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian-values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian-values-based-education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based-education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila.

Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

Rah! Boys, then in 1926 as the LSC Yell Commanders. The DLSC Squad was the first and oldest Collegiate Coed Spirit Team in the Philippines. Decades later on as the post-war DLSC cheerleading Squad then in the 80's as the DLSU Pep Squad in the UAAP prior to its 2008 renaming by Br. Bernie Oca, FSC as the present DLSU AN1MO! SQUAD. The DLSU Green & White Spirit Team has since then won five cheer dance podium finishes in the span of its UAAP participation, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2011 and 2013. The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

Since the administration of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] (1961\u20131965), Laurel has been officially recognized by later administrations as a former president of the Philippines.\nHIS FROM BATANGAS HAHAHA\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Jose Laurel.JPG|thumb|left|Laurel in 1922, when he was an attorney.]]\n\nJos\u00e9 Paciano Laurel y Garc\u00eda was born on March 9, 1891 in the town of [[Tanauan, Batangas]]. His parents were [[Sotero Laurel I]] and [[Jacoba Garc\u00eda]]. His father had been an official in the revolutionary government of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and a signatory to the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1899 Malolos Constitution]].\n\nWhile a teen, Laurel was indicted for attempted murder when he almost killed a rival suitor of the girl he stole a kiss from with a [[Butterfly knife|fan knife]]. While studying and finishing [[law school]], he argued for and received an acquittal.<ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1912/mar1912/gr_l-7037_1912.html G.R.

Malcolm]], whom he would later succeed on the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]. He then obtained a [[Master of Laws]] degree from [[University of Santo Tomas]] in 1919. Laurel then attended [[Yale Law School]], where he obtained his [[J.S.D.]] degree.\n\nLaurel began his life in public service while a student, as a messenger in the Bureau of Forestry then as a clerk in the Code Committee tasked with the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Philippine laws. During his work for the Code Committee, he was introduced to its head, [[Thomas A. Street]], a future [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justice]] who would be a mentor to the young Laurel.<ref>American Colonial Careerist, p. 104</ref>\n\nUpon his return from [[Yale University|Yale]], Laurel was appointed first as Undersecretary of the Interior Department, then promoted as [[Department of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Secretary of the Interior]] in 1922. In that post, he would frequently clash with the American [[Governor-General]] [[Leonard Wood]], and eventually, in 1923, resign from his position together with other Cabinet members in protest of Wood's administration. His clashes with Wood solidified Laurel's nationalist credentials.\n\nLaurel was a member of the Philippine fraternity [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXsMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Jos%C3%A9+P.+Laurel%22+upsilon&dq=%22Jos%C3%A9+P.+Laurel%22+upsilon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBvLCw6obWAhXo7oMKHaclCocQ6AEIJjAA|title=The Fookien Times Philippines Yearbook|last=Company|first=Fookien Times Publishing|date=1986|publisher=Fookien Times|year=|isbn=9789710503506|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Senator and Congressman of the Philippines==\nIn 1925 Laurel was elected to the [[Philippine Senate]]. He would serve for one term before losing his re-election bid in 1931 to [[Claro M. Recto]].<ref name=\"Supreme Court p. 175\">Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 175</ref> He retired to private practice, but by 1934, he was again elected to public office, this time as a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Hailed as one of the \"Seven Wise Men of the Convention\", he would sponsor the provisions on the Bill of Rights.<ref name=\"Supreme Court p. 175\"/> Following the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], Laurel was appointed [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] on February 29, 1936.\n\n==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court==\nLaurel's Supreme Court tenure may have been overshadowed by his presidency, yet he remains one of the most important Supreme Court justices in Philippine history. He authored several leading cases still analyzed to this day that defined the parameters of the branches of government as well as their powers.\n\n[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html ''Angara v. Electoral Commission''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|63 Phil. 139 (1936)]], which is considered as the Philippine equivalent of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', [[case citation|5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)]], is Laurel's most important contribution to jurisprudence and even the rule of law in the Philippines. In affirming that the Court had [[jurisdiction]] to review the rulings of the Electoral Commission organized under the [[Congress of the Philippines|National Assembly]], the Court, through Justice Laurel's [[opinion]], firmly entrenched the power of Philippine courts to engage in [[judicial review]] of the acts of the other branches of government, and to interpret the Constitution. Held the Court, through Laurel:\n<blockquote>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html|title=G.R. No. L-45081|website=lawphil.net|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother highly influential decision penned by Laurel was [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1940/feb1940/gr_l-46496_1940.html ''Ang Tibay v. CIR''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|69 Phil. 635 (1940)]]. The Court acknowledged in that case that the substantive and procedural requirements before proceedings in administrative agencies, such as labor relations courts, were more flexible than those in judicial proceedings. At the same time, the Court still asserted that the right to [[due process of law]] must be observed, and enumerated the \"cardinal primary rights\" that must be respected in administrative proceedings. Since then, these \"cardinal primary rights\" have stood as the standard in testing due process claims in administrative cases.\n\n''Calalang v. Williams'', [[Case citation#The Philippines|70 Phil. 726 (1940)]] was a seemingly innocuous case involving a challenge raised by a private citizen to a traffic regulation banning [[kalesa]]s from [[Manila]] streets during certain afternoon hours. The Court, through Laurel, upheld the regulation as within the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the government. But in rejecting the claim that the regulation was violative of [[social justice]], Laurel would respond with what would become his most famous [[aphorism]], which is to this day widely quoted by judges and memorized by Filipino law students:\n<blockquote>Social justice is neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy, but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated. Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of [[salus populi est suprema lex]]. Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about \"the greatest good to the greatest number.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/1940decemberdecisions.php?id=237|title=G.R.

After the war, he would be denounced by the pro-American sectors{{Who|date=November 2011}} as a [[collaborationism|war collaborator]] or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by [[Manuel Roxas#Amnesty Proclamation|President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation]].<ref name=\"GovPH-Proc51\">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 51, s. 1948 {{!}} GOVPH |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321050055/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |archivedate=21 March 2019}}</ref> However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence.

Quezon]] first fled to [[Bataan]] and then to the United States to establish a government-in-exile.  Quezon ordered Laurel, Vargas and other cabinet members to stay. Laurel's prewar, close relationship with Japanese officials (a son had been sent to study at the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in Tokyo, and Laurel had received an honorary doctorate from Tokyo University), placed him in a good position to interact with the Japanese occupation forces.\n\nLaurel was among the Commonwealth officials instructed by the Japanese Imperial Army to form a provisional government when they invaded and occupied the country. He cooperated with the Japanese, in contrast to Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos|Abad Santos]], who was shot for refusing to cooperate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/sc/cj/jose-abad-santos/the-execution-of-jose-abad-santos/ |title=The execution of Jose Abad Santos &#124; Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |publisher=Officialgazette.gov.ph |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2019-09-28}}</ref> Because he was well known to the Japanese as a critic of US rule, as well as having demonstrated a willingness to serve under the Japanese Military Administration, he held a series of high posts in 1942\u20131943. Under vigorous Japanese influence, the National Assembly selected Laurel to serve as President in 1943.\n\n===Domestic policies===\n\n====Economy====\nDuring Laurel's tenure as President, [[hunger]] was the main worry. Prices of essential commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring [[consumer]]s' [[good (economics)|goods]] under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, [[guerrilla]] activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.<ref name=\"Molina, Antonio 1961\">Molina, Antonio.

Correspondence between the diplomats of the Vatican and Japan told that the Holy See did not wish to recognize any new states for the duration of the War. Despite this, Laurel still sought to appeal to the Pope about instating Filipinos into the Church hierarchy. <ref>''Le pr\u00e9sident des Iles Philippines Laurel au pape Pie XII''. Rome, 11 March 1944. (A.E.S. 1927/44). '''Acts and Documents of the Holy See Relative to the Second World War Vol. 11''' pp. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/actes/documents/Volume-7.pdf#page=232 232-234]</ref>\n{{Quote|text=As the Head of the Republic of Philippines,' I take liberty of voicing to Your Holiness the desire and sentiments of eighteen million Filipinos, the majority of whom are ardent Catholics, with respect to the matter which vitally affects the administration of the Catholic Church in Philippines, and which may have far reaching effects on their religious faith. I refer to Filipinization of the Catholic hierarchy and clergy in Philippines.\n\nYour Holiness will remember that the movement for Filipinization of the clergy furnished one of the prime motivations of our revolution against Spain; that with overthrow of Spanish sovereignty only 250 out of 17,000 Spanish friars assigned to Philippines in 1898 were retained; that pursuant to the policy announced by the Holy See, Spanish bishops were replaced by American Catholic bishops; that during the American regime more missionaries of different nationalities came to the country; and that at present we have five Bishops and two Apostolic Prefects of foreign nationalities, while in certain provinces, such as Surigao, Agusan, Antique, Misamis Oriental, Mindoro, Bukidnon, Davao, Cotabato, Palawan and Mountain Province, parishes are still under the charge of foreign friars and missionaries. Now that the independence of Philippines has been finally achieved, the Republic of Philippines, though it fundamentally recognizes the separation of Church and State, can no longer remain indifferent to a long-felt need to Filipinize the local Catholic hierarchy and clergy. \n\nIn advocating this reform, the Filipino people are not moved by any spirit of animosity or hostility against any race or nationality, but they are inspired solely by the desire to win a just recognition for the Filipino race in their own country and to secure a vindication of capacity of Filipinos to manage their own affairs, temporal or spiritual. The projected measure can be achieved without in the least prejudicing interests, or sacrificing the creed or doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Without in any way presuming to invade an ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Philippines, it is my honest belief that the spread of Catholicism among our non-Christian brethren and consequently increase of its followers in this country. This, in my opinion, is in consonance with the desire of His Holiness Pope Pius XI when he said:\n\n\u00abFrom the fact that the Roman Pontiff has entrusted to you and to your helpers a task of preaching Christian religion to pagan nations, you ought not to conclude that the role of native clergy is solely that of assisting missionaries in minor matters and in some sort of completing their work\u00bb.\n\nWhat is the object of these holy missions, we ask, except that the Church of Christ may be instituted and established in those boundless regions? And from what shall the Church be built up today among heathens, except from those elements out of which it was built up among us that is unless it is composed of people, clergy and religious men and women recruited from their own country? Why should native clergy be prevented from cultivating their country which is their own native soil that is, from governing their own people? In propagation of Faith, a Filipino priest, by reason of his birth and temper, his sentiments and interests, is in far better position to carry on his mission than a stranger. As a matter of fact, he would know better than any foreigner the best method of approach to his own people and thus he would often have access where an alien priest could never gain an entrance. Moreover foreign missionaries, on account of their imperfect knowledge of Filipino language, are frequently prevented from expressing themselves fully and having themselves clearly understood, as a result of which, force and efficacy of their teachings are greatly weakened. It will also be a source of genuine satisfaction and lasting inspiration for Filipino people to see a Filipino at the head of the Catholic Church in Philippines, a Filipino priest in every parish and a Filipino missionary in every remote corner of the country. Certainly, it will foster development of national clergy of superior stamp and it will serve as an ideal incentive for Filipino clergy to work to the highest degree of perfection\nand the same time to encourage vocations to religious and sacerdotal life.\n\nIn view of foregoing considerations, I beg to convey and reiterate the desire and request of my people that it is, as it has always been, their cherished hope that after more than four centuries of Catholicism in Philippines, Your Holiness will see the wisdom of principle invoked and grant their petition for complete Filipinization of Catholic hierarchy and clergy in their own country.|author=Jose P.

He was the president of the [[Second Philippine Republic]], a Japanese [[puppet state]] when occupied during World War II, from 1943 to 1945. Since the administration of President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] (1961\u20131965), Laurel has been officially recognized by later administrations as a former president of the Philippines.\n\n==Early life and career==\n[[File:Jose Laurel.JPG|thumb|left|Laurel in 1922, when he was an attorney.]]\n\nJos\u00e9 Paciano Laurel y Garc\u00eda was born on March 9, 1891 in the town of [[Tanauan, Batangas]]. His parents were [[Sotero Laurel I]] and [[Jacoba Garc\u00eda]]. His father had been an official in the revolutionary government of [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] and a signatory to the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1899 Malolos Constitution]].\n\nWhile a teen, Laurel was indicted for attempted murder when he almost killed a rival suitor of the girl he stole a kiss from with a [[Butterfly knife|fan knife]]. While studying and finishing [[law school]], he argued for and received an acquittal.<ref>[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1912/mar1912/gr_l-7037_1912.html G.R. No. L-7037, March 15, 1912]</ref>\n\nLaurel received his law degree from the [[University of the Philippines]] [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]] in 1915, where he studied under Dean [[George A. Malcolm]], whom he would later succeed on the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]. He then obtained a [[Master of Laws]] degree from [[University of Santo Tomas]] in 1919. Laurel then attended [[Yale Law School]], where he obtained his [[J.S.D.]] degree.\n\nLaurel began his life in public service while a student, as a messenger in the Bureau of Forestry then as a clerk in the Code Committee tasked with the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Philippine laws. During his work for the Code Committee, he was introduced to its head, [[Thomas A. Street]], a future [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justice]] who would be a mentor to the young Laurel.<ref>American Colonial Careerist, p. 104</ref>\n\nUpon his return from [[Yale University|Yale]], Laurel was appointed first as Undersecretary of the Interior Department, then promoted as [[Department of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Secretary of the Interior]] in 1922. In that post, he would frequently clash with the American [[Governor-General]] [[Leonard Wood]], and eventually, in 1923, resign from his position together with other Cabinet members in protest of Wood's administration. His clashes with Wood solidified Laurel's nationalist credentials.\n\nLaurel was a member of the Philippine fraternity [[Upsilon Sigma Phi]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXsMAQAAMAAJ&q=%22Jos%C3%A9+P.+Laurel%22+upsilon&dq=%22Jos%C3%A9+P.+Laurel%22+upsilon&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBvLCw6obWAhXo7oMKHaclCocQ6AEIJjAA|title=The Fookien Times Philippines Yearbook|last=Company|first=Fookien Times Publishing|date=1986|publisher=Fookien Times|year=|isbn=9789710503506|location=|page=226|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Senator and Congressman of the Philippines==\nIn 1925 Laurel was elected to the [[Philippine Senate]]. He would serve for one term before losing his re-election bid in 1931 to [[Claro M. Recto]].<ref name=\"Supreme Court p. 175\">Justices of the Supreme Court, p. 175</ref> He retired to private practice, but by 1934, he was again elected to public office, this time as a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention. Hailed as one of the \"Seven Wise Men of the Convention\", he would sponsor the provisions on the Bill of Rights.<ref name=\"Supreme Court p. 175\"/> Following the ratification of the [[Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]] and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], Laurel was appointed [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] on February 29, 1936.\n\n==Associate Justice of the Supreme Court==\nLaurel's Supreme Court tenure may have been overshadowed by his presidency, yet he remains one of the most important Supreme Court justices in Philippine history. He authored several leading cases still analyzed to this day that defined the parameters of the branches of government as well as their powers.\n\n[http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html ''Angara v. Electoral Commission''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|63 Phil. 139 (1936)]], which is considered as the Philippine equivalent of ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]'', [[case citation|5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 (1803)]], is Laurel's most important contribution to jurisprudence and even the rule of law in the Philippines. In affirming that the Court had [[jurisdiction]] to review the rulings of the Electoral Commission organized under the [[Congress of the Philippines|National Assembly]], the Court, through Justice Laurel's [[opinion]], firmly entrenched the power of Philippine courts to engage in [[judicial review]] of the acts of the other branches of government, and to interpret the Constitution. Held the Court, through Laurel:\n<blockquote>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government. Who is to determine the nature, scope and extent of such powers? The Constitution itself has provided for the instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way. And when the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1936/jul1936/gr_l-45081_1936.html|title=G.R. No. L-45081|website=lawphil.net|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAnother highly influential decision penned by Laurel was [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1940/feb1940/gr_l-46496_1940.html ''Ang Tibay v. CIR''], [[Case citation#The Philippines|69 Phil. 635 (1940)]]. The Court acknowledged in that case that the substantive and procedural requirements before proceedings in administrative agencies, such as labor relations courts, were more flexible than those in judicial proceedings. At the same time, the Court still asserted that the right to [[due process of law]] must be observed, and enumerated the \"cardinal primary rights\" that must be respected in administrative proceedings. Since then, these \"cardinal primary rights\" have stood as the standard in testing due process claims in administrative cases.\n\n''Calalang v. Williams'', [[Case citation#The Philippines|70 Phil. 726 (1940)]] was a seemingly innocuous case involving a challenge raised by a private citizen to a traffic regulation banning [[kalesa]]s from [[Manila]] streets during certain afternoon hours. The Court, through Laurel, upheld the regulation as within the [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]] of the government. But in rejecting the claim that the regulation was violative of [[social justice]], Laurel would respond with what would become his most famous [[aphorism]], which is to this day widely quoted by judges and memorized by Filipino law students:\n<blockquote>Social justice is neither communism, nor despotism, nor atomism, nor anarchy, but the humanization of laws and the equalization of social and economic forces by the State so that justice in its rational and objectively secular conception may at least be approximated. Social justice means the promotion of the welfare of all the people, the adoption by the Government of measures calculated to insure economic stability of all the competent elements of society, through the maintenance of a proper economic and social equilibrium in the interrelations of the members of the community, constitutionally, through the adoption of measures legally justifiable, or extra-constitutionally, through the exercise of powers underlying the existence of all governments on the time-honored principle of [[salus populi est suprema lex]]. Social justice, therefore, must be founded on the recognition of the necessity of interdependence among divers and diverse units of a society and of the protection that should be equally and evenly extended to all groups as a combined force in our social and economic life, consistent with the fundamental and paramount objective of the state of promoting the health, comfort, and quiet of all persons, and of bringing about \"the greatest good to the greatest number.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw/1940decemberdecisions.php?id=237|title=G.R.

After the war, he would be denounced by the pro-American sectors{{Who|date=November 2011}} as a [[collaborationism|war collaborator]] or even a traitor, although his indictment for treason was superseded by [[Manuel Roxas#Amnesty Proclamation|President Roxas' Amnesty Proclamation]].<ref name=\"GovPH-Proc51\">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 51, s. 1948 {{!}} GOVPH |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321050055/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1948/01/28/proclamation-no-51-s-1948/ |archivedate=21 March 2019}}</ref> However, despite being one of the most infamous figures in Philippine history, he is also regarded as a Pan-Asianist who supported independence. When asked if he was pro-American or pro-Japanese, his answer would be pro-Filipino.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Accession===\n[[File:A propaganda slogan during the Laurel administration.jpg|thumb|One of the many propaganda slogans made during the Laurel administration. Tagalog for \"One Banner, One Nation, One Language\".]]\n\nWhen Japan invaded, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] first fled to [[Bataan]] and then to the United States to establish a government-in-exile.  Quezon ordered Laurel, Vargas and other cabinet members to stay. Laurel's prewar, close relationship with Japanese officials (a son had been sent to study at the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]] in Tokyo, and Laurel had received an honorary doctorate from Tokyo University), placed him in a good position to interact with the Japanese occupation forces.\n\nLaurel was among the Commonwealth officials instructed by the Japanese Imperial Army to form a provisional government when they invaded and occupied the country. He cooperated with the Japanese, in contrast to Chief Justice [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos|Abad Santos]], who was shot for refusing to cooperate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/about/gov/judiciary/sc/cj/jose-abad-santos/the-execution-of-jose-abad-santos/ |title=The execution of Jose Abad Santos &#124; Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |publisher=Officialgazette.gov.ph |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2019-09-28}}</ref> Because he was well known to the Japanese as a critic of US rule, as well as having demonstrated a willingness to serve under the Japanese Military Administration, he held a series of high posts in 1942\u20131943. Under vigorous Japanese influence, the National Assembly selected Laurel to serve as President in 1943.\n\n===Domestic policies===\n\n====Economy====\nDuring Laurel's tenure as President, [[hunger]] was the main worry. Prices of essential commodities rose to unprecedented heights. The government exerted every effort to increase production and bring [[consumer]]s' [[good (economics)|goods]] under control. However, Japanese rapacity had the better of it all. On the other hand, [[guerrilla]] activities and Japanese retaliatory measures brought the peace and order situation to a difficult point. Resorting to district-zoning and domiciliary searches, coupled with arbitrary arrests, the Japanese made the mission of Laurel's administration incalculably exasperating and perilous.<ref name=\"Molina, Antonio 1961\">Molina, Antonio.

Recto]], who was appointed by Laurel as his Foreign Minister, and Japanese Ambassador to Philippines Sozyo Murata. One redeeming feature was that no conscription was envisioned.<ref name=\"Molina, Antonio 1961\"/>\n\n====Greater East Asia Conference====\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|Greater East Asia Conference]]\n\nShortly after the inauguration of the Second Philippine Republic, President Laurel, together with cabinet Ministers Recto and Paredes flew to Tokyo to attend the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] which was an international summit held in Tokyo, Japan from November 5 \u2013 6, 1943, in which Japan hosted the [[head of state|heads of state]] of various component members of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. The conference was also referred to as the ''Tokyo Conference''.\n\nThe Conference addressed few issues of any substance, Eradication of Western Opium Drug Trade and to illustrate the [[Empire of Japan]]'s commitments to the [[Pan-Asianism]] ideal and to emphasize its role as the \"liberator\" of Asia from Western [[colonialism]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=Andrew|title=The Modern History of Japan: From Tokugawa Times to the Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|page=211|isbn=0-19-511060-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiEMgP36lScC&pg=PA211&dq=%22Greater+East+Asia+Conference%22|accessdate=April 13, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Martial law====\nLaurel declared the country under martial law in 1944 through Proclamation No. 29, dated September 21.<ref name=\"Lawphil-Proc29\">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 29 |url=https://www.lawphil.net/executive/proc/procXXX/proc_29_1944.html |website=The Lawphil Project - Philippine Laws and Jurisprudence Databank |accessdate=21 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926145922/http://www.lawphil.net/executive/proc/procXXX/proc_29_1944.html |archivedate={{date|26 Sep 2017}}}}</ref> Martial law came into effect on September 22, 1944 at 9&nbsp;am.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Proclamation No. 30 was issued the next day, declaring the existence of a state of war between the Philippines and the United States and the United Kingdom.

Correspondence between the diplomats of the Vatican and Japan told that the Holy See did not wish to recognize any new states for the duration of the War. Despite this, Laurel still sought to appeal to the Pope about instating Filipinos into the Church hierarchy. <ref>''Le pr\u00e9sident des Iles Philippines Laurel au pape Pie XII''. Rome, 11 March 1944. (A.E.S. 1927/44). '''Acts and Documents of the Holy See Relative to the Second World War Vol. 11''' pp. [http://www.vatican.va/archive/actes/documents/Volume-7.pdf#page=232 232-234]</ref>\n{{Quote|text=As the Head of the Republic of Philippines,' I take liberty of voicing to Your Holiness the desire and sentiments of eighteen million Filipinos, the majority of whom are ardent Catholics, with respect to the matter which vitally affects the administration of the Catholic Church in Philippines, and which may have far reaching effects on their religious faith. I refer to Filipinization of the Catholic hierarchy and clergy in Philippines.\n\nYour Holiness will remember that the movement for Filipinization of the clergy furnished one of the prime motivations of our revolution against Spain; that with overthrow of Spanish sovereignty only 250 out of 17,000 Spanish friars assigned to Philippines in 1898 were retained; that pursuant to the policy announced by the Holy See, Spanish bishops were replaced by American Catholic bishops; that during the American regime more missionaries of different nationalities came to the country; and that at present we have five Bishops and two Apostolic Prefects of foreign nationalities, while in certain provinces, such as Surigao, Agusan, Antique, Misamis Oriental, Mindoro, Bukidnon, Davao, Cotabato, Palawan and Mountain Province, parishes are still under the charge of foreign friars and missionaries. Now that the independence of Philippines has been finally achieved, the Republic of Philippines, though it fundamentally recognizes the separation of Church and State, can no longer remain indifferent to a long-felt need to Filipinize the local Catholic hierarchy and clergy. \n\nIn advocating this reform, the Filipino people are not moved by any spirit of animosity or hostility against any race or nationality, but they are inspired solely by the desire to win a just recognition for the Filipino race in their own country and to secure a vindication of capacity of Filipinos to manage their own affairs, temporal or spiritual. The projected measure can be achieved without in the least prejudicing interests, or sacrificing the creed or doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church. Without in any way presuming to invade an ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Philippines, it is my honest belief that the spread of Catholicism among our non-Christian brethren and consequently increase of its followers in this country. This, in my opinion, is in consonance with the desire of His Holiness Pope Pius XI when he said:\n\n\u00abFrom the fact that the Roman Pontiff has entrusted to you and to your helpers a task of preaching Christian religion to pagan nations, you ought not to conclude that the role of native clergy is solely that of assisting missionaries in minor matters and in some sort of completing their work\u00bb.\n\nWhat is the object of these holy missions, we ask, except that the Church of Christ may be instituted and established in those boundless regions? And from what shall the Church be built up today among heathens, except from those elements out of which it was built up among us that is unless it is composed of people, clergy and religious men and women recruited from their own country? Why should native clergy be prevented from cultivating their country which is their own native soil that is, from governing their own people? In propagation of Faith, a Filipino priest, by reason of his birth and temper, his sentiments and interests, is in far better position to carry on his mission than a stranger. As a matter of fact, he would know better than any foreigner the best method of approach to his own people and thus he would often have access where an alien priest could never gain an entrance. Moreover foreign missionaries, on account of their imperfect knowledge of Filipino language, are frequently prevented from expressing themselves fully and having themselves clearly understood, as a result of which, force and efficacy of their teachings are greatly weakened. It will also be a source of genuine satisfaction and lasting inspiration for Filipino people to see a Filipino at the head of the Catholic Church in Philippines, a Filipino priest in every parish and a Filipino missionary in every remote corner of the country. Certainly, it will foster development of national clergy of superior stamp and it will serve as an ideal incentive for Filipino clergy to work to the highest degree of perfection\nand the same time to encourage vocations to religious and sacerdotal life.\n\nIn view of foregoing considerations, I beg to convey and reiterate the desire and request of my people that it is, as it has always been, their cherished hope that after more than four centuries of Catholicism in Philippines, Your Holiness will see the wisdom of principle invoked and grant their petition for complete Filipinization of Catholic hierarchy and clergy in their own country.|author=Jose P.

The Japanese government refused the offer. On August 6, 1945, [[Hiroshima]], with some 300,000 inhabitants, was almost totally destroyed by an [[atomic bomb]] dropped from an American plane. Two days later, the Soviet Union declared war against Japan and invaded Manchuria.<ref>Molina, Antonio. ''The Philippines: Through the centuries''.
