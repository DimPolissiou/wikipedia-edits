He played [[college football]] for the [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]], earning consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] honors as a senior in 1998. The [[Chicago Bears]] selected him in the first round of the [[1999 NFL Draft]], and he played professionally for the Bears, [[Miami Dolphins]], and [[San Francisco 49ers]] of the NFL.\n\n==Early years==\nMcNown was born in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He went to high school at [[San Benito High School (California)|San Benito High School]] in [[Hollister, California]], before transferring as a senior to [[West Linn High School]] in [[West Linn, Oregon]], where he played quarterback and free safety.\n\nHe led his high school to the 1994 Oregon Class 4A semifinals, becoming wildly touted by newspapers as a college prospect. He also was active on the school track team, where he set a school [[pole vault]] record. McNown signed with UCLA after high school. His selection of UCLA was influenced by future NFL quarterback [[Brock Huard]] signing with Washington. Huard, along with McNown, were the top high school quarterback prospects in the western United States in 1994.\n\n==College career==\nMcNown attended the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), and played for the [[UCLA Bruins football|Bruins]] from 1995 to 1998. He became the starting quarterback as a true freshman, four games into the season, ranking first among all freshmen quarterbacks in many statistics. In 1995, UCLA finished 7\u20135 and played in the [[Aloha Bowl]] (losing to [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]]).\n\nMcNown was less successful as a sophomore in 1996, when UCLA would go 5\u20136 and he would be ranked 9th in the [[Pac-10 Conference|Pac-10]] in [[pass efficiency]]. But the season ended on a high note as UCLA overcame a 17-point fourth quarter deficit to beat rival USC in overtime, 48\u201341.\n\nAs a junior in 1997, McNown announced the team's goal to score an average of 30 points per game. They ended up averaging 39.75 points per game. After an 0\u20132 start, UCLA would win its remaining 10 games, including the 1998 [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] over [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]], to finish Pac-10 co-champion and ranked No. 5 in the nation. McNown was named Most Outstanding Offensive Player for that year's Cotton Bowl Classic. He also was a finalist for the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], was named an [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] by the ''[[Associated Press]]'' (third team), ''[[The Sporting News]]'' (third team), made the All-Pac-10 team (second team) behind Washington State's [[Ryan Leaf]], and finished eighth in the [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman]] balloting. He led the nation in passing efficiency with a 168.6 rating. His play broke many UCLA records, most of which had been previously set by [[Tom Ramsey]].\n\nIn his senior season in 1998, McNown led UCLA to a 10\u20132 record, including a [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] appearance as the sole Pac-10 champion. With McNown at the helm, the Bruins' explosive offense carried them on a school-record 20-game winning streak from the previous year, as they won their first 10 games in 1998, before losing to [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] in their regular season finale in a loss that broke the 20-game winning streak and knocked UCLA out of the BCS Championship Game vs. Tennessee. The disappointed Bruins then lost to Ron Dayne-led [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]] in the 1999 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]], 38\u201331. McNown set numerous school records in passing and offense, became the Pac-10's all-time career leader in total offense, and won a collection of post-season honors, including [[Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year|Pac-10 co-Offensive Player of the Year]], the Pop Warner Memorial Trophy for best senior player on the West Coast, consensus first-team All-American honors, and the [[Johnny Unitas Award]] as the top senior quarterback in college football. McNown also finished third in balloting for the [[Heisman Trophy]]. In the 1999 [[Senior Bowl]], McNown earned MVP honors as he threw two touchdowns in helping to lead the South team to victory.\n\nFor his career, McNown still holds many of the passing and total-offense records. McNown also holds the distinction of being the only UCLA quarterback to go 4-0 against cross-town rival [[USC Trojans football|USC]]. On October 9, 2009, McNown was inducted into the [[UCLA Bruins#UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame|UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame]]. McNown was inducted into the [[Rose Bowl Game#Rose Bowl Hall of Fame|Rose Bowl Hall of Fame]] on December 30, 2017.\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Team !! colspan=8 | Passing !! colspan=4 | Rushing \n|-\n! {{tooltip|Cmp|Passes completed}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Passes attempted}} !! {{tooltip|Pct|Completion percentage}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Passing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Y/A|Yards per passing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Passing touchdowns}} !! {{tooltip|Int|Interceptions}} !! {{tooltip|Rtg|Passer rating}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Rushing attempts}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Rushing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Avg|Yards per rushing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Rushing touchdowns}}\n|-\n| [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season|1995]] || [[1995 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 122 || 245 || 49.8% || 1,698 || 6.9 || 7 || 8 || 110.9 || 71 || 311 || 4.4 ||5\n|-\n| [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996]] || [[1996 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 176 || 336 || 52.4% || 2,424 || 7.2 || 12 || 16 || 115.2 || 88 || 58 || 0.7 || 4\n|-\n| [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]] || [[1997 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 189 || 312 || 60.6% || 3,116 || 10.0 || 24 || 6|| 166.0 || 79|| 26 || 0.3 || 4\n|-\n| [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] || [[1998 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 207 || 357 || 58.0% || 3,470 || 9.7 || 25 || 11 || 156.6 || 75 || 182 || 2.4 || 3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Career''' || 694 || 1,250 || 55.5% || 10,708 || 8.6 || 68 || 41 || 138.9 || 313 || 577 || 1.8 || 16\n|}\n''Source'':<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/cade-mcnown-1.html | title=Cade McNown | publisher=Sports Reference LLC | work=sports-reference.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n{{NFL predraft\n|    height ft = 6\n|    height in = 1\n|       weight = 213\n|         dash = 4.75\n|    ten split = 1.64\n| twenty split = 2.75\n|      shuttle = 4.28\n|   cone drill = 7.27\n|     vertical = 33{{fraction|1|2}}\n|     broad ft = 9\n|     broad in = 5\n|         note = All values from [[NFL Combine]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=5749&draftyear=1999&genpos=QB | title=Cade McNown | publisher=nfldraftscout.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nFollowing the [[scouting combine]], some scouts questioned the strength of his throwing arm. McNown, along with [[Akili Smith]], [[Daunte Culpepper]], and [[Donovan McNabb]], appeared on the cover of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in the issue highlighting the draft. He was selected by the Chicago Bears with the twelfth overall pick in the first round of the [[1999 NFL Draft]], following a [[Ricky Williams trade|draft pick trade]] with the [[Washington Redskins]]. He was the highest-drafted Bears quarterback since [[Jim McMahon]].<ref name=\"Top 5 Turkeys\">{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Dalton |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/chicago-bears-top-five-turkeys-franchise-history-153900262--nfl.html |title=Chicago Bears: Top Five Turkeys in Franchise History |publisher=[[Yahoo!

He was a contract holdout most of training camp, eventually agreeing to a $22 million contract.<ref name=\"Top 5 Turkeys\" /> [[Head coach]] [[Dick Jauron]] announced that [[Shane Matthews]] would be the starter, but that McNown would play at least one series every game to gain experience.\n\nMcNown would start his first game for the Bears on October 10 following a hamstring injury to Matthews the previous week. During the game on December 26, following a poor performance against the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]], McNown chose to sit out the second half of the game. He would be replaced as starter by [[Jim Miller (quarterback)|Jim Miller]], but would again be named the starter following Miller's suspension. McNown had a spectacular game against Detroit on Dec 19, setting franchise rookie records with 27 completions, 301 yards, and 4 touchdowns; he also holds the rookie record for pass attempts, with 42 in the season finale loss to Tampa Bay.<ref>{{As of|2017}}</ref> \n\nHe was named the Bears' 2000 starter over Matthews (Miller was injured during the pre-season), but his performance grew noticeably worse through the season; the Bears under McNown would fall to 1\u20136, leading the home crowd to regularly chant for Miller's return. He suffered a shoulder injury during the seventh game of the season (against [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]]), was briefly replaced by Miller, who would himself suffer an injury and be replaced by Matthews. McNown would start (and lose) one more game that season, against San Francisco.  Although he was benched for the final game of the season at the [[Detroit Lions]], he came in after Matthews was injured again and even helped lead the Bears to an upset win that eliminated the Lions from what appeared to be a sure playoff berth.  However, the Bears had seen enough by this point.\n\nMcNown was traded during the 2001 preseason to the [[Miami Dolphins]], along with a seventh-round pick, for a sixth-round pick, and a conditional [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]] seventh-round pick. In Chicago, he had fallen down the depth chart, below Miller and Matthews, competing against [[Danny Wuerffel]] for the third-string position. He would be named the third-string quarterback for the Dolphins, and saw no action during the season.\n\nThe Dolphins traded McNown to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] for a conditional seventh-round draft pick during the 2002 offseason. By then, [[Terry Donahue]], former head coach at UCLA, was the general manager. Interest was briefly raised in McNown, as the 49ers were then searching for a quarterback for the [[west coast offense]]. Although he was initially competing against [[Tim Rattay]], [[Giovanni Carmazzi]], and Brandon Doman for the backup spot behind starter [[Jeff Garcia]], McNown reinjured his shoulder during the preseason. When it was revealed he would require season-ending surgery, he was placed on [[injured reserve]]. McNown was released by the 49ers during the 2003 offseason. His rights were shortly thereafter acquired by the [[Calgary Stampeders]], although he was never signed.\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Team !! rowspan=2 | {{tooltip|GP|Games played}} !! rowspan=2 | {{tooltip|GS|Games started}} !! colspan=8 | Passing !! colspan=4 | Rushing \n|-\n! {{tooltip|Cmp|Passes completed}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Passes attempted}} !! {{tooltip|Pct|Completion percentage}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Passing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Y/A|Yards per passing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Passing touchdowns}} !! {{tooltip|Int|Interceptions}} !! {{tooltip|Rtg|Passer rating}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Rushing attempts}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Rushing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Avg|Yards per rushing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Rushing touchdowns}}\n|-\n|[[1999 NFL season|1999]] || [[1999 Chicago Bears season|CHI]] || 15 || 6 || 127 || 235 || 54.0 || 1,465 || 6.2 || 8 || 10 || 66.7 || 32 || 160 || 5.0 || 0 \n|-\n|[[2000 NFL season|2000]] || [[2000 Chicago Bears season|CHI]] || 10 || 9 || 154 || 280 || 55.0 || 1,646 || 5.9 || 8 || 9 || 68.5 || 50 || 326 || 6.5 || 3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Career''' || 25 || 15 || 281 || 515 || 54.6 || 3,111 || 6.0 || 16 || 19 || 67.7 || 82 || 486 || 5.9 || 3\n|}\n''Source'':<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LindRy00.htm | title=Cade McNown | publisher=Sports Reference LLC | work=pro-football-reference.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMcNown was charged in September 1999 with the illegal possession of a [[handicapped]] parking pass while playing football at UCLA in 1996,<ref name=\"Charged\">{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1999/09/13/ucla_handicap_ap/ |title=McNown, Hicks, Atkins charged |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= September 13, 1999 |publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020852/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1999/09/13/ucla_handicap_ap/ |archive-date=December 19, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> to which he pleaded no contest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/01/sports/plus-college-football-ucla-mcnown-pleads-no-contest.html |title=PLUS: COLLEGE FOOTBALL -- U.C.L.A.; McNown Pleads No Contest |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527092857/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/01/sports/plus-college-football-ucla-mcnown-pleads-no-contest.html |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other players charged included [[Skip Hicks]], [[Larry Atkins]], [[Marques Anderson]], and [[Brendon Ayanbadejo]].<ref name=\"Charged\" />\n\nIn 2000, it was reported that McNown had been dating 1999 ''[[Playboy]]'' [[List of Playmates of the Year|Playmate of the Year]] [[Heather Kozar]], and future (2001) Playmate of the Year [[Brande Roderick]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-08/sports/0010080487_1_cade-mcnown-playmates-playboy-mansion|title=Mcnown Fooling No One With His Latest Con|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=October 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/05/sports/sp-31649|title=McNown Flirts With Sack, and It's Another Bad Pass|last=SIMERS|first=T.

On October 9, 2009, McNown was inducted into the [[UCLA Bruins#UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame|UCLA Athletics Hall of Fame]]. McNown was inducted into the [[Rose Bowl Game#Rose Bowl Hall of Fame|Rose Bowl Hall of Fame]] on December 30, 2017.\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Team !! colspan=8 | Passing !! colspan=4 | Rushing \n|-\n! {{tooltip|Cmp|Passes completed}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Passes attempted}} !! {{tooltip|Pct|Completion percentage}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Passing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Y/A|Yards per passing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Passing touchdowns}} !! {{tooltip|Int|Interceptions}} !! {{tooltip|Rtg|Passer rating}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Rushing attempts}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Rushing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Avg|Yards per rushing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Rushing touchdowns}}\n|-\n| [[1995 NCAA Division I-A football season|1995]] || [[1995 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 122 || 245 || 49.8% || 1,698 || 6.9 || 7 || 8 || 110.9 || 71 || 311 || 4.4 ||5\n|-\n| [[1996 NCAA Division I-A football season|1996]] || [[1996 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 176 || 336 || 52.4% || 2,424 || 7.2 || 12 || 16 || 115.2 || 88 || 58 || 0.7 || 4\n|-\n| [[1997 NCAA Division I-A football season|1997]] || [[1997 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 189 || 312 || 60.6% || 3,116 || 10.0 || 24 || 6|| 166.0 || 79|| 26 || 0.3 || 4\n|-\n| [[1998 NCAA Division I-A football season|1998]] || [[1998 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] || 207 || 357 || 58.0% || 3,470 || 9.7 || 25 || 11 || 156.6 || 75 || 182 || 2.4 || 3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Career''' || 694 || 1,250 || 55.5% || 10,708 || 8.6 || 68 || 41 || 138.9 || 313 || 577 || 1.8 || 16\n|}\n''Source'':<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/cade-mcnown-1.html | title=Cade McNown | publisher=Sports Reference LLC | work=sports-reference.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\n{{NFL predraft\n|    height ft = 6\n|    height in = 1\n|       weight = 213\n|         dash = 4.75\n|    ten split = 1.64\n| twenty split = 2.75\n|      shuttle = 4.28\n|   cone drill = 7.27\n|     vertical = 33{{fraction|1|2}}\n|     broad ft = 9\n|     broad in = 5\n|         note = All values from [[NFL Combine]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nfldraftscout.com/ratings/dsprofile.php?pyid=5749&draftyear=1999&genpos=QB | title=Cade McNown | publisher=nfldraftscout.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\nFollowing the [[scouting combine]], some scouts questioned the strength of his throwing arm. McNown, along with [[Akili Smith]], [[Daunte Culpepper]], and [[Donovan McNabb]], appeared on the cover of ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' in the issue highlighting the draft. He was selected by the Chicago Bears with the twelfth overall pick in the first round of the [[1999 NFL Draft]], following a [[Ricky Williams trade|draft pick trade]] with the [[Washington Redskins]]. He was the highest-drafted Bears quarterback since [[Jim McMahon]].<ref name=\"Top 5 Turkeys\">{{cite web|last=Russell |first=Dalton |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/chicago-bears-top-five-turkeys-franchise-history-153900262--nfl.html |title=Chicago Bears: Top Five Turkeys in Franchise History |publisher=[[Yahoo!

He was a contract holdout most of training camp, eventually agreeing to a $22 million contract.<ref name=\"Top 5 Turkeys\" /> [[Head coach]] [[Dick Jauron]] announced that [[Shane Matthews]] would be the starter, but that McNown would play at least one series every game to gain experience.\n\nMcNown would start his first game for the Bears on October 10 following a hamstring injury to Matthews the previous week. During the game on December 26, following a poor performance against the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]], McNown chose to sit out the second half of the game. He would be replaced as starter by [[Jim Miller (quarterback)|Jim Miller]], but would again be named the starter following Miller's suspension. McNown had a spectacular game against Detroit on Dec 19, setting franchise rookie records with 27 completions, 301 yards, and 4 touchdowns; he also holds the rookie record for pass attempts, with 42 in the season finale loss to Tampa Bay.<ref>{{As of|2017}}</ref> \n\nHe was named the Bears' 2000 starter over Matthews (Miller was injured during the pre-season), but his performance grew noticeably worse through the season; the Bears under McNown would fall to 1\u20136, leading the home crowd to regularly chant for Miller's return. He suffered a shoulder injury during the seventh game of the season (against [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]]), was briefly replaced by Miller, who would himself suffer an injury and be replaced by Matthews. McNown would start (and lose) one more game that season, against San Francisco.  Although he was benched for the final game of the season at the [[Detroit Lions]], he came in after Matthews was injured again and even helped lead the Bears to an upset win that eliminated the Lions from what appeared to be a sure playoff berth.  However, the Bears had seen enough by this point.\n\nMcNown was traded during the 2001 preseason to the [[Miami Dolphins]], along with a seventh-round pick, for a sixth-round pick, and a conditional [[2003 NFL Draft|2003]] seventh-round pick. In Chicago, he had fallen down the depth chart, below Miller and Matthews, competing against [[Danny Wuerffel]] for the third-string position. He would be named the third-string quarterback for the Dolphins, and saw no action during the season.\n\nThe Dolphins traded McNown to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] for a conditional seventh-round draft pick during the 2002 offseason. By then, [[Terry Donahue]], former head coach at UCLA, was the general manager. Interest was briefly raised in McNown, as the 49ers were then searching for a quarterback for the [[west coast offense]]. Although he was initially competing against [[Tim Rattay]], [[Giovanni Carmazzi]], and Brandon Doman for the backup spot behind starter [[Jeff Garcia]], McNown reinjured his shoulder during the preseason. When it was revealed he would require season-ending surgery, he was placed on [[injured reserve]]. McNown was released by the 49ers during the 2003 offseason. His rights were shortly thereafter acquired by the [[Calgary Stampeders]], although he was never signed.\n\n===Statistics===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! rowspan=2 | Year !! rowspan=2 | Team !! rowspan=2 | {{tooltip|GP|Games played}} !! rowspan=2 | {{tooltip|GS|Games started}} !! colspan=8 | Passing !! colspan=4 | Rushing \n|-\n! {{tooltip|Cmp|Passes completed}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Passes attempted}} !! {{tooltip|Pct|Completion percentage}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Passing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Y/A|Yards per passing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Passing touchdowns}} !! {{tooltip|Int|Interceptions}} !! {{tooltip|Rtg|Passer rating}} !! {{tooltip|Att|Rushing attempts}} !! {{tooltip|Yds|Rushing yards}} !! {{tooltip|Avg|Yards per rushing attempt}} !! {{tooltip|TD|Rushing touchdowns}}\n|-\n|[[1999 NFL season|1999]] || [[1999 Chicago Bears season|CHI]] || 15 || 6 || 127 || 235 || 54.0 || 1,465 || 6.2 || 8 || 10 || 66.7 || 32 || 160 || 5.0 || 0 \n|-\n|[[2000 NFL season|2000]] || [[2000 Chicago Bears season|CHI]] || 10 || 9 || 154 || 280 || 55.0 || 1,646 || 5.9 || 8 || 9 || 68.5 || 50 || 326 || 6.5 || 3\n|- class=\"sortbottom\" style=\"background:#eee;\"\n| colspan=2 | '''Career''' || 25 || 15 || 281 || 515 || 54.6 || 3,111 || 6.0 || 16 || 19 || 67.7 || 82 || 486 || 5.9 || 3\n|}\n''Source'':<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LindRy00.htm | title=Cade McNown | publisher=Sports Reference LLC | work=pro-football-reference.com | accessdate=September 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMcNown was charged in September 1999 with the illegal possession of a [[handicapped]] parking pass while playing football at UCLA in 1996,<ref name=\"Charged\">{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1999/09/13/ucla_handicap_ap/ |title=McNown, Hicks, Atkins charged |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= September 13, 1999 |publisher=[[CNN Sports Illustrated]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020852/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1999/09/13/ucla_handicap_ap/ |archive-date=December 19, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> to which he pleaded no contest.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/01/sports/plus-college-football-ucla-mcnown-pleads-no-contest.html |title=PLUS: COLLEGE FOOTBALL -- U.C.L.A.; McNown Pleads No Contest |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=October 1, 1999 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527092857/http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/01/sports/plus-college-football-ucla-mcnown-pleads-no-contest.html |archive-date=May 27, 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Other players charged included [[Skip Hicks]], [[Larry Atkins]], [[Marques Anderson]], and [[Brendon Ayanbadejo]].<ref name=\"Charged\" />\n\nIn 2000, it was reported that McNown had been dating 1999 ''[[Playboy]]'' [[List of Playmates of the Year|Playmate of the Year]] [[Heather Kozar]], and future (2001) Playmate of the Year [[Brande Roderick]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-10-08/sports/0010080487_1_cade-mcnown-playmates-playboy-mansion|title=Mcnown Fooling No One With His Latest Con|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=October 10, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/05/sports/sp-31649|title=McNown Flirts With Sack, and It's Another Bad Pass|last=SIMERS|first=T.

The shock was centered in [[The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park]] approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] on a section of the [[San Andreas Fault]] System and was named for the nearby [[Loma Prieta|Loma Prieta Peak]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. With an {{m|w|link=y}} magnitude of 6.9<ref>{{short-anss|Loma Prieta|1989|sub-title=Origin|sub-url=origin|2019-04-01}}.<!-- The ANSS 'mh' is appears to be an error. --></ref> and a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Modified Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] (to the degree that it was designated a [[seismic gap]]) until two moderate [[foreshock]]s occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.\n\nDamage was heavy in [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]] and less so to the south in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], but effects extended well to the north into the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], both on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and across the bay in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. No surface faulting occurred, though many other ground failures and [[landslide]]s were present, especially in the [[Summit, Santa Cruz County, California|Summit area]] of the Santa Cruz Mountains. [[Soil liquefaction|Liquefaction]] was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District of San Francisco]], but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of [[Monterey Bay]], where a non-destructive [[tsunami]] was also observed.\n\nBecause it happened during a national live broadcast of the [[1989 World Series]], taking place between Bay Area teams [[San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Oakland Athletics]], it is sometimes referred to as the \"World Series earthquake\". Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game, being played at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck [[Interstate 880 (California)|Nimitz Freeway]] in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], and Santa Cruz.\n\n=={{anchor|Preface}}Background==\n{{see also|List of fault zones}}\n\nThe history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the [[San Andreas Fault]] System, due to its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]; it is the most studied fault on Earth. [[Andrew Lawson]], a geologist from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], had named the fault after the [[San Andreas Lake]] (prior to the occurrence of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of {{convert|290|mi|abbr=on}} during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its [[aftershock]]s occurred within a recognized [[seismic gap]]) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered [[Fault (geology)#Oblique-slip faults|oblique-slip]] reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.<ref>{{citation|title=Active Faults of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQUgAwAAQBAJ|last=Yeats|first=R.|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190855|pages=80\u201383, 89\u201392}}</ref>\n\n===Forecasts===\n[[File:Santa Cruz Mountains \u2013 Loma Prieta Peak.JPG|thumb|left|Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains]]\n{{see also|California earthquake forecast|Earthquake prediction}}\n\nSince many forecasts had been presented for the region near Loma Prieta, [[Seismology|seismologists]] were not taken by surprise by the October 1989 event. Between 1910 and 1989 there were 20 widely varying forecasts that were announced, with some that were highly specific, covering multiple aspects of an event, while others were less complete and vague. With a M6.5 event on the San Juan Bautista segment, or an M7 event on the San Francisco Peninsula segment, [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) seismologist Allan Lindh's 1983 forecasted rupture length of {{convert|25|miles|km|}} (starting near Pajaro Gap, and continuing to the northwest) for the San Juan Bautista segment nearly matched the actual rupture length of the 1989 event. An updated forecast was presented in 1988, at which time Lindh took the opportunity to assign a new name to the San Juan Bautista segment \u2013 the Loma Prieta segment.<ref name=Harris>{{citation|title=Forecasts of the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/88/4/898.abstract?|first=R.

The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but because of a lack of information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the [[Lake Elsman]] earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the [[California Governor's Office of Emergency Services|State office of Emergency Services]] issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was \"a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault\". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's rupture zone since 1914.<ref name=Perfettini>{{citation|title=Stress transfer by the 1988\u20131989 M = 5.3 and 5.4 Lake Elsman foreshocks to the Loma Prieta fault: Unclamping at the site of peak mainshock slip|first=H.|last=Perfettini|first2=R.

Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} of [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks due to their location in space and time relative to the main event. Each event's aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock's rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] deployed four [[accelerometer]]s in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]]. Unlike other nearby (high [[gain (electronics)|gain]]) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.<ref name=Perfettini/><ref name=McNally>{{citation|title=The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 17, 1989 \u2013 Main Shock Characteristics|chapter=Main-shock and very early aftershock activity|series=USGS Professional Paper 1550-A, Earthquake Occurrence|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1550/pp1550a/|first=K.

Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the [[Sunnyvale Town Center]], a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, ''Very strong'') when chimneys were toppled in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], Los Gatos, and [[Redwood Estates, California|Redwood Estates]].

The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but [[strong ground motion]] recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of [[soil]]). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District in San Francisco or the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative [[Fault (geology)|fault]] to be determined \u2013 the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.<ref name=Bolt/>\n\nWhile a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (''Severe'') covered a large swath of territory relatively close to the epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]]) further to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (''Violent''). At more than {{convert|44|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26''g'', and close to the epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6''g''. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist [[Bruce Bolt]]) extended about {{convert|24|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of what it would have been had it ruptured in one direction only. The duration of a typical M6.9 shock with a comparable rupture length would have been about twice as long.<ref name=Bolt/>{{clear}}\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[Image:1989 Loma Prieta Shake Map.jpg|right|thumb|USGS ShakeMap showing the intensity of the mainshock|alt=A map showing the earthquake's epicenter in California's Santa Cruz Mountains, and the various levels of earthquake shaking intensity felt in the surrounding region]]\n\n[[Gregory Beroza]], a seismologist with [[Stanford University]], made several distinctions regarding the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10&nbsp;km and below on a fault plane that [[strike and dip|dipped]] 70\u00b0 to the southwest. Because much of the slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.<ref>{{citation|title=Near-source modeling of the Loma Prieta earthquake: Evidence for heterogeneous slip and implications for earthquake hazard|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/81/5/1603.abstract?|first=G.|last=Beroza|authorlink=Gregory Beroza|date=1991|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=81|number=5|pages=1603, 1604, 1609, 1616}}</ref>\n\nThe contrasting characteristics of the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists [[Hiroo Kanamori]] and [[Kenji Satake]]. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80\u2013100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high [[terrain|topographic relief]], which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.<ref>{{citation|title=The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 17, 1989 \u2013 Main Shock Characteristics|chapter=Broadband study of the source characteristics of the earthquake|series=USGS Professional Paper 1550-A, Earthquake Occurrence|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1550/pp1550a/|first=H.|last=Kanamori|authorlink=Hiroo Kanamori|first2=K.|last2=Satake|authorlink2=Kenji Satake|date=1996|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pages=A75, A79}}</ref>\n\n===Ground effects===\nWhile the effects of a four-year [[drought]] limited the potential of [[landslide]]s, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. [[California State Route 17|Highway 17]] was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a [[rockfall]] along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to the effects of [[liquefaction]], especially near the shore of [[San Francisco Bay]] (where its effects were severe in the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]]) and to the west of the epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay.

The shock was centered in [[The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park]] approximately {{convert|10|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] on a section of the [[San Andreas Fault]] System and was named for the nearby [[Loma Prieta|Loma Prieta Peak]] in the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]]. With an {{m|w|link=y}} magnitude of 6.9<ref>{{short-anss|Loma Prieta|1989|sub-title=Origin|sub-url=origin|2019-04-01}}.<!-- The ANSS 'mh' is appears to be an error. --></ref> and a maximum [[Modified Mercalli intensity scale|Modified Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] (to the degree that it was designated a [[seismic gap]]) until two moderate [[foreshock]]s occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.\n\nDamage was heavy in [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]] and less so to the south in [[Monterey County, California|Monterey County]], but effects extended well to the north into the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], both on the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] and across the bay in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. No surface faulting occurred, though many other ground failures and [[landslide]]s were present, especially in the [[Summit, Santa Cruz County, California|Summit area]] of the Santa Cruz Mountains. [[Soil liquefaction|Liquefaction]] was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District of San Francisco]], but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of [[Monterey Bay]], where a non-destructive [[tsunami]] was also observed.\n\nBecause it happened during a national live broadcast of the [[1989 World Series]], taking place between Bay Area teams [[San Francisco Giants]] and the [[Oakland Athletics]], it is sometimes referred to as the \"World Series earthquake\". Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was lighter than normal because the game, being played at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco, was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area's major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck [[Interstate 880 (California)|Nimitz Freeway]] in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of man-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], and Santa Cruz.\n\n=={{anchor|Preface}}Background==\n{{see also|List of fault zones}}\n\nThe history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the [[San Andreas Fault]] System, due to its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]]; it is the most studied fault on Earth. [[Andrew Lawson]], a geologist from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], had named the fault after the [[San Andreas Lake]] (prior to the occurrence of the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]]) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of {{convert|290|mi|abbr=on}} during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its [[aftershock]]s occurred within a recognized [[seismic gap]]) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered [[Fault (geology)#Oblique-slip faults|oblique-slip]] reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.<ref>{{citation|title=Active Faults of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQUgAwAAQBAJ|last=Yeats|first=R.|date=2012|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521190855|pages=80\u201383, 89\u201392}}</ref>\n\n===Forecasts===\n[[File:Santa Cruz Mountains \u2013 Loma Prieta Peak.JPG|thumb|left|Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains]]\n{{see also|California earthquake forecast|Earthquake prediction}}\n\nSince many forecasts had been presented for the region near Loma Prieta, [[Seismology|seismologists]] were not taken by surprise by the October 1989 event. Between 1910 and 1989 there were 20 widely varying forecasts that were announced, with some that were highly specific, covering multiple aspects of an event, while others were less complete and vague. With a M6.5 event on the San Juan Bautista segment, or an M7 event on the San Francisco Peninsula segment, [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) seismologist Allan Lindh's 1983 forecasted rupture length of {{convert|25|miles|km|}} (starting near Pajaro Gap, and continuing to the northwest) for the San Juan Bautista segment nearly matched the actual rupture length of the 1989 event. An updated forecast was presented in 1988, at which time Lindh took the opportunity to assign a new name to the San Juan Bautista segment \u2013 the Loma Prieta segment.<ref name=Harris>{{citation|title=Forecasts of the 1989 Loma Prieta, California, earthquake|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/88/4/898.abstract?|first=R.

The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but because of a lack of information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the [[Lake Elsman]] earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the [[California Governor's Office of Emergency Services|State office of Emergency Services]] issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was \"a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault\". The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake's rupture zone since 1914.<ref name=Perfettini>{{citation|title=Stress transfer by the 1988\u20131989 M = 5.3 and 5.4 Lake Elsman foreshocks to the Loma Prieta fault: Unclamping at the site of peak mainshock slip|first=H.|last=Perfettini|first2=R.

Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately {{convert|4|in|abbr=on}} of [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip]] and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks due to their location in space and time relative to the main event. Each event's aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock's rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] deployed four [[accelerometer]]s in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in [[Los Gatos, California|Los Gatos]]. Unlike other nearby (high [[gain (electronics)|gain]]) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.<ref name=Perfettini/><ref name=McNally>{{citation|title=The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 17, 1989 \u2013 Main Shock Characteristics|chapter=Main-shock and very early aftershock activity|series=USGS Professional Paper 1550-A, Earthquake Occurrence|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1550/pp1550a/|first=K.

Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the [[Sunnyvale Town Center]], a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, ''Very strong'') when chimneys were toppled in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], Los Gatos, and [[Redwood Estates, California|Redwood Estates]]. Other damage included cracked walls and [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] and broken underground pipes.

The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but [[strong ground motion]] recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (due to different types and thicknesses of [[soil]]). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District in San Francisco or the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative [[Fault (geology)|fault]] to be determined \u2013 the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.<ref name=Bolt/>\n\nWhile a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (''Severe'') covered a large swath of territory relatively close to the epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and [[Watsonville, California|Watsonville]]) further to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (''Violent''). At more than {{convert|44|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26''g'', and close to the epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6''g''. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist [[Bruce Bolt]]) extended about {{convert|24|mi|sigfig=1|sp=us}} in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of what it would have been had it ruptured in one direction only. The duration of a typical M6.9 shock with a comparable rupture length would have been about twice as long.<ref name=Bolt/>{{clear}}\n\n===Characteristics===\n[[Image:1989 Loma Prieta Shake Map.jpg|right|thumb|USGS ShakeMap showing the intensity of the mainshock|alt=A map showing the earthquake's epicenter in California's Santa Cruz Mountains, and the various levels of earthquake shaking intensity felt in the surrounding region]]\n\n[[Gregory Beroza]], a seismologist with [[Stanford University]], made several distinctions regarding the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event's oblique-slip rupture was at 10&nbsp;km and below on a fault plane that [[strike and dip|dipped]] 70\u00b0 to the southwest. Because much of the slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.<ref>{{citation|title=Near-source modeling of the Loma Prieta earthquake: Evidence for heterogeneous slip and implications for earthquake hazard|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/81/5/1603.abstract?|first=G.|last=Beroza|authorlink=Gregory Beroza|date=1991|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=81|number=5|pages=1603, 1604, 1609, 1616}}</ref>\n\nThe contrasting characteristics of the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists [[Hiroo Kanamori]] and [[Kenji Satake]]. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80\u2013100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high [[terrain|topographic relief]], which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.<ref>{{citation|title=The Loma Prieta, California, Earthquake of October 17, 1989 \u2013 Main Shock Characteristics|chapter=Broadband study of the source characteristics of the earthquake|series=USGS Professional Paper 1550-A, Earthquake Occurrence|chapter-url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/pp1550/pp1550a/|first=H.|last=Kanamori|authorlink=Hiroo Kanamori|first2=K.|last2=Satake|authorlink2=Kenji Satake|date=1996|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|pages=A75, A79}}</ref>\n\n===Ground effects===\nWhile the effects of a four-year [[drought]] limited the potential of [[landslide]]s, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. [[California State Route 17|Highway 17]] was blocked for several weeks due to a large slide and one person was killed by a [[rockfall]] along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to the effects of [[liquefaction]], especially near the shore of [[San Francisco Bay]] (where its effects were severe in the [[Marina District, San Francisco|Marina District]]) and to the west of the epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay.

Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]]) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday [[rush hour]], injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed to take into account the game's effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after the earthquake.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/17/newsid_2491000/2491211.stm |title=1989: Earthquake hits San Francisco |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |work=BBC News | date=October 17, 1989}}</ref><ref name=\"cbseveningnews\">{{cite AV media| people = Dan Rather| date = October 18, 1989| time = 0:18| title = CBS Evening News| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR2rKpW_PhM&t=18| accessdate = 2013-02-26| quote = The deadliest earthquake in the United States in more than 80 years kills close to 300 people...| medium = Television broadcast}}</ref>\n\n===Magnetic disturbances===\nAfter the earthquake occurred, a group led by Antony C.

There, the villagers live in poverty due to struggle against exploitation and corruption by the government. At the same time, Cheung attracts the attention of merchant Xiang You-lin (Tin Ching) and his sister, who are keen on killing him for a bounty offered on Cheung. Cheung then agrees to expedite funds to them in the form of cash and goods stolen from foreign invading colonists. While still on land, Cheung discovers that one of his former crew member Hua Er-dao (Fan Mei-sheng), who is an escaped convict, has captured his ship, goods and his crew. As Hua determines to seek vengeance on him, Cheung flees and seeks refuge in a casino.\n\nThe admiral of the  [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] [[Imperial court of China|imperial court]] sends young general Wu Yee ([[David Chiang]]) to investigate where pirates are hiding and ultimately finds Cheung. As the two encounter each other, each of them display their skills in duel while also appreciating each other. Wu eventually grows respect for Cheung for his righteous nature and begins to question his own conscience. He decides to let Cheung escape the government forces tracking him, facilitating Cheung a boat.
