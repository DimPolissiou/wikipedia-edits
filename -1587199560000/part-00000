He was named by ''[[Rugby World]]'' magazine as the third best [[All Black]] of the 20th century after [[Colin Meads]] and [[Sean Fitzpatrick]].<ref>\"The greatest All Blacks of the century\". ''Rugby World''. January 2000.</ref> [[John Hart (rugby coach)|John Hart]], who first selected him for [[Auckland RFU|Auckland]], called him \"almost the perfect rugby player\".\n\n==Early years==\nJones was born in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, and grew up in Te Atat\u016b South, a suburb in the west of Auckland, attending Edmonton Primary, Rangeview Intermediate and [[Henderson High School (Auckland)|Henderson High School]]. His talent for playing was discovered early, as a 10-year-old tackling 15 to 18 year-olds at the weekend kick-abouts at the primary school. He played for the primary school team when still in standard one, when he was three years younger than the other   players and by the time he attended Henderson High School, he was already well known locally. He then helped turn a mediocre high school first XV into a successful rugby team that could compete with Auckland Grammar and Kelston Boys High (the regional heavyweights) for the first time. He played for the local [[Waitemata Rugby Football and Sports Club|Waitemata Rugby Club]] and it wasn't long before the Auckland representative team (coached by John Hart) took notice.<ref name=\"book\">McConnell, Robin (1994).

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs. The SD specification defines a card called '''Thin SD''' with a thickness of 1.4&nbsp;mm, but they occur only rarely, as the SDA went on to define even smaller form factors.\n* The card's electrical contacts are recessed beneath the surface of the card, protecting them from contact with a user's fingers.\n* The SD specification envisioned capacities and transfer rates exceeding those of MMC, and both of these functionalities have grown over time. For a comparison table, see [[#Comparison to other flash memory formats|below]].\n* While MMC uses a single pin for data transfers, the SD card added a four-wire bus mode for higher data rates.\n* The SD card added [[Content Protection for Recordable Media]] (CPRM) security circuitry for [[digital rights management]] (DRM) content-protection.\n* Addition of a write-protect notch\n\nFull-size SD cards do not fit into the slimmer MMC slots, and other issues also affect the ability to use one format in a host device designed for the other.\n\n===SDHC===\n[[File:SDHC-Logo.svg|thumb|upright=0.65|Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) logo; the specification defines cards with a capacity of more than {{No wrap|2 GB}} up to {{nowrap|32 GB}}]]\n\nThe Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) format, announced in January 2006 and defined in version 2.0 of the SD specification, supports cards with capacities up to 32&nbsp;GiB (34359738368 bytes).<ref name=\"sdcard_capacity\" /> The SDHC trademark is licensed to ensure compatibility.<ref name=sandisk-sdhc>[http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf What are SDHC, miniSDHC, and microSDHC?] SanDisk.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916035153/http://www.sandisk.com/Assets/File/pdf/retail/SDHC1.pdf |date=September 16, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nSDHC cards are physically and electrically identical to standard-capacity SD cards (SDSC).

Each lane is capable of transferring up to 156&nbsp;MB/s. In full-duplex mode, one lane is used for Transmit while the other is used for Receive. In half-duplex mode both lanes are used for the same direction of data transfer allowing a double data rate at the same clock speed.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it).

This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.

Secure Digital changed the MMC design in several ways:\n\n* Asymmetrical shape of the sides of the SD card prevent inserting it upside down (while an MMC goes in most of the way but makes no contact if inverted).\n* Most SD cards are {{convert|2.1|mm|abbr=in}} thick, compared to {{convert|1.4|mm|abbr=in}} for MMCs.

Both read and write speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum read-write performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/choices/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class Standards for Video Recording - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org}}</ref><ref name=\"sda_logos_2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/consumers/pdf/2017SDA_brochure_eng.pdf|title=SD Standards Brochure 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe SD Association defines three types of Speed Class ratings: the original Speed Class, UHS Speed Class, and Video Speed Class.\n\n===== Speed Class =====\n'''Speed Class''' ratings 2, 4, and 6 assert that the card supports the respective number of megabytes per second as a minimum sustained write speed for a card in a fragmented state. Class 10 asserts that the card supports 10&nbsp;MB/s as a minimum non-fragmented sequential write speed and uses a High Speed bus mode.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> The host device can read a card's speed class and warn the user if the card reports a speed class that falls below an application's minimum need.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> By comparison, the older \"\u00d7\" rating measured maximum speed under ideal conditions, and was vague as to whether this was read speed or write speed. The graphical symbol for the speed class has a number encircled with 'C' (C2, C4, C6, and C10).\n\n===== UHS Speed Class =====\nUHS-I and UHS-II cards can use '''UHS Speed Class''' rating with two possible grades: class 1 for minimum read/write performance of at least 10&nbsp;MB/s ('U1' symbol featuring number 1 inside 'U') and class 3 for minimum write performance of 30&nbsp;MB/s ('U3' symbol featuring 3 inside 'U'), targeted at recording [[4K video]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/home/New_SDXC_and_SDHC_Memory_Cards_Now_Support_4K2K_Video_11-6-2013_FINAL_2.pdf |title=NEW SDXC AND SDHC MEMORY CARDS SUPPORT 4K2K VIDEO |publisher=SD Association |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> Before November 2013, the rating was branded ''UHS Speed Grade'' and contained grades 0 (no symbol) and 1 ('U1' symbol). Manufacturers can also display standard speed class symbols (C2, C4, C6, and C10) alongside, or in place of UHS speed class.\n\nUHS memory cards work best with UHS host devices. The combination lets the user record HD resolution videos with [[tapeless camcorder]]s while performing other functions. It is also suitable for real-time broadcasts and capturing large HD videos.\n\n===== Video Speed Class =====\n'''Video Speed Class''' defines a set of requirements for UHS cards to match the modern [[Multi-level cell|MLC NAND flash]] memory<ref name=\"sd50_video_speed\"/> and supports progressive 4K and 8K video with minimum sequential writing speeds of 6-90&nbsp;MB/s.<ref name=\"sda_video_speed\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class\"/><ref name=\"sda_speed_class_consumer\"/> The graphical symbols use 'V' followed by a number designating write speed (V6, V10, V30, V60, and V90).\n\n===== Comparison =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Comparison of SD card Speed Class ratings<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/index.html|title=Speed Class - SD Association|website=www.sdcard.org|accessdate=2019-02-15}}</ref>\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Minimum sequential writing speed\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | [[Video format]]{{Efn|The necessary recording and playback speed class requirements may vary by device.}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | UHS Speed Class\n! scope=\"col\" | Video Speed Class \n! scope=\"col\" | [[Standard-definition television|SD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[High-definition video|HD]]/[[Full HD]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[4K resolution|4K]]\n! scope=\"col\" | [[8K resolution|8K]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|2 [[MB/s]]}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 2.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 2 (C2)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| rowspan=\"7\" {{Yes}}\n| {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" {{No}}\n| rowspan=\"4\" {{No}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|4 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 4.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 4 (C4)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}}  \n| rowspan=\"6\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|6 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SDHC Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (C6)}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 6.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 6 (V6)}}\n| rowspan=\"5\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|10 MB/s}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (C10)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 1.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 1 (U1)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 10.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 10 (V10)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|30 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD UHS Speed Class 3.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 3 (U3)}}\n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 30.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 30 (V30)}}\n| rowspan=\"3\" {{Yes}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|60 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 60.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 60 (V60)}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | {{nowrap|90 MB/s}}\n| {{N/a}} \n| {{N/a}} \n| {{nowrap|[[File:SD Video Speed Class 90.svg|frameless|upright=0.12]] Class 90 (V90)}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==== Application Performance Class ====\n''Application Performance Class'' is a newly defined standard from the SD Specification 5.1 and 6.0 which not only define sequential Reading Speeds but also mandates a minimum [[IOPS]] for reading and writing.

Basic cards transfer data at up to six times (6\u00d7) the CD-ROM speed; that is, 900&nbsp;KiB/s or 7.37&nbsp;Mbit/s. The 2.0 specification{{clarify|reason=which specification|date=September 2013}} defines speeds up to 200\u00d7, but is not as specific as Speed Classes are on how to measure speed. Manufacturers may report best-case speeds and may report the card's fastest read speed, which is typically faster than the write speed. Some vendors, including [[Transcend Information|Transcend]] and [[Kingston Technology|Kingston]], report their cards' write speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.com/us/flash/x-speed |title=Flash Memory Cards and X-Speed Ratings |website=Kingston |accessdate=2017-08-05 }}</ref> When a card lists both a speed class and an \"\u00d7\" rating, the latter may be assumed a read speed only.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Real-world performance===\nIn applications that require sustained write throughput, such as video recording, the device might not perform satisfactorily if the SD card's class rating falls below a particular speed. For example, a high-definition [[camcorder]] may require a card of not less than Class 6, suffering dropouts or corrupted video if a slower card is used. [[Digital camera]]s with slow cards may take a noticeable time after taking a photograph before being ready for the next, while the camera writes the first picture.\n\nThe speed class rating does not totally characterize card performance. Different cards of the same class may vary considerably while meeting class specifications. A card's speed depends on many factors, including:\n* The frequency of soft errors that the card's controller must re-try\n* [[Write amplification]]: The flash controller may need to overwrite more data than requested. This has to do with performing read-modify-write operations on write blocks, freeing up (the much larger) erase blocks, while moving data around to achieve [[wear leveling]].\n* [[File fragmentation]]: where there is not sufficient space for a file to be recorded in a contiguous region, it is split into non-contiguous fragments. This does not cause rotational or head-movement delays as with electromechanical [[hard drive]]s, but may decrease speed\u2060\u200a\u2060\u200a\u2060\u2015\u200a\u200afor instance, by requiring additional reads and computation to determine where on the card the file's next fragment is stored.\n\nIn addition, speed may vary markedly between writing a large amount of data to a single file ([[sequential access]], as when a [[digital camera]] records large photographs or videos) and writing a large number of small files (a [[random access|random-access]] use common in [[smartphone]]s). A study in 2012 found that, in this random-access use, some Class 2 cards achieved a write speed of 1.38&nbsp;[[MB/s]], while all cards tested of Class 6 or greater (and some of lower Classes; lower Class does not ''necessarily'' mean better small-file performance), including those from major manufacturers, were over 100 times slower.<ref name=necstudy/> In 2014, a blogger measured a 300-fold performance difference on small writes; this time, the best card in this category was a class 4 card.<ref name=Gough2014/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Card security===\nCards can protect their contents from erasure or modification, prevent access by non-authorized users, and protect copyrighted content using digital rights management.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n====Commands to disable writes====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\nThe host device can command the SD card to become read-only (to reject subsequent commands to write information to it). There are both reversible and irreversible host commands that achieve this.\n\n====Write-protect notch====\n[[File:SD card unlocked and locked.svg|thumb|Unlocked and locked SD cards]]\n[[File:Sony toughcard notch less design.jpg|thumb|Sony 128GB SF-G Tough Series UHS-II SDXC Memory Card is one of the few cards in the market without a sliding tab on the write protect notch.]]\n\nMost full-size SD cards have a \"mechanical write protect switch\" allowing the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised: ''\"It is the responsibility of the host to protect the card. The position of the write protect switch is unknown to the internal circuitry of the card.\"''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/index.html|title=Simplified Specifications - SD Association, version 3.10 , Part 1, Physical Layer, section 4.3.6\" Write Protect Management\"|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sdcard.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=2019-04-11}}</ref> Some host devices do not support write protection, which is an optional feature of the SD specification, and drivers and devices that do obey a read-only indication may give the user a way to override it.\n\nThe switch is a sliding tab that covers a notch in the card. The miniSD and microSD formats do not directly support a write protection notch, but they can be inserted into full-size adapters which do.\n\nWhen looking at the SD card from the top, the right side (the side with the beveled corner) must be notched.\n\nOn the left side, there may be a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or downward to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding write-protect tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.\n\nCards sold with content that must not be altered are permanently marked read-only by having a notch and no sliding tab.\n\n====Card password====\n[[File:Sdadaptersandcards.jpg|thumb|MicroSD to SD adapter (left), microSD to miniSD adapter (middle), microSD card (right)]]\n\nA host device can lock an SD card using a password of up to 16&nbsp;bytes, typically supplied by the user. A locked card interacts normally with the host device except that it rejects commands to read and write data. A locked card can be unlocked only by providing the same password. The host device can, after supplying the old password, specify a new password or disable locking. Without the password (typically, in the case that the user forgets the password), the host device can command the card to erase all the data on the card for future re-use (except card data under DRM), but there is no way to gain access to the existing data.\n\n[[Windows Phone 7]] devices use SD cards designed for access only by the phone manufacturer or mobile provider. An SD card inserted into the phone underneath the battery compartment becomes locked \"to the phone with an automatically generated key\" so that \"the SD card cannot be read by another phone, device, or PC\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2450831|title=Windows Phone 7 Secure Digital Card Limitations}}</ref> [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] devices, however, are some of the few that can perform the necessary low-level format operations on locked SD cards.

SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their input-output functions (typically PDAs like the [[Palm Treo]], but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support [[GPS]] receivers, [[modem]]s, [[barcode reader]]s, [[FM radio]] tuners, TV tuners, [[RFID]] readers, [[digital camera]]s, and interfaces to [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Ethernet]], and [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]]. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.\n\nSDIO cards support most of the memory commands of SD cards. SDIO cards can be structured as eight logical cards, although currently, the typical way that an SDIO card uses this capability is to structure itself as one I/O card and one memory card.\n\nThe SDIO and SD interfaces are mechanically and electrically identical. Host devices built for SDIO cards generally accept SD memory cards without I/O functions. However, the reverse is not true, because host devices need suitable drivers and applications to support the card's I/O functions. For example, an HP SDIO camera usually does not work with PDAs that do not list it as an accessory. Inserting an SDIO card into any SD slot causes no physical damage nor disruption to the host device, but users may be frustrated that the SDIO card does not function fully when inserted into a seemingly compatible slot. (USB and Bluetooth devices exhibit comparable compatibility issues, although to a lesser extent thanks to standardized [[Class driver|USB device classes]] and [[Bluetooth profiles]].)\n\nThe [[#SDIO|SDIO]] family comprises Low-Speed and Full-Speed cards. Both types of SDIO cards support SPI and one-bit SD bus types. Low-Speed SDIO cards are allowed to also support the four-bit SD bus; Full-Speed SDIO cards are required to support the four-bit SD bus. To use an SDIO card as a \"combo card\" (for both memory and I/O), the host device must first select four-bit SD bus operation. Two other unique features of Low-Speed SDIO are a maximum clock rate of 400&nbsp;kHz for all communications, and the use of Pin 8 as \"interrupt\" to try to initiate dialogue with the host device.<ref name=\"SDIOspec\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/sdio/sdio_spec/|title=Simplified Version of SDIO CARD SPEC|publisher=SD Association|accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\n; Ganging cards together\nThe one-bit SD protocol was derived from the MMC protocol, which envisioned the ability to put up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use [[open collector]] interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a [[pull-up resistor]]) if no card pulls it low. Though the cards shared clock and signal lines, each card had its own [[chip select]] line to sense that the host device had selected it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe SD protocol envisioned the ability to gang 30 cards together without separate chip select lines. The host device would broadcast commands to all cards and identify the card to respond to the command using its unique serial number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn practice, cards are rarely ganged together because open-collector operation has problems at high speeds and increases power consumption. Newer versions of the SD specification recommend separate lines to each card.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Compatibility===\nHost devices that comply with newer versions of the specification provide [[backward compatibility]] and accept older SD cards.<ref name=\"sdcard.org\"/> For example, SDXC host devices accept all previous families of SD memory cards, and SDHC host devices also accept standard SD cards.\n\nOlder host devices generally do not support newer card formats, and even when they might support the bus interface used by the card,<ref name=sdcard_using_sdxc /> there are several factors that arise:\n\n* A newer card may offer [[#Types of cards|greater capacity]] than the host device can handle (over 4 GB for SDHC, over 32 GB for SDXC).\n* A newer card may use a [[#File system|file system]] the host device cannot navigate ([[FAT32]] for SDHC, [[exFAT]] for SDXC)\n* Use of an SDIO card requires the host device be designed for the input/output functions the card provides.\n* The hardware interface of the card was changed starting with the version 2.0 (new high-speed bus clocks, redefinition of [[#Storage capacity calculations|storage capacity bits]]) and [[#SDHC|SDHC]] family (Ultra-high speed (UHS) bus)\n* UHS-II has physically more pins but is backwards compatible to UHS-I and non-UHS for both slot and card.<ref name=\"sda_bus_speed\"/>\n* Some vendors produced SDSC cards above&nbsp;1GB before the SDA had standardized a method of doing so.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ SD compatibility table\n! {{Diagonal split header|Slot|Card}}\n! scope=\"col\" | SDSC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDHC<br/>UHS\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC\n! scope=\"col\" | SDXC<br/>UHS \n! scope=\"col\" | SDIO\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDSC\n| {{Partial}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat|See [[#Storage_capacity_and_compatibilities|discussion about storage capacity and compatibilities]]}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{Partial|FAT16,<4GiB}}{{Efn|name=sdsccompat}} || {{No}} || {{No}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs|In non-UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDHC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs|In UHS mode}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Partial|FAT32{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} ||  {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC\n| {{Yes}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{Yes}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}  || {{No}}\n|- \n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDXC UHS\n| {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}} ||  {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{good|Yes{{Efn|name=nonuhs}}}}|| {{Yes|Yes{{Efn|name=uhs}}}} || {{No}}\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:left;\" | SDIO\n| {{partial|Varies}} ||  {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{partial|Varies}} || {{Yes}}\n|}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==Markets==\nSecure Digital cards are used in many consumer electronic devices, and have become a widespread means of storing several gigabytes of data in a small size.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which the user may remove and replace cards often, such as [[digital camera]]s, [[camcorder]]s, and [[video game console]]s, tend to use full-sized cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Devices in which small size is paramount, such as [[mobile phone]]s, tend to use microSD cards.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe microSD card has helped propel the smartphone market by giving both manufacturers and consumers greater flexibility and freedom.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} Due to their compact size, microSD cards are used in many{{Which|date=October 2016}} different applications in a large variety{{Which|date=October 2016}} of markets.

The files that were copied back can be tested either by comparing checksums (e.g. [[Md5sum|MD5]]), or trying to [[Data compression|compress]] them. The latter approach leverages the fact that counterfeited cards let the user read back files, which then consist of easily compressible uniform data (for example, repeating [[0xFF]]s).\n\n===Digital cameras===\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nSD/MMC cards replaced [[Toshiba]]'s [[SmartMedia]] as the dominant memory card format used in digital cameras. In 2001, SmartMedia had achieved nearly 50% use, but by 2005 SD/MMC had achieved over 40% of the digital camera market and SmartMedia's share had plummeted by 2007.\n\nAt this time, all the leading digital camera manufacturers used SD in their consumer product lines, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Casio]], [[Fujifilm]], [[Kodak]], [[Leica Camera|Leica]], [[Nikon]], [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]], [[Panasonic]], [[Pentax]], [[Ricoh]], [[Samsung]], and [[Sony]]. Formerly, [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] and [[Fujifilm]] used [[XD-Picture Card]]s (xD cards) exclusively, while [[Sony]] only used [[Memory Stick]]; by early 2010 all three supported SD.\n\nSome [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras continued to offer [[CompactFlash]] (CF), either on a second card slot or as the only storage, as CF supports much higher maximum capacities and historically was cheaper for the same capacity.\n\nSecure Digital memory cards can be used in Sony [[XDCAM]] EX [[camcorder]]s with an adapter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/micro-xdcamexsite/cat-accessories/product-MEADSD01/ |title=MEAD-SD01 SDHC card adapter (Sony) |publisher=Pro.sony.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref> and in Panasonic [[P2 (storage media)|P2 card]] equipment with a [[MicroP2]] adapter.\n\n===Personal computers===\nAlthough many [[personal computer]]s accommodate SD cards as an auxiliary storage device using a built-in slot, or can accommodate SD cards by means of a USB adapter, SD cards cannot be used as the primary [[hard disk]] through the onboard [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] controller, because none of the SD card variants support ATA signalling.

However, on computers that support [[bootstrapping]] from a USB interface, an SD card in a USB adapter can be the primary hard disk, provided it contains an operating system that supports USB access once the bootstrap is complete.\n\nSince late 2009, newer [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers with installed SD card readers have been able to boot in [[macOS]] from SD storage devices, when properly formatted to [[HFS Plus|Mac OS Extended]] file format and the default partition table set to [[GUID Partition Table]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3553 |title=About the SD and SDXC card slot |publisher=Support.apple.com |date=2013-06-08 |accessdate=2013-11-13}}</ref> (See [[#File system|Other file systems]] below).\n\nSD cards are increasing in usage and popular among owners of vintage computers like [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari]]. For example SIO2SD ([[Atari SIO|SIO]] is an Atari port for connecting external devices) is used nowadays. It may be an interesting fact that the whole collection of software for an 8-bit Atari may be included on one SD card that may have less than 4-8 GB of disk size (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://retrohax.net/sio2sd-for-atari/|title=SIO2SD for 8-bit Atari|date=May 9, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Embedded systems===\n[[File:Arduino Ethernet Shield (pre-production sample).jpg|thumb|A shield ([[daughterboard]]) that gives [[Arduino]] prototyping microprocessors access to SD cards]]\n\nIn 2008, the SDA specified Embedded SD, \"leverag[ing] well-known SD standards\" to enable non-removable SD-style devices on printed circuit boards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Embedded SD|publisher=SD Association|url=http://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/embedded_sd/|accessdate=2011-11-30}}</ref> However this standard was not adopted by the market while the [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]] standard became the de facto standard for embedded systems.

The SPI bus mode and one-bit SD bus mode are mandatory for all SD families, as explained in the next section. Once the host device and the SD card negotiate a bus interface mode, the usage of the numbered pins is the same for all card sizes.\n* '''SPI bus mode:''' [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus]] is primarily used by embedded [[microcontroller]]s. This bus type supports only a 3.3-volt interface. This is the only bus type that does not require a host license.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* '''One-bit SD bus mode:''' Separate command and data channels and a proprietary transfer format.\n* '''Four-bit SD bus mode:''' Uses extra pins plus some reassigned pins. This is the same protocol as the one-bit SD bus mode which uses one command and four data lines for faster data transfer. All SD cards support this mode. UHS-I and UHS-II require this bus type.\n* '''Two differential lines SD UHS-II mode:''' Uses two low-voltage differential interfaces to transfer commands and data. UHS-II cards include this interface in addition to the SD bus modes.\n\nThe physical interface comprises 9 pins, except that the miniSD card adds two unconnected pins in the center and the microSD card omits one of the two V<sub>SS</sub> (Ground) pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |title=SD Part 1, Physical Layer Simplified Specification, Version 4.10 |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232415/https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/simplified_specs/part1_410.pdf |archive-date=2013-12-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:MMC-SD-miniSD-microSD-Color-Numbers-Names.gif|thumb|upright|Official pin numbers for each card type (top to bottom): [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], SD, miniSD, microSD.

The host device thereby sends 48-bit commands and receives responses. The card can signal that a response will be delayed, but the host device can abort the dialogue.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n\nThrough issuing various commands, the host device can:<ref name=\"SDHCspec\"/>\n* Determine the type, memory capacity, and capabilities of the SD card\n* Command the card to use a different voltage, different clock speed, or advanced electrical interface\n* Prepare the card to receive a block to write to the flash memory, or read and reply with the contents of a specified block.\n\nThe command interface is an extension of the [[MultiMediaCard]] (MMC) interface. SD cards dropped support for some of the commands in the MMC protocol, but added commands related to copy protection. By using only commands supported by both standards until determining the type of card inserted, a host device can accommodate both SD and MMC cards.\n\n====Electrical interface====\nAll SD card families initially use a 3.3&nbsp;[[volt]] electrical interface. On command, SDHC and SDXC cards can switch to 1.8&nbsp;V operation.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAt initial power-up or card insertion, the host device selects either the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus or the one-bit SD bus by the voltage level present on Pin 1. Thereafter, the host device may issue a command to switch to the four-bit SD bus interface, if the SD card supports it. For various card types, support for the four-bit SD bus is either optional or mandatory.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\nAfter determining that the SD card supports it, the host device can also command the SD card to switch to a [[#Speed|higher transfer speed]]. Until determining the card's capabilities, the host device should not use a clock speed faster than 400&nbsp;kHz. SD cards other than SDIO (see below) have a \"Default Speed\" clock rate of 25&nbsp;MHz. The host device is not required to use the maximum clock speed that the card supports. It may operate at less than the maximum clock speed to conserve power.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Between commands, the host device can stop the clock entirely.\n\n====Achieving higher card speeds====\nThe SD specification defines four-bit-wide transfers. (The MMC specification supports this and also defines an eight-bit-wide mode; MMC cards with extended bits were not accepted by the market.) Transferring several bits on each clock pulse improves the card speed. Advanced SD families have also improved speed by offering faster clock frequencies and double data rate (explained [[#UHS Speed Class|here]]) in a high-speed differential interface (UHS-II).{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===File system===\nLike other types of [[flash memory]] card, an SD card of any SD family is a [[block (data storage)|block-addressable]] [[Data storage device|storage device]], in which the host device can read or write fixed-size blocks by specifying their block number.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n====MBR and FAT====\nMost SD cards ship preformatted with one or more [[Master boot record|MBR partitions]], where the first or only partition contains a [[file system]]. This lets them operate like the [[hard disk]] of a [[personal computer]]. Per the SD card specification, an SD card is formatted with MBR and the following file system:\n\n* For SDSC cards:\n** Capacity of less than 32,680 logical sectors<!-- This is the exact condition as per the SD card spec.

Universal support for FAT12, FAT16, FAT16B, and FAT32 allows the use of SDSC and SDHC cards on most host computers with a compatible SD reader, to present the user with the familiar method of named files in a hierarchical directory tree.\n\nOn such SD cards, standard utility programs such as Mac OS X's \"{{nowrap|[[Disk Utility]]}}\" or Windows' [[SCANDISK]] can be used to repair a corrupted filing system and sometimes recover deleted files. [[Defragmentation]] tools for FAT file systems may be used on such cards. The resulting consolidation of files may provide a marginal improvement in the time required to read or write the file,<ref name=\"Fragmentation_and_Speed\">{{Citation | url = https://www.sdcard.org/developers/overview/speed_class/ | title = Fragmentation and Speed | publisher = SD Card}}</ref> but not an improvement comparable to defragmentation of hard drives, where storing a file in multiple fragments requires additional physical, and relatively slow, movement of a drive head. Moreover, defragmentation performs writes to the SD card that count against the card's rated lifespan. The write endurance of the physical memory is discussed in the article on [[Flash memory degradation|flash memory]]; newer technology to increase the storage capacity of a card provides worse write endurance.\n\nWhen reformatting an SD card with a capacity of at least 32&nbsp;MB (65536 logical sectors or more), but not more than 2&nbsp;GB, [[FAT16B]] with partition type [[Partition type#PID 06h|06h]] and [[EBPB 4.1]]<ref name=\"SDG_2000_SD-P2-V1.0\"/> is recommended if the card is for a consumer device. (FAT16B is also an option for 4&nbsp;GB cards, but it requires the use of 64&nbsp;KiB [[cluster (file system)|clusters]], which are not widely supported.) FAT16B does not support cards above 4&nbsp;GB at all.\n\nThe SDXC specification mandates the use of [[Microsoft]]'s [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[exFAT]] file system,<ref name=\"engadget_sdxc_2t_300m\">{{cite web | url = https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/07/sdxc-memory-cards-promise-2tb-of-storage-300mbps-transfer/ |title = SDXC memory cards promise 2 TB of storage, 300 MBps transfer | publisher=Engadget |date= 2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> which sometimes requires appropriate drivers (e.g. <code>exfat-utils</code>/<code>exfat-fuse</code> on Linux).\n\n====Other file systems====\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\nBecause the host views the SD card as a block storage device, the card does not require MBR partitions or any specific file system. The card can be reformatted to use any file system the operating system supports. For example:\n* Under [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], SD cards can be formatted using [[NTFS]] and, on later versions, [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[macOS]], SD cards can be partitioned as [[GUID Partition Table|GUID]] devices and formatted with either [[HFS Plus]] or [[Apple File System|APFS]] file systems or still use [[exFAT]].\n* Under [[Unix-like]] operating systems such as [[Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]], SD cards can be formatted using the [[Unix File System|UFS]], [[Ext2]], [[Ext3]], [[Ext4]], [[btrfs]], [[HFS Plus]], [[ReiserFS]] or [[F2FS]] file system. Additionally under Linux, [[HFS Plus]] file systems may be accessed for read/write if the \"hfsplus\" package is installed, and partitioned and formatted if \"hfsprogs\" is installed. (These package names are correct under Debian, Ubuntu etc., but may differ on other Linux distributions.)\n\nAny recent version of the above can format SD cards using the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system.\n\nAdditionally, as with [[live USB]] flash drives, an SD card can have an operating system installed on it. Computers that can [[booting|boot]] from an SD card (either using a USB adapter or inserted into the computer's flash media reader) instead of the hard disk drive may thereby be able to recover from a corrupted hard disk drive.<ref>Any operating system used on [[Raspberry Pi]] generally have to boot off a Live SD, most commonly Raspbian.</ref> Such an SD card can be [[#Card security|write-locked]] to preserve the system's integrity.\n\nThe SD Standard allows usage of only the above-mentioned Microsoft FAT file systems and any card produced in the market shall be preloaded with the related standard file system upon its delivery to the market. If any application or user re-formats the card with a non-standard file system the proper operation of the card, including interoperability, cannot be assured.\n\n====Risks of reformatting====\nReformatting an SD card with a different file system, or even with the same one, may make the card slower, or shorten its lifespan. Some cards use [[wear leveling]], in which frequently modified blocks are mapped to different portions of memory at different times, and some wear-leveling algorithms are designed for the access patterns typical of FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/428584/ |title=Optimizing Linux with cheap flash drives |publisher=Linux Weekly News|accessdate=2011-04-11}}</ref> In addition, the preformatted file system may use a cluster size that matches the erase region of the physical memory on the card; reformatting may change the cluster size and make writes less efficient.  The SD Association provides freely-downloadable SD Formatter software to overcome these problems for Windows and Mac OS X.<ref name=sdfmt>[https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_3/ SD Formatter 3.1 for SD/SDHC/SDXC], SD Association</ref>\n\nSD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards have a \"Protected Area\" on the card for the SD standard's security function.  Neither standard formatters nor the SD Association formatter will erase it.  The SD Association suggests that devices or software which use the SD security function may format it.<ref name=sdfmt/>\n\n===Power consumption===\nThe power consumption of SD cards varies by its speed mode, manufacturer and model.\n\nDuring transfer it may be in the range of 66\u2013330&nbsp;mW (20\u2013100&nbsp;mA at a supply voltage of 3.3&nbsp;V). Specifications from TwinMos technologies list a maximum of 149&nbsp;mW (45&nbsp;mA) during transfer. Toshiba lists 264\u2013330&nbsp;mW (80\u2013100&nbsp;mA).<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.toshiba-memory.com/en/micro_sd_cards.html | contribution = microSD & microSDHC Cards | publisher = Toshiba | title = Memory Solutions}}</ref> Standby current is much lower, less than 0.2&nbsp;mA for one 2006 microSD card.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | publisher = DTT | title = Micro SD specification | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130207004550/http://www.dtt8.com/images/micro-sd%20specification.pdf | archive-date = 2013-02-07 | df =  }}</ref> If there is data transfer for significant periods, battery life may be reduced noticeably (smartphones typically have batteries of capacity around 6&nbsp;Wh (Samsung Galaxy S2, 1650&nbsp;mAh @ 3.7&nbsp;V)).\n\nModern UHS-II cards can consume up to 2.88&nbsp;W, if the host device supports bus speed mode SDR104 or UHS-II.

The resulting cards do not work correctly in some host devices.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.hjreggel.net/cardspeed/special-sd.html | contribution = SD Compatibility | title = Card speed \u2013 Card Readers and Memory Cards | date = December 1, 2006 | publisher = HJ Reggel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/33338344/winxp-sp3-cant-read-4gb.aspx |title=WinXP SP3 cannot read 4GB SD card in multicard reader |publisher=Egg head cafe | accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\n===SDSC cards above 1 GB===\n[[File:Sd4gy crop.jpg|thumb|4&nbsp;GB SDSC card]]\n\nA host device can ask any inserted SD card for its 128-bit identification string (the Card-Specific Data or CSD). In standard-capacity cards (SDSC), 12 bits identify the number of memory clusters (ranging from 1 to 4,096) and 3 bits identify the number of blocks per cluster (which decode to 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 512 blocks per cluster). The host device multiplies these figures (as shown in the following section) with the number of bytes per block to determine the card's capacity in bytes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nSD version 1.00 assumed 512 bytes per block. This permitted SDSC cards up to 4,096 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 512 B = 1&nbsp;GiB, for which there are no known incompatibilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nVersion 1.01 let an SDSC card use a 4-bit field to indicate 1,024 or 2,048 bytes per block instead.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Doing so enabled cards with 2&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB capacity, such as the Transcend 4&nbsp;GB SD card and the Memorette 4 GB SD card.\n\nEarly SDSC host devices that assume 512-byte blocks therefore do not fully support the insertion of 2&nbsp;GB or 4&nbsp;GB cards. In some cases, the host device can read data that happens to reside in the first 1&nbsp;GB of the card. If the assumption is made in the driver software, success may be version-dependent. In addition, any host device might not support a 4&nbsp;GB SDSC card, since the specification lets it assume that 2&nbsp;GB is the maximum for these cards.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Storage capacity calculations===\nThe format of the Card-Specific Data (CSD) register changed between version 1 (SDSC) and version 2.0 (which defines SDHC and SDXC).\n\n====Version 1====\nIn version 1 of the SD specification, capacities up to 2&nbsp;GB are calculated by combining fields of the CSD as follows:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 2<sup>('''C_SIZE_MULT''' + '''READ_BL_LEN''' + 2)</sup>\n where\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 4095,\n   0 \u2264 '''C_SIZE_MULT''' \u2264 7,\n   '''READ_BL_LEN''' is 9 (for 512 bytes/sector) or 10 (for 1024 bytes/sector)\n\nLater versions state (at Section 4.3.2) that a 2&nbsp;GB SDSC card shall set its READ_BL_LEN (and WRITE_BL_LEN) to indicate 1024 bytes, so that the above computation correctly reports the card's capacity; but that, for consistency, the host device shall not request (by CMD16) block lengths over 512 B.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" />\n\n====Versions 2 and 3====\nIn the definition of SDHC cards in version 2.0, the C_SIZE portion of the CSD is 22 bits and it indicates the memory size in multiples of 512&nbsp;KiB (the C_SIZE_MULT field is removed and READ_BL_LEN is no longer used to compute capacity). Two bits that were formerly reserved now identify the card family: 0 is SDSC; 1 is SDHC or SDXC; 2 and 3 are reserved.<ref name=\"SDHCspec\" /> Because of these redefinitions, older host devices do not correctly identify SDHC or SDXC cards nor their correct capacity.\n\n* SDHC cards are restricted to reporting a capacity not over 32&nbsp;GB.\n* SDXC cards are allowed to use all 22 bits of the C_SIZE field. An SDHC card that did so (reported C_SIZE > 65375 to indicate a capacity of over 32&nbsp;GB) would violate the specification. A host device that relied on C_SIZE rather than the specification to determine the card's maximum capacity might support such a card, but the card might fail in other SDHC-compatible host devices.\n\nCapacity is calculated thus:\n\n Capacity = ('''C_SIZE''' + 1) \u00d7 524288\n where for SDHC  \n   4112 \u2264 '''C_SIZE''' \u2264 65375  \n   \u22482&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 \u224832&nbsp;GB\n where for SDXC \n   65535 \u2264 '''C_SIZE'''\n   \u224832&nbsp;GB \u2264 Capacity \u2264 2&nbsp;TB\n\nCapacities above 4&nbsp;GB can only be achieved by following version 2.0 or later versions. In addition, capacities equal to 4&nbsp;GB must also do so to guarantee compatibility.\n\n==Openness of specification==\n[[File:SD-microSD adaptor.jpg|thumb|upright|Dismantled microSD to SD adapter showing the passive connection from the microSD card slot on the bottom to the SD pins on the top]]\n\nLike most memory card formats, SD is covered by numerous [[patent]]s and [[trademark]]s. Excluding [[Secure Digital#SDIO cards|SDIO]] cards, [[Royalty payment|royalties]] for SD card licenses are imposed for manufacture and sale of memory cards and host adapters (US$1,000/year plus membership at US$1,500/year)\n\nEarly versions of the SD specification were available under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] (NDA) prohibiting development of [[open-source software|open-source]] drivers. However, the system was eventually [[reverse-engineered]] and free software drivers provided access to SD cards not using DRM. Subsequent to the release of most open-source drivers, the SDA provided a simplified version of the specification under a less restrictive license helping reduce some incompatibility issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/20060 |title=Sharp Linux PDA promotes the use of proprietary SD card, but more open MMC works just fine |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nUnder a disclaimers agreement, the simplified specification released by the SDA in 2006 \u2013 as opposed to that of SD cards \u2013 which later extended to the physical layer, ASSD extensions, SDIO, and SDIO [[Bluetooth]] Type-A.<ref>[http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ Simplified Specification Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028165644/http://www.sdcard.org/developers/tech/sdcard/pls/ |date=2008-10-28 }} from the SDA's website</ref> Again, most of the information had already been discovered and [[Linux]] had a fully free driver for it. Still, building a chip conforming to this specification caused the [[One Laptop per Child]] project to claim \"the first truly Open Source SD implementation, with no need to obtain an SDI license or sign NDAs to create SD drivers or applications.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html |title=OLPC mailing list archive |publisher=Mailman.laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412094819/http://mailman.laptop.org/pipermail/community-news/2006-September/000023.html|archivedate=2011-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe proprietary nature of the complete SD specification affects [[embedded system]]s, laptop computers, and some desktop computers; many desktop computers do not have card slots, instead using [[USB]]-based [[card reader#Memory card readers|card readers]] if necessary. These card readers present a standard [[USB mass storage]] interface to memory cards, thus separating the operating system from the details of the underlying SD interface. However, embedded systems (such as portable music players) usually gain direct access to SD cards and thus need complete programming information. Desktop card readers are themselves embedded systems; their manufacturers have usually paid the SDA for complete access to the SD specifications. Many notebook computers now include SD card readers not based on USB; device drivers for these essentially gain direct access to the SD card, as do embedded systems.\n\nThe [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]]-bus interface mode is the only type that does not require a host license for accessing SD cards.\n\n==Comparison to other flash memory formats==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}\n[[File:Flash memory cards size.jpg|thumb|upright|Size comparison of various flash cards: SD, [[CompactFlash]], [[MultiMediaCard|MMC]], [[xD-Picture Card|xD]]]]\n\nOverall, SD is less open than [[CompactFlash]] or [[USB flash drive|USB flash memory drives]]. Those [[open standard]]s can be implemented without paying for licensing, royalties, or documentation. (CompactFlash and USB flash drives may require licensing fees for the use of the SDA's trademarked logos.)\n\nHowever, SD is much more open than [[Memory Stick|Sony's Memory Stick]], for which no public documentation nor any documented legacy implementation is available. All SD cards can be accessed freely using the well-documented [[Serial Peripheral Interface Bus|SPI]] bus.\n\n[[xD-Picture Card|xD]] cards are simply 18-pin [[NAND flash]] chips in a special package and support [[XD-Picture Card#Raw hardware|the standard command set]] for raw NAND flash access. Although the raw hardware interface to xD cards is well understood, the layout of its memory contents\u2014necessary for interoperability with xD card readers and digital cameras\u2014is totally undocumented. The consortium that licenses xD cards has not released any technical information to the public.\n\n{{Comparison of memory cards}}\n\n==Data recovery==\nA malfunctioning SD card can be repaired using specialized equipment, as long as the middle part, containing the flash storage, is not physically damaged.
