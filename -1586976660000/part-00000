Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.\n\nWood and other plant materials used to make pulp contain three main components (apart from water): cellulose fibers (desired for papermaking), [[lignin]] (a three-dimensional polymer that binds the cellulose fibres together) and [[hemicellulose]]s, (shorter branched carbohydrate polymers). The aim of pulping is to break down the bulk structure of the fibre source, be it chips, stems or other plant parts, into the constituent fibres.\n\nChemical pulping achieves this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules which can be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. There are a number of related hybrid pulping methods that use a combination of chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping, also known as TMP, and chemithermomechanical pulping, also known as CTMP. The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Global pulp production by category (2000)<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of pulp|volume=1 |editor1-last=Sixta |editor1-first=Herbert |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Winheim, Germany |isbn=3-527-30997-7 |page=9 }}</ref>\n|align=\"left\" | '''Pulp category'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''Production [M [[Tonne|ton]]''']\n|-\n| Chemical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 131.2\n|-\n| Kraft\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''117.0''\n|-\n| Sulfite\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''7.0''\n|-\n| Semichemical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''7.2''\n|-\n| Mechanical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 37.8\n|-\n| Nonwood\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 18.0\n|-\n|| '''Total virgin fibres'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''187.0'''\n|-\n| Recovered fibres\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 147.0\n|-\n|| '''Total pulp'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''334.0'''\n|}\n\n=== Harvesting trees ===\n{{Main|Logging}}\nMost pulp mills use good [[forest management]] practices in harvesting trees to ensure that they have a sustainable source of raw materials. One of the major complaints about harvesting wood for pulp mills is that it reduces the [[biodiversity]] of the harvested forest.  Pulp [[tree plantations]] account for 16 percent of world pulp production, [[old-growth forest]]s 9 percent, and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the rest.<ref name=\"chase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070619104819/http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-19 |title=Paper Chase |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Martin |first=Sam |year=2004 |publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc. }}</ref> [[Reforestation]] is practiced in most areas, so trees are a [[renewable resource]].

Only the [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] are useful for making pulp. [[Bark (botany)|Bark]] contains relatively few useful fibers and is removed and used as fuel to provide steam for use in the pulp mill. Most pulping processes require that the wood be chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips.\n\n===Pulping===\nThere are a number of different processes which can be used to separate the wood fiber:\n\n====Mechanical pulp====\nManufactured [[grindstone]]s with embedded [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminum oxide]] can be used to grind small wood logs called \"bolts\" to make stone  pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as [[newsprint]] and [[paperboard]]s.\n\n====Thermomechanical pulp====\n[[File:Mechanicalpulping.png|thumb|300px|right|Mechanical pulping process<ref name=igg/>]]\n\nThermomechanical pulp is pulp produced by processing [[Woodchips|wood chips]] using heat (thus \"[[wikt:thermo-|thermo-]]\") and a mechanical refining movement (thus \"-mechanical\"). It is a two-stage process where the logs are first stripped of their [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and converted into small chips. These chips have a moisture content of around 25\u201330 percent. A mechanical force is applied to the wood chips in a crushing or grinding action which generates heat and water vapour and softens the [[lignin]] thus separating the individual fibres. The pulp is then screened and cleaned, any clumps of fibre are reprocessed. This process gives a high yield of fibre from the [[timber]] (around 95 percent) and as the lignin has not been removed, the fibres are hard and rigid.<ref name=igg>{{Cite journal\n|last=Iggesund Paperboard AB\n|title=Paperboard the Iggesund Way\n|year=2008\n|page=15}}</ref>\n\n====Chemi-thermomechanical pulp====\nWood chips can be pre-treated with [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[sodium sulfate]] and other chemicals prior to refining with equipment similar to a mechanical mill. The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme [[pH]]) than in a chemical pulping process since the goal is to make the fibers easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process. Pulps made using these hybrid processes are known as chemi-thermomechanical pulps (CTMP).\n\n====Chemical pulp====\n[[File:InternationalPaper6413.jpg|thumb|[[International Paper]] Company, a pulp mill that makes [[fluff pulp]] for use in [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] products with the [[kraft process]]]]\n{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Soda pulping}}\n{{See also|Dissolving pulp|Fluff pulp|NBSK|SBSK (pulp)}}\n'''Chemical pulp''' is produced by combining wood chips and chemicals in large vessels called digesters. There, heat and chemicals break down lignin, which binds [[cellulose]] fibres together, without seriously degrading the [[cellulose fibre]]s. Chemical pulp is used for materials that need to be stronger or combined with mechanical pulps to give a product different characteristics. The [[kraft process]] is the dominant chemical pulping method, with the [[sulfite process]] second. Historically [[soda pulping]] was the first successful chemical pulping method.\n\n====Recycled pulp====\n{{Main|Paper recycling|Deinking}}\n'''Recycled pulp''' is also called '''deinked pulp''' (DIP). DIP is [[paper recycling|recycled paper]] which has been processed by chemicals, thus removing [[printing ink]]s and other unwanted elements and freed the paper fibres. The process is called [[deinking]].\n\nDIP is used as raw material in [[papermaking]]. Many [[newsprint]], [[toilet paper]] and [[facial tissue]] grades commonly contain 100 percent deinked pulp and in many other grades, such as lightweight coated for offset and printing and writing papers for office and home use, DIP makes up a substantial proportion of the furnish.\n\n====Organosolv pulping====\n{{Main|organosolv}}\nOrganosolv pulping uses organic solvents at temperatures above 140&nbsp;\u00b0C to break down lignin and hemicellulose into soluble fragments. The pulping liquor is easily recovered by distillation. The reason for using a solvent is to make the [[lignin]] more soluble in the cooking liquor. Most common used solvents are [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[formic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] often in combination with [[water]].\n\n====Alternative pulping methods====\nResearch is under way to develop biopulping (biological pulping), similar to chemical pulping but using certain species of [[fungus|fungi]] that are able to break down the unwanted lignin, but not the cellulose fibres.<ref>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |title=Lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by tropical white rot fungi during biopulping of Acacia mangium wood chips|url=http://www.jbiochemtech.com/index.php/jbt/article/download/jbt322/83|author1=Husaini, Ahmad |author2=Fisol, Faisalina Ahmad |author3=Yun, Liew Chia |author4=Hussain, Mohd Hasnain |author5=Muid, Sepiah |author6=Roslan, Hairul Azman |journal= J Biochem Tech |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= 245\u2013250 }}</ref> In the biopulping process, the fungal enzyme [[lignin peroxidase]] selectively digests lignin to leave remaining cellulose fibres. This could have major [[Environmentally friendly|environmental benefits]] in reducing the pollution associated with chemical pulping. The pulp is bleached using chlorine dioxide stage followed by neutralization and calcium hypochlorite. The oxidizing agent in either case oxidizes and destroys the dyes formed from the tannins of the wood and accentuated (reinforced) by sulfides present in it.\n\n[[Steam exploded fiber|Steam exploded fibre]] is a pulping and extraction technique that has been applied to wood and other fibrous organic material.<ref name=\"Avella 1995\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/apmc.1995.052330113|title=Steam-exploded wheat straw fibres as reinforcing material for polypropylene-based composites.

This is pulp dried to about 10 percent moisture content. It is normally delivered as sheeted bales of 250&nbsp;kg.

Modern [[logging]] practices, using [[forest management]] seek to provide a reliable, renewable source of raw materials for [[pulp mill]]s. The practice of [[clear cutting]] is a particularly sensitive issue since it is a very visible effect of [[logging]]. [[Reforestation]], the planting of tree seedlings on logged areas, has also been criticized for decreasing [[biodiversity]] because reforested areas are [[monocultures]].\nLogging of [[old growth forest]]s accounts for less than 10 percent of wood pulp,<ref name=\"chase\"/> but is one of the most controversial issues.\n\n===Effluents from pulp mills===\n{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Bleaching of wood pulp}}\n\nThe process effluents are treated in a biological [[Industrial wastewater treatment|effluent treatment plant]], which guarantees that the effluents are not toxic in the recipient.\n\nMechanical pulp is not a major cause for environmental concern since most of the organic material is retained in the pulp, and the chemicals used ([[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[sodium dithionite]]) produce benign byproducts (water and [[sodium sulfate]] (finally), respectively).\n\nChemical pulp mills, especially kraft mills, are energy self-sufficient and very nearly closed cycle with respect to inorganic chemicals.\n\n[[Bleaching of wood pulp|Bleaching]] with chlorine  produces large amounts of [[organochlorine]] compounds, including [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]].<ref name=\"can\">{{cite book |url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/contaminants/psl1-lsp1/pulp_mill_effluents_pate_blanchie/index_e.html |title=Effluents from Pulp Mills using Bleaching \u2013 PSL1 |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last= |first= |year=1991 |isbn=0-662-18734-2 |publisher=Health Canada}}</ref>\n\n===Odor problems===\nThe kraft pulping reaction in particular releases foul-smelling compounds. The hydrogen sulfide reagent that degrades lignin structure also causes some demethylation to produce [[methanethiol]], [[dimethyl sulfide]] and [[dimethyl disulfide]].  These same compounds are released during many forms of microbial decay, including the internal microbial action in [[Camembert cheese]], although the kraft process is a chemical one and does not involve any microbial degradation.  These compounds have extremely low odor thresholds and disagreeable smells.\n\n==Applications==\nThe main applications for pulp are [[paper]] and [[Paperboard|board]] production. The furnish of pulps used depends on the quality on the finished paper. Important quality parameters are [[Pulpwood|wood furnish]], [[Bleaching of wood pulp|brightness]], viscosity, extractives, dirt count and strength.\n\nChemical pulps are used for making [[nanocellulose]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\nSpeciality pulp grades have many other applications.

Pulp can be manufactured using mechanical, semi-chemical or fully chemical methods (kraft and sulfite processes). The finished product may be either bleached or non-bleached, depending on the customer requirements.\n\nWood and other plant materials used to make pulp contain three main components (apart from water): cellulose fibers (desired for papermaking), [[lignin]] (a three-dimensional polymer that binds the cellulose fibres together) and [[hemicellulose]]s, (shorter branched carbohydrate polymers). The aim of pulping is to break down the bulk structure of the fibre source, be it chips, stems or other plant parts, into the constituent fibres.\n\nChemical pulping achieves this by degrading the lignin and hemicellulose into small, water-soluble molecules which can be washed away from the cellulose fibres without depolymerizing the cellulose fibres (chemically depolymerizing the cellulose weakens the fibres). The various mechanical pulping methods, such as groundwood (GW) and refiner mechanical (RMP) pulping, physically tear the cellulose fibres one from another. Much of the lignin remains adhering to the fibres. Strength is impaired because the fibres may be cut. There are a number of related hybrid pulping methods that use a combination of chemical and thermal treatment to begin an abbreviated chemical pulping process, followed immediately by a mechanical treatment to separate the fibres. These hybrid methods include thermomechanical pulping, also known as TMP, and chemithermomechanical pulping, also known as CTMP. The chemical and thermal treatments reduce the amount of energy subsequently required by the mechanical treatment, and also reduce the amount of strength loss suffered by the fibres.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Global pulp production by category (2000)<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of pulp|volume=1 |editor1-last=Sixta |editor1-first=Herbert |year=2006 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Winheim, Germany |isbn=3-527-30997-7 |page=9 }}</ref>\n|align=\"left\" | '''Pulp category'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''Production [M [[Tonne|ton]]''']\n|-\n| Chemical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 131.2\n|-\n| Kraft\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''117.0''\n|-\n| Sulfite\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''7.0''\n|-\n| Semichemical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| ''7.2''\n|-\n| Mechanical\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 37.8\n|-\n| Nonwood\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 18.0\n|-\n|| '''Total virgin fibres'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''187.0'''\n|-\n| Recovered fibres\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| 147.0\n|-\n|| '''Total pulp'''\n| style=\"text-align:right;\"| '''334.0'''\n|}\n\n=== Harvesting trees ===\n{{Main|Logging}}\nMost pulp mills use good [[forest management]] practices in harvesting trees to ensure that they have a sustainable source of raw materials. One of the major complaints about harvesting wood for pulp mills is that it reduces the [[biodiversity]] of the harvested forest.  Pulp [[tree plantations]] account for 16 percent of world pulp production, [[old-growth forest]]s 9 percent, and second- and third- and more generation forests account for the rest.<ref name=\"chase\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070619104819/http://www.ecology.com/feature-stories/paper-chase/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-06-19 |title=Paper Chase |accessdate=2007-09-21 |last=Martin |first=Sam |year=2004 |publisher=Ecology Communications, Inc. }}</ref> [[Reforestation]] is practiced in most areas, so trees are a [[renewable resource]].

Mechanical pulping is about twice as efficient in using trees, since almost all of the wood is used to make fibre, therefore it takes about 12 trees to make 0.9&nbsp;tonne (1&nbsp;ton) of mechanical pulp or [[newsprint]].<ref>[http://www.conservatree.com/learn/EnviroIssues/TreeStats.shtml Trees Into Paper].

Only the [[heartwood]] and [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] are useful for making pulp. [[Bark (botany)|Bark]] contains relatively few useful fibers and is removed and used as fuel to provide steam for use in the pulp mill. Most pulping processes require that the wood be chipped and screened to provide uniform sized chips.\n\n===Pulping===\nThere are a number of different processes which can be used to separate the wood fiber:\n\n====Mechanical pulp====\nManufactured [[grindstone]]s with embedded [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminum oxide]] can be used to grind small wood logs called \"bolts\" to make stone  pulp (SGW). If the wood is steamed prior to grinding it is known as pressure ground wood pulp (PGW). Most modern mills use chips rather than logs and ridged metal discs called refiner plates instead of grindstones. If the chips are just ground up with the plates, the pulp is called refiner mechanical pulp (RMP) and if the chips are steamed while being refined the pulp is called thermomechanical pulp (TMP). Steam treatment significantly reduces the total energy needed to make the pulp and decreases the damage (cutting) to fibres. Mechanical pulps are used for products that require less strength, such as [[newsprint]] and [[paperboard]]s.\n\n====Thermomechanical pulp====\n[[File:Mechanicalpulping.png|thumb|300px|right|Mechanical pulping process<ref name=igg/>]]\n\nThermomechanical pulp is pulp produced by processing [[Woodchips|wood chips]] using heat (thus \"[[wikt:thermo-|thermo-]]\") and a mechanical refining movement (thus \"-mechanical\"). It is a two-stage process where the logs are first stripped of their [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and converted into small chips. These chips have a moisture content of around 25\u201330 percent. A mechanical force is applied to the wood chips in a crushing or grinding action which generates heat and water vapour and softens the [[lignin]] thus separating the individual fibres. The pulp is then screened and cleaned, any clumps of fibre are reprocessed. This process gives a high yield of fibre from the [[timber]] (around 95 percent) and as the lignin has not been removed, the fibres are hard and rigid.<ref name=igg>{{Cite journal\n|last=Iggesund Paperboard AB\n|title=Paperboard the Iggesund Way\n|year=2008\n|page=15}}</ref>\n\n====Chemi-thermomechanical pulp====\nWood chips can be pre-treated with [[sodium carbonate]], [[sodium hydroxide]], [[sodium sulfate]] and other chemicals prior to refining with equipment similar to a mechanical mill. The conditions of the chemical treatment are much less vigorous (lower temperature, shorter time, less extreme [[pH]]) than in a chemical pulping process since the goal is to make the fibers easier to refine, not to remove lignin as in a fully chemical process. Pulps made using these hybrid processes are known as chemi-thermomechanical pulps (CTMP).\n\n====Chemical pulp====\n[[File:InternationalPaper6413.jpg|thumb|[[International Paper]] Company, a pulp mill that makes [[fluff pulp]] for use in [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbent]] products with the [[kraft process]]]]\n{{Main|Kraft process|Sulfite process|Soda pulping}}\n{{See also|Dissolving pulp|Fluff pulp|NBSK|SBSK (pulp)}}\n'''Chemical pulp''' is produced by combining wood chips and chemicals in large vessels called digesters. There, heat and chemicals break down lignin, which binds [[cellulose]] fibres together, without seriously degrading the [[cellulose fibre]]s. Chemical pulp is used for materials that need to be stronger or combined with mechanical pulps to give a product different characteristics. The [[kraft process]] is the dominant chemical pulping method, with the [[sulfite process]] second. Historically [[soda pulping]] was the first successful chemical pulping method.\n\n====Recycled pulp====\n{{Main|Paper recycling|Deinking}}\n'''Recycled pulp''' is also called '''deinked pulp''' (DIP). DIP is [[paper recycling|recycled paper]] which has been processed by chemicals, thus removing [[printing ink]]s and other unwanted elements and freed the paper fibres. The process is called [[deinking]].\n\nDIP is used as raw material in [[papermaking]]. Many [[newsprint]], [[toilet paper]] and [[facial tissue]] grades commonly contain 100 percent deinked pulp and in many other grades, such as lightweight coated for offset and printing and writing papers for office and home use, DIP makes up a substantial proportion of the furnish.\n\n====Organosolv pulping====\n{{Main|organosolv}}\nOrganosolv pulping uses organic solvents at temperatures above 140&nbsp;\u00b0C to break down lignin and hemicellulose into soluble fragments. The pulping liquor is easily recovered by distillation. The reason for using a solvent is to make the [[lignin]] more soluble in the cooking liquor. Most common used solvents are [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[formic acid]] and [[acetic acid]] often in combination with [[water]].\n\n====Alternative pulping methods====\nResearch is under way to develop biopulping (biological pulping), similar to chemical pulping but using certain species of [[fungus|fungi]] that are able to break down the unwanted lignin, but not the cellulose fibres.<ref>{{cite journal |year= 2011 |title=Lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by tropical white rot fungi during biopulping of Acacia mangium wood chips|url=http://www.jbiochemtech.com/index.php/jbt/article/download/jbt322/83|author1=Husaini, Ahmad |author2=Fisol, Faisalina Ahmad |author3=Yun, Liew Chia |author4=Hussain, Mohd Hasnain |author5=Muid, Sepiah |author6=Roslan, Hairul Azman |journal= J Biochem Tech |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages= 245\u2013250 }}</ref> In the biopulping process, the fungal enzyme [[lignin peroxidase]] selectively digests lignin to leave remaining cellulose fibres. This could have major [[Environmentally friendly|environmental benefits]] in reducing the pollution associated with chemical pulping. The pulp is bleached using chlorine dioxide stage followed by neutralization and calcium hypochlorite. The oxidizing agent in either case oxidizes and destroys the dyes formed from the tannins of the wood and accentuated (reinforced) by sulfides present in it.\n\n[[Steam exploded fiber|Steam exploded fibre]] is a pulping and extraction technique that has been applied to wood and other fibrous organic material.<ref name=\"Avella 1995\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/apmc.1995.052330113|title=Steam-exploded wheat straw fibres as reinforcing material for polypropylene-based composites.

Modern [[logging]] practices, using [[forest management]] seek to provide a reliable, renewable source of raw materials for [[pulp mill]]s. The practice of [[clear cutting]] is a particularly sensitive issue since it is a very visible effect of [[logging]].
