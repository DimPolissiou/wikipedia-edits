The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

That game in particular attracted a large crowd as the town of Stockport supported its team at [[Edgeley Park]].

The club wasn't re-elected and spent one season outside the Football League before being elected back again at the end of 1904\u201305. Stockport then competed in it continuously for 106 years from 1905 to 2011. The team spent most of their history in the lower reaches of the Football League, having to seek re-election on many further occasions. Stockport won their first league championship in 1922 coming top of the newly created [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]].

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto.

In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

O'Grady was handed his debut when coming off the bench in Leicester's 2\u20130 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in April 2003, but failed to break through into the first team the following season.\n\nHe made 11 appearances during a loan spell at Notts County in late 2004, gaining some much needed league experience, and ended the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] campaign on a high, winning a place on the bench in City's final game of the season against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].\n\nAfter scoring from the penalty spot against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] in pre-season, O'Grady had a successful spell on loan at Rushden & Diamonds at the end of 2005, before returning to Leicester to compete for a place in the first team line-up.

the eye of former [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] boss [[Micky Adams]] as he was prolific in front of goal for the under 18s and reserves. O'Grady was handed his debut when coming off the bench in Leicester's 2\u20130 victory over [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in April 2003, but failed to break through into the first team the following season.\n\nHe made 11 appearances during a loan spell at Notts County in late 2004, gaining some much needed league experience, and ended the [[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] campaign on a high, winning a place on the bench in City's final game of the season against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].\n\nAfter scoring from the penalty spot against [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] in pre-season, O'Grady had a successful spell on loan at Rushden & Diamonds at the end of 2005, before returning to Leicester to compete for a place in the first team line-up. He grabbed his first [[Football League Championship|Championship]] goal at [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] in March 2006, a late strike which earned City a 2\u20131 away win.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luton 1\u20132 Leicester |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4773802.stm |website=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=18 January 2014 |date=11 March 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn his first start for Leicester City, he scored the first goal in a 2\u20130 win over [[Macclesfield Town F.C.|Macclesfield Town]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] first round.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leicester 2\u20130 Macclesfield |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/league_cup/5266284.stm |website=bbc.co.uk |accessdate=18 January 2014 |date=22 August 2006}}</ref> His second start saw Leicester win 1\u20130 at home to [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]].\n\n===Rotherham United===\nOn 18 January 2007, O'Grady signed for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] on a two-and-a-half-year deal for [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]65,000.

Past research projects include the study of energy use and conservation, the crowd in contemporary Britain, youth and unemployment, and social and cognitive aspects of survey methodology.\n\nGeorge Gaskell is well known for developing the [[Social Representations|toblerone model of social representations]] with [[Martin Bauer]], for his edited handbook with Martin Bauer, ''Qualitative Researching with Text, Image and Sound: A Practical Handbook'' (2000), which provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to a broad range of research methods with the objective of clarifying procedures, good practice and public accountability \u2013 now translated into Portuguese, Hebrew and Chinese.\n\nHis current research, drawing on social representations theory, focuses on science, technology and society, in particular the issues of risk and trust; how values influence people\u2019s views about technological innovation, and the governance of science and technology. Since 1996 he has coordinated the series of Eurobarometer surveys on \u2018Biotechnology and the Life Sciences\u2019 for DG Research. He was principal investigator of \u2018Life Sciences in European Society\u2019 (LSES), a European comparative study of biotechnology in the public sphere funded by FP6 of the European Commission and more recently \u2018Sensitive technologies and European Public Ethics\u2019 (STEPE).\n\n== Publications ==\n\n'''Edited books and monographs'''\n\nGaskell, G., and Bauer, M.

He joined the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of 16, before being signed up to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in November 1974. He spent three years at the club before being sold on to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] for \u00a314,000. He returned to Portsmouth in 1981 for a \u00a350,000 fee, but was traded to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in October 1981. He spent four years with the \"Bees\" before leaving the club after picking up a runners-up medal in the [[Football League Trophy]] in [[1985 Football League Trophy Final|1985]].\n\nHe re-signed with Swindon Town in August 1985 and helped the club to two successive promotions into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. He moved on to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1988, and a successful spell with the club won him a move to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1990. He helped the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390, but was never a first team regular before being sold to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for \u00a3150,000 in 1991. He had loan spells with [[Premier League]] clubs [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], before joining Sheffield United on a permanent basis in 1993. The following year he joined [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as a player-coach.\n\nHe was appointed Bradford City manager in November 1995 and took the club from a relegation scrap to promotion out of the Second Division via the play-offs in [[1996 Football League Second Division play-off Final|1996]]. He left the club in January 1998 and quickly took the reins at Stoke City, before he left the \"Potters\" in April 1998. From there he became a broadcaster with Sky Sports and has since appeared as a presenter on numerous other television programmes.\n\n==Early life==\nKamara was born in [[Middlesbrough]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], to a Sierra Leonean father \u2013 Alimamy Kindo \"Albert\" Kamara \u2013 on Christmas Day in 1957.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=116}}</ref> Through his father he was eligible to play for [[Sierra Leone national football team|Sierra Leone]], and was called up to play in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations]], though he declined the offer.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=97}}</ref>\n\nHis father was a heavy gambler, leaving his mother Irene to sometimes plead for money from neighbours in order to provide food for Chris and his brother George and sister Maria.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=117}}</ref> Being one of the few black families in [[Park End, Middlesbrough]], the family suffered racist abuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=115}}</ref>\n\nHe remains a great friend of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] chairman [[Steve Gibson (businessman)|Steve Gibson]] with whom he grew up on the Park End council estate.

He joined the [[Royal Navy]] at the age of 16, before being signed up to [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in November 1974. He spent three years at the club before being sold on to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] for \u00a314,000. He returned to Portsmouth in 1981 for a \u00a350,000 fee, but was traded to [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] in October 1981. He spent four years with the \"Bees\" before leaving the club after picking up a runners-up medal in the [[Football League Trophy]] in [[1985 Football League Trophy Final|1985]].\n\nHe re-signed with Swindon Town in August 1985 and helped the club to two successive promotions into the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. He moved on to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in 1988, and a successful spell with the club won him a move to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 1990. He helped the club to the Second Division title in 1989\u201390, but was never a first team regular before being sold to [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]] for \u00a3150,000 in 1991. He had loan spells with [[Premier League]] clubs [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], before joining Sheffield United on a permanent basis in 1993. The following year he joined [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] as a player-coach.\n\nHe was appointed Bradford City manager in November 1995 and took the club from a relegation scrap to promotion out of the Second Division via the play-offs in [[1996 Football League Second Division play-off Final|1996]]. He left the club in January 1998 and quickly took the reins at Stoke City, before he left the \"Potters\" in April 1998. From there he became a broadcaster with Sky Sports and has since appeared as a presenter on numerous other television programmes.\n\n==Early life==\nKamara was born in [[Middlesbrough]], [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], to a Sierra Leonean father \u2013 Alimamy Kindo \"Albert\" Kamara \u2013 on Christmas Day in 1957.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=116}}</ref> Through his father he was eligible to play for [[Sierra Leone national football team|Sierra Leone]], and was called up to play in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations]], though he declined the offer.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=97}}</ref>\n\nHis father was a heavy gambler, leaving his mother Irene to sometimes plead for money from neighbours in order to provide food for Chris and his brother George and sister Maria.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=117}}</ref> Being one of the few black families in [[Park End, Middlesbrough]], the family suffered racist abuse.<ref>{{harvnb|Kamara|2011|p=115}}</ref>\n\nHe remains a great friend of [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] chairman [[Steve Gibson (businessman)|Steve Gibson]] with whom he grew up on the Park End council estate.
