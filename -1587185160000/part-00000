The country\u2019s major political parties have generally agreed on the broad outlines of foreign policy, and the government has been active in promoting [[free trade]], [[nuclear disarmament]], and [[arms control]].\n\nIn summer 2013, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|New Zealand Foreign Minister]] [[Murray McCully]] reported that:\n:All New Zealand's important relationships are in good repair....With the United States there are hopes of a major breakthrough in terms of trade relations. Sino - New Zealand relations are also subdued, but trade is burgeoning. Japan's decision to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a welcome change and New Zealand continues to pursue a free trade agreement with South Korea. The government is pressing ahead with plans to strengthen relations in a number of other areas, including Russia, South Asia, Latin America, the Persian Gulf and especially the South Pacific. It is also alive to the potential benefits of closer ties with countries on the African continent.<ref>Murray McCully, \"Keeping Relationships in Good Repair,\" ''New Zealand International Review'' (July 2013) 38#4 p 13</ref>{{Update|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of New Zealand|Independence of New Zealand}}\n\n===Maori rule===\nNew Zealand was first settled by [[Polynesians]] at some point between 800 and 1300 AD. From the 1760s New Zealand was visited by various European explorers and traders, and later missionaries and settlers. An informal system of trade was established, especially in [[Northland Region|Northland]], and some [[iwi]] (tribes) became wealthy and powerful. As M\u0101ori was a tribal-level society of many shifting chiefdoms, relationships with Europeans were ad hoc and informal. In 1835 a group of Northland chiefs, under the guidance of British resident [[James Busby]], signed a [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|declaration of independence]], which was recognised by Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.united-tribes.com/history.htm|work=United Tribes of New Zealand|title=History|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence |title=Declaration of Independence \u2013 background to the Treaty |work=New Zealand History Online |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=4 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811225106/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===British colony===\nMany M\u0101ori were still worried that a European power might invade and dispossess them, and some iwi were having difficulties controlling the large numbers of Europeans who visited and settled in their areas. English missionaries were also concerned about the levels of lawlessness, which were undermining their efforts to convert M\u0101ori to Christianity. The British [[Colonial Office]], influenced by the missionaries and by reports that the independent [[New Zealand Company]] was planning to privately colonise the islands, sent naval captain [[William Hobson]] to negotiate a treaty. The subsequent [[Treaty of Waitangi]], signed in 1840, made New Zealand part of the British Empire, established a [[Governor of New Zealand]], and gave M\u0101ori the rights of British subjects.\n\nThe annexation of New Zealand by Britain meant that Britain now controlled New Zealand's foreign policy. Subsidised large-scale immigration from Britain and Ireland began, and miners came for the gold rush around 1850-60. In the 1860s, the British sent 16,000 soldiers to contain the  [[New Zealand wars]] in the [[North Island]]. The colony shipped gold and, especially, wool to Britain. From the 1880s the development of [[refrigerated]] shipping allowed the establishment of an export economy based on the mass export of frozen meat and dairy products to Britain. In 1899-1902 New Zealand made its first contribution to an external war, sending troops to fight on the British side in the [[Second Boer War]]. The country changed its status from colony to [[dominion]] with internal self governance in 1907.\n\nNew Zealand eagerly sent a large fraction of its young men to fight on Britain's side in the First World War. Their heroism in the failed Gallipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and secured the psychological independence of the nation.\n\nAfter the war New Zealand signed the Treaty of Versailles (1919) joined the [[League of Nations]] and pursued an independent foreign policy, while its defense was still controlled by Britain. Wellington trusted Conservative Party governments in London, but not Labour. When the British Labour Party took power in 1924 and 1929, the New Zealand government felt threatened by Labour's foreign policy because of its reliance upon the League of Nations. The League was distrusted and Wellington did not expect to see the coming of a peaceful world order under League auspices. What had been the Empire's most loyal dominion became a dissenter as it opposed efforts the first and second British Labour governments to trust the League's framework of arbitration and collective security agreements.<ref>Gerald Chaudron, \"The League of Nations and Imperial Dissent: New Zealand and the British Labour Governments, 1924-31,\" ''Journal of Imperial & Commonwealth History'' (March 2011) 39#1 pp 47-71</ref>\n\nThe governments of the Reform and United parties between 1912 and 1935 followed a \"realistic\" foreign policy. They made national security a high priority, were skeptical of international institutions such as the League, and showed no interest on the questions of self-determination, democracy, and human rights. However the opposition Labour Party was more idealistic and proposed a liberal internationalist outlook on international affairs. From 1935 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] showed a limited degree of idealism in foreign policy, for example opposing the appeasement of Germany and Japan.<ref>D.J. McCraw, \"The Zenith of Realism in New Zealand\u2019s Foreign Policy,\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' (2002) 48#3 pp 353-368.</ref>\n\n===Second World War===\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, New Zealand whole-heartedly joined in the defence of Britain, with Prime Minister [[Michael Joseph Savage]] declaring that \"where Britain goes, we go; where Britain stands, we stand\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Malcolm McKinnon|title=Interdependence and Foreign Policy: New Zealand in the World Since 1935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cb4YAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT44|year=2013|publisher=Auckland U.P.|pages=43\u201344|isbn=9781775580959}}</ref>  New Zealand soldiers served in North Africa, Italy and the Pacific, and airmen in England and the Pacific, throughout the war, even when New Zealand had concerns about invasion by the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]. In 1947 New Zealand ratified the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which made certain former colonies completely self-governing.\n\n=== Since 1945 ===\nThe [[Fall of Singapore]] during World War II made New Zealand realise that she could no longer rely on Britain to defend the British Empire. New Zealand troops supported the British in the successful battle against [[Malayan Emergency|Communist insurrection in Malaysia]] and maintained an air-force fighter squadron in Singapore, and later on Cyprus, again supporting British forces. New Zealand diplomats sought an alliance with the [[United States|United States of America]], and in 1951 adhered to the [[ANZUS]] Treaty between New Zealand, Australia and the US. In return for America's guarantee of protection, New Zealand felt obliged to support America in its wars, and New Zealand committed forces to the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953) under United nation auspices and to the [[Vietnam War]]. By the 1970s, many New Zealanders began to feel uncomfortable with their country's support for the US, particularly in Vietnam and regarding the visits of nuclear-powered and armed American warships. The [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour government]] (1972\u20131975) pulled New Zealand troops out of the Vietnam War and protested against [[French nuclear testing]] in the Pacific, at one stage sending a warship to act as disapproving witness to the tests.\n\nBritain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 forced New Zealand into a more independent role.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1468-0289.00057|title = Britain, Butter, and European Integration, 1957\u20131964|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 327\u2013347|year = 1997|last1 = Singleton|first1 = John|last2 = Robertson|first2 = Paul L.}}</ref> The British move restricted New Zealand's trade access to its biggest market, and it sought new trading partners in Asia, America and the Middle East. Australia and New Zealand signed the free-trade [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement in 1983. The election of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] in 1984 marked a new period of independent foreign policy. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships were banned from New Zealand waters, effectively removing New Zealand from the ANZUS pact. Immigration laws were liberalised, leading to a massive increase in immigration from Asia. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] (1990\u20131999) liberalised trade by removing most tariffs and import restrictions.\n\nIn 2008, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Winston Peters]] announced what he called \"a seismic change for New Zealand\u2019s foreign service\", designed to remedy the country's \"struggling to maintain an adequate presence on the international stage\". Peters said that the Ministry would receive additional funding and increase the number of New Zealand diplomats serving abroad by 50%.<ref>\n[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0804/S00406.htm \"Seismic change for NZ\u2019s foreign service\"], Winston Peters, New Zealand government press release, 16 April 2008\n</ref> However this policy was reversed following the 2008 General Election which brought the [[John Key]]-led [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]] to power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==United Nations==\n{{Main|New Zealand and the United Nations}}\nNew Zealand was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Peter Fraser]] felt that in order for New Zealand to be secure in the South Pacific, it need to align itself with major world powers like the United States through some kind of organisation that could guarantee small powers a say in world affairs. Since the defeat of the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II it became clear that Britain was no longer able to protect New Zealand so the government decided that a policy of independent relations with a group of strong powers was the best way to defend New Zealand.\n\n==Participation in international organisations==\nNew Zealand participates in the United Nations (UN); the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[World Bank]]; the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); the [[International Energy Agency]]; the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]; the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]]; the [[Colombo Plan]]; [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC); and the [[International Whaling Commission]]. New Zealand also actively participates as a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Despite the 1985 rupture in the [[ANZUS]] military alliance, New Zealand has maintained good working relations with the [[New Zealand-United States relations|United States]] and Australia on a broad array of international issues.\n\nIn the past, New Zealand's geographic isolation and its agricultural economy's general prosperity minimised public interest in international affairs. However, growing global trade and other international economic events have made New Zealanders increasingly aware of their country\u2019s dependence on unstable overseas markets.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand's reliance on trade leaves us exposed to global instability |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/transforming-business/79172347/new-zealands-reliance-on-trade-leaves-us-exposed-to-global-instability |website=Stuff |language=en}}</ref> New Zealand governments strongly advocate [[free trade]], especially in agricultural products, and the country belongs to the Cairns group of nations in the WTO.\n\nNew Zealand's economic involvement with Asia has become increasingly important. New Zealand is a \u201cdialogue partner\u201d with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), a member of the [[East Asia Summit]] and an active participant in [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]].\n\nAs a charter member of the [[Colombo Plan]], New Zealand has provided Asian countries with technical assistance and capital. It also contributes through the [[Asian Development Bank]] and through UN programs and is a member of the UN Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Summary of international organisation participation===\n[[ABEDA]], [[ANZUS]] (U.S. suspended security obligations to NZ on 11 August 1986), [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ARF]] (dialogue partner), [[Asian Development Bank|AsDB]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] (dialogue partner), [[Australia Group]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Colombo Plan|CP]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|EBRD]], [[Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|ESCAP]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Confederation of Free Trade Unions|ICFTU]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[International Energy Agency|IEA]], [[International Fund for Agricultural Development|IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|IFRCS]], [[International Hydrographic Organization|IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]] (guest), [[Nuclear Suppliers Group|NSG]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons|OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Pacific Islands Forum|PIF]], [[Sparteca]], [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community|SPC]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|UNAMSIL]], [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]], [[UNMISET]], [[United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka|UNMOP]], [[United Nations Truce Supervision Organization|UNTSO]], [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Intellectual Property Organization|WIPO]], [[World Meteorological Organization|WMO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]<ref>\nSource: [[CIA World Factbook]], 2003 edition [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/ (external link)].\n</ref>\n\n==Overseas territories==\nNew Zealand administers [[Tokelau]] (formerly known as the Tokelau Islands) as a non self-governing colonial territory. In February 2006 a UN-sponsored referendum was held in Tokelau on whether to become a self-governing state, but this failed to achieve the two-thirds majority required to pass.\nSamoa was a New Zealand protectorate from 1918 to full independence in 1962. However New Zealand retains some responsibilities for former colonies [[Niue]] and the [[Cook Islands]] which are in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand. Citizens of all three countries hold [[New Zealand citizenship]] and the associated rights to healthcare and education in New Zealand.\n\nNew Zealand has also claimed part of Antarctica known as the [[Ross Dependency]] since 1923.\n\n==Trade==\nMcGraw argues that, \"Probably the greatest foreign policy achievement of [Helen] Clark's [1999\u20132008] term was the conclusion of a free trade agreement with China.\"<ref>David McCraw, \"The Clark Government's Foreign Policy Legacy,\" ''New Zealand International Review'' (2009) 34#6 [https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-213081330/the-clark-government-s-foreign-policy-legacy-david online]</ref> Clark's government also set up a free-trade deal with Australia and the ten nations of ASEAN (the Association of South East Asian Nations).\n\nNew Zealand has existing free trade agreements with Australia, Brunei, Chile, the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand; new free trade agreements are under negotiation with ASEAN, and Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mfat.govt.nz/foreign/tnd/ceps/cepindex.html|work=NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade|title=Free Trade Agreements Index |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930031728/http://www.mfat.govt.nz/foreign/tnd/ceps/cepindex.html|archivedate=30 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.news.gov.hk/isd/ebulletin/en/category/businessandfinance/100329/html/100329en03002.htm|title=HK, NZ sign economic partnership pact|work=news.gov.hk}}</ref> New Zealand is involved in the WTO's [[Doha round|Doha Development Agenda]] and was disappointed by the failure of [[Doha round#Geneva, 2006|the most recent talks]] in July 2006.\n\nNew Zealand is a signatory of the [[Trans-Pacific Partnership|Trans Pacific Partnership]].

The Strategy argues that there is considerable scope to expand New Zealand's investment and services trade in the region. Focusing on six countries (Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Peru), the Strategy posits that New Zealand should be seeking to: promote a better understanding of the region among New Zealand businesses to help identify prospects for increased investment, trade and joint ventures; lower barriers to business between New Zealand and Latin America; promote New Zealand tourism in the region; improve airlinks between New Zealand and the region; deepen education and research and science links. There are significant flows of tourists and students from Latin America to New Zealand.

Bilateral economic assistance resources have been focused on projects in the South Pacific island states, especially on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. The country\u2019s long association with Samoa (formerly known as Western Samoa), reflected in a treaty of friendship signed in 1962, and its close association with Tonga have resulted in a flow of immigrants and visitors under work permit schemes from both countries.

New Zealand has been a leader in the organisation.

New Zealand is a [[Major non-NATO ally]] of the United States and has been since 1997.

New Zealand abstained from the vote to send Kosovo's independence to the International Court of Justice, its judge at the ICJ voted in support of Kosovo, it has voted for Kosovo to join [[UNESCO]] and continues to support Kosovo's endervours to join international organisations.<ref>http://untribune.com/kosovo-falls-three-votes-short-in-unesco-bid/</ref> New Zealand is home to 3,500 Kosovo-born [[New Zealanders]], predominately Albanians but also a small number of Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats.

Relations however did not start well when M\u0101ori killed several of the Abel Tasman's crew after he sent out a shore party. Tasman mapped a section of the North Island and left and there was no further contact between the Netherlands and New Zealand for more than a hundred years. Once New Zealand was established as a state in 1840 relations have been good.\n\nThe relationship was enhanced significantly with migration of large numbers of Dutch people to New Zealand after World War II. As a result of negotiations between the Dutch and New Zealand Governments a migration agreement was signed in October 1950. This resulted in thousands of Dutch immigrants coming to New Zealand in subsequent years.

From the 1760s New Zealand was visited by various European explorers and traders, and later missionaries and settlers. An informal system of trade was established, especially in [[Northland Region|Northland]], and some [[iwi]] (tribes) became wealthy and powerful. As M\u0101ori was a tribal-level society of many shifting chiefdoms, relationships with Europeans were ad hoc and informal. In 1835 a group of Northland chiefs, under the guidance of British resident [[James Busby]], signed a [[Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand|declaration of independence]], which was recognised by Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.united-tribes.com/history.htm|work=United Tribes of New Zealand|title=History|accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence |title=Declaration of Independence \u2013 background to the Treaty |work=New Zealand History Online |publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=4 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811225106/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/politics/treaty/background-to-the-treaty/declaration-of-independence |archivedate=11 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n===British colony===\nMany M\u0101ori were still worried that a European power might invade and dispossess them, and some iwi were having difficulties controlling the large numbers of Europeans who visited and settled in their areas. English missionaries were also concerned about the levels of lawlessness, which were undermining their efforts to convert M\u0101ori to Christianity. The British [[Colonial Office]], influenced by the missionaries and by reports that the independent [[New Zealand Company]] was planning to privately colonise the islands, sent naval captain [[William Hobson]] to negotiate a treaty. The subsequent [[Treaty of Waitangi]], signed in 1840, made New Zealand part of the British Empire, established a [[Governor of New Zealand]], and gave M\u0101ori the rights of British subjects.\n\nThe annexation of New Zealand by Britain meant that Britain now controlled New Zealand's foreign policy. Subsidised large-scale immigration from Britain and Ireland began, and miners came for the gold rush around 1850-60. In the 1860s, the British sent 16,000 soldiers to contain the  [[New Zealand wars]] in the [[North Island]]. The colony shipped gold and, especially, wool to Britain. From the 1880s the development of [[refrigerated]] shipping allowed the establishment of an export economy based on the mass export of frozen meat and dairy products to Britain. In 1899-1902 New Zealand made its first contribution to an external war, sending troops to fight on the British side in the [[Second Boer War]]. The country changed its status from colony to [[dominion]] with internal self governance in 1907.\n\nNew Zealand eagerly sent a large fraction of its young men to fight on Britain's side in the First World War. Their heroism in the failed Gallipoli campaign made their sacrifices iconic in New Zealand memory, and secured the psychological independence of the nation.\n\nAfter the war New Zealand signed the Treaty of Versailles (1919) joined the [[League of Nations]] and pursued an independent foreign policy, while its defense was still controlled by Britain. Wellington trusted Conservative Party governments in London, but not Labour. When the British Labour Party took power in 1924 and 1929, the New Zealand government felt threatened by Labour's foreign policy because of its reliance upon the League of Nations. The League was distrusted and Wellington did not expect to see the coming of a peaceful world order under League auspices. What had been the Empire's most loyal dominion became a dissenter as it opposed efforts the first and second British Labour governments to trust the League's framework of arbitration and collective security agreements.<ref>Gerald Chaudron, \"The League of Nations and Imperial Dissent: New Zealand and the British Labour Governments, 1924-31,\" ''Journal of Imperial & Commonwealth History'' (March 2011) 39#1 pp 47-71</ref>\n\nThe governments of the Reform and United parties between 1912 and 1935 followed a \"realistic\" foreign policy. They made national security a high priority, were skeptical of international institutions such as the League, and showed no interest on the questions of self-determination, democracy, and human rights. However the opposition Labour Party was more idealistic and proposed a liberal internationalist outlook on international affairs. From 1935 the [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]] showed a limited degree of idealism in foreign policy, for example opposing the appeasement of Germany and Japan.<ref>D.J.

In 1947 New Zealand ratified the 1931 [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which made certain former colonies completely self-governing.\n\n=== Since 1945 ===\nThe [[Fall of Singapore]] during World War II made New Zealand realise that she could no longer rely on Britain to defend the British Empire. New Zealand troops supported the British in the successful battle against [[Malayan Emergency|Communist insurrection in Malaysia]] and maintained an air-force fighter squadron in Singapore, and later on Cyprus, again supporting British forces. New Zealand diplomats sought an alliance with the [[United States|United States of America]], and in 1951 adhered to the [[ANZUS]] Treaty between New Zealand, Australia and the US. In return for America's guarantee of protection, New Zealand felt obliged to support America in its wars, and New Zealand committed forces to the [[Korean War]] (1950-1953) under United nation auspices and to the [[Vietnam War]]. By the 1970s, many New Zealanders began to feel uncomfortable with their country's support for the US, particularly in Vietnam and regarding the visits of nuclear-powered and armed American warships. The [[Third Labour Government of New Zealand|Third Labour government]] (1972\u20131975) pulled New Zealand troops out of the Vietnam War and protested against [[French nuclear testing]] in the Pacific, at one stage sending a warship to act as disapproving witness to the tests.\n\nBritain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973 forced New Zealand into a more independent role.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1468-0289.00057|title = Britain, Butter, and European Integration, 1957\u20131964|journal = The Economic History Review|volume = 50|issue = 2|pages = 327\u2013347|year = 1997|last1 = Singleton|first1 = John|last2 = Robertson|first2 = Paul L.}}</ref> The British move restricted New Zealand's trade access to its biggest market, and it sought new trading partners in Asia, America and the Middle East. Australia and New Zealand signed the free-trade [[Closer Economic Relations]] agreement in 1983. The election of the [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] in 1984 marked a new period of independent foreign policy. Nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed ships were banned from New Zealand waters, effectively removing New Zealand from the ANZUS pact. Immigration laws were liberalised, leading to a massive increase in immigration from Asia. The [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] (1990\u20131999) liberalised trade by removing most tariffs and import restrictions.\n\nIn 2008, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Winston Peters]] announced what he called \"a seismic change for New Zealand\u2019s foreign service\", designed to remedy the country's \"struggling to maintain an adequate presence on the international stage\". Peters said that the Ministry would receive additional funding and increase the number of New Zealand diplomats serving abroad by 50%.<ref>\n[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0804/S00406.htm \"Seismic change for NZ\u2019s foreign service\"], Winston Peters, New Zealand government press release, 16 April 2008\n</ref> However this policy was reversed following the 2008 General Election which brought the [[John Key]]-led [[Fifth National Government of New Zealand]] to power.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==United Nations==\n{{Main|New Zealand and the United Nations}}\nNew Zealand was a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. [[New Zealand Prime Minister]] [[Peter Fraser]] felt that in order for New Zealand to be secure in the South Pacific, it need to align itself with major world powers like the United States through some kind of organisation that could guarantee small powers a say in world affairs. Since the defeat of the [[Royal Navy]] during World War II it became clear that Britain was no longer able to protect New Zealand so the government decided that a policy of independent relations with a group of strong powers was the best way to defend New Zealand.\n\n==Participation in international organisations==\nNew Zealand participates in the United Nations (UN); the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO); [[World Bank]]; the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF); the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD); the [[International Energy Agency]]; the [[Asian Development Bank]]; the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]; the [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]]; the [[Colombo Plan]]; [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC); and the [[International Whaling Commission]]. New Zealand also actively participates as a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. Despite the 1985 rupture in the [[ANZUS]] military alliance, New Zealand has maintained good working relations with the [[New Zealand-United States relations|United States]] and Australia on a broad array of international issues.\n\nIn the past, New Zealand's geographic isolation and its agricultural economy's general prosperity minimised public interest in international affairs. However, growing global trade and other international economic events have made New Zealanders increasingly aware of their country\u2019s dependence on unstable overseas markets.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand's reliance on trade leaves us exposed to global instability |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/transforming-business/79172347/new-zealands-reliance-on-trade-leaves-us-exposed-to-global-instability |website=Stuff |language=en}}</ref> New Zealand governments strongly advocate [[free trade]], especially in agricultural products, and the country belongs to the Cairns group of nations in the WTO.\n\nNew Zealand's economic involvement with Asia has become increasingly important. New Zealand is a \u201cdialogue partner\u201d with the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), a member of the [[East Asia Summit]] and an active participant in [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]].\n\nAs a charter member of the [[Colombo Plan]], New Zealand has provided Asian countries with technical assistance and capital.

Bilateral economic assistance resources have been focused on projects in the South Pacific island states, especially on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. The country\u2019s long association with Samoa (formerly known as Western Samoa), reflected in a treaty of friendship signed in 1962, and its close association with Tonga have resulted in a flow of immigrants and visitors under work permit schemes from both countries.

New Zealand has been a leader in the organisation. In 1971, New Zealand joined the other independent and self-governing states of the South Pacific to establish the South Pacific Forum (now known as the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]), which meets annually at the \u201cheads of government\u201d level.\n\n===2006 East Timor crisis===\n{{Main|2006 East Timorese crisis}}\nOn 26 May, New Zealand deployed forty-two troops, with a second contingent of 120 troops leaving [[Christchurch]] on 27 May, en route to [[Townsville]], Queensland before being sent to East Timor.

In July 2003 he had an [[Off the record (journalism)|off-the-record]] conversation with [[Andrew Gilligan]], a [[BBC]] journalist; during their discussion they talked about the [[September Dossier|2002 dossier]] on Iraqi [[weapons of mass destruction]], which stated that some of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons were deployable within 45 minutes. When Gilligan reported this on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme, he stated that the 45 minute claim was included at the insistence of [[Alastair Campbell]], the [[Downing Street Director of Communications]]\u2014something Kelly denied. The government complained to the BBC about the claim, but they refused to recant on the claim; political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed. Kelly informed his line managers in the MoD that he may have been the source, but did not think he was the only one, as Gilligan had reported points he had not mentioned. Kelly's name became known to the media, and he was called to appear on 15 July before the parliamentary [[Intelligence and Security Committee|Intelligence and Security]] and [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee|Foreign Affairs Select]] committees. Two days later Kelly was found dead near his home.\n\nA former head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at [[Porton Down]], Kelly was part of a joint US-UK team that inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia in the early 1990s and concluded that were running a covert and illegal BW programme. He was appointed to the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq and led ten of the organisation's missions between May 1991 and December 1998. He also worked with UNSCOM's successor, the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and led several of their missions into Iraq. During his time with UNMOVIC he was key in uncovering the [[anthrax]] production programme at the [[Salman Pak facility]], and a BW programme run at [[Al Hakum (Iraq)|Al Hakum]].\n\nFollowing Kelly's suicide in 2003 [[Tony Blair]], the [[British Prime Minister]], set up [[Hutton Inquiry|a government inquiry]] under [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]], a former [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide by \"cutting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by his taking Coproxamol tablets\".{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=3}} Hutton also stated that no other parties were involved in Kelly's death.\n\nThere was [[Hutton Inquiry#Criticism|continued debate]] over the manner of Kelly's death, and the case was reviewed between 2010 and 2011 by [[Dominic Grieve]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]; he concluded that there was \"overwhelmingly strong\" evidence that Kelly committed suicide.{{sfn|Watt|2011|p=15}} The [[post-mortem]] and [[toxicology]] reports were released in 2010; both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The manner of Kelly's death has been the subject of several documentaries and has been fictionalised on television, on stage and in print. He was appointed as [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in 1994 and might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003, according to Hutton. His work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life, education and first jobs: 1944\u20131984===\n[[File:Linacre Main Enterence.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Linacre College, Oxford]], where Kelly studied for his doctorate in [[microbiology]]]]\nDavid Christopher Kelly was born in [[Llwynypia]], [[Glamorgan]], [[South Wales]], on 14 May 1944.

The following year he was seconded back to the MoD as part of the Proliferation and Arms Control Secretariat; as part of the role he was an advisor to the Non-Proliferation Department, which was part of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. It was through the FCO that Kelly undertook his role on the UN inspection teams. He also acted as an advisor to the DIS and the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6). In 2001, with a further re-organisation of the UK's defence establishment, Kelly's personnel management was moved to the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]], who was his formal employer until 2003, although he was still on secondment to the MoD.{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=4}}}} The department had only a small number of microbiologists when he arrived, and most of their work involved the decontamination of [[Gruinard Island]], which had been used for experiments during the Second World War with weaponised [[anthrax]]. He increased the scope of his department, obtaining additional funding to undertake research into [[biodefence]].

Kelly asked the assistant about the work he was doing, and was surprised when the man said he was involved in testing [[smallpox]]. Kelly questioned [[Lev Sandakchiev]], the head of Vector, about the use of smallpox, but received no answers. Kelly described the questioning sessions as \"a very tense moment\".{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=169}}{{sfn|''Germ Warfare'', 13 February 2004|loc=Event occurs at 41:00\u201342:07}}\n\nIn a 2002 review of the verification process, Kelly wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The visits did not go without incident. At Obolensk, access to parts of the main research facility\u2014notably the dynamic aerosol test chambers and the plague research laboratories\u2014was denied on the spurious grounds of quarantine requirements. Skirmishes occurred over access to an explosive aerosol chamber because the officials knew that closer examination would reveal damning evidence of offensive BW activities. At Koltsova access was again difficult and problematic. The most serious incident was when senior officials contradicted an admission by technical staff that research on smallpox was being conducted there. The officials were unable to properly account for the presence of smallpox and for the research being undertaken in a dynamic aerosol test chamber on orthopoxvirus, which was capable of explosive dispersal. At the Institute of Ultrapure Preparations in Leningrad (Pasechnik's former workplace), dynamic and explosive test chambers were passed off as being for agricultural projects, contained milling machines were described as being for the grinding of salt, and studies on plague, especially production of the agent, were misrepresented. Candid and credible accounts of many of the activities at these facilities were not provided.{{sfn|Kelly|2002|p=95}}</blockquote>\n\nThe official reports of the visit concluded that Soviets were running a covert and illegal BW programme.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=170}} Kelly also took part in reciprocal visits to the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]] at [[Fort Detrick]], [[Maryland]], and visits to Porton Down by Russian and American inspectors.{{sfn|Lewis|2013|p=171}} Despite their findings, Kelly concluded that the tripartite inspection programme had failed. It was, he said, \"too ambitious; its disarmament objective deflected by issues of reciprocity and access to sites outside the territories of the three parties\".{{sfn|Kelly|2002|p=106}} He went on to add that \"Russia's refusal to provide a complete account of its past and current BW activity and the inability of the American\u2013British teams to gain access to Soviet/Russian military industrial facilities were significant contributory factors\".{{sfn|Kelly|2002|p=106}}\n\n====Iraq: 1991 \u2013 May 2003====\n{{see also|Iraq disarmament crisis#2002\u20132003|Rationale for the Iraq War}}\n====Appointment to UNSCOM====\nFollowing the end of the [[Gulf War]] (August 1990&nbsp;\u2013 February 1991), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 687]] imposed the articles of Iraq's surrender.

Had this not occurred he may well not have died at this time. Furthermore, on the balance of probabilities, it is likely that the ingestion of an excess number of co-proxamol tablets coupled with apparently clinically silent coronary artery disease would both have played a part in bringing about death more certainly and more rapidly than would have otherwise been the case.

In July 2003 he had an [[Off the record (journalism)|off the record]] conversation with [[Andrew Gilligan]], a [[BBC]] journalist; during their discussion they talked about the [[September Dossier|2002 dossier]] on Iraqi [[weapons of mass destruction]], which stated that some of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons were deployable within 45 minutes. When Gilligan reported this on [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme, he stated that the 45 minute claim was included at the insistence of [[Alastair Campbell]], the [[Downing Street Director of Communications]]\u2014something Kelly denied. The government complained to the BBC about the claim, but they refused to recant on the claim; political tumult between Downing Street and the BBC developed. Kelly informed his line managers in the MoD that he may have been the source, but did not think he was the only one, as Gilligan had reported points he had not mentioned. Kelly's name became known to the media, and he was called to appear on 15 July before the parliamentary [[Intelligence and Security Committee|Intelligence and Security]] and [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee|Foreign Affairs Select]] committees. Two days later Kelly was found dead near his home.\n\nA former head of the Defence Microbiology Division working at [[Porton Down]], Kelly was part of a joint US-UK team that inspected civilian biotechnology facilities in Russia in the early 1990s and concluded that were running a covert and illegal BW programme. He was appointed to the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) in 1991 as one of its chief weapons inspectors in Iraq and led ten of the organisation's missions between May 1991 and December 1998. He also worked with UNSCOM's successor, the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] (UNMOVIC) and led several of their missions into Iraq. During his time with UNMOVIC he was key in uncovering the [[anthrax]] production programme at the [[Salman Pak facility]], and a BW programme run at [[Al Hakum (Iraq)|Al Hakum]].\n\nFollowing Kelly's suicide in 2003 [[Tony Blair]], the [[British Prime Minister]], set up [[Hutton Inquiry|a government inquiry]] under [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Lord Hutton]], a former [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]. The inquiry concluded that Kelly had committed suicide by \"cutting his left wrist and that his death was hastened by his taking Coproxamol tablets\".{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=3}} Hutton also stated that no other parties were involved in Kelly's death.\n\nThere was [[Hutton Inquiry#Criticism|continued debate]] over the manner of Kelly's death, and the case was reviewed between 2010 and 2011 by [[Dominic Grieve]], the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]]; he concluded that there was \"overwhelmingly strong\" evidence that Kelly committed suicide.{{sfn|Watt|2011|p=15}} The [[post-mortem]] and [[toxicology]] reports were released in 2010; both documents supported the conclusion of the Hutton Inquiry. The manner of Kelly's death has been the subject of several documentaries and has been fictionalised on television, on stage and in print. He was appointed as [[Order of St Michael and St George|Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George]] (CMG) in 1994 and might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003, according to Hutton. His work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life, education and first jobs: 1944\u20131984===\n[[File:Linacre Main Enterence.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Linacre College, Oxford]], where Kelly studied for his doctorate in [[microbiology]]]]\nDavid Christopher Kelly was born in [[Llwynypia]], [[Glamorgan]], [[South Wales]], on 14 May 1944.

The following year he was seconded back to the MoD as part of the Proliferation and Arms Control Secretariat; as part of the role he was an advisor to the Non-Proliferation Department, which was part of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. It was through the FCO that Kelly undertook his role on the UN inspection teams. He also acted as an advisor to the DIS and the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6). In 2001, with a further re-organisation of the UK's defence establishment, Kelly's personnel management was moved to the [[Defence Science and Technology Laboratory]], who was his formal employer until 2003, although he was still on secondment to the MoD.{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=4}}}} The department had only a small number of microbiologists when he arrived, and most of their work involved the decontamination of [[Gruinard Island]], which had been used for experiments during the Second World War with weaponised [[anthrax]].

At Koltsova access was again difficult and problematic. The most serious incident was when senior officials contradicted an admission by technical staff that research on smallpox was being conducted there. The officials were unable to properly account for the presence of smallpox and for the research being undertaken in a dynamic aerosol test chamber on orthopoxvirus, which was capable of explosive dispersal. At the Institute of Ultrapure Preparations in Leningrad (Pasechnik's former workplace), dynamic and explosive test chambers were passed off as being for agricultural projects, contained milling machines were described as being for the grinding of salt, and studies on plague, especially production of the agent, were misrepresented.

''The London Gazette''}} the citation reads:\n\n<blockquote>He devised the scientific basis for the enhanced biological warfare defence programme and led strong research groups in many key areas. Following the Gulf War he led the first biological warfare inspection in Iraq and has spent most of his time since either in Iraq or at various sites in the former Soviet Union helping to shed light on past biological warfare related activities and assisting the UK/US RUS trilateral confidence building process. He has pursued this work tirelessly and with good humour despite the significant hardship, hostility and personal risk encountered during extended periods of service in both countries.&nbsp;... His efforts in his specialist field have had consequences of international significance.{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=5}}</blockquote>\n\nLord Hutton, in the report to his inquiry, suggests that Kelly might well have been under consideration for a knighthood in May 2003.{{sfn|Hutton|2004|p=5}} Kelly's work in Iraq earned him a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]];{{sfn|Mangold|2008}}{{sfn|\"Dr David Kelly: Controversial death examined\".

Even among the elite group of international weapons inspectors, he was regarded with some awe, as the inspectors' inspector.{{sfn|Baker|2007|p=358}}</blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Hussein Kamel

Power comes from a 2.0 litre Koenigsegg Tiny Friendly Giant (TFG) three-cylinder twin-turbocharged camless piston engine driving the front wheels, rated at {{convert|600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque, as well as three electric motors (two at the rear and one at the front), with a combined peak output of {{convert|1700|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2580|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque.

Then he accepts an under-the-table commission on the outpost world of [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Nevarro|Nevarro]] from an enigmatic [[The Client (Star Wars)|client]] with apparent Imperial connections, directing him to track down and capture an unnamed fifty-year-old target. While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]]. When IG-11 attempts to kill the infant per its bounty orders, the Mandalorian shoots and destroys the droid, taking the Child alive.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = [[Chapter 2: The Child]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Rick Famuyiwa]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|15}}\n |ShortSummary    = While returning to his ship with the Child, the Mandalorian fights and kills a group of rival bounty hunters who ambush him. Nearing his ship, he finds it being stripped by [[Jawa (Star Wars)|Jawas]] for parts, and violently confronts them. When he tries to attack their [[sandcrawler]], the Jawas stun him and drop him from its roof. The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides. With the trade complete, the Mandalorian and Kuiil work together to repair the ship, allowing the Mandalorian to leave the planet with the Child.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = [[Chapter 3: The Sin]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Deborah Chow]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|22}}\n |ShortSummary    = The Mandalorian delivers the Child to the Client on Nevarro and collects the bounty of 20 bars of Beskar steel. Uncharacteristically, the Mandalorian asks about the Client's plans for the Child, but is told that it's none of his concern. He leaves before conflict arises. Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out. Outnumbered and cornered, the Mandalorian is able to escape only when other Mandalorians arrive from the enclave, attacking the bounty hunters and allowing him to reach his ship with the Child.\n |LineColor       = C4A574\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = [[Chapter 4: Sanctuary]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Bryce Dallas Howard]]\n |WrittenBy       = Jon Favreau\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|29}}\n |ShortSummary    = Arriving on the sparsely populated forest planet [[List of Star Wars planets and moons#Sorgan|Sorgan]], the Mandalorian encounters ex-Rebel shock trooper-turned-mercenary [[Cara Dune]]. Following a short brawl, Dune explains that she is hiding after taking \"early retirement\", and asks the Mandalorian to leave. While he prepares his ship, two desperate fishermen approach, offering to hire him to drive off a band of [[List of Star Wars species|Klatoonian]] raiders. He accepts the job in exchange for lodging, using their credits to enlist Dune's help. At the village, they are housed by [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Omera|Omera]], a widowed mother. The Mandalorian confides in her that no one has seen him without his helmet since childhood, when his tribe took him in as an orphan. Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee. With peace restored, the Mandalorian plans to leave the Child in the village, but a Guild bounty hunter tracks it down and is killed by Dune.

He seeks work in a cantina to pay for the repairs, meeting aspiring bounty hunter [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Toro Calican|Toro Calican]], who is tracking elite mercenary and assassin [[Fennec Shand]]. Calican needs to catch Shand to join the Guild, and the Mandalorian agrees to help when Calican offers to let him keep the money. They capture Shand in the desert, but she destroys one of their speeder bikes, so the Mandalorian goes to get a [[List of Star Wars species|dewback]] they passed for transportation. While Calican watches Shand, she tells him that the Mandalorian betrayed the guild, making the bounty on him and the Child worth more than hers. Shand offers to help Calican capture the Mandalorian if he sets her free, but he shoots her instead and rides the remaining speeder bike to the repair dock, taking Motto and the Child hostage. The Mandalorian arrives, uses a [[flare]] to disorient Calican, and kills him. He takes Calican's money to pay Motto for the repairs, thanking her before leaving Tatooine.

After infiltrating the prison ship, they fight through security droids and make it to the control room where the ship's security chief triggers a security beacon before being killed by Xi'an. The crew rescues Qin but double-crosses the Mandalorian. He escapes and defeats each crew member, then captures Qin. Q9-0 finds the Child after deciphering the archived transmission from Greef Karga, but is shot by the Mandalorian before he can harm him. The Mandalorian delivers Qin to Ran and departs with his payment. Ran immediately moves to launch a fighter to kill the Mandalorian, but discovers the New Republic beacon had been placed on Qin, leading a trio of [[X-wing fighter|X-wings]] to Ran's station where they attack.

Karga proposes that the Mandalorian use the Child as bait in order to kill the Client and free the town. In return, Karga will square things with the Guild, which would allow the Mandalorian and the Child to live in peace. Sensing a trap, the Mandalorian recruits Cara Dune and Kuiil to assist him, and Kuiil brings a rebuilt and reprogrammed IG-11 to protect the Child. They meet Karga and his associates, but are attacked by [[Mynock]]s. Karga is injured, but the Child uses the Force to heal his wound. In return, Karga kills his associates and confesses his original plan to shoot the Mandalorian and take the Child to the Client. Karga pretends that Dune has captured the Mandalorian, while Kuiil returns the Child to the ship. During the meeting, [[Moff Gideon]]'s troops open fire on the building and kill the Client and his bodyguards, trapping the Mandalorian, Karga, and Dune inside. Gideon arrives, demanding the Child.

Gideon warns Karga, Dune, and the Mandalorian that they face certain death unless they agree to assist him. IG-11 arrives and breaks the standoff but Gideon injures the Mandalorian. The Child uses the Force to deflect an attacking stormtrooper's flamethrower back on him. The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy.

name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he first leave the Child with the Client.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He does so again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan, who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first-season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a [[tabula rasa]] effect and his anonymity allows viewers to see and imagine themselves as parents.<ref name=\"Britt1129\" /><ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> Britt said this \"allow(s) us to dream about what arsenal we might deploy to protect our children\".<ref

Anthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no

as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that's left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger.

While the Client is indifferent to the target's well-being, his colleague [[List of The Mandalorian characters#Dr. Pershing|Dr. Pershing]] insists the target be brought back alive. The Mandalorian is given a down payment of a single bar of [[Beskar steel]], sacred to his people. He takes it to a covert Mandalorian enclave where an [[The Armorer (Star Wars)|armorer]] uses it to make him a [[pauldron]]. Arriving at the planet of the target's last reported location, the Mandalorian is aided by a vapor farmer named [[Kuiil]]. Tired of the chaos that bounty hunters bring to the area, Kuiil leads him to the target's location and departs. Entering the remote and heavily defended encampment, the Mandalorian reluctantly teams up with bounty hunting droid [[IG-11]] to clear the camp and find the quarry: a [[The Child (Star Wars)|child]] of [[Yoda's species]].

The following day, Kuiil helps him locate the Jawas and negotiate for the return of his ship's components. The Mandalorian agrees to retrieve the egg of a rhinoceros-like Mudhorn in exchange for the stolen parts. He enters the Mudhorn's cave only to be hurled out by the angry beast inside, which attacks him repeatedly, damaging his armor. As the Mudhorn rushes in for the kill, the Child uses [[the Force]] to levitate the beast, allowing the surprised Mandalorian to stab and kill it. He collects the egg and takes it to the Jawas, who crack it open and eat its yellow insides.

Returning to the Mandalorian enclave, the Mandalorian has his damaged armor replaced and weapons upgraded by the Armorer, who forges a full [[cuirass]] from most of the Beskar steel, while the remainder goes to support Mandalorian foundling children. The Mandalorian accepts a new job from Greef Karga and prepares his ship to depart. Feeling guilty for abandoning the Child to the Empire, he turns back to attack the Client's base, killing most of the stormtroopers guarding it. He rescues the Child from Dr. Pershing's laboratory where it was being experimented on, but chooses not to kill the doctor. On the way back to his ship, the Mandalorian is ambushed by other bounty hunters and Greef Karga, who demand that he hand over the Child. He refuses, and a firefight breaks out.

Despite discovering that the raiders have an old Imperial [[AT-ST]], the villagers refuse to leave, so the Mandalorian and Dune train them to defend themselves. They provoke the raiders at night, with Dune luring the AT-ST into a trap for the Mandalorian to blow up and forcing the remaining raiders to flee.

The Mandalorian sends the others through a sewer grate with the Child to find help from the Mandalorian enclave, while IG-11 removes his helmet to tend to a head injury. Joining the others, the Mandalorian finds the covert group of Mandalorians dead or escaped, except for the Armorer. She tasks him to care for the foundling Child like his own, discover its origins, and return it to its kind. The Armorer fashions the Mandalorian his own signet and gives him a jetpack. The group is ferried down an underground lava river, but when they are ambushed by stormtroopers, IG-11 self-destructs to eliminate the enemy. Gideon attacks in a [[TIE fighter]] and the Mandalorian uses the jetpack to bring the craft down, but the Moff survives and cuts himself out of the ship with the [[Darksaber (fictional weapon)|Darksaber]].<!-- The inclusion of the Darksaber in this plot summary, and the accompanying efn citation, were the result of a a consensus and compromise reached after an extensive talk page discussion.

parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref

be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nSeveral writers suggested the fact that the Mandalorian's face is concealed has a [[tabula rasa]] effect and his anonymity allows viewers to

Unlike most Minecraft servers, the world map has never been reset, making it the oldest running map in the game.\n\n==Rules==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n===Rules===\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n===Grief===\nGrief on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n===Cheating===\n'''Cheating''' on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n===Spam===\nSpam, including flooding, on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of speech===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]].\n\n==Hardware==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moderation==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks. Usually, moderators are banning players online, and admins clearing what moderators missed by checking logs. \n\nEvery time the player breaks or places a block, the online staff gets a message in chat. Moderators or admins then teleport to the place player broke or placed a block at, asking player a few questions if needed. \n\nStaff also gets an alert every time a player is caught cheating.\n\nPlayers usually get a warning for the first time they break a rule, repeating the action can get the player banned. All bans are permanent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Moderator|title=Category:Moderators - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe next day the server was opened to the public, the first few players were promoted to moderators. MinecraftOnline started logging every block the player places or breaks to make sure griefers get banned even if the staff is offline.\n\nIn the first month 1000 unique players joined the server, the number of banned players reached 100. By January 2011 10,000 players logged in on the server at least once.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Timeline|title=Timeline - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\nOn May 15th, 2011 the user by the name of Bill shields made a post on [[7chan]] claiming they were banned on the server for grief. Players started joining and griefing everything around them. The total ban counter reached 4000 players in a few days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/May_Unrest|title=May Unrest - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1st, 2016 YouTuber TheCampingRusher uploaded a video covering another Minecraft server called [[2b2t]], the anarchy server with no rules. In his video, he stated that 2b2t is the oldest Minecraft server. People started to search it up and found MinecraftOnline instead. Many people started to grief thinking they were on 2b2t. The ban counter reached 18,000 players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rusherpocalypse|title=Rusherpocalypse - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQbnPn5BM-E|title=OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT!!}}</ref>\n\nOn November 20th, 2017 Slovakian YouTuber StudioMoonTV uploaded a video of them breaking torches and getting themselves banned on this server. Since then players from Czechia or Slovakia join the server and start breaking torches on a highway from spawn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IlJsazPu0I|title=Dostal som ban na najstar\u0161om minecraftovom serveri v dejin\u00e1ch}}</ref>\n\nOn August 9th, 2018 the server was blacklisted by [[Mojang]] for violating their [[End-user license agreement]]. The donation system the server had, had to be changed to only give players cosmetics. The server was removed from Mojang's blacklist on the 20th of August. \n\nOn April 4th, 2020 YouTuber FitMC uploaded a video dedicated to this server.

Unlike most Minecraft servers, the world map has never been reset, making it the oldest running map in the game.\n\n==Rules==\nUnlike most other Minecraft servers, MinecraftOnline does not have block protection outside of the spawn region. Because of this, very strict rules are needed to protect the creations of other players and make the survival experience enjoyable. Moderators and administrators are both tasked with making sure these rules are not broken.\n\n===Rules===\n# Do not grief.\n# Do not cheat.\n# Do not spam.\n\n===Grief===\nGrief on MinecraftOnline is an act of damaging or changing the builds of other players without given permission. Breaking a single block placed by another player can get the griefer banned.\n\n===Cheating===\n'''Cheating''' on MinecraftOnline means using [[Minecraft mods|client-side modifications]] or abusing glitches or exploits in order to gain an unfair advantage over other players.\n\n===Spam===\nSpam, including flooding, on MinecraftOnline means sending repeated or nonsensical messages in chat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rules|title=Category:Rules - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n===Freedom of speech===\nMinecraftOnline has complete [[freedom of speech]] and absolutely no [[censorship]].\n\n==Hardware==\nThe server runs on Debian Linux 7, 8x Xeon CPUs, 32GB of RAM, 8x i7-2600 3.4GHz. The server is located in [[Germany]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Hardware|title=Hardware - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Moderation==\nIn order to protect the server, staff bans people for breaking the rules. Every block players break or place is logged. Staffs are moderators and admins. Moderators can ban and warn players, teleport to them to make sure the player is not breaking the rules. Admins have the ability to do anything in order to fix the grief. Admins can also check the logs of broken or placed blocks. Usually, moderators are banning players online, and admins clearing what moderators missed by checking logs. \n\nEvery time the player breaks or places a block, the online staff gets a message in chat. Moderators or admins then teleport to the place player broke or placed a block at, asking player a few questions if needed. \n\nStaff also gets an alert every time a player is caught cheating.\n\nPlayers usually get a warning for the first time they break a rule, repeating the action can get the player banned. All bans are permanent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Moderator|title=Category:Moderators - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe next day the server was opened to the public, the first few players were promoted to moderators. MinecraftOnline started logging every block the player places or breaks to make sure griefers get banned even if the staff is offline.\n\nIn the first month 1000 unique players joined the server, the number of banned players reached 100. By January 2011 10,000 players logged in on the server at least once.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Timeline|title=Timeline - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\nOn May 15th, 2011 the user by the name of Bill shields made a post on [[7chan]] claiming they were banned on the server for grief. Players started joining and griefing everything around them. The total ban counter reached 4000 players in a few days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/May_Unrest|title=May Unrest - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1st, 2016 YouTuber TheCampingRusher uploaded a video covering another Minecraft server called [[2b2t]], the anarchy server with no rules. In his video, he stated that 2b2t is the oldest Minecraft server. People started to search it up and found MinecraftOnline instead. Many people started to grief thinking they were on 2b2t. The ban counter reached 18,000 players.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://minecraftonline.com/wiki/Rusherpocalypse|title=Rusherpocalypse - MinecraftOnline|website=minecraftonline.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQbnPn5BM-E|title=OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT!!}}</ref>\n\nOn November 20th, 2017 Slovakian YouTuber StudioMoonTV uploaded a video of them breaking torches and getting themselves banned on this server. Since then players from Czechia or Slovakia join the server and start breaking torches on a highway from spawn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IlJsazPu0I|title=Dostal som ban na najstar\u0161om minecraftovom serveri v dejin\u00e1ch}}</ref>\n\nOn August 9th, 2018 the server was blacklisted by [[Mojang]] for violating their [[End-user license agreement]]. The donation system the server had, had to be changed to only give players cosmetics. The server was removed from Mojang's blacklist on the 20th of August. \n\nOn April 4th, 2020 YouTuber FitMC uploaded a video dedicated to this server. A peak of 120 players online was reached for the very first time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BjZIzagevE|title=Minecraft's Oldest Server Was Griefed (MinecraftOnline)}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\nWhile most of the players are impressed by long-standing player-made structures, with more than 35,000 bans and 200,000 unique players joined, very strict no griefing rules, and how easy it is to damage something made by another player, a lot of people are not thrilled with the current server's policy.
