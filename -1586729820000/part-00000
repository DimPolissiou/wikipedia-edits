James left the club at the end of his contract.\n\nJames returned to the helm of the club as their head coach a day after the sacking of [[Rene Meulensteen]] on 3 January 2018, following a string of poor performances.<ref name=\"auto\"/> He set about rebuilding the side in the January transfer window, releasing [[Mark Sifneos]] and signing [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] international midfielder [[Gu\u00f0j\u00f3n Baldvinsson]] on loan from [[Stjarnan]], along with appointing former [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] teammate [[Hermann Hrei\u00f0arsson]] as his assistant. Despite overseeing a turnaround in form, he could only guide the Blasters to 6th place at the end the [[2017\u201318 Indian Super League]] season, missing out on the play-offs.\n\nThe club started the [[2018\u201319 Indian Super League]] season with a victory, beating [[ATK (football club)|ATK]] 2\u20130 at [[Salt Lake Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite

The Chinese force consisted of a garrison of Manchu and Mongol [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]].<ref>Elliott, Mark (June 1990). \"[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/elliott/files/elliott_bannerman_and_townsman.pdf Bannerman and Townsman: Ethnic Tension in Nineteenth-Century Jiangnan]\".

Fought near the confluence of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and [[Yangtze River]], the battle effectively blocked operation of the [[Caoyun system]], a transport network vital for the movement of grain throughout the empire. As a result, the [[Daoguang Emperor]] decided to sue for peace and agreed to sign the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which brought hostilities to an end. Mass suicide was committed by the Manchu Bannermen who were defending the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Makeham|title=China: The World's Oldest Living Civilization Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ4NAQAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Bannermen+desperately|year=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-25142-3|page=331}}</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\nIn mid July, the British ships concentrated on Chinkiang and blocked the route between the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal. On the morning of July 21, the British attacked Chinkiang City in three directions with four brigades. With the support of artillery brigade, 2,310 soldiers of the first brigade attacked the Qing army guarding the outside of Chinkiang City; 1,832 soldiers of the second brigade attacked the west gate with the support of navy; 2,155 soldiers of the third brigade attacked the north gate. At this time, there were 1,583 Bannermen in Chinkiang and 2,700 [[Green Standard Army]] in the southwest suburb. The Green Standard Army were transferred from other provinces after the fort outside the city was attacked and the situation in Chinkiang was tense. The Green Standard Army, who were temporarily concentrated, were not familiar with the terrain of Chinkiang. Their weapons are all swords and spears, except for a small number of muskets.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the British third brigade landed in Beigu mountain, and then attacked the north gate, which was covered by the British ship's heavy artillery. The Bannermen guarding the north gate immediately shot with muskets, hitting and injuring two British captains. The Bannermen dismantled some battlements and temporarily set up artillery to counterattack the British army. More than an hour after the fierce battle, the artillery of the Bannermen was destroyed, and the British troops rushed to the battery from the side. The garrison fought with the British on the wall of the city.\n\nBefore dawn, the first brigade successfully landed and occupied the highlands near Jinshan. At 8 a.m., the British began their attack on the Green Standard Army stationed outside the city. These Green Standard Army came to reinforce the city from afar. Because of their tired journey and lack of food, they were defeated by the British army after fierce battle. Many Green Standard Army soldiers became deserters. The commander of Green Standard Army saw the fire in Chinkiang City and thought that the city had been lost, so he ordered the remaining soldiers to retreat.\n\nThe west gate is the main battlefield for the British to attack the city. Shortly after the battle between the north gate and the southwest suburb, the second brigade began to attack the west gate. The British soldiers of the two regiments occupied some houses outside the city to shoot at the garrison under the cover; meanwhile, the transport ship carrying the British marines drove along the canal to the west gate, where they planned to attack the city. The west gate garrison fired at the British Army on land and the Marine Corps in the canal, injuring 16 sailors, 8 gunners and an officer and forcing the British army to withdraw from the canal within 10 minutes. After that, the British army sent another 200 Marines to cooperate with the land force to attack Chinkiang city again, this time they successfully occupied part of the city buildings. The defenders fought fiercely with the British Army on the city buildings. At noon, the British army sent a team of engineers to blow up the west gate with gunpowder. At the same time, the third brigade of the British Army occupying the north gate rushed to the west gate to fight, and finally the Qing's defense was broken. However, the garrison and the British army had a fierce street battle in the city. At least 40 British officers and soldiers were injured or killed in the street war. After the British army completely seized the city, Hai Ling, the supreme commander of the Qing army, and his family committed suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.meipian.cn/1jz2rezz|title=\u9e26\u7247\u6218\u4e89\u4e4b\u9547\u6c5f\u6218\u5f79 - \u7f8e\u7bc7|website=www.meipian.cn|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Capture of Chinkeangfoo.jpg|Map of the battle\nFile:Tartars at Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Rallying of the Tartar troops\nFile:British troops capture Chin-Keang-Foo.jpg|Engagement in Chinkiang\nFile:Escalade of Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Escalade in Chinkiang\nFile:Gates of Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Blowing open the gates of the city\nFile:Battle of Chinkiang Memorial at the St. George's Cathedral, Madras.jpg|Battle memorial at [[St. George's Cathedral, Chennai|St. George's Cathedral, Madras]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttU1AAAAMAAJ Bulletins of State Intelligence]''.

The Chinese force consisted of a garrison of Manchu and Mongol [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]].<ref>Elliott, Mark (June 1990). \"[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/elliott/files/elliott_bannerman_and_townsman.pdf Bannerman and Townsman: Ethnic Tension in Nineteenth-Century Jiangnan]\".

Fought near the confluence of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] and [[Yangtze River]], the battle effectively blocked operation of the [[Caoyun system]], a transport network vital for the movement of grain throughout the empire. As a result, the [[Daoguang Emperor]] decided to sue for peace and agreed to sign the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which brought hostilities to an end. Mass suicide was committed by the Manchu Bannermen who were defending the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Makeham|title=China: The World's Oldest Living Civilization Revealed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TQ4NAQAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=Bannermen+desperately|year=2008|publisher=Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-25142-3|page=331}}</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\nIn mid July, the British ships concentrated on Chinkiang and blocked the route between the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal. On the morning of July 21, the British attacked Chinkiang City in three directions with four brigades. With the support of artillery brigade, 2,310 soldiers of the first brigade attacked the Qing army guarding the outside of Chinkiang City; 1,832 soldiers of the second brigade attacked the west gate with the support of navy; 2,155 soldiers of the third brigade attacked the north gate. At this time, there were 1,583 Bannermen in Chinkiang and 2,700 [[Green Standard Army]] in the southwest suburb. The Green Standard Army were transferred from other provinces after the fort outside the city was attacked and the situation in Chinkiang was tense. The Green Standard Army, who were temporarily concentrated, were not familiar with the terrain of Chinkiang. Their weapons are all swords and spears, except for a small number of muskets.\n\nAt 7 a.m. the British third brigade landed in Beigu mountain, and then attacked the north gate, which was covered by the British ship's heavy artillery. The Bannermen guarding the north gate immediately shot with muskets, hitting and injuring two British captains. The Bannermen dismantled some battlements and temporarily set up artillery to counterattack the British army. More than an hour after the fierce battle, the artillery of the Bannermen was destroyed, and the British troops rushed to the battery from the side. The garrison fought with the British on the wall of the city.\n\nBefore dawn, the first brigade successfully landed and occupied the highlands near Jinshan. At 8 a.m., the British began their attack on the Green Standard Army stationed outside the city. These Green Standard Army came to reinforce the city from afar. Because of their tired journey and lack of food, they were defeated by the British army after fierce battle. Many Green Standard Army soldiers became deserters. The commander of Green Standard Army saw the fire in Chinkiang City and thought that the city had been lost, so he ordered the remaining soldiers to retreat.\n\nThe west gate is the main battlefield for the British to attack the city. Shortly after the battle between the north gate and the southwest suburb, the second brigade began to attack the west gate. The British soldiers of the two regiments occupied some houses outside the city to shoot at the garrison under the cover; meanwhile, the transport ship carrying the British marines drove along the canal to the west gate, where they planned to attack the city. The west gate garrison fired at the British Army on land and the Marine Corps in the canal, injuring 16 sailors, 8 gunners and a officer and forcing the British army to withdraw from the canal within 10 minutes. After that, the British army sent another 200 Marines to cooperate with the land force to attack Chinkiang city again, this time they successfully occupied part of the city buildings. The defenders fought fiercely with the British Army on the city buildings. At noon, the British army sent a team of engineers to blow up the west gate with gunpowder. At the same time, the third brigade of the British Army occupying the north gate rushed to the west gate to fight, and finally the Qing's defense was broken. However, the garrison and the British army had a fierce street battle in the city. At least 40 British officers and soldiers were injured or killed in the street war. After the British army completely seized the city, Hai Ling, the supreme commander of the Qing army, and his family committed suicide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.meipian.cn/1jz2rezz|title=\u9e26\u7247\u6218\u4e89\u4e4b\u9547\u6c5f\u6218\u5f79 - \u7f8e\u7bc7|website=www.meipian.cn|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Capture of Chinkeangfoo.jpg|Map of the battle\nFile:Tartars at Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Rallying of the Tartar troops\nFile:British troops capture Chin-Keang-Foo.jpg|Engagement in Chinkiang\nFile:Escalade of Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Escalade in Chinkiang\nFile:Gates of Chin-keang-foo.jpg|Blowing open the gates of the city\nFile:Battle of Chinkiang Memorial at the St. George's Cathedral, Madras.jpg|Battle memorial at [[St. George's Cathedral, Chennai|St. George's Cathedral, Madras]]\n</gallery>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ttU1AAAAMAAJ Bulletins of State Intelligence]''.

coming from [[Europe]] via air and seaports \u2013 starting on March15 and in effect until March 31 \u2013 with the exception of those who are Aruban citizens.<ref name=\"FirstCases\"/> They also suspended public and private school classes for the week of March 16, as well as all large-scale public gatherings.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, at approximately 8pm AST, Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes announced that there would be a lockdown on all inbound international travel commencing at midnight of March 16, 2020 and ending on March 31, 2020. An exception to this inbound travel lockdown would be granted to Aruba residents. A travel advisory would also be instituted for residents, advising against outbound travel at this time. To this date Aruba had two confirmed Corona Virus cases. It is important to note that this lockdown does not apply to outbound travel for international travelers currently in Aruba \u2013 they will be able to take their return flight home.\n\nOn March 16 to 17th the 3rd case of the coronavirus was reported, a doctor who recently travelled to New York for her vacation. She did not show any symptoms, but was tested, and the results of the test showed she was positive for the virus.\n\nMarch 17, 2020 \u2013 Fourth case of coronavirus announced. Aruba's Prime Minister Evelyn Wever-Croes has just announced a fourth case of COVID-19 coronavirus in Aruba. The person who tested positive for the coronavirus is a tourist.\n\nMarch 20, 2020 \u2013 Fifth case of coronavirus announced. The patient is an employee of the airport, who arrived back from New York, where he was on vacation. This was discovered a day after there was public protest over the lack of measures on the airport to protect employees against contagion.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=|title=24 luchthavenmedewerkers uit voorzorg in quarantaine|date=March 20, 2020|work=Amigoe Aruba|access-date=|url-status=live|publisher=Amigoe}}</ref>\n\nMarch 21, 2020 \u2013 Three more cases have been announced, bringing the total to eight. It concerns two people from outside of Aruba (one from [[New York City|New York]] and one from [[Miami]]).
