They are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the [[kilowatt hour]] (''kWh''). They are usually read once each billing period.\n\nWhen energy savings during certain periods are desired, some meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. \"Time of day\" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for [[demand response]] load shedding during peak load periods.<ref>[http://www.minnkota.com/Pages/loadmana.html E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616204615/http://minnkota.com/Pages/loadmana.html |date=2006-06-16 }}, accessed 22 August 2009.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Direct current ===\n[[file:DC Electric Meter.JPG|thumb|An Aron type DC electricity meter showing that the calibration was in charge consumed rather than energy]]\n\nAs commercial use of electric energy spread in the 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing [[gas meter]]s, was required to properly bill customers, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month.\n\nDC meters measured [[Electric charge|charge]] in ampere-hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example, if a meter recorded that 100&nbsp;ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20&nbsp;kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied.\n\nMany experimental types of meter were developed. [[Thomas Edison]] at first worked on a [[direct current]] (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an [[electrochemical]] metering system, which used an [[electrolytic cell]] to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.\n\n[[file:Reason electricity meter.JPG|thumb|left|A 'Reason' meter]]\n\nAn early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter. This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter. As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere-hours. Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply.\n\nIn 1885 [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Ferranti]] offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.<ref>Graeme Gooday ''The morals of measurement: accuracy, irony,and trust in late Victorian electrical practice'', Cambridge University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-43098-4}}, p 232\u2013241</ref> The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a [[direct current|DC]] meter by [[Hermann Aron|Dr Hermann Aron]], who patented it in 1883.

Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.\n\n== Units ==\n[[file:CommercialElectricityMeter.jpg|thumb|Panel-mounted [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] electricity meter, connected to a 2 [[Apparent power|MVA]] electricity [[Electrical substation|substation]]. Remote current and voltage sensors can be read and programmed remotely by [[modem]] and locally by [[infra-red]]. The circle with two dots is the infra-red port. Tamper-evident seals can be seen]]\n\nThe most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the [[kilowatt hour]] [''kWh''], which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one [[kilowatt]] over a period of one [[hour]], or 3,600,000 [[joule]]s. Some electricity companies use the [[SI]] [[megajoule]] instead.\n\nDemand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter- or half-hour.\n\n[[Reactive power]] is measured in \"thousands of [[volt-ampere reactive]]-hours\", (kvarh). By convention, a \"lagging\" or [[Inductance|inductive]] load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. A \"leading\", or [[capacitive]] load, will have negative reactive power.<ref>''[[IEEE]] Recommended practice for industrial and commercial power systems analysis Standard 399-1997'', IEEE, {{ISBN|1-55937-968-5}} page 47</ref>\n\nVolt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual. This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes.\n\nDistortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways. [[Power factor]] is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.\n\nIn addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available. Meters which measured the amount of charge ([[coulomb]]s) used, known as [[Ampere-hour|ampere-hour meters]], were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries. Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These are only suited for constant-load applications and are rarely used today.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[file:ElectricityMeterMechanism.jpg|thumb|Mechanism of [[electromechanical]] [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] meter. 1: Voltage coil: many turns of fine wire encased in plastic, connected in parallel with load. 2: Current coil: three turns of thick wire, connected in series with load. 3: Stator: concentrates and confines magnetic field. 4: Aluminum rotor disc. 5: rotor brake magnets. 6: spindle with worm gear. 7: display dials: the 1/10, 10 and 1000 dials rotate [[clockwise]] while the 1, 100 and 10000 dials rotate counter-clockwise]]\n\nElectricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous [[voltage]] ([[volt]]s) and [[electric current|current]] ([[ampere]]s) to give [[energy]] used (in [[joules]], kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in-line between source and customer. For larger loads, more than about 200 ampere of load, [[current transformer]]s are used, so that the meter can be located other than in line with the service conductors. The meters fall into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic.\n\n=== Electromechanical ===\n\nThe most common type of electricity meter is the [[electromechanical]] watt-hour meter.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jehl |first=Francis | title=Menlo Park Reminiscences | year=1941 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkL1Smk4uiAC&dq | isbn=978-0-7661-2648-0 | pp = 841 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Magnets and Electric Currents|last=Fleming|first=J.A. | year=1914 | publisher=Spon & Chamberlain |location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/magnetsandelect00flemgoog | pp = [https://archive.org/details/magnetsandelect00flemgoog/page/n346 335] }}</ref>\n\nOn a [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] AC supply, the electromechanical induction meter operates through [[electromagnetic induction]] by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. The current coil similarly consumes a small amount of power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.\n\nThe disc is acted upon by two sets of [[induction coil]]s, which form, in effect, a two phase [[linear induction motor]]. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a [[magnetic flux]] in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the [[electric current|current]]. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist3_10/vol3-10.pdf | title=Volume 3-10 | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref> This produces [[eddy current]]s in the disc and the effect is such that a [[force]] is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle ([[power factor]]) between them. A [[permanent magnet]] acts as an [[eddy current brake]], exerting an opposing force proportional to the [[Angular velocity|speed of rotation]] of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the [[odometer]] in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.\n\nDifferent [[polyphase system|phase configurations]] use additional voltage and current coils.\n\n[[file:ThreePhaseElectricityMeter.jpg|thumb|[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electromechanical induction meter, metering 100 A 240/415 V supply.

The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used. The dials may be of the ''cyclometer'' type, an odometer-like display that is easy to read where for each dial a single [[Numerical digit|digit]] is shown through a window in the face of the meter, or of the pointer type where a pointer indicates each digit. With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism.\n\nThe amount of energy represented by one revolution of the disc is denoted by the symbol Kh which is given in units of watt-hours per revolution. The value 7.2 is commonly seen. Using the value of Kh one can determine their power consumption at any given time by timing the disc with a stopwatch.\n\n<math>P = {{3600 \\cdot Kh } \\over t}</math>.\n\nWhere:\n::{{math|''t''}} = time in seconds taken by the disc to complete one revolution,\n::{{math|''P''}} = power in watts.\n\nFor example, if {{math|''Kh''}} = 7.2 as above, and one revolution took place in 14.4 seconds, the power is 1800 watts. This method can be used to determine the power consumption of household devices by switching them on one by one.\n\nMost domestic electricity meters must be read manually, whether by a representative of the [[electricity retailing|power company]] or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by [[telephone]], [[Mail|post]] or over the [[internet]]. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.\n\nIn an induction type meter, creep is a phenomenon that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due to creep is called a creep test.\n\nTwo standards govern meter accuracy, [[ANSI C12.20]] for North America and IEC&nbsp;62053.\n\n=== Electronic ===\n[[file:Solid-state-electricity-meter.jpg|thumb|[[Solid state (electronics) Danish made|Solid state]] electricity meter used in a home in the [[Netherlands]]]]\n\nElectronic meters display the energy used on an [[LCD]] or LED display, and some can also transmit readings to remote places. In addition to measuring energy used, electronic meters can also record other parameters of the load and supply such as instantaneous and maximum rate of usage demands, voltages, power factor and [[reactive power]] used etc. They can also support time-of-day billing, for example, recording the amount of energy used during on-peak and off-peak hours.\n\nAs in the block diagram{{where?|date=December 2017}}, the meter has a power supply, a metering engine, a processing and communication engine (i.e. a [[microcontroller]]), and other add-on modules such as RTC, LCD, communication ports/modules and so on.\n\nThe metering engine is given the voltage and current inputs and has a voltage reference, samplers and quantisers followed by an ADC section to yield the digitised equivalents of all the inputs. These inputs are then processed using a [[digital signal processor]] to calculate the various metering parameters.\n\nThe largest source of long-term errors in the meter is drift in the preamp, followed by the precision of the voltage reference. Both of these vary with temperature as well, and vary wildly because most meters are outdoors. Characterising and compensating for these is a major part of meter design.\n\nThe processing and communication section has the responsibility of calculating the various derived quantities from the digital values generated by the metering engine. This also has the responsibility of communication using various protocols and interface with other addon modules connected as slaves to it.\n\nRTC and other add-on modules are attached as slaves to the processing and communication section for various input/output functions. On a modern meter most if not all of this will be implemented inside the microprocessor, such as the real-time clock ([[Real-time clock|RTC]]), LCD controller, temperature sensor, memory and analogue to digital converters.\n\n=== Communication methods ===\n\nRemote meter reading is a practical example of [[telemetry]]. It saves the cost of a human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service.\n\nHistorically, rotating meters could report their metered information remotely, using a pair of [[electrical contacts]] attached to a ''KYZ'' line.\n\nA KYZ interface is a [[Electrical contacts|Form C]] contact supplied from the meter. In a KYZ interface, the Y and Z wires are switch contacts, shorted to K for a measured amount of energy. When one contact closes the other contact opens to provide count accuracy security.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are KYZ Pulses?|url=http://www.solidstateinstruments.com/newsletters/newsletter%20pages/Mar11/What%20are%20KYZ%20Pulses.htm|publisher=SolidState Instruments |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> Each contact change of state is considered one pulse. The frequency of pulses indicates the power demand. The number of pulses indicates energy metered.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www2.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | title=Handbook for Electricity Metering | publisher=EEI | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024063933/http://www.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | archivedate=2008-10-24 }}</ref>\n\nThe '''KYZ''' [[relay]] creates pulses. The term KYZ refers to the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for Normally Closed. When incorporated into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a \"pulse.\" When connected to external equipment, rate of use (kW) as well as total usage (kWh) can be determined from the rate and quantity of pulses.\n\nKYZ outputs were historically attached to \"totaliser relays\" feeding a \"totaliser\" so that many meters could be read all at once in one place.\n\nKYZ outputs are also the classic way of attaching electricity meters to [[programmable logic controller]]s, [[building automation|HVAC]]s or other control systems. Some modern meters also supply a contact closure that warns when the meter detects a demand near a higher [[electricity tariff]],\nto improve [[demand side management]].\n\nSome meters have an [[open collector]] or IR LED output that give 32-100 ms pulses for each metered amount of electrical energy, usually 1000-10000 pulses per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]. Output is limited to max 27 V DC and 27 mA DC. These outputs usually follow the DIN 43864 standard.\n\nOften, meters designed for semi-automated reading have a [[serial port]] on that communicates by [[infrared]] LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, but in a wired bus using a [[serial port|serial]] [[current loop]] to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.\n\nIn the European Union, the most common infrared and protocol is \"FLAG\", a simplified subset of mode C of [[IEC 61107]]. In the United States and Canada, the favoured infrared protocol is [[ANSI C12.18]]. Some industrial meters use a protocol for [[programmable logic controller]]s ([[Modbus]] or [[DNP3]]).\n\nOne protocol proposed for this purpose is [[DLMS/COSEM]] which can operate over any medium, including serial ports. The data can be transmitted by [[Zigbee]], [[WiFi]], [[telephone line]]s or [[Power line communication|over the power lines themselves]]. Some meters can be read over the internet. Other more modern protocols are also becoming widely used, like OSGP (Open Smart Grid Protocol).\n\nElectronic meters now use [[short range device|low-power radio]], [[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IrDA]], as well as [[RS-485]] wired link. The meters can now store the entire usage profiles with time stamps and relay them at a click of a button. The demand readings stored with the profiles accurately indicate the load requirements of the customer. This [[load profile]] data is processed at the utilities for billing and planning purposes.\n\n''AMR'' ([[Automatic Meter Reading]]) and ''RMR'' (Remote Meter Reading) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked without the need to send a meter reader out. An electronic meter can transmit its readings by telephone line or radio to a central billing office. Automatic meter reading can be done with [[GSM]] (Global System for Mobile Communications) modems, one is attached to each meter and the other is placed at the central utility office.\n\n== Monitoring and billing methods ==\n\n=== Commercial uses ===\n\nLarge commercial and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of half an hour or less. This is because most [[electricity grid]]s have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company may wish to give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular [[television programme]]s.\n\n=== Home energy monitoring ===\n{{Main|Home energy monitor}}\n\nA potentially powerful means to [[energy conservation|reduce household energy consumption]] is to provide convenient real-time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behaviour. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by ''[[Hydro One]]'' showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. ''Hydro One'' subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | title = CBPHydroOneReprint | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231959/http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-18 }}</ref> Projects such as [[Google PowerMeter]], take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation.<ref name=sfgate >{{cite news | author=Verne Kopytoff | author2=Ryan Kim|title=Google plans meter to detail home energy use | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/10/BULM15RHFH.DTL&type=tech | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2009-02-11 }}</ref>\n[[File:P3-Kill-a-watt.jpg|thumb|right|One model of plug-in electricity meter, used to measure consumption of an individual appliance; in this case, Christmas lights.]]\nPlug-in electricity meters (or plug load meters) measure energy used by individual appliances. There are a variety of models available on the market today but they all work on the same basic principle. The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged into the meter. Such meters can help in [[energy conservation]] by identifying major energy users, or devices that consume excessive [[standby power]]. Web resources can also be used, if an estimate of the power consumption is enough for the research purposes. A power meter can often be borrowed from the local power authorities<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | title=Residential&nbsp;\u2014 Home Energy Audit&nbsp;\u2014 Watts Up | publisher=Austin Utilities | accessdate=2009-08-04 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071207/http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | archivedate=2009-03-12 }}</ref> or a local public library.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mge.com/home/saving/energymeter.htm | title=Portable Energy Meter | publisher=Mge.com | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linkcat.info/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=link%3D1100002%40%212072347%40%211100001%40%211100002&menu=search&profile=dial&index=TL&term=Watts%20up%3F%20%5Benergy%20meter%5D#focus | title=LINKcat | publisher=Linkcat.info | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple tariff ===\n{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Electricity retailing|Electricity retailers]] may wish to charge customers different tariffs at different times of the day to better reflect the costs of generation and transmission. Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.\n\nSome multiple tariff meters use different tariffs for different amounts of demand. These are usually industrial meters.\n\nDomestic variable-rate meters generally permit two to three tariffs (\"peak\", \"off-peak\" and \"shoulder\") and in such installations a simple electromechanical time switch may be used. Historically, these have often been used in conjunction with electrical [[storage heater]]s or [[hot water storage]] systems.\n\nMultiple tariffs are made easier by time of use (TOU) meters which incorporate or are connected to a [[time switch]] and which have multiple registers.\n\nSwitching between the tariffs may happen via [[Load management#Ripple control|ripple control]], or via a radio-activated switch. In principle, a sealed time switch can also be used, but is considered more vulnerable to tampering to obtain cheaper electricity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[file:Economy 7 Meter and Teleswitcher.JPG|thumb|[[Economy 7]] Meter and Teleswitcher]]\n\n[[Radio teleswitch|Radio-activated switching]] is common in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of [[BBC Radio 4]], 198&nbsp;kHz. The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power [[storage heater]]s and [[immersion heater]]s. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded ''[[Economy 7]]'', ''White Meter'' or ''Dual-Rate''. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, at least in the domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much lower cost of [[natural gas]] per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.\n\nAn [[Economy 10]] meter is also available, which gives 10 hours of cheap off-peak electricity spread out over three timeslots throughout a 24-hour period. This allows multiple top-up boosts to storage heaters, or a good spread of times to run a wet electric heating system on a cheaper electricity rate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electricityprices.org.uk/economy-10 | title=Price comparison website | accessdate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>\n\nMost meters using ''[[Economy 7]]'' switch the entire electricity supply to the cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside of this is that the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal (\"single rate\") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC1_CORE&postcode=SW1A%202AA&division=01&tariff=STD&paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}</ref> The equivalent [[Economy 7]] costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC2_CORE&postcode=SW1A%202AA&division=01&tariff=EC7&paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}</ref> Timer switches installed on [[washing machine]]s, [[tumble dryer]]s, [[dishwasher]]s and [[immersion heater]]s may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.\n\n=== Smart meters ===\n{{Main|Smart meter}}\n\nSmart meters go a step further than simple AMR ([[automatic meter reading]]). They offer additional functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, [[power outage]] notification, and power quality monitoring. They allow price setting agencies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season.\n\nAnother type of smart meter uses [[nonintrusive load monitoring]] to automatically determine the number and type of appliances in a residence, how much energy each uses and when. This meter is used by electric utilities to do surveys of energy use. It eliminates the need to put timers on all of the appliances in a house to determine how much energy each uses.\n\n=== Prepayment meters ===\n[[file:PrepaymentMeter.jpg|thumb|Prepayment meter and [[magnetic stripe]] tokens, from a rented accommodation in the UK. The button labelled '''A''' displays information and statistics such as current tariff and remaining credit. The button labelled '''B''' activates a small amount of emergency credit should the customer run out]]\n[[file:London electricity keymeter key.jpg|thumb|A prepayment key]]\n\nThe standard business model of electricity retailing involves the electricity company billing the customer for the amount of energy used in the previous month or quarter. In some countries, if the retailer believes that the customer may not pay the bill, a prepayment meter may be installed. This requires the customer to make advance payment before electricity can be used. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} If the available credit is exhausted then the supply of electricity is cut off by a [[relay]].\n\nIn the UK, mechanical prepayment meters used to be common in rented accommodation. Disadvantages of these included the need for regular visits to remove [[cash]], and risk of theft of the cash in the meter.\n\nModern solid-state electricity meters, in conjunction with [[smart card]]s, have removed these disadvantages and such meters are commonly used for customers considered to be a poor [[credit risk]]. In the UK, customers can use organisations such as the [[Post Office Ltd]] or [[PayPoint]] network, where rechargeable tokens (Quantum cards for natural gas, or plastic \"keys\" for electricity) can be loaded with whatever money the customer has available.\n\nIn [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]] and [[Northern Ireland]] prepaid meters are recharged by entering a unique, encoded twenty digit number using a keypad. This makes the tokens, essentially a slip of paper, very cheap to produce.\n\nAround the world, experiments are going on, especially in developing countries, to test pre-payment systems. In some cases, prepayment meters have not been accepted by customers. There are various groups, such as the Standard Transfer Specification ([[Standard Transfer Specification|STS]]) association, which promote common standards for prepayment metering systems across manufacturers. Prepaid meters using the STS standard are used in many countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sts.org.za|title=Standard Transfer Specification Association NPC / 95/08496/08 > Home|website=www.sts.org.za}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/genus-power-infrastructures-ltd/directorsreport/companyid-7916.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saeec.org.za/members/conlog|title=Conlog | publisher = SAEEC }}</ref>\n\n=== Time of day metering ===\n\nTime of Day metering (TOD), also known as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this can be used to automatically control usage on the part of the customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the [[Electric utility|utilities]] to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also [[Energy demand management|Demand-side Management]] (DSM).\n\nTOD metering normally splits rates into an arrangement of multiple segments including on-peak, off-peak, mid-peak or shoulder, and critical peak. A typical arrangement is a peak occurring during the day (non-holiday days only), such as from 1 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday during the summer and from 6:30 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm during the winter. More complex arrangements include the use of critical peaks that occur during high demand periods. The times of peak demand/cost will vary in different markets around the world.\n\nLarge commercial users can purchase power by the hour using either forecast pricing or real-time pricing.\nSome utilities allow residential customers to pay hourly rates, such as in Illinois, which uses day ahead pricing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ameren.com/RetailEnergy/realtimeprices.aspx|title=retail-energy|website=www2.ameren.com|access-date=2009-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131003653/https://www2.ameren.com/RetailEnergy/realtimeprices.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-31|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | title = Real Time Pricing | publisher = Thewattspot.com | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090223194312/http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | archivedate = 2009-02-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Power export metering ===\n{{See also|Net metering}}\n\nMany electricity customers are installing their own electricity generating equipment, whether for reasons of economy, [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[green power|environmental reasons]]. When a customer is generating more electricity than required for his own use, the surplus may be exported back to the [[power grid]]. Customers that generate back into the \"grid\" usually must have special equipment and safety devices to protect the grid components (as well as the customer's own) in case of faults (electrical short circuits) or maintenance of the grid (say voltage on a downed line coming from an exporting customers facility).\n\nThis exported energy may be accounted for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of [[Net metering|net export]], thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.\n\nLately, upload sources typically originate from renewable sources (e.g., [[wind turbine]]s, [[photovoltaic]] cells), or [[gas]] or steam [[turbine]]s, which are often found in [[cogeneration]] systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries ([[vehicle-to-grid]] power systems). This requires a \"[[smart grid]],\" which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. Vehicle-to-grid systems could be installed at workplace [[parking lot]]s and garages and at [[park and ride]]s and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when [[Energy demand management|off-peak]] power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.\n\n== Location ==\n[[file:CurrentTransformers.jpg|thumb|[[Current transformer]]s used as part of metering equipment for [[three-phase]] 400 A electricity supply. The fourth neutral wire does not require a current transformer because current cannot flow in the neutral without also flowing in metered phase wires. ([[Blondel's theorem]]) ]]\n[[file:Dunkin donuts electric power meter in framingham ma shot by brian katt with a canon digital rebel in June of 2006.JPG|thumb|A commercial power meter]]\n[[file:Electricity meters in India.JPG|thumb|Electricity meters placed outside the homes of residents in a common place, which is accessible only for the department staff and concerned residents]]\n[[file:2008-08-12 Technician disconnecting electricity for nonpayment.jpg|thumb|A [[Duke Energy]] technician removes the tamper-proof seal from an electricity meter at a residence in [[Durham, North Carolina]]]]\n\nThe location of an electricity meter varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a [[utility pole]] serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises adjacent to the [[consumer unit]] / [[distribution board]]. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to [[vandalism]].\n\n[[Current transformer]]s permit the meter to be located remotely from the current-carrying conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a [[Electrical substation|substation]] serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet.\n\n=== Customer drop and metering equation ===\n\nSince electrical standards vary in different regions, \"customer drops\" from the grid to the customer also vary depending on the standards and the type of installation. There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. Each type has a different ''metering equation.'' [[Blondel's theorem]] states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system.\n\nIn Europe, Asia, Africa and most other locations, [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] is common for residential and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: [[Watt]]s = [[volts]] x [[Ampere|amps]], with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by [[split phase|three-wire single phase]]. Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing that can be easily measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A \u2212 amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires.\n\nIndustrial power is normally supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire with a system neutral. In \"three wire\" or \"three wire delta,\" , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, it is common for this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.\n\nIn the four-wire three-phase system, sometimes called \"four-wire wye\", the safety ground is connected to a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type.<ref>See the [[National Electrical Code]], a large book, revised yearly, widely available for purchase.</ref> In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.\n\nIn North America, it is common for electricity meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, on the side of a building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. Most electronic meters in North America use a serial protocol, [[ANSI C12.18]].\n\nIn many other countries the supply and load terminals are in the meter housing itself. Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often [[EIA-485]] or infra-red with a serial protocol such as [[IEC 62056]].\n\nIn 2014, networking to meters is rapidly changing. The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. [[ANSI C12.19]] or [[IEC 62056]]) operating via the [[internet protocol]] with a small circuit board for [[powerline communication]], or a digital radio for a [[mobile phone]] network, or an [[ISM band]].\n\n== Accuracy ==\n\nElectricity meters are required to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the electricity supplier, or the consumer being over billed. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions may also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, any installed electricity meter is required to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%.<ref>Measuring Instruments (Active Electrical Energy Meters) regulations 2006, Schedule 1, Paragraph 15. These errors apply between +5\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C and a power factor of 0.8 leading to 0.5 lagging. Outside of these limits larger errors are permissible.</ref> Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electricity-meter-accuracy-and-disputes Electricity meter accuracy disputes]</ref> Approximately 93% of disputed meters are found to be operating satisfactorily. A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory is able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read for as long as the consumer has had a gas supply through it.<ref>the Gas (Meters) Regulations 1983</ref>\n\n== Tampering and security ==\n\nMeters can be manipulated to make them under-register, effectively allowing power use without paying for it. This theft or fraud can be dangerous as well as dishonest.\n\nPower companies often install remote-reporting meters specifically to enable remote detection of tampering, and specifically to discover energy theft. The change to smart power meters is useful to stop energy theft.\n\nWhen tampering is detected, the normal tactic, legal in most areas of the United States, is to switch the subscriber to a \"tampering\" tariff charged at the meter's maximum designed current{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. At US$0.095/kWh, a standard residential 50&nbsp;A meter causes a legally collectible charge of about US$5,000.00 per month. Meter readers are trained to spot signs of tampering, and with crude mechanical meters, the maximum rate may be charged each billing period until the tamper is removed, or the service is disconnected.\n\nA common method of tampering on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets to the outside of the meter. Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in electronic meters, though countermeasures are common.\n\nSome combinations of capacitive and inductive load can interact with the coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion.\n\nAll of these effects can be detected by the electric company, and many modern meters can detect or compensate for them.\n\nThe owner of the meter normally secures the meter against tampering. Revenue meters' mechanisms and connections are sealed. Meters may also measure VAR-hours (the reflected load), neutral and DC currents (elevated by most electrical tampering), ambient magnetic fields, etc. Even simple mechanical meters can have mechanical flags that are dropped by magnetic tampering or large DC currents.\n\nNewer computerised meters usually have counter-measures against tampering. AMR (Automated Meter Reading) meters often have sensors that can report opening of the meter cover, magnetic anomalies, extra clock setting, glued buttons, inverted installation, reversed or switched phases etc.\n\nSome tampers bypass the meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers of this type normally increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.<ref>Teridian Semiconductors Application Note, \"Antitamper Features Enabled by the 71M6511\" The 71M6511 is a single chip metering device widely used in computerised meters.</ref>\n\nDisconnecting a meter's neutral connector is unsafe because shorts can then pass through people or equipment rather than a metallic ground to the generator or earth.\n\nA [[phantom loop]] connection via an earth ground is often much higher resistance than the metallic neutral connector. Even if an earth ground is safe, metering at the substation can alert the operator to tampering. Substations, inter-ties, and transformers normally have a high-accuracy meter for the area served. Power companies normally investigate discrepancies between the total billed and the total generated, in order to find and fix power distribution problems. These investigations are an effective method to discover tampering.\n\nPower thefts in the United States are often connected with indoor marijuana [[grow operation]]s. Narcotics detectives associate abnormally high power usage with the lighting such operations require.<ref>{{cite book|title=James Bong's Ultimate SpyGuide to Marijuana|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8N4DwMb19oC&pg=PA235&dq=meter+bypass+marijuana&hl=en&ei=iOB2TqbqKpDB8QP_rdXzDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=234\u2013242|chapter=Theft of power}}</ref> Indoor marijuana growers aware of this are particularly motivated to steal electricity simply to conceal their usage of it.\n\n== Regulation and legislation ==\n\nFollowing the [[deregulation]] of electricity supply markets in many countries, the company responsible for an electricity meter may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be the property of the [[meter Operator]], [[electricity distribution|electricity distributor]], the [[electricity retail|retailer]] or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer.\n\nThe company responsible for reading the meter may not always be the company which owns it. Meter reading is now sometimes subcontracted and in some areas the same person may read [[gas meter|gas]], [[water meter|water]] and electricity meters at the same time.\n\nThe introduction of [[Automatic meter reading|advanced meters]] in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues that may affect ordinary customers. These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Some meters have one or two IR LEDs on the front: one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples' possessions and behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | author = Hart, G.W. | journal = IEEE Technology and Society Magazine| date=June 1989 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12\u201316 | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 }}</ref> For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods.

They are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the [[kilowatt hour]] (''kWh''). They are usually read once each billing period.\n\nWhen energy savings during certain periods are desired, some meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. \"Time of day\" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high-cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for [[demand response]] load shedding during peak load periods.<ref>[http://www.minnkota.com/Pages/loadmana.html E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616204615/http://minnkota.com/Pages/loadmana.html |date=2006-06-16 }}, accessed 22 August 2009.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Direct current ===\n[[file:DC Electric Meter.JPG|thumb|An Aron type DC electricity meter showing that the calibration was in charge consumed rather than energy]]\n\nAs commercial use of electric energy spread in the 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing [[gas meter]]s, was required to properly bill customers, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month.\n\nDC meters measured [[Electric charge|charge]] in ampere-hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example, if a meter recorded that 100&nbsp;ampere-hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20&nbsp;kilowatt-hours of energy had been supplied.\n\nMany experimental types of meter were developed. [[Thomas Edison]] at first worked on a [[direct current]] (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an [[electrochemical]] metering system, which used an [[electrolytic cell]] to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor-intensive to read and not well received by customers.\n\n[[file:Reason electricity meter.JPG|thumb|left|A 'Reason' meter]]\n\nAn early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter. This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter. As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere-hours. Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply.\n\nIn 1885 [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Ferranti]] offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.<ref>Graeme Gooday ''The morals of measurement: accuracy, irony,and trust in late Victorian electrical practice'', Cambridge University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-521-43098-4}}, p 232\u2013241</ref> The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a [[direct current|DC]] meter by [[Hermann Aron|Dr Hermann Aron]], who patented it in 1883.

Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.\n\n== Units ==\n[[file:CommercialElectricityMeter.jpg|thumb|Panel-mounted [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] electricity meter, connected to a 2 [[Apparent power|MVA]] electricity [[Electrical substation|substation]]. Remote current and voltage sensors can be read and programmed remotely by [[modem]] and locally by [[infra-red]]. The circle with two dots is the infra-red port. Tamper-evident seals can be seen]]\n\nThe most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the [[kilowatt hour]] [''kWh''], which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one [[kilowatt]] over a period of one [[hour]], or 3,600,000 [[joule]]s. Some electricity companies use the [[SI]] [[megajoule]] instead.\n\nDemand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter- or half-hour.\n\n[[Reactive power]] is measured in \"thousands of [[volt-ampere reactive]]-hours\", (kvarh). By convention, a \"lagging\" or [[Inductance|inductive]] load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. A \"leading\", or [[capacitive]] load, will have negative reactive power.<ref>''[[IEEE]] Recommended practice for industrial and commercial power systems analysis Standard 399-1997'', IEEE, {{ISBN|1-55937-968-5}} page 47</ref>\n\nVolt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual. This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes.\n\nDistortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways. [[Power factor]] is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.\n\nIn addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available. Meters which measured the amount of charge ([[coulomb]]s) used, known as [[Ampere-hour|ampere-hour meters]], were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries. Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These are only suited for constant-load applications and are rarely used today.\n\n== Operation ==\n[[file:ElectricityMeterMechanism.jpg|thumb|Mechanism of [[electromechanical]] [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] meter. 1: Voltage coil: many turns of fine wire encased in plastic, connected in parallel with load. 2: Current coil: three turns of thick wire, connected in series with load. 3: Stator: concentrates and confines magnetic field. 4: Aluminum rotor disc. 5: rotor brake magnets. 6: spindle with worm gear. 7: display dials: the 1/10, 10 and 1000 dials rotate [[clockwise]] while the 1, 100 and 10000 dials rotate counter-clockwise]]\n\nElectricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous [[voltage]] ([[volt]]s) and [[electric current|current]] ([[ampere]]s) to give [[energy]] used (in [[joules]], kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in-line between source and customer. For larger loads, more than about 200 ampere of load, [[current transformer]]s are used, so that the meter can be located other than in line with the service conductors. The meters fall into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic.\n\n=== Electromechanical ===\n\nThe most common type of electricity meter is the [[electromechanical]] watt-hour meter.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jehl |first=Francis | title=Menlo Park Reminiscences | year=1941 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OkL1Smk4uiAC&dq | isbn=978-0-7661-2648-0 | pp = 841 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Magnets and Electric Currents|last=Fleming|first=J.A. | year=1914 | publisher=Spon & Chamberlain |location=New York | url=https://archive.org/details/magnetsandelect00flemgoog | pp = [https://archive.org/details/magnetsandelect00flemgoog/page/n346 335] }}</ref>\n\nOn a [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] AC supply, the electromechanical induction meter operates through [[electromagnetic induction]] by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. The current coil similarly consumes a small amount of power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter.\n\nThe disc is acted upon by two sets of [[induction coil]]s, which form, in effect, a two phase [[linear induction motor]]. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a [[magnetic flux]] in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the [[electric current|current]]. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/fist/fist3_10/vol3-10.pdf | title=Volume 3-10 | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref> This produces [[eddy current]]s in the disc and the effect is such that a [[force]] is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle ([[power factor]]) between them. A [[permanent magnet]] acts as an [[eddy current brake]], exerting an opposing force proportional to the [[Angular velocity|speed of rotation]] of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the [[odometer]] in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used.\n\nDifferent [[polyphase system|phase configurations]] use additional voltage and current coils.\n\n[[file:ThreePhaseElectricityMeter.jpg|thumb|[[Three-phase electric power|Three-phase]] electromechanical induction meter, metering 100 A 240/415 V supply. Horizontal aluminium rotor disc is visible in centre of meter]]\n\nThe disc is supported by a spindle which has a [[gear#Worm|worm gear]] which drives the register. The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used. The dials may be of the ''cyclometer'' type, an odometer-like display that is easy to read where for each dial a single [[Numerical digit|digit]] is shown through a window in the face of the meter, or of the pointer type where a pointer indicates each digit. With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism.\n\nThe amount of energy represented by one revolution of the disc is denoted by the symbol Kh which is given in units of watt-hours per revolution. The value 7.2 is commonly seen. Using the value of Kh one can determine their power consumption at any given time by timing the disc with a stopwatch.\n\n<math>P = {{3600 \\cdot Kh } \\over t}</math>.\n\nWhere:\n::{{math|''t''}} = time in seconds taken by the disc to complete one revolution,\n::{{math|''P''}} = power in watts.\n\nFor example, if {{math|''Kh''}} = 7.2 as above, and one revolution took place in 14.4 seconds, the power is 1800 watts. This method can be used to determine the power consumption of household devices by switching them on one by one.\n\nMost domestic electricity meters must be read manually, whether by a representative of the [[electricity retailing|power company]] or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by [[telephone]], [[Mail|post]] or over the [[internet]]. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter.\n\nIn an induction type meter, creep is a phenomenon that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due to creep is called a creep test.\n\nTwo standards govern meter accuracy, [[ANSI C12.20]] for North America and IEC&nbsp;62053.\n\n=== Electronic ===\n[[file:Solid-state-electricity-meter.jpg|thumb|[[Solid state (electronics)|Solid state]] electricity meter used in a home in the [[Netherlands]]]]\n\nElectronic meters display the energy used on an [[LCD]] or LED display, and some can also transmit readings to remote places. In addition to measuring energy used, electronic meters can also record other parameters of the load and supply such as instantaneous and maximum rate of usage demands, voltages, power factor and [[reactive power]] used etc. They can also support time-of-day billing, for example, recording the amount of energy used during on-peak and off-peak hours.\n\nAs in the block diagram{{where?|date=December 2017}}, the meter has a power supply, a metering engine, a processing and communication engine (i.e. a [[microcontroller]]), and other add-on modules such as RTC, LCD, communication ports/modules and so on.\n\nThe metering engine is given the voltage and current inputs and has a voltage reference, samplers and quantisers followed by an ADC section to yield the digitised equivalents of all the inputs. These inputs are then processed using a [[digital signal processor]] to calculate the various metering parameters.\n\nThe largest source of long-term errors in the meter is drift in the preamp, followed by the precision of the voltage reference. Both of these vary with temperature as well, and vary wildly because most meters are outdoors. Characterising and compensating for these is a major part of meter design.\n\nThe processing and communication section has the responsibility of calculating the various derived quantities from the digital values generated by the metering engine. This also has the responsibility of communication using various protocols and interface with other addon modules connected as slaves to it.\n\nRTC and other add-on modules are attached as slaves to the processing and communication section for various input/output functions. On a modern meter most if not all of this will be implemented inside the microprocessor, such as the real-time clock ([[Real-time clock|RTC]]), LCD controller, temperature sensor, memory and analogue to digital converters.\n\n=== Communication methods ===\n\nRemote meter reading is a practical example of [[telemetry]]. It saves the cost of a human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service.\n\nHistorically, rotating meters could report their metered information remotely, using a pair of [[electrical contacts]] attached to a ''KYZ'' line.\n\nA KYZ interface is a [[Electrical contacts|Form C]] contact supplied from the meter. In a KYZ interface, the Y and Z wires are switch contacts, shorted to K for a measured amount of energy. When one contact closes the other contact opens to provide count accuracy security.<ref>{{cite web|title=What are KYZ Pulses?|url=http://www.solidstateinstruments.com/newsletters/newsletter%20pages/Mar11/What%20are%20KYZ%20Pulses.htm|publisher=SolidState Instruments |accessdate=22 November 2012}}</ref> Each contact change of state is considered one pulse. The frequency of pulses indicates the power demand. The number of pulses indicates energy metered.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www2.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | title=Handbook for Electricity Metering | publisher=EEI | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024063933/http://www.eei.org/products_and_services/descriptions_and_access/handbook_meterng.htm | archivedate=2008-10-24 }}</ref>\n\nThe '''KYZ''' [[relay]] creates pulses. The term KYZ refers to the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for Normally Closed. When incorporated into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a \"pulse.\" When connected to external equipment, rate of use (kW) as well as total usage (kWh) can be determined from the rate and quantity of pulses.\n\nKYZ outputs were historically attached to \"totaliser relays\" feeding a \"totaliser\" so that many meters could be read all at once in one place.\n\nKYZ outputs are also the classic way of attaching electricity meters to [[programmable logic controller]]s, [[building automation|HVAC]]s or other control systems. Some modern meters also supply a contact closure that warns when the meter detects a demand near a higher [[electricity tariff]],\nto improve [[demand side management]].\n\nSome meters have an [[open collector]] or IR LED output that give 32-100 ms pulses for each metered amount of electrical energy, usually 1000-10000 pulses per [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]]. Output is limited to max 27 V DC and 27 mA DC. These outputs usually follow the DIN 43864 standard.\n\nOften, meters designed for semi-automated reading have a [[serial port]] on that communicates by [[infrared]] LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, but in a wired bus using a [[serial port|serial]] [[current loop]] to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point.\n\nIn the European Union, the most common infrared and protocol is \"FLAG\", a simplified subset of mode C of [[IEC 61107]]. In the United States and Canada, the favoured infrared protocol is [[ANSI C12.18]]. Some industrial meters use a protocol for [[programmable logic controller]]s ([[Modbus]] or [[DNP3]]).\n\nOne protocol proposed for this purpose is [[DLMS/COSEM]] which can operate over any medium, including serial ports. The data can be transmitted by [[Zigbee]], [[WiFi]], [[telephone line]]s or [[Power line communication|over the power lines themselves]]. Some meters can be read over the internet. Other more modern protocols are also becoming widely used, like OSGP (Open Smart Grid Protocol).\n\nElectronic meters now use [[short range device|low-power radio]], [[GSM]], [[GPRS]], [[Bluetooth]], [[IrDA]], as well as [[RS-485]] wired link. The meters can now store the entire usage profiles with time stamps and relay them at a click of a button. The demand readings stored with the profiles accurately indicate the load requirements of the customer. This [[load profile]] data is processed at the utilities for billing and planning purposes.\n\n''AMR'' ([[Automatic Meter Reading]]) and ''RMR'' (Remote Meter Reading) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked without the need to send a meter reader out. An electronic meter can transmit its readings by telephone line or radio to a central billing office. Automatic meter reading can be done with [[GSM]] (Global System for Mobile Communications) modems, one is attached to each meter and the other is placed at the central utility office.\n\n== Monitoring and billing methods ==\n\n=== Commercial uses ===\n\nLarge commercial and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of half an hour or less. This is because most [[electricity grid]]s have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company may wish to give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular [[television programme]]s.\n\n=== Home energy monitoring ===\n{{Main|Home energy monitor}}\n\nA potentially powerful means to [[energy conservation|reduce household energy consumption]] is to provide convenient real-time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behaviour. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by ''[[Hydro One]]'' showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. ''Hydro One'' subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | title = CBPHydroOneReprint | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090318231959/http://www.energetics.com/madri/pdfs/ChartwellHydroOneMonitoringProgram.pdf | archivedate = 2009-03-18 }}</ref> Projects such as [[Google PowerMeter]], take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation.<ref name=sfgate >{{cite news | author=Verne Kopytoff | author2=Ryan Kim|title=Google plans meter to detail home energy use | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/10/BULM15RHFH.DTL&type=tech | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2009-02-11 }}</ref>\n[[File:P3-Kill-a-watt.jpg|thumb|right|One model of plug-in electricity meter, used to measure consumption of an individual appliance; in this case, Christmas lights.]]\nPlug-in electricity meters (or plug load meters) measure energy used by individual appliances. There are a variety of models available on the market today but they all work on the same basic principle. The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged into the meter. Such meters can help in [[energy conservation]] by identifying major energy users, or devices that consume excessive [[standby power]]. Web resources can also be used, if an estimate of the power consumption is enough for the research purposes. A power meter can often be borrowed from the local power authorities<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | title=Residential&nbsp;\u2014 Home Energy Audit&nbsp;\u2014 Watts Up | publisher=Austin Utilities | accessdate=2009-08-04 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090312071207/http://www.austinutilities.com/pages/residential_audit_watts.asp | archivedate=2009-03-12 }}</ref> or a local public library.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mge.com/home/saving/energymeter.htm | title=Portable Energy Meter | publisher=Mge.com | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.linkcat.info/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=link%3D1100002%40%212072347%40%211100001%40%211100002&menu=search&profile=dial&index=TL&term=Watts%20up%3F%20%5Benergy%20meter%5D#focus | title=LINKcat | publisher=Linkcat.info | accessdate=2009-08-04 }}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple tariff ===\n{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}\n\n[[Electricity retailing|Electricity retailers]] may wish to charge customers different tariffs at different times of the day to better reflect the costs of generation and transmission. Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive.\n\nSome multiple tariff meters use different tariffs for different amounts of demand. These are usually industrial meters.\n\nDomestic variable-rate meters generally permit two to three tariffs (\"peak\", \"off-peak\" and \"shoulder\") and in such installations a simple electromechanical time switch may be used. Historically, these have often been used in conjunction with electrical [[storage heater]]s or [[hot water storage]] systems.\n\nMultiple tariffs are made easier by time of use (TOU) meters which incorporate or are connected to a [[time switch]] and which have multiple registers.\n\nSwitching between the tariffs may happen via [[Load management#Ripple control|ripple control]], or via a radio-activated switch. In principle, a sealed time switch can also be used, but is considered more vulnerable to tampering to obtain cheaper electricity. {{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[file:Economy 7 Meter and Teleswitcher.JPG|thumb|[[Economy 7]] Meter and Teleswitcher]]\n\n[[Radio teleswitch|Radio-activated switching]] is common in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of [[BBC Radio 4]], 198&nbsp;kHz. The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power [[storage heater]]s and [[immersion heater]]s. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded ''[[Economy 7]]'', ''White Meter'' or ''Dual-Rate''. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, at least in the domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much lower cost of [[natural gas]] per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system.\n\nAn [[Economy 10]] meter is also available, which gives 10 hours of cheap off-peak electricity spread out over three timeslots throughout a 24-hour period. This allows multiple top-up boosts to storage heaters, or a good spread of times to run a wet electric heating system on a cheaper electricity rate.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electricityprices.org.uk/economy-10 | title=Price comparison website | accessdate=2010-12-15 }}</ref>\n\nMost meters using ''[[Economy 7]]'' switch the entire electricity supply to the cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside of this is that the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal (\"single rate\") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC1_CORE&postcode=SW1A%202AA&division=01&tariff=STD&paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}</ref> The equivalent [[Economy 7]] costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://my.edfenergy.com/gas-electricity/tariff-information-labels/view-label?product=ERC2_CORE&postcode=SW1A%202AA&division=01&tariff=EC7&paytype=01 | title=EDF Energy Tariff Information Label checker | accessdate=2017-07-28 }}</ref> Timer switches installed on [[washing machine]]s, [[tumble dryer]]s, [[dishwasher]]s and [[immersion heater]]s may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period.\n\n=== Smart meters ===\n{{Main|Smart meter}}\n\nSmart meters go a step further than simple AMR ([[automatic meter reading]]). They offer additional functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, [[power outage]] notification, and power quality monitoring. They allow price setting agencies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season.\n\nAnother type of smart meter uses [[nonintrusive load monitoring]] to automatically determine the number and type of appliances in a residence, how much energy each uses and when. This meter is used by electric utilities to do surveys of energy use. It eliminates the need to put timers on all of the appliances in a house to determine how much energy each uses.\n\n=== Prepayment meters ===\n[[file:PrepaymentMeter.jpg|thumb|Prepayment meter and [[magnetic stripe]] tokens, from a rented accommodation in the UK. The button labelled '''A''' displays information and statistics such as current tariff and remaining credit. The button labelled '''B''' activates a small amount of emergency credit should the customer run out]]\n[[file:London electricity keymeter key.jpg|thumb|A prepayment key]]\n\nThe standard business model of electricity retailing involves the electricity company billing the customer for the amount of energy used in the previous month or quarter. In some countries, if the retailer believes that the customer may not pay the bill, a prepayment meter may be installed. This requires the customer to make advance payment before electricity can be used. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} If the available credit is exhausted then the supply of electricity is cut off by a [[relay]].\n\nIn the UK, mechanical prepayment meters used to be common in rented accommodation. Disadvantages of these included the need for regular visits to remove [[cash]], and risk of theft of the cash in the meter.\n\nModern solid-state electricity meters, in conjunction with [[smart card]]s, have removed these disadvantages and such meters are commonly used for customers considered to be a poor [[credit risk]]. In the UK, customers can use organisations such as the [[Post Office Ltd]] or [[PayPoint]] network, where rechargeable tokens (Quantum cards for natural gas, or plastic \"keys\" for electricity) can be loaded with whatever money the customer has available.\n\nIn [[South Africa]], [[Sudan]] and [[Northern Ireland]] prepaid meters are recharged by entering a unique, encoded twenty digit number using a keypad. This makes the tokens, essentially a slip of paper, very cheap to produce.\n\nAround the world, experiments are going on, especially in developing countries, to test pre-payment systems. In some cases, prepayment meters have not been accepted by customers. There are various groups, such as the Standard Transfer Specification ([[Standard Transfer Specification|STS]]) association, which promote common standards for prepayment metering systems across manufacturers. Prepaid meters using the STS standard are used in many countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sts.org.za|title=Standard Transfer Specification Association NPC / 95/08496/08 > Home|website=www.sts.org.za}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/genus-power-infrastructures-ltd/directorsreport/companyid-7916.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Genus Power Infrastructures Ltd}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saeec.org.za/members/conlog|title=Conlog | publisher = SAEEC }}</ref>\n\n=== Time of day metering ===\n\nTime of Day metering (TOD), also known as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this can be used to automatically control usage on the part of the customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the [[Electric utility|utilities]] to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also [[Energy demand management|Demand-side Management]] (DSM).\n\nTOD metering normally splits rates into an arrangement of multiple segments including on-peak, off-peak, mid-peak or shoulder, and critical peak. A typical arrangement is a peak occurring during the day (non-holiday days only), such as from 1 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday during the summer and from 6:30 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm during the winter. More complex arrangements include the use of critical peaks that occur during high demand periods. The times of peak demand/cost will vary in different markets around the world.\n\nLarge commercial users can purchase power by the hour using either forecast pricing or real-time pricing.\nSome utilities allow residential customers to pay hourly rates, such as in Illinois, which uses day ahead pricing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ameren.com/RetailEnergy/realtimeprices.aspx|title=retail-energy|website=www2.ameren.com|access-date=2009-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131003653/https://www2.ameren.com/RetailEnergy/realtimeprices.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-31|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | title = Real Time Pricing | publisher = Thewattspot.com | accessdate = 2009-08-04 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090223194312/http://www.thewattspot.com/rtsavings.php | archivedate = 2009-02-23 }}</ref>\n\n=== Power export metering ===\n{{See also|Net metering}}\n\nMany electricity customers are installing their own electricity generating equipment, whether for reasons of economy, [[redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] or [[green power|environmental reasons]]. When a customer is generating more electricity than required for his own use, the surplus may be exported back to the [[power grid]]. Customers that generate back into the \"grid\" usually must have special equipment and safety devices to protect the grid components (as well as the customer's own) in case of faults (electrical short circuits) or maintenance of the grid (say voltage on a downed line coming from an exporting customers facility).\n\nThis exported energy may be accounted for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of [[Net metering|net export]], thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid.\n\nLately, upload sources typically originate from renewable sources (e.g., [[wind turbine]]s, [[photovoltaic]] cells), or [[gas]] or steam [[turbine]]s, which are often found in [[cogeneration]] systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries ([[vehicle-to-grid]] power systems). This requires a \"[[smart grid]],\" which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. Vehicle-to-grid systems could be installed at workplace [[parking lot]]s and garages and at [[park and ride]]s and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when [[Energy demand management|off-peak]] power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.\n\n== Location ==\n[[file:CurrentTransformers.jpg|thumb|[[Current transformer]]s used as part of metering equipment for [[three-phase]] 400 A electricity supply. The fourth neutral wire does not require a current transformer because current cannot flow in the neutral without also flowing in metered phase wires. ([[Blondel's theorem]]) ]]\n[[file:Dunkin donuts electric power meter in framingham ma shot by brian katt with a canon digital rebel in June of 2006.JPG|thumb|A commercial power meter]]\n[[file:Electricity meters in India.JPG|thumb|Electricity meters placed outside the homes of residents in a common place, which is accessible only for the department staff and concerned residents]]\n[[file:2008-08-12 Technician disconnecting electricity for nonpayment.jpg|thumb|A [[Duke Energy]] technician removes the tamper-proof seal from an electricity meter at a residence in [[Durham, North Carolina]]]]\n\nThe location of an electricity meter varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a [[utility pole]] serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises adjacent to the [[consumer unit]] / [[distribution board]]. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to [[vandalism]].\n\n[[Current transformer]]s permit the meter to be located remotely from the current-carrying conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a [[Electrical substation|substation]] serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet.\n\n=== Customer drop and metering equation ===\n\nSince electrical standards vary in different regions, \"customer drops\" from the grid to the customer also vary depending on the standards and the type of installation. There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. Each type has a different ''metering equation.'' [[Blondel's theorem]] states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system.\n\nIn Europe, Asia, Africa and most other locations, [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] is common for residential and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: [[Watt]]s = [[volts]] x [[Ampere|amps]], with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by [[split phase|three-wire single phase]]. Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing that can be easily measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A \u2212 amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires.\n\nIndustrial power is normally supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire with a system neutral. In \"three wire\" or \"three wire delta,\" , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, it is common for this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.\n\nIn the four-wire three-phase system, sometimes called \"four-wire wye\", the safety ground is connected to a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type.<ref>See the [[National Electrical Code]], a large book, revised yearly, widely available for purchase.</ref> In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral.\n\nIn North America, it is common for electricity meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, on the side of a building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. Most electronic meters in North America use a serial protocol, [[ANSI C12.18]].\n\nIn many other countries the supply and load terminals are in the meter housing itself. Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often [[EIA-485]] or infra-red with a serial protocol such as [[IEC 62056]].\n\nIn 2014, networking to meters is rapidly changing. The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. [[ANSI C12.19]] or [[IEC 62056]]) operating via the [[internet protocol]] with a small circuit board for [[powerline communication]], or a digital radio for a [[mobile phone]] network, or an [[ISM band]].\n\n== Accuracy ==\n\nElectricity meters are required to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the electricity supplier, or the consumer being over billed. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions may also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed.\n\nFor the United Kingdom, any installed electricity meter is required to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%.<ref>Measuring Instruments (Active Electrical Energy Meters) regulations 2006, Schedule 1, Paragraph 15. These errors apply between +5\u00b0C to +30\u00b0C and a power factor of 0.8 leading to 0.5 lagging. Outside of these limits larger errors are permissible.</ref> Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/guidance/electricity-meter-accuracy-and-disputes Electricity meter accuracy disputes]</ref> Approximately 93% of disputed meters are found to be operating satisfactorily. A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory is able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read for as long as the consumer has had a gas supply through it.<ref>the Gas (Meters) Regulations 1983</ref>\n\n== Tampering and security ==\n\nMeters can be manipulated to make them under-register, effectively allowing power use without paying for it. This theft or fraud can be dangerous as well as dishonest.\n\nPower companies often install remote-reporting meters specifically to enable remote detection of tampering, and specifically to discover energy theft. The change to smart power meters is useful to stop energy theft.\n\nWhen tampering is detected, the normal tactic, legal in most areas of the United States, is to switch the subscriber to a \"tampering\" tariff charged at the meter's maximum designed current{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}. At US$0.095/kWh, a standard residential 50&nbsp;A meter causes a legally collectible charge of about US$5,000.00 per month. Meter readers are trained to spot signs of tampering, and with crude mechanical meters, the maximum rate may be charged each billing period until the tamper is removed, or the service is disconnected.\n\nA common method of tampering on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets to the outside of the meter. Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in electronic meters, though countermeasures are common.\n\nSome combinations of capacitive and inductive load can interact with the coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion.\n\nAll of these effects can be detected by the electric company, and many modern meters can detect or compensate for them.\n\nThe owner of the meter normally secures the meter against tampering. Revenue meters' mechanisms and connections are sealed. Meters may also measure VAR-hours (the reflected load), neutral and DC currents (elevated by most electrical tampering), ambient magnetic fields, etc. Even simple mechanical meters can have mechanical flags that are dropped by magnetic tampering or large DC currents.\n\nNewer computerised meters usually have counter-measures against tampering. AMR (Automated Meter Reading) meters often have sensors that can report opening of the meter cover, magnetic anomalies, extra clock setting, glued buttons, inverted installation, reversed or switched phases etc.\n\nSome tampers bypass the meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers of this type normally increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper-resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.<ref>Teridian Semiconductors Application Note, \"Antitamper Features Enabled by the 71M6511\" The 71M6511 is a single chip metering device widely used in computerised meters.</ref>\n\nDisconnecting a meter's neutral connector is unsafe because shorts can then pass through people or equipment rather than a metallic ground to the generator or earth.\n\nA [[phantom loop]] connection via an earth ground is often much higher resistance than the metallic neutral connector. Even if an earth ground is safe, metering at the substation can alert the operator to tampering. Substations, inter-ties, and transformers normally have a high-accuracy meter for the area served. Power companies normally investigate discrepancies between the total billed and the total generated, in order to find and fix power distribution problems. These investigations are an effective method to discover tampering.\n\nPower thefts in the United States are often connected with indoor marijuana [[grow operation]]s. Narcotics detectives associate abnormally high power usage with the lighting such operations require.<ref>{{cite book|title=James Bong's Ultimate SpyGuide to Marijuana|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w8N4DwMb19oC&pg=PA235&dq=meter+bypass+marijuana&hl=en&ei=iOB2TqbqKpDB8QP_rdXzDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=234\u2013242|chapter=Theft of power}}</ref> Indoor marijuana growers aware of this are particularly motivated to steal electricity simply to conceal their usage of it.\n\n== Regulation and legislation ==\n\nFollowing the [[deregulation]] of electricity supply markets in many countries, the company responsible for an electricity meter may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be the property of the [[meter Operator]], [[electricity distribution|electricity distributor]], the [[electricity retail|retailer]] or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer.\n\nThe company responsible for reading the meter may not always be the company which owns it. Meter reading is now sometimes subcontracted and in some areas the same person may read [[gas meter|gas]], [[water meter|water]] and electricity meters at the same time.\n\nThe introduction of [[Automatic meter reading|advanced meters]] in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues that may affect ordinary customers. These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Some meters have one or two IR LEDs on the front: one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two-way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples' possessions and behaviour.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Residential energy monitoring and computerized surveillance via utility power flows | author = Hart, G.W. | journal = IEEE Technology and Society Magazine| date=June 1989 | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 12\u201316 | doi = 10.1109/44.31557 }}</ref> For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel. To solve this problem, cars built in and after late 1981 have one solid trim piece with the bolster permanently attached.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nAs an addition to later cars, a foot rest, or [[dead pedal]], was added to help prevent [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]] while driving. This is one of the few changes that is directly tied to a model year. These were built into only a few of the late-1981 vehicles and were added to all cars starting with 1982 production.<ref name=\"babbtechnology.com\"/>\n\nAlthough the styling of the DeLorean's wheels remained unchanged, the wheels of early-model 1981 vehicles were painted grey. These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side. Originally these were installed such that the headliner side would be on the bottom when not in use. Later on in 1981, they were reversed so that the vinyl side would be on the bottom.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 40}}</ref>\n\nThe original 80 amp Ducellier [[Alternator (auto)|alternator]] supplied with the early-production DeLoreans could not provide enough [[electric current|current]] to supply the car when all lights and electrical options were on; as a result, the [[battery (electricity)|battery]] would gradually discharge, leaving the driver stranded on the road. Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery. This happened to DeLorean owner [[Johnny Carson]] shortly after he was presented with the vehicle.\n\n<gallery>\n|align=\n\nFile:De Lorean add-on Pull strap.jpg|Early pull strap\nFile:Delorean dmc-12 later style side bolster.jpg|Later-style one-piece bolster\nFile:mid 1981 De Lorean silver wheel.JPG|Mid-1981 silver wheel\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable and unique DeLoreans==\n===Wooden Mock-up===\n[[File:Ulster Transport Museum, Cultra, DMC-12 Coupe clay model of Italdesign, Moncalieri, Turin for the De Lorean Company, 1975 04.jpg|thumb|DMC-12 Coupe Mock-up]]\nIn March 1975, DMC entered into a contract with Ital Design to have Giorgetto Giugiaro design the DeLorean Sports Car.

The car was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and stood out for its [[gull-wing door]]s and brushed stainless-steel outer body panels. It became widely known for its disappointing lack of power and performance, which did not match the expectations created by its looks and price tag, but it became iconic for its appearances as the [[DeLorean time machine|time machine]] in the [[Back to the Future (franchise)|''Back to the Future'' media franchise]] after 1985.\n\nThroughout production, the car was generally unchanged, although minor modifications were made to such parts as the hood and wheels. The first production car was completed on January 21, 1981. About 9,000 DeLoreans were made before production halted in late December 1982 shortly after DMC had filed for bankruptcy.\n\n==History==\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 (9979) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A DeLorean with the gull-wing doors closed]]\n[[File:DeLorean DMC-12 with doors open.jpg|thumb|A DeLorean from the front with the gull-wing doors open]]\nIn October 1976, the first prototype DeLorean was completed by American automotive chief engineer William T. Collins, formerly chief engineer at [[Pontiac]].  Originally, the car was intended to have a centrally-mounted [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].  The engine selection was reconsidered when [[Comotor]] production ended, and the favored engine became the [[Ford Cologne V6 engine]].  Eventually the French/Swedish [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[V6 PRV engine]] ([[Peugeot]]-[[Renault]]-[[Volvo]]) was selected.  Also the engine location moved from the mid-engined location in the prototype to a rear-engined installation in the production car.  The [[chassis]] was initially planned to be produced from a new and untested manufacturing technology known as elastic reservoir moulding (ERM), which would lighten the car while presumably lowering its production costs.  This new technology, for which DeLorean had purchased patent rights, was eventually found to be unsuitable.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 38\u201339}}</ref>\n\nThese and other changes to the original concept led to considerable schedule pressures.  The entire car was deemed to require almost complete re-engineering, which was turned over to engineer [[Colin Chapman]], founder of [[Lotus Cars]].  Chapman replaced most of the unproven material and manufacturing techniques with those then employed by Lotus, like the steel backbone chassis.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003| pages = 71\u201375}}</ref>\n\nThe first prototype appeared in October 1976 and was known as the DSV-1, or DeLorean Safety Vehicle.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 23}}</ref> As development continued, the model was referred to as the DSV-12<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| page = 28}}</ref> and later the DMC-12 since DMC was targeting a list price of US$12,000 ({{Inflation|US|12000|1976|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) at release.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |title=DeLorean DMC-12 |access-date=February 3, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204065904/https://www.classic-car-history.com/delorean-car.htm |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html How an immigrant mechanic used $5 million to bring DeLoreans back to the future] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204014534/https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/how-an-immigrant-mechanic-used-5-million-to-bring-deloreans-back-to-the-future.html |date=February 4, 2019 }} Zack Guzman. 3:52 PM ET Wed, November 9, 2016</ref>\n\nIn an interview with James Espey of the new incarnation of the DeLorean Motor Company of [[Texas]], a drawing surfaced showing that the car originally had the potential to be named \"Z Tavio\".

Approximately 100 partially assembled DeLoreans on the production line were completed by [[Big Lots|Consolidated International]].  About 9,000 DeLoreans were produced in total.\n\n==Sales and production==\n===Sales===\nPrior to the release of the DeLorean, there was a waiting list of anxious buyers, many of whom paid over [[List_price#Automobiles/motorcars|MSRP]], however that exuberance subsided very quickly and production output soon far exceeded sales volume.  October 1981 was the highest month of sales for DMC with 720 vehicles sold but by December, the US was falling into recession and interest rates were rising which further negatively impacted sales.  Despite this, instead of reducing production, John DeLorean doubled production output, further adding to the backlog of unsold cars.   By the end of 1981, DMC had produced 7,500 cars but had only sold 3,000.  By this point, DMC was in a financial hardship and in February 1982, DMC was placed into receivership. <ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 130}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1982, unsold 1981 model year cars were \u201cpriced for immediate clearance\u201d in hopes to make room for the more expensive 1982 model year cars.  In March, telegrams were sent to all 343 dealerships requesting each buy six cars to help save the company;  none of the dealers responded with a sales order.  By this point, dealers were sitting on unsold inventory as were the quality assurance centers and hundreds more sitting on the  docks in [[Long Beach]], California.  By the end of May 1982, production at the factory was shut down.  Another attempt in July 1982 was made to revive sales by offering discounts to dealerships and offering a 5-year/{{convert|50000|mi|adj=on}} warranty with the first year or {{convert|12000|mi|adj=on}} portion secured by a major insurance carrier but this was not successful. \n\nBruce McWilliams, VP of Marketing for DMC and later acting President for DMC America, after resigning his position said, \u201cThe car could never be sold in the numbers John DeLorean predicted\u2026\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7 |date= 2003| pages = 133-141}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nProduction information was lost or scattered upon the [[DeLorean Motor Company#Downturn and bankruptcy|shutdown of DMC]] and production figures for the DeLorean have never been verified based on official factory records.  Despite some unexplained VIN gaps, based upon VIN information, owners have been able to piece together the approximate quantity of DeLoreans produced.\n\nIn February 1982, DMC was placed into [[receivership]] and the factory continued to operate at a reduced production rate until the end of May.  When Consolidated International acquired the unsold and partially assembled cars in November 1982, it brought back workers to complete the cars remaining on the assembly line. It was decided to make the remaining completed 1982 model year cars into 1983 models. The remaining cars VINs were re-VINed into 1983 cars by taking the original VIN number and adding 5000 to it and changing the \"CD\" in the middle of the VIN to \"DD\" thus making a 1983 model.\n\nFor the 1981 model year, there were 6,700 DeLoreans produced (VIN 500-7199).  For the 1982 model year, there were 1,999 DeLoreans produced (VIN 10001-11999).  For the 1983 model year, there were 276 DeLoreans (VIN 17000-17170 and 20001-20105) bringing the total estimated production to 8,975 cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |date= 2014 |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9| pages = 115-117}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2007, about 6,500 DeLorean cars were thought to still exist.<ref>{{cite news |first= Martin |last= Zimmerman |url= https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |title= For the DeLorean, it's back to the present |accessdate= January 7, 2013 |work= Los Angeles Times |date= July 28, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130228154343/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-garage28jul28,0,7786124.story?coll=la-home-center |archive-date= February 28, 2013 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThe DeLorean features a number of unusual construction details, including gull-wing doors, unpainted [[stainless-steel]] body panels, and a rear-mounted engine.\n\n===Body===\n[[File:De Lorean DMC-12 at Wollaton Park, Nottingham, England.jpg|thumb|The gull-wing doors on the DeLorean were a distinctive feature.]]\nThe body design of the DeLorean was a product of [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] of [[Italdesign Giugiaro|Ital Design]] and is panelled in brushed [[AISI steel grades#Stainless steel|SS304]] stainless steel.

The underbody is affixed to a steel double-Y frame chassis, inspired by the [[Lotus Esprit]] platform.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe unpainted stainless body creates challenges during [[Automotive restoration|restoration]] of the cars. In traditional automotive body repair, the panel is repaired to be as original (\"straight\") as possible, and imperfections are sculpted back to form with polyester body filler like [[Bondo (putty)|Bondo]] or lead (body [[solder]]). This poses no problem (aside from originality) with most cars, as the filler will be hidden by the car's paint (for example, most new cars have filler hiding the seam where the roof meets the [[quarter panel]]). With an unpainted stainless body, the stainless steel must be reworked to exactly the original shape, contour, and grain, which is a tremendously difficult job on regular steel (a dented or bent panel is stretched, and a shrinking hammer or other techniques must be used to unstretch the metal) and even more difficult with stainless due to its tendency to [[Work hardening|work-harden]]. Furthermore, it is exceedingly difficult to paint stainless steel due to difficulties with paint adhesion. DeLorean envisioned that damaged panels would simply be replaced rather than repaired.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the DeLorean is its [[gull-wing door]]s. The common problem of supporting the weight of gull-wing doors was solved by other manufacturers with lightweight doors in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] and a hydraulic pump in the [[Bricklin SV-1]], although these designs had structural or convenience disadvantages. The DeLorean features heavy doors supported by [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preset [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] and gas-charged [[strut]]s.<ref>{{US patent|4,378,658}}</ref> These torsion bars were developed by [[Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation|Grumman Aerospace]] to withstand the stresses of supporting the doors.<ref>{{cite web |first= Knut |last= Grimsrud |url= http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |work= DeLorean FAQ |title= Exotic Technology |publisher= Dmcnews.com |date=  |accessdate= December 4, 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110511091013/http://www.dmcnews.com/faq/t_tech1.htm |archive-date= May 11, 2011 |url-status= live }}</ref> The DeLorean doors featured small cutout windows, because full-sized windows would not be fully retractable within the short door panels.

All of them noted disappointing performance, especially those that performed comparative tests against other vehicles but were otherwise impressed with the car noting commendable gas mileage and most of them noting that the DeLorean is more of a [[grand tourer|GT]] car rather than a sports car or racecar.\n\nHowever, more recent reviews of the car have been much more harsh.  In 2017, [[Time Magazine]] included the DeLorean on its list of 50 worst cars of all time.<ref>https://time.com/4723114/50-worst-cars-of-all-time/</ref>  In his book ''Naff Motors: 101 Automotive Lemons'', Tony Davis described the build quality as \"woeful\".

Early production cars needed as much as 140-200 hours of work at DMC Quality Assurance Centers prior to being shipped to dealerships for delivery. DMC eventually sent 30 factory workers to the quality centers in the US to learn about the issues and how to fix them.  Quality issues did improve over time and by 1982 many of the quality issues had been resolved.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 83 - 84}}</ref>\n\nA total of four recalls were issued by the factory to correct issues such as a sticking throttle, front suspension issues and an inertia switch. <ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nOther quality issues that plagued the car included other issues surrounding the front suspension, clutch pedal adjustment (or lack thereof), brake rotors, instruments; in particular the [[speedometer]], power door locks and weak alternators.  Many early DeLoreans were delivered with an incorrect alignment with the toe-in incorrectly set leading to premature tire wear. \n\nIn addition, many dealers were reluctant to perform warranty work on DeLoreans since DMC owed them money for past warranty claims that were still unpaid.  Some dealerships were not able to perform repair work properly as DMC never issued a proper service manual.  The lack of quality service at dealerships was a point of frustration for many DeLorean owners at the time, particularly those who paid over sticker price to purchase one of the first cars.<ref>{{Cite book | title = DeLorean Stainless Steel Illusion| author=John Lamm| publisher = Red Lion Press |ISBN=0-9744141-0-7|date= 2003 | pages = 111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n==Pricing and options==\n[[File:1982 De Lorean DMC12 coupe (8453073488).jpg|thumb|1982 DeLorean grey interior]]\n[[File:1981 DeLorean DMC 12 -- Virginia Museum of Transportation - 49374820477.jpg|thumb|1981 DeLorean with optional accent stripe]]\nUpon release in 1981, a DeLorean had a suggested retail price of US$25,000 ($650 more when equipped with an [[automatic transmission]]); this is equivalent to approximately US${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25000|1981}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}.{{inflation-fn|US}}.

This resulted in no clear distinction between the 1981, 1982, and 1983 model years, but with subtle changes taking place almost continuously throughout the life cycle of the DeLorean.\n\n===Hood styles===\nThe original [[hood (vehicle)|hood]] of the DeLorean had [[Groove (machining)|grooves]] running down both sides. It included a tank flap to simplify [[Filling station|fuel filling]]. These cars typically had a locking cap to prevent fuel theft by [[siphon]]ing. In August 1981, the hood flap was removed from the hood of the cars (although the hood creases remained). This style was retained well into 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |title=The DeLorean |publisher=Babb Technology |date=April 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035413/http://babbtechnology.com/thecar/Prod_changes/index.htm |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Based on production numbers for all three years, this hood style is probably the most common. After the supply of locking caps was exhausted, the company switched to a non-locking version (resulting in at least 500 cars with no flap, but with locking caps). The final styling for the hood included the addition of a DeLorean name badge and the removal of the grooves, resulting in a completely flat hood. According to senior personnel who worked at the Dunmurry factory, initial elimination of flapped hoods has a simple if unglamorous explanation; Chuck Benington, managing director, did not like the design.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nick Sutton, Purchasing Manager, Dunmurry factory|url=http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|accessdate=September 17, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402132250/http://dmctalk.org/showthread.php?1412-How-DeLoreans-Were-Originally-Built-Stainless-Panel-Discussion&p=20354&viewfull=1#post20354|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>{{multiple image |align=left |direction=horizontal |total_width=600 |image1=Early 1981 De Lorean hood.jpg |width1=387 |height1=142 |alt1=Early 1981 hood |image2=1983 De Lorean hood.jpg |width2=414 |height2=162 |alt2=1983 hood |footer_align=center |footer=Side-by-side comparison of an early 1981 hood (left) vs. a later model 1983 hood (right)}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Other changes===\nJohn DeLorean was {{height|ft=6|in=4}} tall, and he designed the car to comfortably fit someone of his stature.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|title= The DeLorean's Time Leap|author= Claire Suddath|publisher= [[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date= April 19, 2012|access-date= July 14, 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140706011419/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-19/the-deloreans-time-leap|archive-date= July 6, 2014|url-status= live}}</ref> For shorter people, the addition of a pull strap made closing the doors much easier from the inside.

In cars with this construction, is a tendency to place pressure on this piece when entering and exiting the vehicle, which eventually causes the bolstering to separate from the trim panel.

These wheels sported matching grey centre caps with an embossed DMC logo. Early into the 1981 production run, these were changed to a polished silver look, with a contrasting black center cap. The embossed logo on the center caps was painted silver to add contrast.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 25\u201326}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the DeLorean came with an AM/FM stereo radio with cassette made by Craig. Since the Craig radio did not have a built-in clock, one was installed in front of the [[gear shift]] on the console. DeLorean switched to an ASI stereo in the middle of the 1982 production run. Since the ASI radio featured an on-board clock, the clock on the console was removed at the same time.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 44\u201345}}</ref>\n\nThe first 2,200 cars produced used a windshield-embedded [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]. This type of antenna proved to be unsuitable with poor radio reception. Oftentimes the radio would continually \"seek\", attempting to find a signal. A standard whip antenna, which was later changed to a manually retractable antenna, was added to the outside of the front right fender. While improving radio reception, this resulted in a hole in the stainless steel, and an unsightly antenna. As a result, the antenna was again moved. The final antenna was an automatic retractable version installed under the rear induction grill behind the rear driver's-side window.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Illustrated Buyer's Guide to DeLorean Automobiles | author=James Espey| publisher = DeLorean Garage |ISBN=978-0-9856578-1-9|date= 2014 | pages = 28\u201329}}</ref>\n\nThe small [[visor|sun visors]] on the DeLorean have [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] on one side and headliner [[Textile|fabric]] on the other side.

Beginning with cars built in late 1981, DeLoreans were fitted from the factory with a 90 amp [[Motorola]] alternator, which solved this problem. Additional battery drainage problems were caused by faulty or improperly adjusted door jamb switches. This switch activated the \"safety\" lights located around the door perimeter when it was open. When the door was closed, the door seals prevented the light from being seen. Due to the faulty switches the lights remained on, draining the battery.
