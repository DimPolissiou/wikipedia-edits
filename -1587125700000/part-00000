LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

LucasArts was founded after ''Star Wars'' creator George Lucas took interest in the increasing success of the video game market. Wanting to have more creative control over the games and their narratives, Lucas founded his own video-game development company, LucasArts. During this era, improved video game graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity as the films, with voice-overs and CGI [[cutscene]]s. Lucasfilm had founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and [[World War II]] flight combat games. In 1993, [[LucasArts]] released ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'', the first self-published ''Star Wars'' video game and the first [[space simulator|space flight simulator]] based on the franchise.<ref

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for one side of their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', which also contained one side of new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], Frank Beard's American Blues bandmate, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single, \"[[Francine (song)|Francine]]\".<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for one side of their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'', which also contained one side of new studio songs, was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, would be the band's final album under their contract with London Records.

That site is now called '''Old Iliamna'''. In 1935, the residents of Old Iliamna moved to the present-day location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeandpen.com/residents/about_l_p_b/villages/iliamna/|publisher=[[Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska]]|accessdate=2017-02-05|title=Native Village of Iliamna}}</ref>\n\nThe first sport fishing lodge in Iliamna was built in the 1930s, and the second was built in the 1950s. Many more were built later in the 20th century. Iliamna's economy has two main elements: [[subsistence]] fishing and hunting and [[sport fishing]] lodges. Year-round residents largely pursue subsistence activities, while summer workers from other areas work in the lodges.\n\nAround 1913, Herman Gartelmann, Jack Kinney, and Ed Ahola built a [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] here, taking advantage of air travel through Lake Clark Pass. Jack and Ed were from Old Iliamna village. Frederick Roehl purchased the roadhouse around 1917, and when he died in 1923, Hans Seversen took over and the facility became known as Seversen's Roadhouse. He started hosting [[Big-game hunting|big game hunters]] in 1921 and the first sport fishermen in 1937. Martin Seversen ran the operation from 1946 and put up a new building. Mary Seversen Clark sold the operation in 1956.<ref name=Bo>{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Bo |title=Rods & Wings |date=2000 |publisher=Publication Consultants |location=Anchorage |isbn=9781888125627 |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIliamna faces the prospect of developing into a [[mining town]], as several multi-national companies plan to develop the area northwest of the village into one of North America's largest gold-copper-molybdenum mines. The first company to submit plans to the [[State of Alaska]] is [[Northern Dynasty Minerals]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hunter Dickinson]].

In 1935, the residents of Old Iliamna moved to the present-day location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakeandpen.com/residents/about_l_p_b/villages/iliamna/|publisher=[[Lake and Peninsula Borough, Alaska]]|accessdate=2017-02-05|title=Native Village of Iliamna}}</ref>\n\nThe first sport fishing lodge in Iliamna was built in the 1930s, and the second was built in the 1950s. Many more were built later in the 20th century. Iliamna's economy has two main elements: [[subsistence]] fishing and hunting and [[sport fishing]] lodges. Year-round residents largely pursue subsistence activities, while summer workers from other areas work in the lodges.\n\nAround 1913, Herman Gartelmann, Jack Kinney, and Ed Ahola built a [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]] here, taking advantage of air travel through Lake Clark Pass. Jack and Ed were from Old Iliamna village. Frederick Roehl purchased the roadhouse around 1917, and when he died in 1923, Hans Seversen took over and the facility became known as Seversen's Roadhouse. He started hosting [[Big-game hunting|big game hunters]] in 1921 and the first sport fishermen in 1937. Martin Seversen ran the operation from 1946 and put up a new building. Mary Seversen Clark sold the operation in 1956.<ref name=Bo>{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=Bo |title=Rods & Wings |date=2000 |publisher=Publication Consultants |location=Anchorage |isbn=9781888125627 |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nIliamna faces the prospect of developing into a [[mining town]], as several multi-national companies plan to develop the area northwest of the village into one of North America's largest gold-copper-molybdenum mines. The first company to submit plans to the [[State of Alaska]] is [[Northern Dynasty Minerals]], a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Hunter Dickinson]]. The [[Lake and Peninsula Borough]], the region's governing body, passed a strong resolution in support of the mine's development, but the majority of the surrounding villages adamantly oppose it.
