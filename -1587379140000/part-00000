When infected, the host cell is forced to rapidly produce thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Unlike most [[Organism|living things]], viruses do not have cells that divide; new viruses assemble in the infected host cell. But unlike simpler infectious agents like [[prion]]s, they contain [[Introduction to genetics|genes]], which allow them to mutate and evolve. Over 4,800 species of viruses have been [[List of virus taxa|described in detail]]<ref name=\"pmid29754305\">{{cite journal |vauthors=King AM, Lefkowitz EJ, Mushegian AR, Adams MJ, Dutilh BE, Gorbalenya AE, Harrach B, Harrison RL, Junglen S, Knowles NJ, Kropinski AM, Krupovic M, Kuhn JH, Nibert ML, Rubino L, Sabanadzovic S, Sanfa\u00e7on H, Siddell SG, Simmonds P, Varsani A, Zerbini FM, Davison AJ |title=Changes to taxonomy and the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature ratified by the International Committee Taxonomy of Viruses (2018) |journal=Archives of Virology |volume=163 |issue=9 |pages=2601\u201331 |date=September 2018 |pmid=29754305 |doi=10.1007/s00705-018-3847-1 |url=https://hal-pasteur.archives-ouvertes.fr/pasteur-01977332/file/King2018_Article_ChangesToTaxonomyAndTheInterna.pdf}}</ref> out of the millions in the environment. Their origin is unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from [[bacteria]].\n\nViruses are made of either two or three parts. All include [[gene]]s. These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. All viruses are also covered with a [[protein]] coat to protect the genes. Some viruses may also have an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[Lipid|fat-like substance]] that covers the protein coat, and makes them vulnerable to soap. A virus with this \"viral envelope\" uses it\u2014along with specific [[Cell surface receptor|receptors]]\u2014to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 [[nanometre]]s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm|1}}.\n\nViruses spread in many ways. Although many are very specific about which host species or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] they attack, each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself. [[Plant pathology#Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms|Plant viruses]] are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]''. Some [[Virus#Role in human disease|viruses of humans]] and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as [[norovirus]] are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the [[dengue virus]], are spread by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking insects]].\n\nViruses, especially those made of RNA, can [[Mutation|mutate]] rapidly to give rise to new types. Hosts may have little [[Immunity (medical)|protection]] against such new forms. Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new [[vaccine]] is needed each year. Major changes can cause [[pandemic]]s, as in the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 swine influenza]] that spread to most countries. Often, these mutations take place when the virus has first infected other animal hosts. Some examples of such [[Zoonosis|\"zoonotic\" diseases]] include [[coronavirus]] in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were [[Cross-species transmission|transferred to humans]].\n\nViral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants. In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], which can provide lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s, which work against bacteria, have no impact, but [[antiviral drug]]s can treat life-threatening infections. Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections.\n{{Virus glossary}}\n\n== Discovery ==\n{{Main|History of virology}}\n[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]\n\nIn 1884, French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented the [[Chamberland filter]] (or Chamberland\u2013Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than [[bacteria]]. He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them. In the early 1890s, Russian [[biologist]] [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] used this method to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.<ref>Shors p. 6</ref>\n\nAt the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease. In 1899, Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent only multiplied when in [[cell division|dividing cells]]. He called it a \"contagious living fluid\" ({{lang-la|text= [[contagium vivum fluidum]]}})\u2014or a \"soluble living germ\" because he could not find any germ-like particles.<ref>Collier p. 3</ref> In the early 20th century, English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,<ref>Shors p. 827</ref> and French-Canadian microbiologist [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria.

This lends credence to this theory, as their dependence on being parasites may have led to the loss of the genes that once allowed them to live on their own.<ref>Collier p. 11</ref>\n\n; Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may have evolved from bits of DNA or RNA that \"escaped\" from the genes of a larger organism.

The regressive hypothesis does not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way.

The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.<ref>Shors p. 81</ref>\n\nViruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. In comparison, humans have 20,000\u201325,000. Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle. Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.<ref>Shors p. 129</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome |  journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931\u201345 | pmid = 15496913 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}</ref>\n\nAll cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s that drive chemical reactions. Some of these enzymes, called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]],  make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells,<ref>Shors pp. 129\u201331</ref>  but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains.<ref>Shors p. 652</ref>\n\nIn some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].<ref>Shors p. 654</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components. [[Organelle]]s: (1) [[nucleolus]] (2) [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (3) [[ribosome]] (4) [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] (5) rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) (6) [[Golgi apparatus]] (7) [[cytoskeleton]] (8) smooth ER (9) [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] (10) [[vacuole]] (11) [[cytoplasm]] (12) [[lysosome]] (13) [[centriole]]s within [[centrosome]] (14) a virus shown to approximate scale]]\n\nProteins are essential to life. Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].<ref name=\"pmid25648499\">{{cite journal |vauthors=de Klerk E, 't Hoen PA |title=Alternative mRNA transcription, processing, and translation: insights from RNA sequencing |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=128\u201339 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25648499 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2015.01.001 |url=}}</ref>\n\nTranscription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.<ref name=\"pmid25648499\" />\n\nSome nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.<ref>Collier pp. 75\u201382</ref> In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref>Shors p. 698</ref>\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n{{Main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}\n\n[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus (left to right); following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released.]]\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.<ref>Shors pp. 6\u201313</ref>\n\nThere are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref>Shors pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\n*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.\n*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.\n*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.\n*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.\n*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.\n*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].\n\n== Effects on the host cell ==\nViruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.<ref>Collier pp. 115\u201346</ref> These are called ''[[cytopathic effect]]s''.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell. The causes of death include cell lysis (bursting), alterations to the cell's surface membrane and [[apoptosis]] (cell \"suicide\").<ref name=\"pmid28846635\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Okamoto T, Suzuki T, Kusakabe S, Tokunaga M, Hirano J, Miyata Y, Matsuura Y |title=Regulation of Apoptosis during Flavivirus Infection |journal=Viruses |volume=9 |issue=9 |pages= 243|year= 2017 |pmid=28846635 |pmc=5618009 |doi=10.3390/v9090243}}</ref> Often cell death is caused by cessation of its normal activity due to proteins produced by the virus, not all of which are components of the virus particle.<ref name=\"pmid18637511\">{{cite book | vauthors = Alwine JC | title = Modulation of host cell stress responses by human cytomegalovirus | journal = Curr.

Some virus infections, such as [[norovirus]] and [[rotavirus]], are spread by contaminated food and water, by hands and communal [[fomites|objects]], and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, [[hepatitis B]] and [[hepatitis C]] are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated [[hypodermic needle]]s.

Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called \"[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]\". These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[nematode]] worms and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have also been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 822</ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 802\u201303</ref>\n\n=== Bacteriophages ===\n{{Main|Bacteriophage}}\n\n[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and [[archaea]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families.<ref>{{vcite book |vauthor=Fauquet CM |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}</ref> They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.<ref>Shors p. 803</ref>\n\n=== Host resistance ===\n\n==== Innate immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Innate immunity}}\n\nAnimals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a \"memory\" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus-infected cells.<ref>Shors pp. 116\u201317</ref>\n\n==== Adaptive immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Immune response}}\n[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|left|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]\n\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection. After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.<ref>Shors pp. 225\u201333</ref>\n\n==== Plant resistance ====\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene relationship#Classes of resistance gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref name=\"pmid30201857\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia-Ruiz H |title=Susceptibility Genes to Plant Viruses |journal=Viruses |volume=10 |issue=9 |year= 2018 |pages=484 |pmid=30201857 |pmc=6164914 |doi=10.3390/v10090484}}</ref> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors p. 812</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that destroy viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1239 | vauthors = Soosaar JL, Burch-Smith TM, Dinesh-Kumar SP | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 789\u201398 | pmid = 16132037 }}</ref>\n\n==== Resistance to bacteriophages ====\nThe major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA.

Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which masquerade as DNA building blocks ([[nucleoside]]s). When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of the fake building blocks are used. This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain. When DNA production stops the virus can no longer reproduce.<ref>Shors pp. 514\u201315</ref> Examples of nucleoside analogues are [[aciclovir]] for [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]] infections and [[lamivudine]] for HIV and [[hepatitis B virus]] infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.<ref>Shors p. 514</ref>\n\nOther antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for the virus to become infectious. There is a class of drugs called [[protease inhibitors]], which bind to this enzyme and stop it from functioning.<ref name=\"Shors p. 463\">Shors p. 568</ref>\n\nHepatitis C is caused by an RNA virus. In 80% of those infected, the disease becomes [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]], and they remain infectious for the rest of their lives unless they are treated.

Their origin is unclear: some may have [[evolution|evolved]] from [[plasmid]]s\u2014pieces of DNA that can move between cells\u2014while others may have evolved from [[bacteria]].\n\nViruses are made of either two or three parts. All include [[gene]]s. These genes contain the encoded biological information of the virus and are built from either [[DNA]] or [[RNA]]. All viruses are also covered with a [[protein]] coat to protect the genes. Some viruses may also have an [[viral envelope|envelope]] of [[Lipid|fat-like substance]] that covers the protein coat, and makes them vulnerable to soap. A virus with this \"viral envelope\" uses it\u2014along with specific [[Cell surface receptor|receptors]]\u2014to enter a new host cell. Viruses vary in shape from the simple [[tobacco mosaic virus|helical]] and [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] to more [[bacteriophage|complex]] structures. Viruses range in size from 20 to 300 [[nanometre]]s; it would take 33,000 to 500,000 of them, side by side, to stretch to {{convert|1|cm|1}}.\n\nViruses spread in many ways. Although many are very specific about which host species or [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] they attack, each [[species]] of virus relies on a particular method to copy itself. [[Plant pathology#Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms|Plant viruses]] are often spread from plant to plant by insects and other [[organism]]s, known as ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]''. Some [[Virus#Role in human disease|viruses of humans]] and other animals are spread by exposure to infected bodily fluids. Viruses such as [[influenza]] are spread through the air by droplets of moisture when people cough or sneeze. Viruses such as [[norovirus]] are transmitted by the [[fecal\u2013oral route|faecal\u2013oral route]], which involves the contamination of hands, food and water. [[Rotavirus]] is often spread by direct contact with infected children. The human immunodeficiency virus, [[HIV]], is transmitted by bodily fluids transferred during sex. Others, such as the [[dengue virus]], are spread by [[Hematophagy|blood-sucking insects]].\n\nViruses, especially those made of RNA, can [[Mutation|mutate]] rapidly to give rise to new types. Hosts may have little [[Immunity (medical)|protection]] against such new forms. Influenza virus, for example, changes often, so a new [[vaccine]] is needed each year. Major changes can cause [[pandemic]]s, as in the [[2009 flu pandemic|2009 swine influenza]] that spread to most countries. Often, these mutations take place when the virus has first infected other animal hosts. Some examples of such [[Zoonosis|\"zoonotic\" diseases]] include [[coronavirus]] in bats, and influenza in pigs and birds, before those viruses were [[Cross-species transmission|transferred to humans]].\n\nViral infections can cause disease in humans, animals and plants. In healthy humans and animals, infections are usually eliminated by the [[immune system]], which can provide lifetime [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the host for that virus. [[Antibiotic]]s, which work against bacteria, have no impact, but [[antiviral drug]]s can treat life-threatening infections. Those vaccines that produce lifelong immunity can prevent some infections.\n{{Virus glossary}}\n\n== Discovery ==\n{{Main|History of virology}}\n[[File:HIV-budding-Color cropped.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail|[[Scanning electron microscope|Scanning electron micrograph]] of HIV-1 viruses, coloured green, budding from a [[lymphocyte]]]]\n\nIn 1884, French [[microbiologist]] [[Charles Chamberland]] invented the [[Chamberland filter]] (or Chamberland\u2013Pasteur filter), that contains pores smaller than [[bacteria]]. He could then pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter, and completely remove them. In the early 1890s, Russian [[biologist]] [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]] used this method to study what became known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that extracts from the crushed leaves of infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.<ref>Shors p. 6</ref>\n\nAt the same time, several other scientists showed that, although these agents (later called viruses) were different from bacteria and about one hundred times smaller, they could still cause disease. In 1899, Dutch microbiologist [[Martinus Beijerinck]] observed that the agent only multiplied when in [[cell division|dividing cells]]. He called it a \"contagious living fluid\" ({{lang-la|text= [[contagium vivum fluidum]]}})\u2014or a \"soluble living germ\" because he could not find any germ-like particles.<ref>Collier p. 3</ref> In the early 20th century, English [[bacteriologist]] [[Frederick Twort]] discovered viruses that infect bacteria,<ref>Shors p. 827</ref> and French-Canadian microbiologist [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] described viruses that, when added to bacteria growing on [[agar]], would lead to the formation of whole areas of dead bacteria.

The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA or RNA. Most organisms use DNA, but [[RNA virus|many viruses]] have RNA as their genetic material. The DNA or RNA of viruses consists of either a single strand or a double helix.<ref>Shors p. 81</ref>\n\nViruses can reproduce rapidly because they have relatively few genes. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and [[rotavirus]] has eleven. In comparison, humans have 20,000\u201325,000. Some viral genes contain the code to make the structural proteins that form the virus particle. Other genes make non-structural proteins found only in the cells the virus infects.<ref>Shors p. 129</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 | last1 = International Human | first1 = Genome Sequencing Consortium | year = 2004 | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome |  journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011| pages = 931\u201345 | pmid = 15496913 |bibcode = 2004Natur.431..931H }}</ref>\n\nAll cells, and many viruses, produce proteins that are [[enzyme]]s that drive chemical reactions. Some of these enzymes, called [[DNA polymerase]] and [[RNA polymerase]],  make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often much more efficient at making DNA and RNA than the equivalent enzymes of the host cells,<ref>Shors pp. 129\u201331</ref>  but viral RNA polymerase enzymes are error-prone, causing RNA viruses to mutate and form new strains.<ref>Shors p. 652</ref>\n\nIn some species of RNA virus, the genes are not on a continuous molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA. When two different strains of influenza virus infect the same cell, these genes can mix and produce new strains of the virus in a process called [[reassortment]].<ref>Shors p. 654</ref>\n\n=== Protein synthesis ===\n[[File:Cell with Virus.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of a typical [[eukaryotic]] cell, showing subcellular components.

Cells produce new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information coded in DNA. Each type of protein is a specialist that usually only performs one function, so if a cell needs to do something new, it must make a new protein. Viruses force the cell to make new proteins that the cell does not need, but are needed for the virus to reproduce. [[Protein biosynthesis|Protein synthesis]] consists of two major steps: [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]].<ref name=\"pmid25648499\">{{cite journal |vauthors=de Klerk E, 't Hoen PA |title=Alternative mRNA transcription, processing, and translation: insights from RNA sequencing |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=128\u201339 |date=March 2015 |pmid=25648499 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2015.01.001 |url=}}</ref>\n\nTranscription is the process where information in DNA, called the [[genetic code]], is used to produce RNA copies called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to [[ribosome]]s where it is used to make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence translated from the language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.<ref name=\"pmid25648499\" />\n\nSome nucleic acids of RNA viruses function directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses.<ref>Collier pp. 75\u201382</ref> In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses rely on the cell's or their own enzyme to make mRNA. These are called [[Sense (molecular biology)|negative-sense]] RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production is similar to that of the cell. The species of viruses called [[retrovirus]]es behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme [[reverse transcriptase]]. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.<ref>Shors p. 698</ref>\n\n== Life-cycle ==\n{{Main|Viral life cycle|Viral entry}}\n\n[[File:HepC replication.png|thumb|Life-cycle of a typical virus (left to right); following infection of a cell by a single virus, hundreds of offspring are released.]]\n\nWhen a virus infects a cell, the virus forces it to make thousands more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.<ref>Shors pp. 6\u201313</ref>\n\nThere are six basic, overlapping stages in the life cycle of viruses in living cells:<ref>Shors pp. 121\u201323</ref>\n\n*'''Attachment''' is the binding of the virus to specific molecules on the surface of the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human [[T cell]]s, because its surface protein, [[gp120]], can only react with [[CD4]] and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot infect animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only infect cells in which they are capable of reproducing.\n*'''Penetration''' follows attachment; viruses penetrate the host cell by [[endocytosis]] or by fusion with the cell.\n*'''Uncoating''' happens inside the cell when the viral capsid is removed and destroyed by viral enzymes or host enzymes, thereby exposing the viral nucleic acid.\n*'''Replication''' of virus particles is the stage where a cell uses viral messenger RNA in its protein synthesis systems to produce viral proteins. The RNA or DNA synthesis abilities of the cell produce the virus's DNA or RNA.\n*'''Assembly''' takes place in the cell when the newly created viral proteins and nucleic acid combine to form hundreds of new virus particles.\n*'''Release''' occurs when the new viruses escape or are released from the cell. Most viruses achieve this by making the cells burst, a process called [[lysis]]. Other viruses such as HIV are released more gently by a process called [[viral shedding#Via budding|budding]].\n\n== Effects on the host cell ==\nViruses have an extensive range of structural and biochemical effects on the host cell.<ref>Collier pp. 115\u201346</ref> These are called ''[[cytopathic effect]]s''.<ref>Collier p. 115</ref> Most virus infections eventually result in the death of the host cell.

Plant viruses are frequently spread from plant to plant by organisms called \"[[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]]\". These are normally insects, but some [[fungi]], [[nematode]] worms and [[protozoa|single-celled organisms]] have also been shown to be vectors. When control of plant virus infections is considered economical (perennial fruits, for example) efforts are concentrated on killing the vectors and removing alternate hosts such as weeds.<ref>Shors p. 822</ref> Plant viruses are harmless to humans and other animals because they can only reproduce in living plant cells.<ref>Shors pp. 802\u201303</ref>\n\n=== Bacteriophages ===\n{{Main|Bacteriophage}}\n\n[[File:PhageExterior.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The structure of a typical bacteriophage]]\n\nBacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and [[archaea]]. The [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] officially recognises 28 genera of bacteriophages that belong to 11 families.<ref>{{vcite book |vauthor=Fauquet CM |title=Desk Encyclopedia of General Virology|publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=2009 |page=82 |isbn=978-0-12-375146-1}}</ref> They are important in [[marine ecology]]: as the infected bacteria burst, carbon compounds are released back into the environment, which stimulates fresh organic growth. Bacteriophages are useful in scientific research because they are harmless to humans and can be studied easily. These viruses can be a problem in industries that produce food and drugs by [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] and depend on healthy bacteria. Some bacterial infections are becoming difficult to control with antibiotics, so there is a growing interest in the use of bacteriophages to treat infections in humans.<ref>Shors p. 803</ref>\n\n=== Host resistance ===\n\n==== Innate immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Innate immunity}}\n\nAnimals, including humans, have many natural defences against viruses. Some are non-specific and protect against many viruses regardless of the type. This [[innate]] immunity is not improved by repeated exposure to viruses and does not retain a \"memory\" of the infection. The skin of animals, particularly its surface, which is made from dead cells, prevents many types of viruses from infecting the host. The acidity of the contents of the stomach destroys many viruses that have been swallowed. When a virus overcomes these barriers and enters the host, other innate defences prevent the spread of infection in the body. A special hormone called [[interferon]] is produced by the body when viruses are present, and this stops the viruses from reproducing by killing the infected cells and their close neighbours. Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called [[RNA interference]]. Some blood cells [[phagocytosis|engulf]] and destroy other virus-infected cells.<ref>Shors pp. 116\u201317</ref>\n\n==== Adaptive immunity of animals ====\n{{Main|Immune response}}\n[[File:Rotavirus with antibody.jpg|thumb|left|Two rotavirus particles: the one on the right is coated with antibodies which stop its attaching to cells and infecting them]]\n\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called [[lymphocyte]]s play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called [[antibody|antibodies]]. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection. After the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, usually giving the host lifelong immunity to the virus.<ref>Shors pp. 225\u201333</ref>\n\n==== Plant resistance ====\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called [[Gene-for-gene relationship#Classes of resistance gene|resistance (R) genes]]. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading.<ref name=\"pmid30201857\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Garcia-Ruiz H |title=Susceptibility Genes to Plant Viruses |journal=Viruses |volume=10 |issue=9 |year= 2018 |pages=484 |pmid=30201857 |pmc=6164914 |doi=10.3390/v10090484}}</ref> RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants.<ref>Shors p. 812</ref> When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that destroy viruses, such as [[salicylic acid]], [[nitric oxide]] and [[Reactive oxygen species|reactive oxygen molecules]].<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro1239 | vauthors = Soosaar JL, Burch-Smith TM, Dinesh-Kumar SP | year = 2005 | title = Mechanisms of plant resistance to viruses | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology  | volume = 3 | issue = 10| pages = 789\u201398 | pmid = 16132037 }}</ref>\n\n==== Resistance to bacteriophages ====\nThe major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA.

Antiviral drugs are often [[nucleoside analogue]]s, which masquerade as DNA building blocks ([[nucleoside]]s). When the replication of virus DNA begins, some of the fake building blocks are used. This prevents DNA replication because the drugs lack the essential features that allow the formation of a DNA chain. When DNA production stops the virus can no longer reproduce.<ref>Shors pp. 514\u201315</ref> Examples of nucleoside analogues are [[aciclovir]] for [[Herpesviridae|herpes virus]] infections and [[lamivudine]] for HIV and [[hepatitis B virus]] infections. Aciclovir is one of the oldest and most frequently prescribed antiviral drugs.<ref>Shors p. 514</ref>\n\nOther antiviral drugs target different stages of the viral life cycle. HIV is dependent on an enzyme called the [[HIV-1 protease]] for the virus to become infectious.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale wired on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' just billionaires it when I get [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, know them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics.

Kreisberg said, \"There are so many characters in the DC Universe who haven't gotten their due in TV and film.

We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

The series premiered in the United States on [[The CW]] on October 10, 2012, and was primarily filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. In January 2019, The CW renewed the series for a ten-episode [[Arrow (season 8)|eighth season]] announcing in March that it would be the series finale. The season premiered on October 15, 2019 and featured the \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\" crossover event; the series finale aired on January 28, 2020.\n\n''Arrow'' follows billionaire playboy [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] ([[Stephen Amell]]), who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on [[Lian Yu (Arrowverse location)|Lian Yu]], a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to [[Starling City]] (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|John Diggle]] ([[David Ramsey]]), I.T. expert and skilled hacker [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]] ([[Emily Bett Rickards]]), former assassin [[Sara Lance]] ([[Caity Lotz]]), aspiring vigilante [[Roy Harper (Arrowverse)|Roy Harper]] ([[Colton Haynes]]), Oliver's sister [[Thea Queen|Thea]] ([[Willa Holland]]), and attorney-turned-vigilante [[Laurel Lance (Arrowverse)|Laurel Lance]] ([[Katie Cassidy]]). During the first five seasons of the show, characters from Oliver's past appear in a separate story arc based on Oliver's flashbacks. Starting with season seven, a series of flash-forwards focus on Oliver's children [[William Clayton (Arrowverse)|William]] and [[Mia Smoak|Mia]], exploring how present events would affect their future and Green Arrow's legacy.\n\nThe series takes a new look at the Green Arrow character, as well as other characters from the DC Comics universe. Although [[Oliver Queen (Smallville)|Oliver Queen / Green Arrow]] had been featured in the television series ''[[Smallville]]'' from 2006 to 2011, on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. ''Arrow'' has received generally positive reviews from critics.

Kreisberg said, \"There are so many characters in the DC Universe who haven't gotten their due in TV and film.

We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling.

''Arrow 2.5'' is intended to tell one continuous story across two arcs, that fits within the television narrative. Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"<ref name=\"Comic2.5\" /> On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what ''Season 2.5'' is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations such as [[Kahndaq]] that cannot be recreated on the show. Additionally, the series has one to two pages each issue dedicated to the Suicide Squad, leading up to their own issue later in the run.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |title='Arrow: Season 2.5' Reveals Hidden Story Between TV Seasons |last=McMillan |first=Graeme |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 29, 2014 |access-date=August 31, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140831102704/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/arrow-season-25-reveals-hidden-729128 |archive-date=August 31, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.<ref name=\"NerdistComic\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nerdist.com/2014/09/exclusive-arrow-showrunner-marc-guggenheim-on-the-arrow-season-2-5-digital-comic/ |title=Exclusive: Arrow Showrunner Marc Guggenheim On The Arrow: Season 2.

A full proof of necessity was given by [[Pierre Wantzel]]. See the [[Constructible polygon]] article for further discussion.}} This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.\nGauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<ref>Pappas, Theoni, ''Mathematical Snippets'', 2008, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Carl Friedrich Gauss \u00a7\u00a7365\u2013366 in ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''. Leipzig, Germany, 1801. New Haven, CT: [[Yale University Press]], 1965.</ref> He further advanced [[modular arithmetic]], greatly simplifying manipulations in number theory. On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.\n\nGauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the note: \"[[Eureka (word)|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0397\u039a\u0391]]! {{nowrap|num {{=}} \u0394 + \u0394' + \u0394\"}}. On 1 October he published a result on the number of solutions of polynomials with coefficients in [[finite field]]s, which 150 years later led to the [[Weil conjectures]].\n\n=== Later years and death ===\n[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss on his Deathbed, 1855.jpg|thumb|Gauss on his deathbed (1855)]]\n[[File:Grave of Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df at Albani-Friedhof G\u00f6ttingen 2017 02.jpg|thumb|Gauss's gravesite at [[Albanifriedhof|Albani Cemetery]] in [[G\u00f6ttingen]], Germany]]\nGauss remained mentally active into his old age, even while suffering from [[gout]] and general unhappiness.<ref name=\":4\" /> For example, at the age of 62, he taught himself Russian.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nIn 1840, Gauss published his influential ''Dioptrische Untersuchungen'',<ref name=\"B\u00fchler1\">{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=B\u00fchler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|pages=144\u2013145}}</ref> in which he gave the first systematic analysis on the formation of images under a [[paraxial approximation]] ([[Gaussian optics]]).<ref name=Hecht>{{Cite book|title=Optics|first=Eugene|last=Hecht|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1987|isbn=978-0-201-11609-0|ref=harv|page=134}}</ref> Among his results, Gauss showed that under a paraxial approximation an optical system can be characterized by its [[Cardinal point (optics)|cardinal points]]<ref name=Bass>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Optics| first1=Michael|last1=Bass|first2=Casimer|last2=DeCusatis| first3=Jay|last3=Enoch|first4=Vasudevan|last4=Lakshminarayanan|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|year=2009|isbn=978-0-07-149889-0|ref=harv|page=17.7}}</ref> and he derived the Gaussian lens formula.<ref name=Ostdiek>{{Cite book|title=Inquiry into Physics |first1=Vern J. |last1=Ostdiek|first2=Donald J.|last2=Bord|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=978-0-495-11943-2|ref=harv|page=381}}</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he became an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands; when that became the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1851, he joined as a foreign member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000342 |title=C.F.

Waldo Dunnington]], described Gauss's religious views as follows:\n<blockquote>For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength, it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life, it brought him confidence. Gauss's God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report the truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|pp=298\u2013301}}</blockquote>\n\nApart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss's personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with B\u00fchler and others considering him a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox views,<ref name=Buhler3/><ref name=\"Gerhard Falk 1995 121\">{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|url=https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk/page/121 121]|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not fully believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet.

Despite his religious beliefs. Despite his strong roots in the Enlightenment, Gauss was not an atheist, rather a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox convictions, unorthodox even if measured against the very liberal persuasions of the contemporary Protestant church.}}</ref> while Dunnington (though admitting that Gauss did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas and that it is unknown what he believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions) points out that he was, at least, a nominal [[Lutheran]].{{efn|{{harvnb| Dunnington|2004|p=305}} writes \"It is not known just what Gauss believed on most doctrinal and confessional questions. He did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas. Officially he was a member of St. Albans Church (Evangelical Lutheran) in Gottingen. All baptisms, burials, and weddings in his family occurred there. It is also not known whether he attended church regularly or contributed financially. A faculty colleague called Gauss a deist, but there is good reason to believe that this label did not fit well. Gauss possessed strong religious tolerance which he carried over to every belief originating in the depths of the human heart. This tolerance is not to be confused with religious indifference. He took a special interest in the religious development of the human race, especially in his own century. With reference to the manifold denominations, which frequently did not agree with his views, he always emphasized that one is not justified in disturbing the faith of others in which they find consolation for earthly sufferings and a safe refuge in days of misfortune\"}}\n\nIn connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Gauss, in which they discussed [[William Whewell]]'s book ''Of the Plurality of Worlds''. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he \"envied\" those who were able to easily believe.<ref name=Buhler3>{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=B\u00fchler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|page=153}}</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Dunnington|2004|p=305}} quotes: \"league, I believe you are more believing in the Bible than I. I am not, and, he added, with the expression of great inner emotion, you are much happier than I. I must say that so often in earlier times when I saw people of the lower classes, simple manual laborers who could believe so rightly with their hearts, I always envied them, and now, he continued, with soft voice and that naive childlike manner peculiar to him, while a tear came to his eye, tell me how does one begin this?...\"}} This later led them to discuss the topic of [[faith]], and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister [[Paul Gerhardt]] than by [[Moses]].{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=356|ps=: \"I must confess that such old theologians and song writers as Paul Gerhard have always made a great impression on me; a song by Paul Gerhard always exerted a wonderful power on me, much more than, for example, Moses, against whom as a man of God I have all sorts of qualms.\"}} Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, [[Johann Peter S\u00fcssmilch]], and the [[New Testament]]. Two religious works which Gauss read frequently were Braubach's ''Seelenlehre'' (Giessen, 1843) and Siissmilch's ''Gottliche'' (Ordnung gerettet A756); he also devoted considerable time to the New Testament in the original Greek.{{sfn| Dunnington|2004|p=305}}\n\nDunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing: <blockquote>Gauss's religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=300}}</blockquote>\n\nGauss declared he firmly believed in the [[afterlife]], and saw spirituality as something essentially important for human beings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-503085-3|author=Morris Kline|page=73}}</ref> He was quoted stating: ''\"The world would be nonsense, the whole creation an absurdity without immortality,\"''{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=357}} and for this statement he was severely criticized by the atheist [[Karl Eugen D\u00fchring|Eugen D\u00fchring]] who judged him as a narrow superstitious man.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=359}}\n\nThough he was not a church-goer,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauss, Carl Friedrich|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.aspx|publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2008|quote=In seeming contradiction, his religious and philosophical views leaned toward those of his political opponents.

He did not want any of his sons to enter mathematics or science for \"fear of lowering the family name\", as he believed none of them would surpass his own achievements.<ref name=\"gausschildren\" /> Gauss wanted Eugene to become a lawyer, but Eugene wanted to study languages. They had an argument over a party Eugene held, which Gauss refused to pay for. The son left in anger and, in about 1832, emigrated to the United States. While working for the American Fur Company in the Midwest, he learned the Sioux language. Later, he moved to [[Missouri]] and became a successful businessman. Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' (\"few, but ripe\"). His personal diaries indicate that he had made several important mathematical discoveries years or decades before his contemporaries published them. Scottish-American mathematician and writer [[Eric Temple Bell]] said that if Gauss had published all of his discoveries in a timely manner, he would have advanced mathematics by fifty years.<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Bell |first=E.T.\n |chapter=Ch. 14: The Prince of Mathematicians: Gauss\n |title=Men of Mathematics: The Lives and Achievements of the Great Mathematicians from Zeno to Poincar\u00e9\n |location=New York\n |publisher=Simon and Schuster\n |pages=218\u2013269\n |year=2009\n |isbn=978-0-671-46400-4\n }}</ref>\n\nThough he did take in a few students, Gauss was known to dislike teaching. It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]].\n\nOn Gauss's recommendation, [[Friedrich Bessel]] was awarded an honorary doctor degree from G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811.<ref>Bessel never had a university education.</ref> Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.<ref>Helmut Koch, ''Introduction to Classical Mathematics I: From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law to the Uniformization Theorem'', Springer, p. 90.</ref> However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are unknown.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.</ref>\n\nBefore she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive an honorary degree; she never received it.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\".

When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=416}}</blockquote>\n\n== Career and achievements ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Algebra===\n[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's magnum opus, ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]\nIn his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.\n\nGauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol {{math|\u2261}} for [[Congruence relation|congruence]] and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]]. It appears that Gauss already knew the [[class number formula]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Gauss know Dirichlet's class number formula in 1801? |work=[[MathOverflow]] |date=10 October 2012 |url=https://mathoverflow.net/q/109330 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems:\n* [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]] for ''n'' = 3\n* [[Fermat's last theorem]] for ''n'' = 5\n* [[Descartes's rule of signs]]\n* [[Kepler conjecture]] for regular arrangements\n\nHe also\n* explained the [[pentagramma mirificum]] (see [https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~sek/cluster/pentagramma/ University of Bielefeld website])\n* developed an algorithm for determining the [[Computus#Gauss algorithm|date of Easter]]\n* invented the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]] for calculating the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s 160 years before Cooley and Tukey\n\n===Astronomy===\n[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df, 1828.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Gauss published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' (1828)]]\nIn the same year, Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data\u2014three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801\u2014just about a year after its first sighting\u2014and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Gauss's method]] involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Second Law]]). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=978-0-915692-28-6|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}</ref>\n\nOne such method was the [[fast Fourier transform]].

Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[G\u00f6ttingen Observatory|observatory in G\u00f6ttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.\n\n[[File:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|Four [[normal distribution]]s]]\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.<ref>Felix Klein, Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Entwicklung der Mathematik im 19.

The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 81.</ref> In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.\"<ref>Stephen M.

To aid the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.\n\n===Non-Euclidean geometries===\nGauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.\n\nResearch on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.\n\nBolyai's son, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"\n\nThis unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was \"stealing\" his idea.<ref name=\"Krantz2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven G.

Among other things, he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]].\nThis led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem''), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface.\n\nThat is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.\n\nIn 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833,<ref name=\":4\" /> which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\" (''magnetic association''), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe British mathematician [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] (1826\u20131883) gave the following appraisal of Gauss:\n{{block quote|If we except the great name of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied. It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty. Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss's claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.<ref>H.J.S Smith,''Presidential Address'', Proceedings of the London Math. Soc. VIII, 18.</ref>}}\n\n== Anecdotes ==\nThere are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.\n\nAnother story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, gave him a task: add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].\n\nGauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;98&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, and so on, for a [[Triangular number|total sum]] of 50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;101&nbsp;=&nbsp;5050.\nHowever, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see<ref name=\"hayesreckoning\" /> for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.\n\nHe referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\"<ref>Quoted in Waltershausen, Wolfgang Sartorius von (1856, repr. 1965).

A full proof of necessity was given by [[Pierre Wantzel]]. See the [[Constructible polygon]] article for further discussion.}} This was a major discovery in an important field of mathematics; construction problems had occupied mathematicians since the days of the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and the discovery ultimately led Gauss to choose mathematics instead of [[philology]] as a career.\nGauss was so pleased with this result that he requested that a regular [[heptadecagon]] be inscribed on his tombstone. The [[stone masonry|stonemason]] declined, stating that the difficult construction would essentially look like a circle.<ref>Pappas, Theoni, ''Mathematical Snippets'', 2008, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe year 1796 was productive for both Gauss and number theory. He discovered a construction of the heptadecagon on 30 March.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Carl Friedrich Gauss \u00a7\u00a7365\u2013366 in ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]''. Leipzig, Germany, 1801.

On 8 April he became the first to prove the [[quadratic reciprocity]] law. This remarkably general law allows mathematicians to determine the solvability of any quadratic equation in modular arithmetic. The [[prime number theorem]], conjectured on 31 May, gives a good understanding of how the [[prime number]]s are distributed among the integers.\n\nGauss also discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of at most three [[triangular number]]s on 10 July and then jotted down in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the note: \"[[Eureka (word)|\u0395\u03a5\u03a1\u0397\u039a\u0391]]! {{nowrap|num {{=}} \u0394 + \u0394' + \u0394\"}}.

Waldo Dunnington]], described Gauss's religious views as follows:\n<blockquote>For him science was the means of exposing the immortal nucleus of the human soul. In the days of his full strength, it furnished him recreation and, by the prospects which it opened up to him, gave consolation. Toward the end of his life, it brought him confidence. Gauss's God was not a cold and distant figment of metaphysics, nor a distorted caricature of embittered theology. To man is not vouchsafed that fullness of knowledge which would warrant his arrogantly holding that his blurred vision is the full light and that there can be none other which might report the truth as does his. For Gauss, not he who mumbles his creed, but he who lives it, is accepted. He believed that a life worthily spent here on earth is the best, the only, preparation for heaven. Religion is not a question of literature, but of life. God's revelation is continuous, not contained in tablets of stone or sacred parchment. A book is inspired when it inspires. The unshakeable idea of personal continuance after death, the firm belief in a last regulator of things, in an eternal, just, omniscient, omnipotent God, formed the basis of his religious life, which harmonized completely with his scientific research.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|pp=298\u2013301}}</blockquote>\n\nApart from his correspondence, there are not many known details about Gauss's personal creed. Many biographers of Gauss disagree about his religious stance, with B\u00fchler and others considering him a [[deism|deist]] with very unorthodox views,<ref name=Buhler3/><ref name=\"Gerhard Falk 1995 121\">{{cite book|title=American Judaism in Transition: The Secularization of a Religious Community|url=https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk|url-access=registration|year=1995|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=978-0-7618-0016-3|author=Gerhard Falk|page=[https://archive.org/details/americanjudaismi00falk/page/121 121]|quote=Gauss told his friend Rudolf Wagner, a professor of biology at Gottingen University, that he did not fully believe in the Bible but that he had meditated a great deal on the future of the human soul and speculated on the possibility of the soul being reincarnated on another planet.

He did not believe literally in all Christian dogmas. Officially he was a member of St. Albans Church (Evangelical Lutheran) in Gottingen. All baptisms, burials, and weddings in his family occurred there. It is also not known whether he attended church regularly or contributed financially. A faculty colleague called Gauss a deist, but there is good reason to believe that this label did not fit well. Gauss possessed strong religious tolerance which he carried over to every belief originating in the depths of the human heart. This tolerance is not to be confused with religious indifference. He took a special interest in the religious development of the human race, especially in his own century. With reference to the manifold denominations, which frequently did not agree with his views, he always emphasized that one is not justified in disturbing the faith of others in which they find consolation for earthly sufferings and a safe refuge in days of misfortune\"}}\n\nIn connection to this, there is a record of a conversation between [[Rudolf Wagner]] and Gauss, in which they discussed [[William Whewell]]'s book ''Of the Plurality of Worlds''. In this work, Whewell had discarded the possibility of existing life in other planets, on the basis of theological arguments, but this was a position with which both Wagner and Gauss disagreed. Later Wagner explained that he did not fully believe in the Bible, though he confessed that he \"envied\" those who were able to easily believe.<ref name=Buhler3>{{Cite book|title=Gauss: a biographical study|first=Walter Kaufmann|last=B\u00fchler|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1987|isbn=978-0-387-10662-5|ref=harv|page=153}}</ref>{{efn|{{harvnb|Dunnington|2004|p=305}} quotes: \"league, I believe you are more believing in the Bible than I.

I must say that so often in earlier times when I saw people of the lower classes, simple manual laborers who could believe so rightly with their hearts, I always envied them, and now, he continued, with soft voice and that naive childlike manner peculiar to him, while a tear came to his eye, tell me how does one begin this?...\"}} This later led them to discuss the topic of [[faith]], and in some other religious remarks, Gauss said that he had been more influenced by theologians like Lutheran minister [[Paul Gerhardt]] than by [[Moses]].{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=356|ps=: \"I must confess that such old theologians and song writers as Paul Gerhard have always made a great impression on me; a song by Paul Gerhard always exerted a wonderful power on me, much more than, for example, Moses, against whom as a man of God I have all sorts of qualms.\"}} Other religious influences included Wilhelm Braubach, [[Johann Peter S\u00fcssmilch]], and the [[New Testament]]. Two religious works which Gauss read frequently were Braubach's ''Seelenlehre'' (Giessen, 1843) and Siissmilch's ''Gottliche'' (Ordnung gerettet A756); he also devoted considerable time to the New Testament in the original Greek.{{sfn| Dunnington|2004|p=305}}\n\nDunnington further elaborates on Gauss's religious views by writing: <blockquote>Gauss's religious consciousness was based on an insatiable thirst for truth and a deep feeling of justice extending to intellectual as well as material goods. He conceived spiritual life in the whole universe as a great system of law penetrated by eternal truth, and from this source he gained the firm confidence that death does not end all.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=300}}</blockquote>\n\nGauss declared he firmly believed in the [[afterlife]], and saw spirituality as something essentially important for human beings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-503085-3|author=Morris Kline|page=73}}</ref> He was quoted stating: ''\"The world would be nonsense, the whole creation an absurdity without immortality,\"''{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=357}} and for this statement he was severely criticized by the atheist [[Karl Eugen D\u00fchring|Eugen D\u00fchring]] who judged him as a narrow superstitious man.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=359}}\n\nThough he was not a church-goer,<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauss, Carl Friedrich|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss.aspx|publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography|accessdate=29 July 2012|year=2008|quote=In seeming contradiction, his religious and philosophical views leaned toward those of his political opponents.

Wilhelm also moved to America in 1837 and settled in Missouri, starting as a farmer and later becoming wealthy in the shoe business in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]].

He was never a prolific writer, refusing to publish work which he did not consider complete and above criticism. This was in keeping with his personal motto ''pauca sed matura'' (\"few, but ripe\").

It is said that he attended only a single scientific conference, which was in [[Berlin]] in 1828. However, several of his students became influential mathematicians, among them [[Richard Dedekind]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]].\n\nOn Gauss's recommendation, [[Friedrich Bessel]] was awarded an honorary doctor degree from G\u00f6ttingen in March 1811.<ref>Bessel never had a university education.</ref> Around that time, the two men engaged in an epistolary correspondence.<ref>Helmut Koch, ''Introduction to Classical Mathematics I: From the Quadratic Reciprocity Law to the Uniformization Theorem'', Springer, p. 90.</ref> However, when they met in person in 1825, they quarrelled; the details are unknown.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 88.</ref>\n\nBefore she died, [[Sophie Germain]] was recommended by Gauss to receive an honorary degree; she never received it.<ref>Mackinnon, Nick (1990). \"Sophie Germain, or, Was Gauss a feminist?\".

When I have clarified and exhausted a subject, then I turn away from it, in order to go into darkness again. The never-satisfied man is so strange; if he has completed a structure, then it is not in order to dwell in it peacefully, but in order to begin another. I imagine the world conqueror must feel thus, who, after one kingdom is scarcely conquered, stretches out his arms for others.{{sfn|Dunnington|2004|p=416}}</blockquote>\n\n== Career and achievements ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2012}}\n\n===Algebra===\n[[File:Disqvisitiones-800.jpg|thumb|Title page of Gauss's magnum opus, ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'']]\nIn his 1799 doctorate in absentia, ''A new proof of the theorem that every integral rational algebraic function of one variable can be resolved into real factors of the first or second degree'', Gauss proved the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that every non-constant single-variable [[polynomial]] with complex coefficients has at least one complex [[root of a function|root]]. Mathematicians including [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] had produced false proofs before him, and Gauss's dissertation contains a critique of d'Alembert's work. Ironically, by today's standard, Gauss's own attempt is not acceptable, owing to the implicit use of the [[Jordan curve theorem]]. However, he subsequently produced three other proofs, the last one in 1849 being generally rigorous. His attempts clarified the concept of complex numbers considerably along the way.\n\nGauss also made important contributions to [[number theory]] with his 1801 book ''[[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]'' ([[Latin]], Arithmetical Investigations), which, among other things, introduced the symbol {{math|\u2261}} for [[Congruence relation|congruence]] and used it in a clean presentation of [[modular arithmetic]], contained the first two proofs of the law of [[quadratic reciprocity]], developed the theories of binary and ternary [[quadratic form]]s, stated the [[class number problem]] for them, and showed that a regular [[heptadecagon]] (17-sided polygon) can be [[Compass and straightedge constructions|constructed with straightedge and compass]]. It appears that Gauss already knew the [[class number formula]] in 1801.<ref>{{cite web |title=Did Gauss know Dirichlet's class number formula in 1801? |work=[[MathOverflow]] |date=10 October 2012 |url=https://mathoverflow.net/q/109330 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, he proved the following conjectured theorems:\n* [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]] for ''n'' = 3\n* [[Fermat's last theorem]] for ''n'' = 5\n* [[Descartes's rule of signs]]\n* [[Kepler conjecture]] for regular arrangements\n\nHe also\n* explained the [[pentagramma mirificum]] (see [https://www.math.uni-bielefeld.de/~sek/cluster/pentagramma/ University of Bielefeld website])\n* developed an algorithm for determining the [[Computus#Gauss algorithm|date of Easter]]\n* invented the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]] for calculating the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s 160 years before Cooley and Tukey\n\n===Astronomy===\n[[File:Bendixen - Carl Friedrich Gau\u00df, 1828.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Gauss published in ''[[Astronomische Nachrichten]]'' (1828)]]\nIn the same year, Italian astronomer [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] discovered the [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]. Piazzi could only track Ceres for somewhat more than a month, following it for three degrees across the night sky. Then it disappeared temporarily behind the glare of the Sun. Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time were not able to extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data\u2014three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit. Gauss heard about the problem and tackled it. After three months of intense work, he predicted a position for Ceres in December 1801\u2014just about a year after its first sighting\u2014and this turned out to be accurate within a half-degree when it was rediscovered by [[Franz Xaver von Zach]] on 31 December at [[Gotha Observatory|Gotha]], and one day later by [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Heinrich Olbers]] in [[Bremen]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[Gauss's method]] involved determining a [[conic section]] in space, given one focus (the Sun) and the conic's intersection with three given lines (lines of sight from the Earth, which is itself moving on an ellipse, to the planet) and given the time it takes the planet to traverse the arcs determined by these lines (from which the lengths of the arcs can be calculated by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Second Law]]). This problem leads to an equation of the eighth degree, of which one solution, the Earth's orbit, is known. The solution sought is then separated from the remaining six based on physical conditions. In this work, Gauss used comprehensive approximation methods which he created for that purpose.<ref>{{cite book|title=Development of mathematics in the 19th century|last1=Klein|first1=Felix|last2=Hermann|first2=Robert |isbn=978-0-915692-28-6|year=1979|publisher=Math Sci Press}}</ref>\n\nOne such method was the [[fast Fourier transform]].

Though Gauss had up to that point been financially supported by his stipend from the Duke, he doubted the security of this arrangement, and also did not believe pure mathematics to be important enough to deserve support. Thus he sought a position in astronomy, and in 1807 was appointed Professor of Astronomy and Director of the astronomical [[G\u00f6ttingen Observatory|observatory in G\u00f6ttingen]], a post he held for the remainder of his life.\n\n[[File:Normal Distribution PDF.svg|thumb|Four [[normal distribution]]s]]\nThe discovery of Ceres led Gauss to his work on a theory of the motion of planetoids disturbed by large planets, eventually published in 1809 as ''Theoria motus corporum coelestium in sectionibus conicis solem ambientum'' (Theory of motion of the celestial bodies moving in conic sections around the Sun). In the process, he so streamlined the cumbersome mathematics of 18th-century orbital prediction that his work remains a cornerstone of astronomical computation.<ref>Felix Klein, Vorlesungen \u00fcber die Entwicklung der Mathematik im 19.

Berlin: Julius Springer Verlag, 1926.</ref> It introduced the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]], and contained an influential treatment of the [[Least squares|method of least squares]], a procedure used in all sciences to this day to minimize the impact of [[Observational error|measurement error]].\n\nGauss proved the method under the assumption of [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] errors (see [[Gauss\u2013Markov theorem]]; see also [[List of topics named after Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gaussian]]). The method had been described earlier by [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]] in 1805, but Gauss claimed that he had been using it since 1794 or 1795.<ref>Oscar Sheynin, [http://sheynin.de/download/hist_stat.pdf ''History of Statistics''], Berlin: NG Verlag Berlin, 2012, p. 81.</ref> In the history of statistics, this disagreement is called the \"priority dispute over the discovery of the method of least squares.\"<ref>Stephen M.

To aid the survey, Gauss invented the [[heliotrope (instrument)|heliotrope]], an instrument that uses a mirror to reflect sunlight over great distances, to measure positions.\n\n===Non-Euclidean geometries===\nGauss also claimed to have discovered the possibility of [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] but never published it. This discovery was a major paradigm shift in mathematics, as it freed mathematicians from the mistaken belief that Euclid's axioms were the only way to make geometry consistent and non-contradictory.\n\nResearch on these geometries led to, among other things, [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of general relativity, which describes the universe as non-Euclidean. His friend [[Farkas Bolyai|Farkas Wolfgang Bolyai]] with whom Gauss had sworn \"brotherhood and the banner of truth\" as a student, had tried in vain for many years to prove the parallel postulate from Euclid's other axioms of geometry.\n\nBolyai's son, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]], discovered non-Euclidean geometry in 1829; his work was published in 1832. After seeing it, Gauss wrote to Farkas Bolyai: \"To praise it would amount to praising myself. For the entire content of the work&nbsp;... coincides almost exactly with my own meditations which have occupied my mind for the past thirty or thirty-five years.\"\n\nThis unproved statement put a strain on his relationship with Bolyai who thought that Gauss was \"stealing\" his idea.<ref name=\"Krantz2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven G.

Among other things, he came up with the notion of [[Gaussian curvature]].\nThis led in 1828 to an important theorem, the [[Theorema Egregium]] (''remarkable theorem''), establishing an important property of the notion of [[curvature]]. Informally, the theorem says that the curvature of a surface can be determined entirely by measuring [[angle]]s and [[distance]]s on the surface.\n\nThat is, curvature does not depend on how the surface might be [[embedding|embedded]] in 3-dimensional space or 2-dimensional space.\n\nIn 1821, he was made a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

They constructed the first [[Electrical telegraph|electromechanical telegraph]] in 1833,<ref name=\":4\" /> which connected the observatory with the institute for physics in G\u00f6ttingen. Gauss ordered a magnetic [[observatory]] to be built in the garden of the observatory, and with Weber founded the \"Magnetischer Verein\" (''magnetic association''), which supported measurements of Earth's magnetic field in many regions of the world. He developed a method of measuring the horizontal intensity of the magnetic field which was in use well into the second half of the 20th century, and worked out the mathematical theory for separating the inner and outer ([[magnetosphere|magnetospheric]]) sources of Earth's magnetic field.\n\n==Appraisal==\nThe British mathematician [[Henry John Stephen Smith]] (1826\u20131883) gave the following appraisal of Gauss:\n{{block quote|If we except the great name of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] it is probable that no mathematicians of any age or country have ever surpassed Gauss in the combination of an abundant fertility of invention with an absolute rigorousness in demonstration, which the ancient Greeks themselves might have envied. It may seem paradoxical, but it is probably nevertheless true that it is precisely the efforts after logical perfection of form which has rendered the writings of Gauss open to the charge of obscurity and unnecessary difficulty. Gauss says more than once that, for brevity, he gives only the synthesis, and suppresses the analysis of his propositions. If, on the other hand, we turn to a memoir of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s, there is a sort of free and luxuriant gracefulness about the whole performance, which tells of the quiet pleasure which Euler must have taken in each step of his work. It is not the least of Gauss's claims to the admiration of mathematicians, that, while fully penetrated with a sense of the vastness of the science, he exacted the utmost rigorousness in every part of it, never passed over a difficulty, as if it did not exist, and never accepted a theorem as true beyond the limits within which it could actually be demonstrated.<ref>H.J.S Smith,''Presidential Address'', Proceedings of the London Math. Soc. VIII, 18.</ref>}}\n\n== Anecdotes ==\nThere are several stories of his early genius. According to one, his gifts became very apparent at the age of three when he corrected, mentally and without fault in his calculations, an error his father had made on paper while calculating finances.\n\nAnother story has it that in primary school after the young Gauss misbehaved, his teacher, J.G. B\u00fcttner, gave him a task: add a list of [[integer]]s in [[arithmetic progression]]; as the story is most often told, these were the numbers from 1 to 100. The young Gauss reputedly produced the correct answer within seconds, to the astonishment of his teacher and his assistant [[Johann Christian Martin Bartels|Martin Bartels]].\n\nGauss's presumed method was to realize that pairwise addition of terms from opposite ends of the list yielded identical intermediate sums: 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;100&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 2&nbsp;+&nbsp;99&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, 3&nbsp;+&nbsp;98&nbsp;=&nbsp;101, and so on, for a [[Triangular number|total sum]] of 50&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;101&nbsp;=&nbsp;5050.\nHowever, the details of the story are at best uncertain (see<ref name=\"hayesreckoning\" /> for discussion of the original [[Wolfgang Sartorius von Waltershausen]] source and the changes in other versions); some authors, such as Joseph Rotman in his book ''A first course in Abstract Algebra'', question whether it ever happened.\n\nHe referred to mathematics as \"the queen of sciences\"<ref>Quoted in Waltershausen, Wolfgang Sartorius von (1856, repr. 1965).
