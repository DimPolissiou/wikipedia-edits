The largest city [[Santiago de Cuba]] is the main administrative center. Other large cities include [[Palma Soriano]], [[Contramaestre, Cuba|Contramaestre]], [[San Luis, Santiago de Cuba|San Luis]] and [[La Maya, Cuba|Songo-la Maya]].\n\n==History==\nSantiago de Cuba province has been the site of many [[battle]]s, both during the war for independence and the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], where much of the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighting took place in the mountainous province.\n\nPrior to 1976, Cuba was divided into six [[Provinces of Cuba#History|historical provinces]]. One of these was [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] province, which was, prior to 1905, known as Santiago de Cuba province. The present day province comprises the south-central region of Oriente.\n\n==Economy==\nThe province is rich in material resources such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]]. The economy, however, relies mostly on [[agriculture]], with large plantations growing [[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], and [[coffee]] dotting the landscape.

The largest city [[Santiago de Cuba]] is the main administrative center. Other large cities include [[Palma Soriano]], [[Contramaestre, Cuba|Contramaestre]], [[San Luis, Santiago de Cuba|San Luis]] and [[La Maya, Cuba|Songo-la Maya]].\n\n==History==\nSantiago de Cuba province has been the site of many [[battle]]s, both during the war for independence and the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], where much of the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighting took place in the mountainous province.\n\nPrior to 1976, Cuba was divided into six [[Provinces of Cuba#History|historical provinces]]. One of these was [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] province, which was, prior to 1905, known as Santiago de Cuba province. The present day province comprises the south-central region of Oriente.\n\n==Economy==\nThe province is rich in material resources such as [[iron]] and [[nickel]]. The economy, however, relies mostly on [[agriculture]], with large plantations growing [[banana]]s, [[Cocoa bean|cacao]], and [[coffee]] dotting the landscape. Industry is growing around the capital, as is [[tourism]]. The natural environment of the province attracts tourists from elsewhere in Cuba and from overseas.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Municipalities==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Municipality!!Population<br />(2004)!!Area<br />(km\u00b2)!!Location!!Remarks\n|-\n|[[Contramaestre, Cuba|Contramaestre]]||{{commas|105493}}||{{commas|610.3}}||<small>{{Coord|20|18|0|N|76|15|2|W|format=dec|name=Contramaestre}}</small>||\n|-\n|[[Guam\u00e1, Cuba|Guam\u00e1]]||{{commas|35516}}||{{commas|965}}||<small>{{Coord|19|58|34|N|76|24|35|W|format=dec|name=Chivirico}}</small>||  [[Chivirico]]\n|-\n|[[Mella, Cuba|Mella]]||{{commas|33667}}||{{commas|335.2}}||<small>{{Coord|20|22|10|N|75|54|39|W|format=dec|name=Mella}}</small>||\n|-\n|[[Palma Soriano, Cuba|Palma Soriano]]||{{commas|124585}}||{{commas|845.8}}||<small>{{Coord|20|12|51|N|75|59|30|W|format=dec|name=Palma Soriano}}</small>||\n|-\n|[[San Luis, Santiago de Cuba|San Luis]]||{{commas|88496}}||{{commas|765}}||<small>{{Coord|20|11|17|N|75|50|55|W|format=dec|name=San Luis}}</small>||\n|-\n|[[Santiago de Cuba, Cuba|Santiago de Cuba]]||{{commas|472255}}||{{commas|1023.8}}||<small>{{Coord|20|02|25|N|75|48|53|W|format=dec|name=Santiago de Cuba}}</small>|| Provincial capital\n|-\n|[[Segundo Frente, Cuba|Segundo Frente]]||{{commas|40885}}||{{commas|540}}||<small>{{Coord|20|24|43|N|75|31|43|W|format=dec|name=Mayar\u00ed Arriba}}</small>||  [[Mayar\u00ed Arriba]]\n|-\n|[[Songo-La Maya, Cuba|Songo-La Maya]]||{{commas|100287}}||{{commas|721}}||<small>{{Coord|20|10|24|N|75|38|46|W|format=dec|name=La Maya}}</small>||  [[La Maya, Cuba|La Maya]]\n|-\n|[[Tercer Frente, Cuba|Tercer Frente]]||{{commas|30457}}||{{commas|364}}||<small>{{Coord|20|10|19|N|76|19|38|W|format=dec|name=Cruce de los Ba\u00f1os}}</small>||  [[Cruce de los Ba\u00f1os]]\n|}\n{{GeoGroupTemplate}}\n:''Source: Population from 2004 Census.''<ref name=atenas>{{Cite web| url=http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Estadisticas/TABLA%20No_3balance.htm| title=2004 Population trends, by Province and Municipality| author= Atenas.cu| year= 2004| accessdate=2007-10-06 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927111826/http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Estadisticas/TABLA+No_3balance.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27|language=es}}</ref> ''Area from 1976 municipal re-distribution.''<ref name=statoids>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ycu.html|title=Municipios of Cuba|author=Statoids|date=July 2003| accessdate=2007-10-06}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nIn 2004, the province of Santiago De Cuba had a population of 1,043,202.<ref name=atenas>{{Cite web| url=http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Estadisticas/TABLA%20No_3balance.htm| title=2004 Population trends, by Province and Municipality| author= Atenas.cu| year= 2004| accessdate=2007-10-05 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927111826/http://www.atenas.inf.cu/todo/Estadisticas/TABLA+No_3balance.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27|language=es}}</ref> With a total area of {{convert|6156.44|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=census2002>{{Cite web| url=http://www.cubagob.cu/otras_info/censo/tablas_html/ii_4.htm| title=Population by Province| author= Government of Cuba| year= 2002| accessdate=2007-10-05|language=es}}</ref> the province had a population density of {{convert|169.4|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Caribbean#Cuba|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Cuba}}\n\n===Twin towns \u2014 Sister cities===\nSantiago de Cuba Province is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Naples]], Italy<ref name=\"Naples twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/5931|title= Comune di Napoli -Gemellaggi|accessdate=2013-08-08|last=Vacca|first=Maria Luisa|work=Comune di Napoli|trans-title=Naples - Twin Towns|language= Italian|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722204102/http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/5931|archivedate=2013-07-22 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cuba}}\n*[[Oriente Province]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cubao]]\n*[[Father Jos\u00e9 Conrado]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Santiago de Cuba Province}}\n*[http://www.santiago.cu/ Santiago.cu (in Spanish)]\n*[http://www.santiago-de-cuba.net/ Travel info on Santiago de Cuba]\n*[http://www.santiagoencuba.com/ santiagoencuba.com (in Spanish)]\n*[http://www.santiagodecubacity.org/ Santiago de Cuba City (in English and Spanish)]\n\n{{Provinces of Cuba|province=Santiago de Cuba}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Santiago De Cuba Province}}\n[[Category:Santiago de Cuba Province| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of Cuba]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1976]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_de_Cuba_Province"}

Subsequently, the commissioner has also investigated a separate incident surrounding her use of threatening language to a journalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 8 October 2018, Osamor wrote to the Courts of Justice, Bournemouth, to provide a character reference for her son. The letter was hand-delivered at the court and was written on House of Commons stationery bearing the crowned portcullis, the royal badge used as an emblem by the House of Commons. In the letter Osamor referred to herself as the \"Member of Parliament for Edmonton and Shadow Secretary of State for International Development\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-036|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Commissioner noted that \u201cthe use of House of Commons paper wrongly suggested that her plea carried the authority of the House\u201d. She comments that the tone of any character reference for a constituent would be different from that which Ms Osamor used to plead her son's cause. The Commissioner concludes that \u201cwriting, in the terms that she did, on stationery bearing the royal badge was, in my view, highly inappropriate\u201d. She therefore finds that in writing to the judge on House-provided stationery, Ms Osamor broke the rules on the use of such stationery, in breach of paragraph 16 of the Code of Conduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-026|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> Osamor has accepted that she broke the rules on the use of House-provided stationery, and has apologised to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-025|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn the second matter: on 30 November 2018, police officers had attended Osamor's home after a call from Osamor stating \"a man claiming to be a journalist was banging on the door intimidating her and her family\". Osamor conceded to the Commissioner she had been at home alone at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-024|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nBased on body worn video evidence provided by the police, the Commissioner established that Osamor had said \u201cDon\u2019t knock my fucking door. I should have come down here with a fucking bat and smashed your face open\u201d to the journalist in the presence of the attending police officers. The Commissioner concluded that such behaviour was unacceptable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-014|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards -

Subsequently, the commissioner has also investigated a separate incident surrounding her use of threatening language to a journalist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn a letter dated 8 October 2018, Osamor wrote to the Courts of Justice, Bournemouth, to provide a character reference for her son. The letter was hand-delivered at the court and was written on House of Commons stationery bearing the crowned portcullis, the royal badge used as an emblem by the House of Commons. In the letter Osamor referred to herself as the \"Member of Parliament for Edmonton and Shadow Secretary of State for International Development\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-036|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe Commissioner noted that \u201cthe use of House of Commons paper wrongly suggested that her plea carried the authority of the House\u201d. She comments that the tone of any character reference for a constituent would be different from that which Ms Osamor used to plead her son's cause. The Commissioner concludes that \u201cwriting, in the terms that she did, on stationery bearing the royal badge was, in my view, highly inappropriate\u201d. She therefore finds that in writing to the judge on House-provided stationery, Ms Osamor broke the rules on the use of such stationery, in breach of paragraph 16 of the Code of Conduct.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-026|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref> Osamor has accepted that she broke the rules on the use of House-provided stationery, and has apologised to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5801/cmselect/cmstandards/210/21003.htm#footnote-025|title=Kate Osamor - Committee on Standards - House of Commons|website=publications.parliament.uk}}</ref>\n\nOn the second matter: on 30 November 2018, police officers had attended Osamor's home after a call from Osamor stating \"a man claiming to be a journalist was banging on the door intimidating her and her family\".
