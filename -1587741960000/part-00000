Fought on 17 February 1782 near present-day [[Kalpakkam]], the battle was tactically indecisive, but the British fleet suffered the most damage. Under Suffren's protection, French troop transports were able to land at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]].\n\n==Background==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780 after the Dutch refused to stop trading with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nThe French admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched for military assistance to French colonies in India, leading a fleet of five ships of the line, seven transports, and a corvette to escort transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in March 1781. Suffren was involved in a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with a British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April. In October, he left reinforcement troops at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] to assist with colonial defense. Suffren added some ships to his fleet and sailed on to [[Mauritius|\u00cele de France]], arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December.\n\nAfter further additions at Port Louis, Suffren's fleet sailed for India under the command of the elderly Navy Brigadier General Thomas d'Orves, accompanying transports carrying nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin.  D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren once again took command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai, India|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold there. Encountering the fleet of Hughes anchored in Madras on 15 February 1782, Suffren turned south. He intended to land troops at Porto Novo, march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way.  Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren.\n\n==Battle==\nSuffren was hampered with protecting his troop convoys from Hughes, whose goal he presumed was to prevent the troops from landing. Detaching one corvette to protect the convoy and detailing another to watch the British fleet, Suffren attempted to draw Hughes away.  However, under cover of night Hughes managed to slip between Suffren's squadron and the convoys. The signal was raised on the morning of 17 February, and Suffren gave chase to force battle.\n\n[[File:BailliDeSuffrenByBatoni.jpg|left|thumb|upright|French Admiral the Bailli de Suffren]]\nWhen the fleets closed for action around 15:30, some of Suffren's ships had not properly formed the line of battle. Only five of the French ships engaged at first. Of the remaining six, only two joined the action later, with the other four apparently violating Suffren's orders and hanging back.  Suffren, leading in ''H\u00e9ros'', exchanged a broadside with ''Exeter'' before targeting Hughes' flagship ''Superb''. The battle lasted for over three hours, with ''Exeter'' sustaining the worst damage.  She was very nearly sunk, but two French ships were recalled (for reasons unknown) before they could finish her off.  ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage. The battle came to end with the onset of night.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSuffren summoned his captains for council and chastised those that had chosen to stay out of the battle before following the troop convoy to Porto Novo.  There the French army had landed, and Suffren met with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysorean]] ruler [[Hyder Ali]] to plan strategy.  After making repairs, Suffren set off to find Hughes again.  The French and Mysorean forces captured [[Cuddalore]], just north of Porto Novo, on 4 April.\n\nHughes sailed for [[Trincomalee]], where he made repairs.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{|

Fought on 17 February 1782 near present-day [[Kalpakkam]], the battle was tactically indecisive, but the British fleet suffered the most damage. Under Suffren's protection, French troop transports were able to land at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]].\n\n==Background==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780 after the Dutch refused to stop trading with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nThe French admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched for military assistance to French colonies in India, leading a fleet of five ships of the line, seven transports, and a corvette to escort transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in March 1781. Suffren was involved in a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with a British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April. In October, he left reinforcement troops at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] to assist with colonial defense. Suffren added some ships to his fleet and sailed on to [[Mauritius|\u00cele de France]], arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December.\n\nAfter further additions at Port Louis, Suffren's fleet sailed for India under the command of the elderly Navy Brigadier General Thomas d'Orves, accompanying transports carrying nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin.  D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren once again took command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai, India|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold there. Encountering the fleet of Hughes anchored in Madras on 15 February 1782, Suffren turned south. He intended to land troops at Porto Novo, march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way.  Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren.\n\n==Battle==\nSuffren was hampered with protecting his troop convoys from Hughes, whose goal he presumed was to prevent the troops from landing. Detaching one corvette to protect the convoy and detailing another to watch the British fleet, Suffren attempted to draw Hughes away.  However, under cover of night Hughes managed to slip between Suffren's squadron and the convoys. The signal was raised on the morning of 17 February, and Suffren gave chase to force battle.\n\n[[File:BailliDeSuffrenByBatoni.jpg|left|thumb|upright|French Admiral the Bailli de Suffren]]\nWhen the fleets closed for action around 15:30, some of Suffren's ships had not properly formed the line of battle. Only five of the French ships engaged at first. Of the remaining six, only two joined the action later, with the other four apparently violating Suffren's orders and hanging back.  Suffren, leading in ''H\u00e9ros'', exchanged a broadside with ''Exeter'' before targeting Hughes' flagship ''Superb''. The battle lasted for over three hours, with ''Exeter'' sustaining the worst damage.  She was very nearly sunk, but two French ships were recalled (for reasons unknown) before they could finish her off.  ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage. The battle came to end with the onset of night.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSuffren summoned his captains for council and chastised those that had chosen to stay out of the battle before following the troop convoy to Porto Novo.  There the French army had landed, and Suffren met with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysorean]] ruler [[Hyder Ali]] to plan strategy.  After making repairs, Suffren set off to find Hughes again.  The French and Mysorean forces captured [[Cuddalore]], just north of Porto Novo, on 4 April.\n\nHughes sailed for [[Trincomalee]], where he made repairs.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{|

Meanwhile, [[Lucius Vorenus (Rome character)|Vorenus]] returns to Rome with his rescued children. Secretly, the children wish to run away. The children steal some of Vorenus' money and run off to their aunt Lyde who insists that they return to their father and, at least, pretend to love and forgive him even after what he has done to their mother. Vorenus makes peace with his rival gangs at a great loss, but informs [[Titus Pullo (Rome character)|Pullo]] that even though the others may think they're \"going soft\", they will rebuild their forces. At an orgy, Agrippa abducts Octavia and returns her home to [[Atia of the Julii|Atia]]. After Atia fumes at Octavia for going to an orgy, [[Marcus Agrippa (Rome character)|Agrippa]] confesses his love for Octavia who is stunned as he walks out.\n\nOctavian, who had promised to heed Cicero's advice as consul, uses intimidation to pass a motion in the Senate declaring [[Marcus Junius Brutus (Rome character)|Brutus]] and Cassius enemies of the state. Cicero, mortified by Octavian's tactics and the fact he has, in his own words ''\"been outmaneuvered by a child\"'', sends a letter to Brutus, asking for help. In the east, Brutus is encouraged by the news, and plans to take advantage of the conflict between [[Mark Antony (Rome character)|Mark Antony]] and Octavian by letting them fight it out, and then returning to Rome just as their forces have dwindled. Cicero tells Octavian that Brutus is coming to Rome with \"20 legions\", which puts Octavian, who is left with 4 legions, in a dangerous position. Octavian must turn to his mother for help. Atia, accompanied by her son and his army, rides to Gaul, where she greets Mark Antony. She succeeds in convincing Mark Antony to become Octavian's ally, to ensure that they can defeat Brutus' approaching army.\n\nTitus Pullo swears to his wife, [[Eirene (Rome character)|Eirene]], who feels Pullo values his friendship with Vorenus over their marriage, that he would save her before Vorenus. As the friends and children sit down for dinner, Vorenus' eldest daughter Vorena gives out stew and thanks her father for his compliments. As the camera pans downward, we see her making the [[Corna]] (the \"horns\" hand gesture) behind her back, revealing her dishonesty.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0901368/ \"Heroes of the Republic\"] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n\n{{Rome (TV series)}}\n\n[[Category:2007 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:2007 British television episodes]]\n[[Category:Rome (TV series) episodes]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title        = Heroes of the Republic\n| series       = [[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]\n| image        = \n| caption      = \n| season       = 2\n| episode      = 5\n| writer       = [[Mere Smith]]\n| director     = [[Alik Sakharov]]\n| airdate      = February 11, 2007 ([[HBO]])<br />July 4, 2007 ([[BBC]])<!--\n-->{{Infobox|child=yes\n| label1 = Setting\n| data1  = [[Rome]]\n| label2 = Time frame\n| data2  = c. 43 BC\n}}\n| length       = \n| season_list  = \n| prev         = [[Testudo et Lepus (The Tortoise and the Hare)]]\n| next         = [[Philippi (Rome)|Philippi]]\n| episode_list = List of Rome episodes\n}}\n\n\"'''Heroes of the Republic'''\" is the fifth episode of the second season of the television series ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]''.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nThe struggle in Rome continues as [[Gaius Octavian (Rome character)|Octavian]], the new Caesar, with his army at the city's borders, establishes himself as consul to the senate with the reluctant help of [[Marcus Tullius Cicero (Rome character)|Cicero]].

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on September 24, 2006. The episode follows teenage daughter [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] after she requests that her parents buy her a car. At the showroom, however, her father, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], decides to buy a tank, instead of the car Meg was interested in. Deciding to pay for a new car herself, Meg is able to get a job at Superstore USA, which eventually destroys the local economy of Quahog, and upsets the local community, leading [[Brian Griffin]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to save the day.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Kirker Butler]] and directed by [[Dan Povenmire]]. It received mostly positive reviews from critics for its storyline and entertaining cultural references. It was viewed by 9.66 million viewers in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Dave Boat]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]] and [[Fred Tatasciore]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Hell Comes to Quahog\" was released on DVD along with twelve other episodes from the season on September 18, 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nPeter, [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], [[Joe Swanson|Joe]], and [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] are spending the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded to pick up Meg from the [[roller rink|roller skating rink]]. They then go to the rink and continue to enjoy themselves, while skating. The guys forget to pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car dealership, where she shows an interest in a [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]]. Distracted by a large [[tank]] at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog megastore, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon go bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter loses his job at the Pawtucket Brewery because Superstore USA has its own brewery and they can't compete with them. Back at the house, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and Peter watch TV and on the news, Tom says that Quahog is suffering a heat wave across the city, with Superstore USA taking away the neighborhood power to power their cooling system. Disjointed, Peter joins an angry protest outside the store, but after entering the store to encourage customers to leave, Peter is impressed by its central cooling system, and decides to become an employee also working under Mr. Penisburg, with Meg as his superior. Later, Meg is promoted to assistant manager by Mr. Penisburg, who immediately instructs her to fire Peter. Despite her reservations about her father, she chooses her family over her job and quits. In the meantime, Brian and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] decide to destroy the superstore completely by retrieving Peter's tank, and driving it through the superstore, while Peter and Meg escape through an emergency exit. After bulldozing the store, Brian and Stewie drive outside and demolish it with the tank's cannon, killing Penisburg in the process. Immediately afterwards, the electricity supply to Quahog is restored, and life returns to normal.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Kirker Butler by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Kirker Butler wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was written by [[Kirker Butler]] and directed by [[Dan Povenmire]].

A commercial during Quahog's local news is then played, parodying the theme to the 1971 children's television series ''[[The Electric Company (1971 TV series)|The Electric Company]]''.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> While Stewie and Brian attack the store, the manager of Superstore USA runs to hide in the bathroom before being crushed by the billboard in front of him. This is a reference to the ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' scene where the attorney also hides in a bathroom before being eaten by the T-Rex.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/> In addition, the music that is played when Brian and Stewie are destroying the store follows the style of [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s theme to ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]''.<ref name=\"MacFarlane\"/>\n\n==Reception==\nIn a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode brought in 9.66 million viewers on its original airing, according to the [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode acquired a 3.4 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, tying with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and edging out series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s second show ''[[American Dad!]]'', in both ratings and total viewership.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=092606_07 |title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329105628/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=092606_07 |archivedate=2012-03-29 }}</ref>\n\nReviews of the episode by television critics were mostly positive, noting its \"hilarious beginning and the nice ending.\"<ref name=\"IGN\"/> Dan Iverson of [[IGN]] praised the episode, stating that the episode \"looks to show that this fifth season is going to bring the series back to the irreverent basics that made it so appealing.\" Iverson went on to comment that some of the jokes were \"extremely funny\" and that \"the episode had it all, from the ''Electric Company'' bit to making fun of people who drive Hummers and watch movies like Madagascar.\" In the conclusion of his review, Iverson gave the episode an eight out of ten.<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|last=Iverson|first=Dan|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/735/735065p1.html|title=Family Guy: \"Hell Comes to Quahog\" Review |accessdate=2007-11-28|date=2006-09-25|publisher=IGN}}</ref> Brett Love of [[TV Squad]] also gave the episode a positive review, calling the installment much better than the previous two episode's from the season, \"[[Stewie Loves Lois]]\" and \"[[Mother Tucker]]\", but criticized the storyline's similarity to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes]]\".

It was first released on VHS as an exclusive [[direct-to-video]] episode in 1995, and was not broadcast on television in the United Kingdom until 2006.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Act 1: The Barbershop ===\n[[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] goes to Derrick (Tony Haase)'s barbershop to have a haircut. After choosing what hair style he wants by pointing to a calendar of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]], Derrick attempts to make the first snip, but is unable to do so as Bean keeps tilting his head forward to read a magazine. The office phone then rings, and Derrick reluctantly goes to answer it. All alone, Bean entertains himself by pretending to give someone a haircut until two customers come in and mistake Bean for the hairdresser. The first customer is Jamie, a young boy whose mother leaves him in Bean's care as she runs to retrieve her purse she left at the shop. Bean places a bowl over Jamie's head and cuts his messy shoulder length mullet and fringe into a neater [[Bowl cut|bowl hairstyle]]. He then accidentally shaves off a small piece of Jamie's hair while trying to use a razor, and ends up shaving a bald stripe down the middle of his head to even it out. Although it looks ridiculous, Jamie is nonetheless satisfied with his new hairstyle.\n\nAfter Jamie's mother returns and pays Bean for the haircut (which she cannot see as Bean has covered Jamie's hair with a hat), he returns to his seat just as Derrick returns from the phone, only for it to ring again; Bean then resumes being the substitute hairdresser, and his next customer being a man with a ponytail ([[Colin Wells (actor)|Colin Wells]]) which apparently took over two and a half years to grow. While trimming the ponytail, Bean becomes distracted by the magazine the man is reading and accidentally detaches it. After he finishes, Bean uses a portrait of a different ponytailed man over a mirror to deceive him and the man leaves, unaware that his real ponytail has gone.\n\nBean's final customer is Roger ([[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]]), a man who is supposedly a regular at Derrick's. After taking off his glasses, Roger mistakes Bean for Derrick due to his poor eyesight and asks for his usual haircut. Bean then proceeds to use the razor but, despite being as careful as he can, he accidentally shaves off Roger's [[toupee]], causing it to get stuck in the razor. He remedies it by applying [[Hair mousse|mousse]] on Roger's bald spot and using bits of hair from the floor to create a new \"toupee\". Derrick finally returns from his phone call just as Roger pays him and leaves, and Derrick's initial confusion intensifies when Jamie's mother and the man who had the ponytail storm in and demand to know where his supposed assistant (who is nobody other than Bean himself) is as they hate the terrible haircuts he gave (even though Jamie insists he likes his haircut while his mother doesn't).\n\nBean sneaks out by disguising his face with the Prince Charles calendar in order to avoid being recognised. Roger then storms in and mistakenly greets Bean as Prince Charles himself thanks to his poor eyesight, before going over to and berating Derrick for his haircut. Bean then finally sneaks out of the door and makes a run for it.\n\n=== Act 2: The F\u00eate and the Pet Show ===\nFollowing his haircut, Bean heads to a [[f\u00eate]] where firstly, he is unable to find somewhere to park his [[Mini]], so he instead parks in one of the [[sheep]] pens after sounding the horn in order to get the sheep out of the way. Upon going inside the f\u00eate tents, he cheats at the indoor games, such as nudging a young boy playing a [[wire loop game]], causing him to lose the game.{{r|\"Dutton2015\"}} He then plays the game himself, but after failing on the first attempt, he unplugs it and wins; the owner only realises it has been unplugged after giving Bean his prize. Afterwards, Bean plays a game called \"Hit the Headmaster\", where he must throw wet sponges at the \"headmaster\" ([[George Webb (actor)|George Webb]]) in which gets a bit carried away by throwing random objects, such as canned peas and cereal boxes, at the \"headmaster\". He almost throws a chair, but a nearby teacher stops him.\n\nLater, Bean participates at a [[Animal show|pet show]] by entering Teddy into the competition. In the competition, Bean cheats his way through everything using Teddy despite winning easily due to the other kids' dogs not being trained well, much to the annoyance of the contest organisers. At the end of the show, two kids are awarded a ribbon each while Bean is awarded a huge [[bone]] by one of the contest organizers. However, Bean doesn't want it, so he instead takes a jar of [[honey]] to his satisfaction. Following this, he throws the bone back into the tent, inadvertently creating chaos off-screen involving the children and their dogs, who are presumably fighting for the bone. As the chaos ensues, Bean promptly exits the tent with Teddy.\n\n=== Act 3: The Railway Station ===\nFollowing the pet show, Bean gets off a train at London [[St Pancras railway station]]. Unfortunately, he has lost his ticket on the way, so he decides to sneak past a security guard ([[Robin Driscoll]]). After several failed attempts, he hides inside a [[mail bag]] and crawls towards the gate. When the guard leaves once the clock bell rings, Bean climbs onto the gate, but two station workers turn the gate around to which Bean crawls off the gate (while celebrating that he has made it through) and ends up falling onto the railway tracks. Two station workers appear and put the mailbag (with Bean still inside) on board a train carrying cargo and mail that is destined for [[Moscow]]. As the end credits roll, we see short clips of a ship sailing through a rough sea (most likely carrying the mail and cargo from the train earlier), and then of a French steam train and of marching Russian soldiers in Moscow's Red Square (indicating that Bean indeed ended up in Russia).\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]]\n* Tony Haase as Derrick\n* [[Colin Wells (actor)|Colin Wells]] as Man with ponytail\n* [[Frederick Treves (actor)|Frederick Treves]] as Roger \n* [[George Webb (actor)|George Webb]] as the Headmaster \n* [[Robin Driscoll]] as Railway Station Security Guard\n\n== Production ==\nAs per the other episodes, studio sequences were recorded before a live audience at [[Teddington Studios]].\n\nOn the door of the railway coach next to the English inscription of \"MOSCOW\", some mock [[Cyrillic]] writing is visible \"\u041d\u041f\u0423\u041b\u0426\u0410\" (''npultsa'') instead of \"\u041c\u041e\u0421\u041a\u0412\u0410\".

These schools were run on the [[Lancasterian system]], in which one \"master\" taught hundreds of students in a single room.

The main support came from local merchants, businessmen, and wealthier artisans, while many wage earners opposed it because they knew they would be paying for it through income taxation. In spite of this, [[Boston Latin School]] became public in 1820. This was the first public '''high school''' in the United States. Seven years later, a state law in Massachusetts made all grades of public school open to all pupils, free of charge.<ref name=\"ColorLines\"/>\n\nHowever, in the slave-owning states, things were different. Even after public schools were being opened up to all ages in Massachusetts, in the 1830s, it was illegal in southern states to teach black children to read.

The episode was written by co-[[executive producer]] [[Jennifer Celotta]] and directed by [[Roger Nygard]], making it Nygard's only series credit. It first aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on October 12, 2006.\n\nThe series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is overcome with grief when he learns about the death of his former boss Ed Truck.

The episode was viewed favorably by most television critics; Pam's pranks and the bird funeral were a particular source of praise, as was Michael's monologue on the [[five stages of grief]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carell]]) is informed by [[Jan Levinson]] ([[Melora Hardin]]) that his former boss Ed Truck has died.

Later, [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed Bratton]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) tells Michael that Truck, heavily inebriated, was decapitated in a truck accident while [[speed limit|speeding]] [[Drunk drivers|drunk]] on [[U.S. Route 6]]. Michael summons the staff to a primitive grief counseling session involving a collapsible [[Hoberman sphere]] ball, in which Michael tells members of the staff to give stories of deceased love ones. This leads to the staff telling stories about losing loved ones based on death scenes in movies (''[[Million Dollar Baby]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'', and ''[[Weekend at Bernie's]]'') with [[Ryan Howard (The Office)|Ryan Howard]] ([[B. J. Novak]]) saying he would elaborate more on his story, but it would take about an hour and a half to do it.\n\n[[Toby Flenderson]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) tells Michael death is a part of life, and uses an example of a bird that flew into a first-floor window that morning. Michael charges outside, picks up the deceased animal and tries in vain to revive it.  Michael schedules a parking lot funeral for the bird. [[Pam Beesly]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) fashions a makeshift coffin and reads a prepared speech that comforts Michael. Pam then proceeds to sing \"[[On the Wings of Love (song)|On the Wings of Love]]\" as [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) accompanies her on his [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]]. The coffin is placed in a box of shredded paper and set afire.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) gains authority over [[Karen Filippelli]]'s ([[Rashida Jones]]) schedule for the day. When Karen mentions her favorite kind of [[Herr's Snacks|Herr's potato chips]] is missing from the vending machine, Jim tells Karen that they cannot work until they find her chips.  The duo spends the rest of the day searching stores and vending machines around town in a vain attempt to find the chips. But at the end of the day, Karen finds a bag of Herr's on her desk. Jim tells the documentary crew that he traced the chips from the manufacturer to the distributor to the vending machine company to an adjacent office building.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Roger Nygard at the 2011 Humanist Film Festival.jpg|right|thumb|170px|Roger Nygard directed the episode, his only credit for the series.]]\n\"Grief Counseling\" was written by co-[[executive producer]] [[Jennifer Celotta]], and was directed by Roger Nygard, his only episode of ''The Office'' to date.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Grief Counseling |series=The Office |serieslink=The Office (American TV series) |credits=Roger Nygard (director), [[Jennifer Celotta]] (writer) |network=[[NBC]] |airdate=October 12, 2006 |season=3 |number=4}}</ref> In a later interview with ''Den of Geek'', Nygard found that \"television episodes are the domain of the writer-producers.
