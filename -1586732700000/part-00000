It cast Mickey as the owner of a small theater (or opera house according to the title). Mickey performs a vaudeville show all by himself. Acts include his impersonation of a snake charmer, his dressing in drag and performing a belly dance, his caricature of a Hasidic Jew and, for the finale, a piano performance.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe cartoon starts with the opening of a theater and Mickey Mouse sweeping and using the broom as an instrument and a dance partner. Mickey is then faced with a large show goer, who must be deflated in order to fit through the doorway. The band takes over, with a large variety of short gags occurring throughout. Following, Mickey Mouse becomes the star of the show, taking on the multiple roles of a vaudeville star. The cartoon ends with a humorous fight between himself and a piano and a stool.<ref>Mickey Mouse in ''The Opry House''. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxVJwH_89o</ref> Mickey's interactions are highly stylized in order to capture the essence of what a vaudeville performance should be.<ref name =Cartoons>Barrier, Michael. ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''. OUP Oxford, 2003 pg. 59.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''The Opry House'' was the fifth Mickey Mouse cartoon released by Walt Disney Productions. It appears in black and white, and the audio was recorded using [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]]'s cinephone system.<ref>Iwerks, Ub. The Opry House. Comedy, Family, Animation, Short, Music, 1929.</ref> It was animated mostly by [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt Disney's first employee who later became known as a \u201cDisney Legend\u201d.<ref>\u201cUb Iwerks\u201d https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412650/</ref> The short became the most expensive early Disney short, its negative cost being almost $2,500 more than the ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' cartoon produced just a year prior.<ref name =Cartoons/>\n\nThis short is an early example of how the Disney studio's animated shorts became more sophisticated. The short shows more realistic animating. The early Disney cartoons, like ''Steamboat Willie'' show many similarities to the [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] cartoons that preceded them. However, as Mickey Mouse evolved from the silent film era, the cartoons became more intricate. Mickey Mouse began interacting within his space in his cartoon world to create a more realist feel.<ref>Telotte, J.P. \u201cThe Stereoscopic Mickey: Space, Animation, and the Mouse\u201d.</ref>\n\nWalt Disney himself reinforces this idea:\n<blockquote> \u201c...Our characters were beginning to act & behave like real persons. Because of this we could begin to put real feeling and charm into our characterization. After all you can't expect charm from animated sticks and that is what Mickey Mouse was in his first pictures\u201d.<ref name =Cartoon>Barrier, Michael. ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''.

It cast Mickey as the owner of a small theater (or opera house according to the title). Mickey performs a vaudeville show all by himself. Acts include his impersonation of a snake charmer, his dressing in drag and performing a belly dance, his caricature of a Hasidic Jew and, for the finale, a piano performance.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe cartoon starts with the opening of a theater and Mickey Mouse sweeping and using the broom as an instrument and a dance partner. Mickey is then faced with a large show goer, who must be deflated in order to fit through the doorway. The band takes over, with a large variety of short gags occurring throughout. Following, Mickey Mouse becomes the star of the show, taking on the multiple roles of a vaudeville star. The cartoon ends with a humorous fight between himself and a piano and a stool.<ref>Mickey Mouse in ''The Opry House''. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjxVJwH_89o</ref> Mickey's interactions are highly stylized in order to capture the essence of what a vaudeville performance should be.<ref name =Cartoons>Barrier, Michael. ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''. OUP Oxford, 2003 pg. 59.</ref>\n\n==Production==\n''The Opry House'' was the fifth Mickey Mouse cartoon released by Walt Disney Productions. It appears in black and white, and the audio was recorded using [[Pat Powers (businessman)|Pat Powers]]'s cinephone system.<ref>Iwerks, Ub. The Opry House. Comedy, Family, Animation, Short, Music, 1929.</ref> It was animated mostly by [[Ub Iwerks]], Walt Disney's first employee who later became known as a \u201cDisney Legend\u201d.<ref>\u201cUb Iwerks\u201d https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0412650/</ref> The short became the most expensive early Disney short, its negative cost being almost $2,500 more than the ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'' cartoon produced just a year prior.<ref name =Cartoons/>\n\nThis short is an early example of how the Disney studio's animated shorts became more sophisticated. The short shows more realistic animating. The early Disney cartoons, like ''Steamboat Willie'' show many similarities to the [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]] cartoons that preceded them. However, as Mickey Mouse evolved from the silent film era, the cartoons became more intricate. Mickey Mouse began interacting within his space in his cartoon world to create a more realist feel.<ref>Telotte, J.P. \u201cThe Stereoscopic Mickey: Space, Animation, and the Mouse\u201d.</ref>\n\nWalt Disney himself reinforces this idea:\n<blockquote> \u201c...Our characters were beginning to act & behave like real persons. Because of this we could begin to put real feeling and charm into our characterization. After all you can't expect charm from animated sticks and that is what Mickey Mouse was in his first pictures\u201d.<ref name =Cartoon>Barrier, Michael.

It operates as a subsidiary of, and is distributed through, [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[Interscope Records]]. Current acts include Dr. Dre himself, [[Eminem]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Anderson Paak]], RaqBoy Bux (Daddy Warbux) which is now newly signed to Interscope Rec. Also [[Justus (musician)|Justus]] with former acts including [[50 Cent]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], [[Raekwon]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], [[Rakim]], [[Jon Connor]] and many others. The label's acts over the years have earned [[RIAA certification]]s of platinum or higher on 20 of its 28 released albums.\n\n== History ==\nUpon his departure from [[Death Row Records]] on March 22, 1996, Dr. Dre quickly launched Aftermath Entertainment through Interscope Records.<ref name=\"Cover\"/> It was founded as a \"boutique label\" that prides itself on \"quality over quantity\", focusing on small numbers of high-profile releases.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AngeloSanders.html |title=Interview With Angelo Sander |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=December 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' was released towards the year's end featuring artists who were amongst the label's first signees (most of the acts featured, however, quickly became disassociated with the company). In 1997, [[Dawn Robinson]] announced her departure from the R&B group [[En Vogue]] and that she had signed with Aftermath.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n23_v91/ai_19354279/|title=En Vogue to become trio: Dawn Robinson officially leaves group|date=April 28, 1997 |magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref> Before the year's end, however, she abruptly left the label, claiming that Dr. Dre had been too slow to get the ball rolling on her project.\n\nIn the autumn of 1997, Aftermath released the only collaborative project by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] super-group [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]] (composed of [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Nas]], and [[Nature (rapper)|Nature]]). Despite the highly anticipated album featuring production and cameo appearances by Dr. Dre himself, debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and being certified platinum,<ref name=\"RIAA-Firm\"/> it sold below commercial expectation. The group subsequently disbanded. Aftermath's next release was supposed to be by rapper [[King Tee]]. His album, however, was shelved, and King Tee was released from his contractual obligations in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/king-t/40/25/23 |title=King T |work=LinkedIn |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> [[The Last Emperor (rapper)|Last Emperor]] had also been signed during this time, but was shelved due to creative differences with an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at Aftermath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thereal.hiphop.dk/interviews/Travelling-with-The-Last-Emperor-pt1/552 |title=Travelling with The Last Emperor pt.1 &#124; HIPHOP.DK - The Real |work=hiphop.dk |date=August 27, 2004 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUpon recommendation from Interscope Records head, [[Jimmy Iovine]], Aftermath signed [[Detroit]] rapper [[Eminem]] on Monday 9th March 1998, exactly one year after Biggie's death.<ref>{{cite web|author=XXL Staff|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2008/02/the-8-biggest-moment-eminem-signs-to-aftermath/|title=The #8 Biggest Moment: Eminem Signs To Aftermath|publisher=[[XXL Magazine]]|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref> The following year (1999), Eminem's major-label debut album, ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' was released. The album topped the Billboard albums chart, went on to be certified quadruple platinum, and arguably became the label's first successful album release. Also in 1999, Aftermath released ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', Dr. Dre's follow-up to his 1992 album, ''[[The Chronic]]''. The album went on to be certified six-times-platinum.\n\nSeveral more artists were signed to, and later dropped from Aftermath, including [[Hittman (rapper)|Hittman]] and [[Rakim]] due to production conflicts.

Shortly after the release of ''The Documentary'', tension between The Game and 50 Cent ignited, resulting in The Game leaving Aftermath Entertainment in mid-2006.\n\n[[Busta Rhymes]] was also signed and released one album before later being dropped from the label due to conflict with Interscope head, Iovine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2009/01/30/busta-rhymes-clears-up-rumors-of-argument-with-jimmy-iovine/ |title=Busta Rhymes Clears Up Rumors Of Argument With Jimmy Iovine |last=Starbury |first=Allen |work=BallerStatus.com |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> His album, then titled ''Blessed'', since retitled ''[[Back on My B.S.]]'', was to be released on Aftermath.

It operates as a subsidiary of, and is distributed through, [[Universal Music Group]]'s [[Interscope Records]]. Current acts include Dr. Dre himself, [[Eminem]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], [[Anderson Paak]], RaqBoy Bux which is now newly signed to Interscope Rec. Also [[Justus (musician)|Justus]] with former acts including [[50 Cent]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], [[Raekwon]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], [[Rakim]], [[Jon Connor]] and many others. The label's acts over the years have earned [[RIAA certification]]s of platinum or higher on 20 of its 28 released albums.\n\n== History ==\nUpon his departure from [[Death Row Records]] on March 22, 1996, Dr. Dre quickly launched Aftermath Entertainment through Interscope Records.<ref name=\"Cover\"/> It was founded as a \"boutique label\" that prides itself on \"quality over quantity\", focusing on small numbers of high-profile releases.<ref name=\"hitquarters.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AngeloSanders.html |title=Interview With Angelo Sander |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=December 19, 2005 |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}</ref>\n\n''[[Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath]]'' was released towards the year's end featuring artists who were amongst the label's first signees (most of the acts featured, however, quickly became disassociated with the company). In 1997, [[Dawn Robinson]] announced her departure from the R&B group [[En Vogue]] and that she had signed with Aftermath.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n23_v91/ai_19354279/|title=En Vogue to become trio: Dawn Robinson officially leaves group|date=April 28, 1997 |magazine=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|accessdate=October 25, 2009}}</ref> Before the year's end, however, she abruptly left the label, claiming that Dr. Dre had been too slow to get the ball rolling on her project.\n\nIn the autumn of 1997, Aftermath released the only collaborative project by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] super-group [[The Firm (hip hop group)|The Firm]] (composed of [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Nas]], and [[Nature (rapper)|Nature]]). Despite the highly anticipated album featuring production and cameo appearances by Dr. Dre himself, debuting atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and being certified platinum,<ref name=\"RIAA-Firm\"/> it sold below commercial expectation. The group subsequently disbanded. Aftermath's next release was supposed to be by rapper [[King Tee]]. His album, however, was shelved, and King Tee was released from his contractual obligations in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.linkedin.com/pub/king-t/40/25/23 |title=King T |work=LinkedIn |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> [[The Last Emperor (rapper)|Last Emperor]] had also been signed during this time, but was shelved due to creative differences with an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] at Aftermath.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thereal.hiphop.dk/interviews/Travelling-with-The-Last-Emperor-pt1/552 |title=Travelling with The Last Emperor pt.1 &#124; HIPHOP.DK - The Real |work=hiphop.dk |date=August 27, 2004 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUpon recommendation from Interscope Records head, [[Jimmy Iovine]], Aftermath signed [[Detroit]] rapper [[Eminem]] on Monday 9th March 1998, exactly one year after Biggie's death.<ref>{{cite web|author=XXL Staff|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2008/02/the-8-biggest-moment-eminem-signs-to-aftermath/|title=The #8 Biggest Moment: Eminem Signs To Aftermath|publisher=[[XXL Magazine]]|date=2008-02-05|accessdate=2019-11-17}}</ref> The following year (1999), Eminem's major-label debut album, ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' was released. The album topped the Billboard albums chart, went on to be certified quadruple platinum, and arguably became the label's first successful album release. Also in 1999, Aftermath released ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', Dr. Dre's follow-up to his 1992 album, ''[[The Chronic]]''. The album went on to be certified six-times-platinum.\n\nSeveral more artists were signed to, and later dropped from Aftermath, including [[Hittman (rapper)|Hittman]] and [[Rakim]] due to production conflicts. Legal troubles forced singer [[Truth Hurts (singer)|Truth Hurts]] to subsequently get dropped from the label after her album's release.<ref name=\"AM-Truth\">{{cite web|date=November 10, 2008 |url=http://www.aftermathmusic.com/blog/interviews/2003/truth-hurts-september-2003/ |title=Truth Hurts &#124; Aftermath Entertainment |publisher=Aftermath Entertainment |accessdate=December 26, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529064001/http://www.aftermathmusic.com/blog/interviews/2003/truth-hurts-september-2003/ |archivedate=May 29, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> Aftermath released [[50 Cent]]'s [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] major-label debut album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' through a joint venture with [[Shady Records]] in 2003. Rapper [[Game (rapper)|The Game]], who signed with the label in 2003, also released his debut album ''[[The Documentary]]'' through a joint venture with 50 Cent's [[G-Unit Records]] in 2005. Shortly after the release of ''The Documentary'', tension between The Game and 50 Cent ignited, resulting in The Game leaving Aftermath Entertainment in mid-2006.\n\n[[Busta Rhymes]] was also signed and released one album before later being dropped from the label due to conflict with Interscope head, Iovine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2009/01/30/busta-rhymes-clears-up-rumors-of-argument-with-jimmy-iovine/ |title=Busta Rhymes Clears Up Rumors Of Argument With Jimmy Iovine |last=Starbury |first=Allen |work=BallerStatus.com |date=January 30, 2009 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> His album, then titled ''Blessed'', since retitled ''[[Back on My B.S.]]'', was to be released on Aftermath.
