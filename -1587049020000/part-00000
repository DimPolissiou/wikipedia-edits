It is a part of the [[Metro East]] in [[southern Illinois]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], it had a population of 270,056,<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17163.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref> making it the eighth-most populous county in Illinois and the most populous in the [[Southern Illinois|southern]] portion of the state. Its [[county seat]] is [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county was founded in 1790 by the government of the [[Northwest Territory]], before the establishment of Illinois as a state. [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia Village]] in the county was founded in 1697 and was a French settlement and former Jesuit mission.\n\nSt. Clair County is part of the [[American Bottom]] or [[Metro-East]] area of the [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri|MO]]-IL [[Greater St. Louis|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nIn 1970, the [[United States Census Bureau]] placed the [[mean center of U.S. population]] in St. Clair County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/meanctr.pdf|title=Mean Center of Population for the United States: 1790 to 2000|accessdate=17 September 2011|publisher=US Census Bureau|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103033717/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/meanctr.pdf|archivedate=3 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis area was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples. The first modern explorers and colonists of the area were French and French Canadians, founding a mission settlement in 1697 now known as [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia Village]]. After Great Britain defeated France in [[French and Indian War|the Seven Years' War]] in 1763 and absorbed its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River, British-American colonists began to move into the area. Many ethnic and Catholic French moved to settlements west of the river rather than live under British Protestant rule.\n\nAfter the United States [[American Revolutionary War|achieved independence]] in the late 18th century, St. Clair County was the first county established in present-day Illinois; it antedates Illinois' existence as a separate jurisdiction. The county was established in 1790 by a proclamation of [[Arthur St. Clair]], first governor of the [[Northwest Territory]], who named it after himself.\n\nThe original boundary of St. Clair county covered a large area between the [[Mackinaw River|Mackinaw]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers. In 1801, Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] re-established St. Clair County as part of the [[Indiana Territory]], extending its northern border to [[Lake Superior]] and the international border with [[Rupert's Land]].<ref name=white>White, Jesse. ''Origin and Evolution of Illinois Counties.'' State of Illinois, March 2010. [http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub15.pdf]</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Illinois Territory]] was created in 1809, Territorial Secretary [[Nathaniel Pope]], in his capacity as acting governor, issued a proclamation establishing St. Clair and [[Randolph County, Illinois|Randolph County]] as the two original counties of Illinois.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:St. Clair County Illinois 1809.png|St. Clair County as it was re-established in 1809.

It was always strongly influenced by actions of businessmen from St. Louis, who were initially French Creole fur traders with western trading networks.\n\nIn the 19th century, industrialists from St. Louis put coal plants and other heavy industry on the east side of the river, developing East St. Louis. Coal from southern mines was transported on the river to East St. Louis, then fed by barge to St. Louis furnaces as needed. After bridges spanned the river, industry expanded.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cities attracted immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from the South. In 1910 there were 6,000 African Americans in the city. With the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] underway from the rural South, to leave behind [[Jim Crow]] and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], by 1917, the African-American population in East St. Louis had doubled. Whites were generally hired first and given higher\u2013paying jobs, but there were still opportunities for American blacks. If hired as strikebreakers, they were resented by white workers, and both groups competed for jobs and limited housing in East St. Louis. The city had not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of population. The United States was developing war industries to support its eventual entry into the Great War, now known as [[World War I]].\n\n{{main|East St. Louis riots}}\nIn February 1917 tensions in the city arose as white workers struck at the [[Aluminum Ore Company]]. Employers fiercely resisted union organizing, sometimes with violence. In this case they hired hundreds of blacks as strikebreakers. White workers complained to the city council about this practice in late May. Rumors circulated about an armed African American man robbing a white man, and whites began to attack blacks on the street. The governor ordered in the National Guard and peace seemed restored by early June.\n\n\"On July 1, a white man in a Ford shot into black homes. Armed African-Americans gathered in the area and shot into another oncoming Ford, killing two men who turned out to be police officers investigating the shooting.\"<ref name=\"smith\"/> Word spread and whites gathered at the Labor Temple; the next day they fanned out across the city, armed with guns, clubs, anything they could use against the blacks they encountered. From July 1 through July 3, 1917, the [[East St. Louis riots]] engulfed the city, with whites attacking blacks throughout the city, pulling them from streetcars, shooting and hanging them, burning their houses. During this period, some African Americans tried to swim or use boats to get to safety; thousands crossed the [[Eads Bridge]] to St. Louis, seeking refuge, until the police closed it off. The official death toll was 39 blacks and nine whites, but some historians believe more blacks were killed.<ref name=\"smith\">[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/east-st-louis-race-riot-left-dozens-dead-devastating-community-on-the-rise-180963885/#kWLjUYlGxGqo7fTY.99 Alison Keyes, \"The East St. Louis Race Riot Left Dozens Dead, Devastating a Community on the Rise\"], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', 30 June 2017; accessed 26 May 2018</ref> Because the riots were racial terrorism, the Equal Justice Initiative has included these deaths among the lynchings of African Americans in the state of Illinois in its 2017 3rd edition of its report, ''Lynching in America''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |title=''Lynching in America/Supplement by County'', 3rd ed.

In addition to the human toll, they cost approximately $400,000 in property damage<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/forward/text4/silentprotest.pdf|title=The Negro Silent Protest Parade organized by the NAACP Fifth Ave., New York City July 28, 1917|date=2014|website=National Humanities Center, Research Triangle Park, NC|publisher=National Humanities Center|access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref> (over $8 million, in 2017 US Dollars <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=400000&year=1917|title=Calculate the value of $400,000 in 1917|website=www.dollartimes.com}}</ref>). They have been described as among the worst labor and race-related riots in United States history, and they devastated the African-American community.\n\nRebuilding was difficult as workers were being drafted to fight in World War I. When the veterans returned, they struggled to find jobs and re-enter the economy, which had to shift down to peacetime.\n\nIn the late 20th century, national restructuring of heavy industry cost many jobs, hollowing out the city, which had a marked decline in population. Residents who did not leave have suffered high rates of poverty and crime. In the early 21st century, East St. Louis is a site of [[urban decay]]. Swathes of deteriorated housing were demolished and parts of the city have become [[urban prairie]]. In 2017 the city marked the centennial of the riots that had so affected its residents.\n\nOther cities in St. Clair County border agricultural or vacant lands. Unlike the suburbs on the Missouri side of the metro area, those in [[Metro-East]] are typically separated by agriculture, or otherwise undeveloped land left after the decline of industry. The central portion of St. Clair county is located on a bluff along the Mississippi River. This area is being developed with suburban housing, particularly in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], and its [[Satellite town|satellite cities]]. The eastern and southern portion of the county is sparsely populated. The older small communities and small tracts of newer suburban villages are located between large areas of land devoted to [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]] fields, the major commodity crops of the area.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of {{convert|674|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|658|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|16|sqmi}} (2.4%) is water.<ref name=CD/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Belleville, Illinois]]\n|22|40|2.02\n|27|46|2.20\n|35|57|3.54\n|45|68|3.91\n|54|77|4.18\n|63|86|3.97\n|67|90|3.51\n|64|88|3.34\n|56|82|2.98\n|45|71|2.87\n|36|56|3.88\n|27|44|2.97\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0089|title=Monthly Averages for Belleville IL|accessdate=January 27, 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Belleville have ranged from a low of {{convert|22|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-27|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of {{convert|117|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} at [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] was recorded in July 1954.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Westcott|first=Nancy E.|title=The Prolonged 1954 Midwestern US Heat Wave: Impacts and Responses|journal=Wea.

(United States)|county]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]]; its western border is formed by the [[Mississippi River]], bordering the [[U.S. state]] of [[Missouri]]. It is a part of the [[Metro East]] in [[southern Illinois]]. According to the [[2010 United States Census]], it had a population of 270,056,<ref name=\"QF\">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17163.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref> making it the eighth-most populous county in Illinois and the most populous in the [[Southern Illinois|southern]] portion of the state. Its [[county seat]] is [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=7 June 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The county was founded in 1790 by the government of the [[Northwest Territory]], before the establishment of Illinois as a state. [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia Village]] in the county was founded in 1697 and was a French settlement and former Jesuit mission.\n\nSt. Clair County is part of the [[American Bottom]] or [[Metro-East]] area of the [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri|MO]]-IL [[Greater St. Louis|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nIn 1970, the [[United States Census Bureau]] placed the [[mean center of U.S. population]] in St. Clair County.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/meanctr.pdf|title=Mean Center of Population for the United States: 1790 to 2000|accessdate=17 September 2011|publisher=US Census Bureau|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011103033717/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/meanctr.pdf|archivedate=3 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis area was occupied for thousands of years by cultures of indigenous peoples. The first modern explorers and colonists of the area were French and French Canadians, founding a mission settlement in 1697 now known as [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia Village]]. After Great Britain defeated France in [[French and Indian War|the Seven Years' War]] in 1763 and absorbed its territory in North America east of the Mississippi River, British-American colonists began to move into the area. Many ethnic and Catholic French moved to settlements west of the river rather than live under British Protestant rule.\n\nAfter the United States [[American Revolutionary War|achieved independence]] in the late 18th century, St. Clair County was the first county established in present-day Illinois; it antedates Illinois' existence as a separate jurisdiction. The county was established in 1790 by a proclamation of [[Arthur St. Clair]], first governor of the [[Northwest Territory]], who named it after himself.\n\nThe original boundary of St. Clair county covered a large area between the [[Mackinaw River|Mackinaw]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers. In 1801, Governor [[William Henry Harrison]] re-established St. Clair County as part of the [[Indiana Territory]], extending its northern border to [[Lake Superior]] and the international border with [[Rupert's Land]].<ref name=white>White, Jesse. ''Origin and Evolution of Illinois Counties.'' State of Illinois, March 2010. [http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/ipub15.pdf]</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Illinois Territory]] was created in 1809, Territorial Secretary [[Nathaniel Pope]], in his capacity as acting governor, issued a proclamation establishing St. Clair and [[Randolph County, Illinois|Randolph County]] as the two original counties of Illinois.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:St. Clair County Illinois 1809.png|St. Clair County as it was re-established in 1809.

It was always strongly influenced by actions of businessmen from St. Louis, who were initially French Creole fur traders with western trading networks.\n\nIn the 19th century, industrialists from St. Louis put coal plants and other heavy industry on the east side of the river, developing East St. Louis. Coal from southern mines was transported on the river to East St. Louis, then fed by barge to St. Louis furnaces as needed. After bridges spanned the river, industry expanded.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the cities attracted immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and from the South. In 1910 there were 6,000 African Americans in the city. With the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] underway from the rural South, to leave behind [[Jim Crow]] and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]], by 1917, the African-American population in East St. Louis had doubled. Whites were generally hired first and given higher\u2013paying jobs, but there were still opportunities for American blacks. If hired as strikebreakers, they were resented by white workers, and both groups competed for jobs and limited housing in East St. Louis. The city had not been able to keep up with the rapid growth of population. The United States was developing war industries to support its eventual entry into the Great War, now known as [[World War I]].\n\n{{main|East St. Louis riots}}\nIn February 1917 tensions in the city arose as white workers struck at the [[Aluminum Ore Company]]. Employers fiercely resisted union organizing, sometimes with violence. In this case they hired hundreds of blacks as strikebreakers. White workers complained to the city council about this practice in late May. Rumors circulated about an armed African American man robbing a white man, and whites began to attack blacks on the street. The governor ordered in the National Guard and peace seemed restored by early June.\n\n\"On July 1, a white man in a Ford shot into black homes. Armed African-Americans gathered in the area and shot into another oncoming Ford, killing two men who turned out to be police officers investigating the shooting.\"<ref name=\"smith\"/> Word spread and whites gathered at the Labor Temple; the next day they fanned out across the city, armed with guns, clubs, anything they could use against the blacks they encountered. From July 1 through July 3, 1917, the [[East St. Louis riots]] engulfed the city, with whites attacking blacks throughout the city, pulling them from streetcars, shooting and hanging them, burning their houses. During this period, some African Americans tried to swim or use boats to get to safety; thousands crossed the [[Eads Bridge]] to St. Louis, seeking refuge, until the police closed it off. The official death toll was 39 blacks and nine whites, but some historians believe more blacks were killed.<ref name=\"smith\">[https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/east-st-louis-race-riot-left-dozens-dead-devastating-community-on-the-rise-180963885/#kWLjUYlGxGqo7fTY.99 Alison Keyes, \"The East St. Louis Race Riot Left Dozens Dead, Devastating a Community on the Rise\"], ''Smithsonian Magazine'', 30 June 2017; accessed 26 May 2018</ref> Because the riots were racial terrorism, the Equal Justice Initiative has included these deaths among the lynchings of African Americans in the state of Illinois in its 2017 3rd edition of its report, ''Lynching in America''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eji.org/sites/default/files/lynching-in-america-third-edition-summary.pdf |title=''Lynching in America/Supplement by County'', 3rd ed.

In addition to the human toll, they cost approximately $400,000 in property damage<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/pds/maai2/forward/text4/silentprotest.pdf|title=The Negro Silent Protest Parade organized by the NAACP Fifth Ave., New York City July 28, 1917|date=2014|website=National Humanities Center, Research Triangle Park, NC|publisher=National Humanities Center|access-date=July 28, 2017}}</ref> (over $8 million, in 2017 US Dollars <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dollartimes.com/inflation/inflation.php?amount=400000&year=1917|title=Calculate the value of $400,000 in 1917|website=www.dollartimes.com}}</ref>). They have been described as among the worst labor and race-related riots in United States history, and they devastated the African-American community.\n\nRebuilding was difficult as workers were being drafted to fight in World War I. When the veterans returned, they struggled to find jobs and re-enter the economy, which had to shift down to peacetime.\n\nIn the late 20th century, national restructuring of heavy industry cost many jobs, hollowing out the city, which had a marked decline in population. Residents who did not leave have suffered high rates of poverty and crime. In the early 21st century, East St. Louis is a site of [[urban decay]]. Swathes of deteriorated housing were demolished and parts of the city have become [[urban prairie]]. In 2017 the city marked the centennial of the riots that had so affected its residents.\n\nOther cities in St. Clair County border agricultural or vacant lands. Unlike the suburbs on the Missouri side of the metro area, those in [[Metro-East]] are typically separated by agriculture, or otherwise undeveloped land left after the decline of industry. The central portion of St. Clair county is located on a bluff along the Mississippi River. This area is being developed with suburban housing, particularly in [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]], and its [[Satellite town|satellite cities]]. The eastern and southern portion of the county is sparsely populated. The older small communities and small tracts of newer suburban villages are located between large areas of land devoted to [[maize|corn]] and [[soybean]] fields, the major commodity crops of the area.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the county has a total area of {{convert|674|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|658|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|16|sqmi}} (2.4%) is water.<ref name=CD/>\n\n===Climate and weather===\n{{climate chart\n|[[Belleville, Illinois]]\n|22|40|2.02\n|27|46|2.20\n|35|57|3.54\n|45|68|3.91\n|54|77|4.18\n|63|86|3.97\n|67|90|3.51\n|64|88|3.34\n|56|82|2.98\n|45|71|2.87\n|36|56|3.88\n|27|44|2.97\n|float=right\n|units=imperial\n|clear=both\n|source=The Weather Channel<ref name=WX>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USIL0089|title=Monthly Averages for Belleville IL|accessdate=January 27, 2011|publisher=The Weather Channel}}</ref>}}\nIn recent years, average temperatures in the county seat of Belleville have ranged from a low of {{convert|22|\u00b0F}} in January to a high of {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} in July, although a record low of {{convert|-27|\u00b0F}} was recorded in January 1977 and a record high of {{convert|117|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}} at [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] was recorded in July 1954.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Westcott|first=Nancy E.|title=The Prolonged 1954 Midwestern US Heat Wave: Impacts and Responses|journal=Wea.

Harry Webb attended a local primary school, Stanley Park Juniors, in Carshalton. In 1949 his father obtained employment in the credit control office of [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] and the family moved in with other relatives in [[Waltham Cross]], Hertfordshire, where he attended Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School until a three-bedroom council house in [[Cheshunt]] was allocated to them in 1950, at 12 Hargreaves Close.\n\nHe then attended Cheshunt Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1957.

The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer to change from his real name of Harry Webb. The name ''Cliff'' was adopted as it sounded like \"cliff face\", which suggested \"Rock\". It was \"[[Move It]]\" writer [[Ian Samwell]] who suggested the surname \"Richard\" as a tribute to Webb's musical hero [[Little Richard]].<ref name=\"contactmusic.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7524 |title=Move It by Cliff Richard Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in [[Ripley, Derbyshire]] in 1958, they adopted the name \"Cliff Richard and the Drifters\". The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name \"Cliff Richard\"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known [[The Shadows|Shadows]], although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career.\n\nFor his debut session, [[Norrie Paramor]] provided Richard with \"Schoolboy Crush\", a song previously recorded by an American, [[Bobby Helms]]. Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the [[B-side]]; this was \"Move It\", written and composed by the Drifters' Samwell while he was on board a number 715 [[Green Line Coaches|Green Line]] bus on the way to Richard's house for a rehearsal. For the \"Move It\" session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.\n\nThere are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]], who used the act <!--another word needed for the act?-->for his TV show ''[[Oh Boy!

Like previous British rockers such as [[Tommy Steele]] and [[Marty Wilde]], Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, \"High Class Baby\" and \"Livin' Lovin' Doll\", were followed by \"Mean Streak\", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and [[Lionel Bart]]'s \"[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]\".\n\nIt was on \"Living Doll\" that the Drifters began to back Richard on record. It was his fifth record and became his first No. 1 single. By that time, the group's line-up had changed with the arrival of [[Jet Harris]], [[Tony Meehan]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]]. The group was obliged to change its name to \"The Shadows\" after legal complications with the American group [[the Drifters]] as \"Living Doll\" entered the American top 40, licensed by [[ABC-Paramount]]. \"Living Doll\" was used in Richard's d\u00e9but film ''[[Serious Charge]]'', but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.\n\nThe Shadows were not a typical backing group. They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard. In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an [[EMI]] recording contract of their own, for independent recordings. That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits. On more than one occasion, a Shadows instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts.\n\nRichard's fifth single \"Living Doll\" triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s \"[[Travellin' Light]]\" and \"[[I Love You (Cliff Richard song)|I Love You]]\" and also \"A Voice in the Wilderness\", lifted from his film ''[[Expresso Bongo]]'', and \"Theme for a Dream\" cemented Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as [[Adam Faith]] and [[Billy Fury]]. Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five.\n\nIn 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album \"21 Today\" in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.\n\nTypically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of ''Live at the ABC Kingston 1962''. Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had their own chart successes for [[Decca Records|Decca]]. The Shadows added bass players [[Brian Locking]] (1962\u201363) and then [[John Rostill]] (1963\u201368) and took on [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]] permanently on drums.\n\nIn the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was [[When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart]] in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of \"[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]\" in 1963 and \"[[L'Edera (song)|Constantly]]\" in 1964, a revival of a popular Italian hit. In 1965, sessions under the direction of [[Billy Sherrill]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] were particularly successful, yielding \"[[The Minute You're Gone]]\", which topped the UK singles chart and \"Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)\" which made No. 2.\n\nRichard, and the Shadows in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 they toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there despite several chart records by Richard including the aforementioned \"[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]\" on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended its distribution deal with CBS. To the Shadows' chagrin, \"[[Apache (single)|Apache]]\" reached No. 2 in the US through a cover version by Danish guitarist [[Jorgen Ingmann]] which was almost unchanged from their worldwide hit. Richard and the band appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which was crucial for the Beatles, but these performances did not help them gain sustained success in North America.\n\nRichard and the Shadows appeared in six feature films including a debut in the 1959 film ''[[Serious Charge]]'' but most notably in ''[[The Young Ones (1961 film)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'', ''[[Wonderful Life (1964 film)|Wonderful Life]]'', and ''[[Finders Keepers (1966 film)|Finders Keepers]]''. These films created their own genre, known as the \"Cliff Richard musical\", and led to Richard being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, beating that of even James Bond.<ref>'Top Box Office Stars of 1962, ''Motion Picture Herald'' 1962</ref> The [[The Young Ones (song)|title song]] of ''The Young Ones'' became his biggest-selling single in the United Kingdom, selling over one million copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uk-s-million-selling-singles__6907/ |title=Official Charts &#124; The UK's million selling singles |publisher=Official Charts |accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> The irreverent 1980s TV [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' took its name from Richard's 1962 film. In mid-1963, Cliff and the Shadows appeared for a season in [[Blackpool]], where Richard had his portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.\n\n===1964\u20131975: Changing circumstances===\nAs with the other existing rock acts in Britain, Richard's career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the [[Beat music|Mersey sound]] in 1963 and 1964. He continued to be popular, and have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the [[British Invasion]], and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 \"It's All in the Game\") between August 1963 and August 1964, the American public had little awareness of him.\n\nRichard's 1965 UK No. 12 hit \"On My Word\" ended a run of 23 consecutive top ten UK hits between \"A Voice in the Wilderness\" in 1960 to \"The Minute You're Gone\" in 1965, which, to date, is still a record number of consecutive top ten UK hits for a male artist.<ref name=\"everyHit.com\"/> Richard continued having international hits, including 1967's \"The Day I Met Marie\", which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 5 in the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] charts.\n\nAlthough [[Baptism|baptised]] as an [[Anglican]], Richard did not practice the faith in his early years. In 1964, he became an active Christian and his faith has become an important aspect of his life. Standing up publicly as a Christian affected his career in several ways. Initially, he believed that he should quit rock 'n' roll, feeling he could no longer be the rocker who had been called a \"crude exhibitionist\" and \"too sexy for TV\". Richard intended at first to \"reform his ways\" and become a teacher, but Christian friends advised him not to abandon his career just because he had become an active Christian. Soon after, Richard re-emerged, performing with Christian groups and recording some Christian material. He still recorded secular songs with the Shadows, but devoted a lot of his time to Christian work, including appearances with the [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] crusades. As time progressed, Richard balanced his faith and work, enabling him to remain one of the most popular singers in Britain as well as one of its best-known Christians.\n\nRichard acted in the 1967 film ''[[Two a Penny]]'', released by Billy Graham's [[World Wide Pictures]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140642/ Two a Penny (1967) IMDB.com] <!--Retrieved 22 September 2008--></ref> in which he played Jamie Hopkins, a young man who gets involved in [[drug dealing]] while questioning his life after his girlfriend changes her attitude. He released the live album ''Cliff in Japan'' in 1967.\n\nIn 1968, he sang the UK's entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\", written and composed by [[Bill Martin (musician)|Bill Martin]] and [[Phil Coulter]]; it lost, however, by one point to Spain's \"[[La, la, la|La La La]]\". According to [[John Kennedy O'Connor]]'s ''The Eurovision Song Contest\u2014The Official History'', this was the closest result yet in the contest and Richard locked himself in the toilet to avoid the nerves of the voting.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. Richard says: Spain is the best of Eurovision Song Contest.</ref> In May 2008, a [[Reuters]] news report claimed that voting in the competition had been fixed by the Spanish dictator leader, [[Francisco Franco]], to ensure that the Spanish entry won, allowing them to host the contest the following year (1969). It is claimed that Spanish [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] television executives offered to buy programmes in exchange for votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0556354420080505 |title=Reuters |agency=Reuters |date= 5 May 2008|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Govan |first=Fiona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/1926993/How-Franco-cheated-Cliff-of-victory-in-Eurovision.html |title=How Franco cheated Cliff out of Eurovision title |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> The story was widely covered and featured on UK's ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' as a main story on 7 May 2008, with [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] interviewing author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] about the matter.<ref>{{cite web|author=JKMMOC |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiF3Ylj6oRM&feature=channel_page |title=EUROVISION CHANNEL 4 NEWS May 7, 2008 |via=YouTube |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Eurovision later ended voting by national juries in a bid to eradicate such alleged scams. Nevertheless, \"Congratulations\" was a huge hit throughout Europe and Australia, and yet another No. 1 in April 1968.\n\nAfter the Shadows split in 1968, Richard continued to record.\n[[Image:Sir Cliff Richard Allan Warren.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Allan Warren]] (1973)]]\nDuring the 1970s, Richard took part in several television shows and fronted his own show ''It's Cliff Richard'' from 1970 to 1976. It starred [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Una Stubbs]], and included ''A Song for Europe''. He began 1970 by appearing live on the [[BBC]]'s review of the sixties music scene, ''[[Pop Go The Sixties]]'', which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969. He performed \"Bachelor Boy\" with the Shadows and \"Congratulations\" solo. In 1972, he made a short BBC television comedy film called ''The Case'' with appearances from comedians and his first ever duets with a woman\u2014Newton-John. He went on to release a double live album, ''Cliff Live in Japan 1972'', which featured Newton-John.\n\nHis final acting role on the silver screen to date was in 1973, when he starred in the film ''[[Take Me High]]''.\n\nIn 1973, he sang the British Eurovision entry \"[[Power to All Our Friends]];\" the song finished third, close behind Luxembourg's \"[[Tu Te Reconna\u00eetras]]\" and Spain's \"[[Eres T\u00fa (Mocedades song)|Eres T\u00fa]].\" This time, Richard took [[Diazepam|Valium]] to overcome his nerves and his manager was almost unable to wake him for the performance.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Richard also hosted the BBC's qualifying heat for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], ''[[A Song for Europe]],'' in 1970, 1971 and 1972 as part of his BBCTV variety series. He presented the [[Eurovision Song Contest Previews]] for the BBC in 1971 and 1972.\n\nIn 1975, he released the single \"[[Honky Tonk Angel (Cliff Richard song)|Honky Tonk Angel]],\" produced by Hank Marvin and John Farrar, oblivious to its connotations or hidden meanings. As soon as he was notified that a \"honky-tonk angel\" was southern US slang for a prostitute, the horrified Richard ordered EMI to withdraw it and refused to promote it despite making a video for it. EMI agreed to his demand despite the fact the single was expected to sell well. About 1,000 copies are known to exist on vinyl.\n\n===1976\u20131994: Renaissance===\nIn 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a \"rock\" artist. That year Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff's career and produced the landmark album ''[[I'm Nearly Famous]]'', which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track \"[[Devil Woman (Cliff Richard song)|Devil Woman]]\", which became Richard's first true hit in the United States, and the ballad \"[[Miss You Nights]]\". In reviewing the new album in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Turner|title=Cliff Richard: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He0S6tFOGPUC&pg=PA270|year=2008|publisher=Lion Books|isbn=978-0-7459-5279-6|page=270}}</ref> Richard's fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many music names such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Elton John]] were seen sporting ''I'm Nearly Famous'' badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock in which he had begun his career.\n\nNotwithstanding this, Richard continued to release albums with [[contemporary Christian music]] content in parallel with his rock and pop albums, for example: ''[[Small Corners]]'' from 1978 contained the single \"Yes He Lives\". On 31 December 1976, he performed his latest single, \"Hey, Mr. Dream Maker\", on BBC1's ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].\n\nIn 1979, Richard teamed up once again with producer [[Bruce Welch]] for the pop hit single \"[[We Don't Talk Anymore (Cliff Richard song)|We Don't Talk Anymore]]\", written and composed by [[Alan Tarney]], which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. [[Bryan Ferry]] added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile]],'' which was re-titled ''We Don't Talk Anymore'' for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0723771/trivia |title=Cliff Richard \u2013 Trivia|publisher=IMDb |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> Later in 1979, Richard performed with [[Kate Bush]] at the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]'s 75th anniversary celebration at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mendelssohn |first=John |title=Waiting For Kate Bush |date=15 November 2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/?id=i30JTVKbyjcC&pg=PT153&dq=cliff+richard+albert+hall+kate+bush#v=onepage&q=cliff%20richard%20albert%20hall%20kate%20bush&f=false|isbn=9780857123237 }}</ref>\n\nWith \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" in 1979, Richard finally began to receive some extended success in the United States to follow on from the success of \"Devil Woman\" in 1976. In 1980, \"[[Carrie (Cliff Richard song)|Carrie]]\" broke into the US top 40, followed by \"[[Dreamin' (Cliff Richard song)|Dreamin']]\", which reached No. 10. His 1980 duet \"[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]\" with Olivia Newton-John, from the film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', peaked at No. 20, followed by \"[[A Little in Love (Cliff Richard song)|A Little in Love]]\" (No. 17) and \"[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]\" (No. 23) in 1981. After many years of limited success in the US, three of his singles simultaneously charted on the last [[Hot 100]] of 1980 (\"A Little in Love\", \"Dreamin'\", and \"Suddenly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-12-27 |title=The Hot 100 |work=Billboard |date=27 December 1980 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK meanwhile, \"Carrie\" reached No. 4 and \"Dreamin'\" peaked at No. 8.

To finish the year, \"Daddy's Home\" hit No. 2 in the UK. On the singles chart, Richard was having his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid-1960s. He also was amassing a string of top ten albums, including ''[[I'm No Hero]]'', ''[[Wired for Sound]]'', ''[[Now You See Me, Now You Don't (album)|Now You See Me, Now You Don't]]'', a live album he recorded with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] titled ''[[Dressed for the Occasion (Cliff Richard album)|Dressed for the Occasion]]'', and ''[[Silver (Cliff Richard album)|Silver]]'', marking his 25th year in show business in 1983.\n\nIn 1986, Richard reached No. 1 by teaming up with [[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]] to re-record his smash hit \"[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]\" for the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Along with the song, the recording contained comedy dialogue between Richard and the Young Ones. That same year Richard opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] as a rock musician called upon to defend Earth in a trial set in the Andromeda Galaxy in the [[multi-media]] [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] musical ''[[Time (musical)|Time]]''. Three Richard singles, \"She's So Beautiful\", which reached No. 17 in the UK, \"It's in Every One of Us\" and \"Born To Rock 'n Roll\", were released over 1985 and 1986 from the [[Time (Dave Clark album)|concept album recorded for ''Time'']].\n\nIn August 1986, Richard was involved in a five-car crash in torrential rain on the [[M4 motorway]] in West London. Richard's car was a write-off as another car swerved and braked hard. Richard hurt his back in the accident but was not seriously injured. Police called for a cab from the accident scene so that he was able to perform that night in the \"Time\" musical. After the show, Richard said: \"I'm lucky to be here\". He said that his seatbelt had prevented him from flying through the windscreen.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pop Star Performs Despite Car Accident |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19860827&id=Oc9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9wYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1328,6177556 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |date=27 August 1986 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1986, \"[[All I Ask of You]]\", a duet that Richard recorded with [[Sarah Brightman]] from the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical version of [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/All+I+Ask+Of+You|title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 All I Ask of You by Cliff Richard And Sarah Brightman Search|date=6 May 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref> 1987 saw the release of his ''[[Always Guaranteed]]'' album, which became his best-selling album of all-new material, and included the two top-10 hit singles \"[[My Pretty One]]\" and \"[[Some People (Cliff Richard song)|Some People]]\".\n\nRichard concluded his thirtieth year in music by achieving a UK Christmas No. 1 single in 1988 with \"[[Mistletoe and Wine]]\", while simultaneously holding the No. 1 positions on the album and video charts with the compilation ''[[Private Collection: 1979\u20131988|Private Collection]]'', which summed up his biggest hits from 1979 to 1988. \"Mistletoe and Wine\" was Richard's 99th UK single and spent four weeks at the top of the chart.

In 1994, the compilation ''[[The Hit List (Cliff Richard album)|The Hit List]]'' was released, meanwhile in the background, Richard was concentrating on bringing the musical ''[[Heathcliff (musical)|Heathcliff]]'' to the stage.\n\nWith Richard's succession of hit songs and albums from the late 1970s into the early 1980s, followed by another strong run in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a strong fan base had been reestablished and Richard remained one of the best-known music artists in the country. Over the decade of the 1980s he recorded with [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Phil Everly]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[Sheila Walsh (singer)|Sheila Walsh]] and [[Van Morrison]]. Meanwhile, the Shadows later re-formed (and again split).

The Webbs moved from comparative wealth in India, where they lived in a company-supplied flat at [[Howrah]] near [[Calcutta]], to a [[semi-detached]] house in [[Carshalton]]. Harry Webb attended a local primary school, Stanley Park Juniors, in Carshalton. In 1949 his father obtained employment in the credit control office of [[Thorn Electrical Industries]] and the family moved in with other relatives in [[Waltham Cross]], Hertfordshire, where he attended Kings Road Junior Mixed Infants School until a three-bedroom council house in [[Cheshunt]] was allocated to them in 1950, at 12 Hargreaves Close.\n\nHe then attended Cheshunt Secondary Modern School from 1952 to 1957.

The 1950s entrepreneur Harry Greatorex wanted the up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer to change from his real name of Harry Webb. The name ''Cliff'' was adopted as it sounded like \"cliff face\", which suggested \"Rock\". It was \"[[Move It]]\" writer [[Ian Samwell]] who suggested the surname \"Richard\" as a tribute to Webb's musical hero [[Little Richard]].<ref name=\"contactmusic.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=7524 |title=Move It by Cliff Richard Songfacts |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=2 November 2008 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore their first large-scale appearance, at the Regal Ballroom in [[Ripley, Derbyshire]] in 1958, they adopted the name \"Cliff Richard and the Drifters\". The four members were Harry Webb (by then going under the stage name \"Cliff Richard\"), Ian Samwell on guitar, Terry Smart on drums and Norman Mitham on guitar. None of the other three played with the later and better known [[The Shadows|Shadows]], although Samwell wrote songs for Richard's later career.\n\nFor his debut session, [[Norrie Paramor]] provided Richard with \"Schoolboy Crush\", a song previously recorded by an American, [[Bobby Helms]]. Richard was permitted to record one of his own songs for the [[B-side]]; this was \"Move It\", written and composed by the Drifters' Samwell while he was on board a number 715 [[Green Line Coaches|Green Line]] bus on the way to Richard's house for a rehearsal. For the \"Move It\" session, Paramor used the session guitarist Ernie Shears on lead guitar and Frank Clark on bass.\n\nThere are various stories about why the A-side was replaced by the intended B-side. One is that Norrie Paramor's young daughter raved about the B-side; another was that influential TV producer [[Jack Good (producer)|Jack Good]], who used the act <!--another word needed for the act?-->for his TV show ''[[Oh Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy!]]'', wanted the only song on his show to be \"Move It\".<!--the only song to be sung on his show, or Move It as opposed to Schoolboy Crush?--><ref>Richard himself stated that the latter theory is correct; interviewed for the first episode of the [[BBC Four]] programme, ''Pop Britannia'', broadcast on 4 January 2008.</ref> Richard was quoted as saying:\n{{quote|It's wonderful to be going on TV for the first time, but I feel so nervous that I don't know what to do.

Like previous British rockers such as [[Tommy Steele]] and [[Marty Wilde]], Richard adopted Elvis-like dress and hairstyle. In performance he struck a pose of rock attitude, rarely smiling or looking at the audience or camera. His late 1958 and early 1959 follow-up singles, \"High Class Baby\" and \"Livin' Lovin' Doll\", were followed by \"Mean Streak\", which carried a rocker's sense of speed and passion, and [[Lionel Bart]]'s \"[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]\".\n\nIt was on \"Living Doll\" that the Drifters began to back Richard on record. It was his fifth record and became his first No. 1 single. By that time, the group's line-up had changed with the arrival of [[Jet Harris]], [[Tony Meehan]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Bruce Welch]]. The group was obliged to change its name to \"The Shadows\" after legal complications with the American group [[the Drifters]] as \"Living Doll\" entered the American top 40, licensed by [[ABC-Paramount]]. \"Living Doll\" was used in Richard's d\u00e9but film ''[[Serious Charge]]'', but it was arranged as a country standard, rather than a rock and roll standard.\n\nThe Shadows were not a typical backing group. They became contractually separate from Richard, and the group received no royalties for records backing Richard. In 1959, the Shadows (then still the Drifters) landed an [[EMI]] recording contract of their own, for independent recordings. That year, they released three singles, two of which featured double-sided vocals and one of which had instrumental A and B sides. They thereafter had several major hits, including five UK No. 1s. The band also continued to appear and record with Richard and wrote many of his hits. On more than one occasion, a Shadows instrumental replaced a Richard song at the top of the British charts.\n\nRichard's fifth single \"Living Doll\" triggered a softer, more relaxed, sound. Subsequent hits, the No. 1s \"[[Travellin' Light]]\" and \"[[I Love You (Cliff Richard song)|I Love You]]\" and also \"A Voice in the Wilderness\", lifted from his film ''[[Expresso Bongo]]'', and \"Theme for a Dream\" cemented Richard's status as a mainstream pop entertainer along with contemporaries such as [[Adam Faith]] and [[Billy Fury]]. Throughout the early 1960s, his hits were consistently in the top five.\n\nIn 1961, EMI records organised Richard's 21st birthday party at its London headquarters in Manchester Square led by his producer Norrie Paramor. Photographs of the celebrations were incorporated into Richard's next album \"21 Today\" in which Tony Meehan joined in despite, then, having very recently left the Shadows to be replaced by Brian Bennett.\n\nTypically, the Shadows closed the first half of the show with a 30-minute set of their own, then backed Richard on his show-closing 45-minute stint as exemplified by the retrospective CD album release of ''Live at the ABC Kingston 1962''. Tony Meehan and Jet Harris left the group in 1961 and 1962 respectively and later had their own chart successes for [[Decca Records|Decca]]. The Shadows added bass players [[Brian Locking]] (1962\u201363) and then [[John Rostill]] (1963\u201368) and took on [[Brian Bennett (musician)|Brian Bennett]] permanently on drums.\n\nIn the early years, particularly on album and EP releases, Richard also recorded ballads backed by the Norrie Paramor Orchestra with Tony Meehan (and later Brian Bennett) as a session drummer. His first such single without the Shadows was [[When the Girl in Your Arms Is the Girl in Your Heart]] in 1961, and he continued to release one or two per year, including covers of \"[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]\" in 1963 and \"[[L'Edera (song)|Constantly]]\" in 1964, a revival of a popular Italian hit. In 1965, sessions under the direction of [[Billy Sherrill]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] were particularly successful, yielding \"[[The Minute You're Gone]]\", which topped the UK singles chart and \"Wind Me Up (Let Me Go)\" which made No. 2.\n\nRichard, and the Shadows in particular, however, never achieved star status in the United States. In 1960 they toured the United States and were well-received, but lacklustre support and distribution from a revolving door of American record labels proved an obstacle to long-term success there despite several chart records by Richard including the aforementioned \"[[It's All in the Game (song)|It's All in the Game]]\" on Epic, via a renewed linking of the worldwide Columbia labels after Philips ended its distribution deal with CBS. To the Shadows' chagrin, \"[[Apache (single)|Apache]]\" reached No. 2 in the US through a cover version by Danish guitarist [[Jorgen Ingmann]] which was almost unchanged from their worldwide hit. Richard and the band appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', which was crucial for the Beatles, but these performances did not help them gain sustained success in North America.\n\nRichard and the Shadows appeared in six feature films including a debut in the 1959 film ''[[Serious Charge]]'' but most notably in ''[[The Young Ones (1961 film)|The Young Ones]]'', ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]'', ''[[Wonderful Life (1964 film)|Wonderful Life]]'', and ''[[Finders Keepers (1966 film)|Finders Keepers]]''. These films created their own genre, known as the \"Cliff Richard musical\", and led to Richard being named the No. 1 cinema box office attraction in Britain for both 1962 and 1963, beating that of even James Bond.<ref>'Top Box Office Stars of 1962, ''Motion Picture Herald'' 1962</ref> The [[The Young Ones (song)|title song]] of ''The Young Ones'' became his biggest-selling single in the United Kingdom, selling over one million copies in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-uk-s-million-selling-singles__6907/ |title=Official Charts &#124; The UK's million selling singles |publisher=Official Charts |accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> The irreverent 1980s TV [[British sitcom|sitcom]] ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'' took its name from Richard's 1962 film. In mid-1963, Cliff and the Shadows appeared for a season in [[Blackpool]], where Richard had his portrait modelled by Victor Heyfron.\n\n===1964\u20131975: Changing circumstances===\nAs with the other existing rock acts in Britain, Richard's career was affected by the advent of the Beatles and the [[Beat music|Mersey sound]] in 1963 and 1964. He continued to be popular, and have hits in the charts throughout the 1960s, though not at the level that he had enjoyed before. Nor did doors open to him in the US market; he was not considered part of the [[British Invasion]], and despite four Hot 100 hits (including the top 25 \"It's All in the Game\") between August 1963 and August 1964, the American public had little awareness of him.\n\nRichard's 1965 UK No. 12 hit \"On My Word\" ended a run of 23 consecutive top ten UK hits between \"A Voice in the Wilderness\" in 1960 to \"The Minute You're Gone\" in 1965, which, to date, is still a record number of consecutive top ten UK hits for a male artist.<ref name=\"everyHit.com\"/> Richard continued having international hits, including 1967's \"The Day I Met Marie\", which reached No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart and No. 5 in the [[ARIA Charts|Australian]] charts.\n\nAlthough [[Baptism|baptised]] as an [[Anglican]], Richard did not practice the faith in his early years. In 1964, he became an active Christian and his faith has become an important aspect of his life. Standing up publicly as a Christian affected his career in several ways. Initially, he believed that he should quit rock 'n' roll, feeling he could no longer be the rocker who had been called a \"crude exhibitionist\" and \"too sexy for TV\". Richard intended at first to \"reform his ways\" and become a teacher, but Christian friends advised him not to abandon his career just because he had become an active Christian. Soon after, Richard re-emerged, performing with Christian groups and recording some Christian material. He still recorded secular songs with the Shadows, but devoted a lot of his time to Christian work, including appearances with the [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]] crusades. As time progressed, Richard balanced his faith and work, enabling him to remain one of the most popular singers in Britain as well as one of its best-known Christians.\n\nRichard acted in the 1967 film ''[[Two a Penny]]'', released by Billy Graham's [[World Wide Pictures]],<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140642/ Two a Penny (1967) IMDB.com] <!--Retrieved 22 September 2008--></ref> in which he played Jamie Hopkins, a young man who gets involved in [[drug dealing]] while questioning his life after his girlfriend changes her attitude. He released the live album ''Cliff in Japan'' in 1967.\n\nIn 1968, he sang the UK's entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], \"[[Congratulations (Cliff Richard song)|Congratulations]]\", written and composed by [[Bill Martin (musician)|Bill Martin]] and [[Phil Coulter]]; it lost, however, by one point to Spain's \"[[La, la, la|La La La]]\". According to [[John Kennedy O'Connor]]'s ''The Eurovision Song Contest\u2014The Official History'', this was the closest result yet in the contest and Richard locked himself in the toilet to avoid the nerves of the voting.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. Richard says: Spain is the best of Eurovision Song Contest.</ref> In May 2008, a [[Reuters]] news report claimed that voting in the competition had been fixed by the Spanish dictator leader, [[Francisco Franco]], to ensure that the Spanish entry won, allowing them to host the contest the following year (1969). It is claimed that Spanish [[Televisi\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|TVE]] television executives offered to buy programmes in exchange for votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUKL0556354420080505 |title=Reuters |agency=Reuters |date= 5 May 2008|accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Govan |first=Fiona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/1926993/How-Franco-cheated-Cliff-of-victory-in-Eurovision.html |title=How Franco cheated Cliff out of Eurovision title |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=4 May 2008 |accessdate=29 January 2012}}</ref> The story was widely covered and featured on UK's ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' as a main story on 7 May 2008, with [[Jon Snow (journalist)|Jon Snow]] interviewing author and historian [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] about the matter.<ref>{{cite web|author=JKMMOC |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiF3Ylj6oRM&feature=channel_page |title=EUROVISION CHANNEL 4 NEWS May 7, 2008 |via=YouTube |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Eurovision later ended voting by national juries in a bid to eradicate such alleged scams. Nevertheless, \"Congratulations\" was a huge hit throughout Europe and Australia, and yet another No. 1 in April 1968.\n\nAfter the Shadows split in 1968, Richard continued to record.\n[[Image:Sir Cliff Richard Allan Warren.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Portrait by [[Allan Warren]] (1973)]]\nDuring the 1970s, Richard took part in several television shows and fronted his own show ''It's Cliff Richard'' from 1970 to 1976. It starred [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Hank Marvin]] and [[Una Stubbs]], and included ''A Song for Europe''. He began 1970 by appearing live on the [[BBC]]'s review of the sixties music scene, ''[[Pop Go The Sixties]]'', which was broadcast across Britain and Europe on 31 December 1969. He performed \"Bachelor Boy\" with the Shadows and \"Congratulations\" solo. In 1972, he made a short BBC television comedy film called ''The Case'' with appearances from comedians and his first ever duets with a woman\u2014Newton-John. He went on to release a double live album, ''Cliff Live in Japan 1972'', which featured Newton-John.\n\nHis final acting role on the silver screen to date was in 1973, when he starred in the film ''[[Take Me High]]''.\n\nIn 1973, he sang the British Eurovision entry \"[[Power to All Our Friends]];\" the song finished third, close behind Luxembourg's \"[[Tu Te Reconna\u00eetras]]\" and Spain's \"[[Eres T\u00fa (Mocedades song)|Eres T\u00fa]].\" This time, Richard took [[Diazepam|Valium]] to overcome his nerves and his manager was almost unable to wake him for the performance.<ref>O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest \u2013 The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}</ref> Richard also hosted the BBC's qualifying heat for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], ''[[A Song for Europe]],'' in 1970, 1971 and 1972 as part of his BBCTV variety series. He presented the [[Eurovision Song Contest Previews]] for the BBC in 1971 and 1972.\n\nIn 1975, he released the single \"[[Honky Tonk Angel (Cliff Richard song)|Honky Tonk Angel]],\" produced by Hank Marvin and John Farrar, oblivious to its connotations or hidden meanings. As soon as he was notified that a \"honky-tonk angel\" was southern US slang for a prostitute, the horrified Richard ordered EMI to withdraw it and refused to promote it despite making a video for it. EMI agreed to his demand despite the fact the single was expected to sell well. About 1,000 copies are known to exist on vinyl.\n\n===1976\u20131994: Renaissance===\nIn 1976, the decision was made to repackage Richard as a \"rock\" artist. That year Bruce Welch relaunched Cliff's career and produced the landmark album ''[[I'm Nearly Famous]]'', which included the successful but controversial guitar-driven track \"[[Devil Woman (Cliff Richard song)|Devil Woman]]\", which became Richard's first true hit in the United States, and the ballad \"[[Miss You Nights]]\". In reviewing the new album in ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Geoff Brown heralded it the renaissance of Richard.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steve Turner|title=Cliff Richard: The Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He0S6tFOGPUC&pg=PA270|year=2008|publisher=Lion Books|isbn=978-0-7459-5279-6|page=270}}</ref> Richard's fans were excited about this revival of a performer who had been a part of British rock from its early days. Many music names such as [[Jimmy Page]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Elton John]] were seen sporting ''I'm Nearly Famous'' badges, pleased that their boyhood idol was getting back into the heavier rock in which he had begun his career.\n\nNotwithstanding this, Richard continued to release albums with [[contemporary Christian music]] content in parallel with his rock and pop albums, for example: ''[[Small Corners]]'' from 1978 contained the single \"Yes He Lives\". On 31 December 1976, he performed his latest single, \"Hey, Mr. Dream Maker\", on BBC1's ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British pop music for Queen [[Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]].\n\nIn 1979, Richard teamed up once again with producer [[Bruce Welch]] for the pop hit single \"[[We Don't Talk Anymore (Cliff Richard song)|We Don't Talk Anymore]]\", written and composed by [[Alan Tarney]], which hit No. 1 in the UK and No. 7 in the US. [[Bryan Ferry]] added hummed backing vocals to the song. The record made Richard the first act to reach the Hot 100's top 40 in the 1980s who had also been there in each of the three previous decades. The song was quickly added onto the end of his latest album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Juvenile]],'' which was re-titled ''We Don't Talk Anymore'' for its release in the United States. It was his first time at the top of the UK singles chart in over ten years and the song would become his biggest-selling single worldwide, selling almost five million copies throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/name/nm0723771/trivia |title=Cliff Richard \u2013 Trivia|publisher=IMDb |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> Later in 1979, Richard performed with [[Kate Bush]] at the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]'s 75th anniversary celebration at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Mendelssohn |first=John |title=Waiting For Kate Bush |date=15 November 2004 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/?id=i30JTVKbyjcC&pg=PT153&dq=cliff+richard+albert+hall+kate+bush#v=onepage&q=cliff%20richard%20albert%20hall%20kate%20bush&f=false|isbn=9780857123237 }}</ref>\n\nWith \"We Don't Talk Anymore\" in 1979, Richard finally began to receive some extended success in the United States to follow on from the success of \"Devil Woman\" in 1976. In 1980, \"[[Carrie (Cliff Richard song)|Carrie]]\" broke into the US top 40, followed by \"[[Dreamin' (Cliff Richard song)|Dreamin']]\", which reached No. 10. His 1980 duet \"[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]\" with Olivia Newton-John, from the film ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'', peaked at No. 20, followed by \"[[A Little in Love (Cliff Richard song)|A Little in Love]]\" (No. 17) and \"[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]\" (No. 23) in 1981. After many years of limited success in the US, three of his singles simultaneously charted on the last [[Hot 100]] of 1980 (\"A Little in Love\", \"Dreamin'\", and \"Suddenly\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1980-12-27 |title=The Hot 100 |work=Billboard |date=27 December 1980 |accessdate=1 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK meanwhile, \"Carrie\" reached No. 4 and \"Dreamin'\" peaked at No. 8.

To finish the year, \"Daddy's Home\" hit No. 2 in the UK. On the singles chart, Richard was having his most consistent period of top twenty hits since the mid-1960s. He also was amassing a string of top ten albums, including ''[[I'm No Hero]]'', ''[[Wired for Sound]]'', ''[[Now You See Me, Now You Don't (album)|Now You See Me, Now You Don't]]'', a live album he recorded with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] titled ''[[Dressed for the Occasion (Cliff Richard album)|Dressed for the Occasion]]'', and ''[[Silver (Cliff Richard album)|Silver]]'', marking his 25th year in show business in 1983.\n\nIn 1986, Richard reached No. 1 by teaming up with [[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]] to re-record his smash hit \"[[Living Doll (song)|Living Doll]]\" for the charity [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. Along with the song, the recording contained comedy dialogue between Richard and the Young Ones. That same year Richard opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] as a rock musician called upon to defend Earth in a trial set in the Andromeda Galaxy in the [[multi-media]] [[Dave Clark (musician)|Dave Clark]] musical ''[[Time (musical)|Time]]''. Three Richard singles, \"She's So Beautiful\", which reached No. 17 in the UK, \"It's in Every One of Us\" and \"Born To Rock 'n Roll\", were released over 1985 and 1986 from the [[Time (Dave Clark album)|concept album recorded for ''Time'']].\n\nIn August 1986, Richard was involved in a five-car crash in torrential rain on the [[M4 motorway]] in West London. Richard's car was a write-off as another car swerved and braked hard. Richard hurt his back in the accident but was not seriously injured. Police called for a cab from the accident scene so that he was able to perform that night in the \"Time\" musical. After the show, Richard said: \"I'm lucky to be here\". He said that his seatbelt had prevented him from flying through the windscreen.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pop Star Performs Despite Car Accident |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19860827&id=Oc9PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9wYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1328,6177556 |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |date=27 August 1986 |accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1986, \"[[All I Ask of You]]\", a duet that Richard recorded with [[Sarah Brightman]] from the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] musical version of [[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]] reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/All+I+Ask+Of+You|title=The Official Charts Company \u2013 All I Ask of You by Cliff Richard And Sarah Brightman Search|date=6 May 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref> 1987 saw the release of his ''[[Always Guaranteed]]'' album, which became his best-selling album of all-new material, and included the two top-10 hit singles \"[[My Pretty One]]\" and \"[[Some People (Cliff Richard song)|Some People]]\".\n\nRichard concluded his thirtieth year in music by achieving a UK Christmas No. 1 single in 1988 with \"[[Mistletoe and Wine]]\", while simultaneously holding the No. 1 positions on the album and video charts with the compilation ''[[Private Collection: 1979\u20131988|Private Collection]]'', which summed up his biggest hits from 1979 to 1988. \"Mistletoe and Wine\" was Richard's 99th UK single and spent four weeks at the top of the chart.

Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nKali Linux popularity grew when it was featured in multiple episodes of the TV series [[Mr. Robot]].

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled.

Most packages Kali uses are imported from the Debian [[Software repository|repositories]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://docs.kali.org/policy/kali-linux-relationship-with-debian |title=Kali's Relationship With Debian |publisher=Kali Linux |date=2013-03-11 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe Kali Linux project began quietly in 2012, when Offensive Security decided that they wanted to replace their venerable [[BackTrack]] Linux project, which was manually maintained, with something that could become a genuine [[Debian]] derivative, complete with all of the required infrastructure and improved packaging techniques. The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nKali Linux popularity grew when it was featured in multiple episodes of the TV series [[Mr. Robot]].

This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting is disabled.
