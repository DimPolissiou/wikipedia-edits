{"title_page": "Symphony No. 3 (Ch\u00e1vez)", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Concha Ac\u00fastica of Bello Monte.jpg|thumb|Anfiteatro Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas, Caracas, where Ch\u00e1vez's Third Symphony was premiered]]\nThe '''Symphony No. 3''' by [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]] was composed in 1951\u201354 on a commission from [[Clare Boothe Luce]], and is dedicated to the memory of her daughter, Anne Clare Brokaw.\n\n==History==\nCh\u00e1vez had evidently met former U.S. congresswoman, ambassador, publisher, playwright, and journalist Clare Boothe Luce in Florence at some point in the late 1940s. An unlikely friendship sprang up between them, which continued for nearly three decades. In February 1950 Luce came to Mexico City for a week of cultural exploration, and on 18 February 1950 wrote on a scrap of newspaper a commission for a musical work (initially envisioned as a piano concerto), \"for Ann Clare Brokaw the most beautiful and sad and gay thing you ever wrote that has her lovely face and my broken heart in it\". Brokaw, who had died as the result of an automobile accident in 1944 at the age of nineteen, was Mrs. Luce's only child, from her first marriage {{harv|Parker|1984|loc=48\u201349}}.\n\nComposition of the Third Symphony began in 1951, but was interrupted repeatedly. After completing the first movement and a large part of the second, Ch\u00e1vez fell ill. By the time he recovered, there were more urgent deadlines requiring Ch\u00e1vez to put the score aside in order to work on the [[Symphony No. 4 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fifth Symphonies]], both of which were completed before the Third. In April 1954 Ch\u00e1vez resumed work, completing the piano score on 14 June and the full score by the end of the same month ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=152\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Parker|1984|loc=65}}). It was premiered in the Anfiteatro [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas]] in Caracas, Venezuela, by the [[Venezuela Symphony Orchestra|Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Venezuela]], conducted by the composer. According to {{harvtxt|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=80}}, this was on 9 December 1954, though others put the date at 11 December 1954 ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=153}}; {{harvnb|Weinstock|1959|loc=15}}). It received further performances, in Europe in June 1955 at the [[International Society for Contemporary Music|I.S.C.M. Festival]] in Baden-Baden (in an orchestral concert conducted by [[Ernest Bour]]), in London with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro]] (29 November 1955), and in the United States, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton (26 January 1956) ({{harvnb|Copland|1955|loc=10}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|1956|loc=34}}; {{harvnb|Reizenstein|1955|loc=8}}; {{harvnb|Taubman|1956}}). Thanks to the efforts of his friend [[Aaron Copland]], Ch\u00e1vez was able to secure a contract with Boosey & Hawkes in 1955, and the Third Symphony was the first of his works published by that firm {{harv|Parker|1987|loc=436\u201337}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), harp, and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Third Symphony consists of four movements:\n#Introduzione: Andante moderato\n#Allegro\n#Scherzo\n#Finale\n\nThe opening movement introduces a number of thematic elements that will be developed throughout the symphony\u2014a procedure known as [[cyclic form]] {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=73}}. The character at the outset is dramatic and tense, recalling somewhat the \"Greek\" style of the ''[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]'' and the ballet ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=154\u201355}}. Later in the movement (at rehearsal-number 16), a jarring contrast is created when Ch\u00e1vez introduces a universally familiar five-note children's chant, a figure that is also found in a number of the composer's contemporaneous and earlier works\u2014the Fourth Symphony, the choral works ''Tierra mojada'' and ''Llamadas'', and the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor]]''\u2014whose presence here may be explained by a hidden program connected to the terms of the Symphony's commission {{harv|Parker|1991|loc=160\u201364}}.\n\nAfter the slow first movement, the fast tempo and [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] design of the second movement more closely resembles the traditional opening movement of a symphony. This Allegro is the main focus of the symphony because of the solidity of its formal structure and its greater length than the other movements {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=74}}. To describe it as a sonata-allegro, however, refers to its character but not its form, which is both simple and original. Ch\u00e1vez replaces the usual [[Exposition (music)|exposition]]\u2013[[Musical development|development]]\u2013[[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] with two alternating sections, each of which occurs three times. Development occurs during the appearances of the second of these, through either the reappearance of motives from the first section, or the production from them of variants {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987b|loc=89}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Six Symphonies of Carlos Ch\u00e1vez''.

An unlikely friendship sprang up between them, which continued for nearly three decades. In February 1950 Luce came to Mexico City for a week of cultural exploration, and on 18 February 1950 wrote on a scrap of newspaper a commission for a musical work (initially envisioned as a piano concerto), \"for Ann Clare Brokaw the most beautiful and sad and gay thing you ever wrote that has her lovely face and my broken heart in it\". Brokaw, who had died as the result of an automobile accident in 1944 at the age of nineteen, was Mrs. Luce's only child, from her first marriage {{harv|Parker|1984|loc=48\u201349}}.\n\nComposition of the Third Symphony began in 1951, but was interrupted repeatedly. After completing the first movement and a large part of the second, Ch\u00e1vez fell ill. By the time he recovered, there were more urgent deadlines requiring Ch\u00e1vez to put the score aside in order to work on the [[Symphony No. 4 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fourth]] and [[Symphony No. 5 (Ch\u00e1vez)|Fifth Symphonies]], both of which were completed before the Third. In April 1954 Ch\u00e1vez resumed work, completing the piano score on 14 June and the full score by the end of the same month ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=152\u201353}}; {{harvnb|Parker|1984|loc=65}}). It was premiered in the Anfiteatro [[Jos\u00e9 \u00c1ngel Lamas]] in Caracas, Venezuela, by the [[Venezuela Symphony Orchestra|Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Venezuela]], conducted by the composer. According to {{harvtxt|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=80}}, this was on 9 December 1954, though others put the date at 11 December 1954 ({{harvnb|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=153}}; {{harvnb|Weinstock|1959|loc=15}}). It received further performances, in Europe in June 1955 at the [[International Society for Contemporary Music|I.S.C.M. Festival]] in Baden-Baden (in an orchestral concert conducted by [[Ernest Bour]]), in London with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Castro]] (29 November 1955), and in the United States, with the [[New York Philharmonic]] under the composer's baton (26 January 1956) ({{harvnb|Copland|1955|loc=10}}; {{harvnb|Mitchell|1956|loc=34}}; {{harvnb|Reizenstein|1955|loc=8}}; {{harvnb|Taubman|1956}}). Thanks to the efforts of his friend [[Aaron Copland]], Ch\u00e1vez was able to secure a contract with Boosey & Hawkes in 1955, and the Third Symphony was the first of his works published by that firm {{harv|Parker|1987|loc=436\u201337}}.\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons (third doubling contrabassoon), four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (three players), harp, and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe Third Symphony consists of four movements:\n#Introduzione: Andante moderato\n#Allegro\n#Scherzo\n#Finale\n\nThe opening movement introduces a number of thematic elements that will be developed throughout the symphony\u2014a procedure known as [[cyclic form]] {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=73}}. The character at the outset is dramatic and tense, recalling somewhat the \"Greek\" style of the ''[[Sinfon\u00eda de Ant\u00edgona]]'' and the ballet ''[[La hija de C\u00f3lquide]]'' {{harv|Garc\u00eda Morillo|1960|loc=154\u201355}}. Later in the movement (at rehearsal-number 16), a jarring contrast is created when Ch\u00e1vez introduces a universally familiar five-note children's chant, a figure that is also found in a number of the composer's contemporaneous and earlier works\u2014the Fourth Symphony, the choral works ''Tierra mojada'' and ''Llamadas'', and the ballet ''[[Caballos de vapor]]''\u2014whose presence here may be explained by a hidden program connected to the terms of the Symphony's commission {{harv|Parker|1991|loc=160\u201364}}.\n\nAfter the slow first movement, the fast tempo and [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]] design of the second movement more closely resembles the traditional opening movement of a symphony. This Allegro is the main focus of the symphony because of the solidity of its formal structure and its greater length than the other movements {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=74}}. To describe it as a sonata-allegro, however, refers to its character but not its form, which is both simple and original. Ch\u00e1vez replaces the usual [[Exposition (music)|exposition]]\u2013[[Musical development|development]]\u2013[[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] with two alternating sections, each of which occurs three times. Development occurs during the appearances of the second of these, through either the reappearance of motives from the first section, or the production from them of variants {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987b|loc=89}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Six Symphonies of Carlos Ch\u00e1vez''.
