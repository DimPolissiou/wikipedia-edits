In pop music circles, as a [[teen idol]] he became known as \"The Polish Prince\", as his music pays tribute to his Polish heritage. His most popular song was \"[[Blue Velvet (song)|Blue Velvet]]\", a cover of [[Tony Bennett]]'s 1951 song, which reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1963 and number two in the UK in 1990. It also served as inspiration for [[Blue Velvet (film)|the film]] of the same name.\n\n==Early life==\nVinton was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, the only child of locally popular [[bandleader]] Stan Vinton and Dorothy Studzinski Vinton.<ref name=Hits>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZcgdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=gGEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6469,1592699&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en|title=Bobby Vinton Finds That Hits Can Be Elusive|author=Bishop, Pete|date=5 June 1983|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> He is of Polish and Lithuanian descent.

These streets were built in the late 1970s; prior attempts to name a residential street after him failed.  The residents did not care for the singer always using Pittsburgh as his home town on TV interviews. Como always claimed Canonsburg as his hometown, so hundreds of people changed their address when the town renamed a street in the east end after Perry Como. The Canonsburg town fathers had plans to erect a statue in Vinton's honor, but Vinton himself vetoed the idea, noting that the $100,000 planned cost could go to far more important town needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k7ciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H7UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1150,7087216&dq=bobby+vinton+statue&hl=en|title=Vinton:Tribute is Just Too Much|date=28 December 2004|publisher=Beaver Country Times|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1960s===\nAfter two years' service in the [[United States Army]], where he served as a chaplain's assistant, Vinton was signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1960 as a bandleader: \"A Young Man With a Big Band\". The break for the Epic Records contract had come after Vinton and his band appeared on [[Guy Lombardo]]'s ''TV Talent Scouts'' program.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Slow/> However, two albums, ''Bobby Vinton Dancing At The Hop'' and ''Bobby Vinton Plays for his Lil Darlin's'' as well as several singles were not successful, and with Epic ready to drop him from its roster, Vinton found his first hit [[single (music)|single]] literally sitting in a reject pile.<ref name=Wilson/> The song was titled \"[[Roses Are Red (My Love)]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1220}}</ref> Vinton had to do his own promotion for the song; he bought one thousand copies and hired a young woman to deliver a copy of the record and a dozen red roses to every local DJ.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Velvet>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OTkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OXADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6287,560151&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en|title=Bobby Vinton still smooth as blue velvet|author=Hayes, John|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2 March 2002|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> It spent four weeks at [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1962|number one]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was also a hit on the Country and R&B charts. The success of the song pushed Epic to renew Vinton's contract and change his status from bandleader to solo singer.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/\nEpic A&R man Bob Morgan had worked with Bobby on the sessions that created the material for the Roses are Red album which was rushed out to capitalize on the success of the hit single.  Morgan wanted to duplicate that records success with another nursery rhyme single and found it in a song called \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". There was only one problem. A small record label owned a recording that Vinton had made before the famous Roses Are Red session.  Anxious to capitalize on Vinton's sudden success, Diamond Records quickly pressed and released \"[[I Love You The Way You Are]]\" getting airplay around the country the week before Epic Records could release \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". The result for Vinton was a trainwreck that had him calling radio stations asking them not to play his own song.  On August 25th 1962 Vinton had 3 45 singles on the \"[[Cashbox Hot 100 Singles Chart]]\" competing with each other for sales.\nArguably, his most famous song is 1963's \"[[Blue Velvet (Tony Bennett song)|Blue Velvet]],\" originally a minor hit for [[Tony Bennett]] in 1951, that also went to [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1963|number one]]. 23 years later, [[David Lynch]] named his movie ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' after the song.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1990, \"Blue Velvet\" reached number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], after being featured in a [[Nivea]] commercial. The 1990 reissue also hit number 3 in the Irish Singles Chart and number 7 in Australia.\n\nIn 1964, Vinton had two number 1 hits, \"[[There! I've Said It Again]]\" (a number 1 hit in 1945 for [[Vaughn Monroe]]) and \"[[Mr. Lonely (Bobby Vinton song)|Mr. Lonely]]\".  Vinton's version of \"There! I've Said It Again\" is noteworthy for being the last U.S. ''Billboard'' number-one single of the pre-[[Beatles]] era, deposed from the Hot 100's summit by \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\".  Also noteworthy is the fact that Vinton continued to have big hit records during the [[British Invasion]], scoring 16 top-ten hits, while [[Connie Francis]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Shirelles]], and other major artists of the early 1960s struggled to reach even the Top 30, though many of them would remain popular in concerts or continue to have hits for certain periods of time.\n\nVinton wrote \"Mr. Lonely\" during his chaplain's assistant service in the U.S. Army in the late 1950s. The song was recorded during the same 1962 session that produced \"[[Roses Are Red (My Love)|Roses Are Red]]\" and launched Vinton's singing career.  It was released as an album track on the 1962 ''[[Roses Are Red (album)|Roses Are Red]] (and other songs for the young & sentimental)'' LP. Despite pressure from Vinton to release it as a single, Epic instead had [[Buddy Greco]] release it and it flopped.  Two years and millions of records sold later, Bobby prevailed on Epic to include \"Mr. Lonely\" on his ''[[Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits (1964 album)|Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits]]'' LP.  Soon DJs picked up on the song and airplay resulted in demand for a single release. \"Mr. Lonely\" shot up the charts in the late fall of 1964 to reach number 1 on the Hot 100 on 12 December 1964.  Epic then released the LP ''[[Bobby Vinton Mr. Lonely]]'', giving the song a unique claim to fame since it now appeared on three Bobby Vinton albums released within two years.  The song has continued to spin gold for its [[composer]] in the 45 years since it hit number 1.  [[Harmony Korine]] named his 2007 film ''[[Mister Lonely]]'' after the latter and features the song in the film's opening, and it was also the basis for [[Akon]]'s 2005 hit, \"[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]\".\n[[File:Bobby Vinton 1969.JPG|thumb|180px|Vinton performing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969]]\n\nIn 1965, Vinton continued his \"Lonely\" success streak with the self-written \"[[L-O-N-E-L-Y]]\".  \"[[Long Lonely Nights]]\" peaked at number 12 and spawned an album, ''[[Bobby Vinton Sings for Lonely Nights]]''. Vinton's self-written 1966 hit, \"[[Coming Home Soldier]]\", hit #11 on the Hot 100 and was a favorite on request shows on the [[American Forces Network]] during the [[Cold War]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] era, often called in by soldiers about to board the [[Government contract flight|Freedom Bird]] that would take them back to the \"Land of the Round Doorknobs\".  Vinton's lush 1967 remake of \"[[Please Love Me Forever]]\", which reached number 6 and sold over a million copies, began his string of twelve consecutive hits, all remakes, over a little less than five and a half years to reach the Hot 100.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  His 1968 hit, \"[[I Love How You Love Me]]\", surged to number 9, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 250]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250\n}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn the 1970s the future \"Polish Prince\" continued to hit the Top 40, notably with \"[[Ev'ry Day of My Life]]\", produced by [[Jimmy Bowen]] and CBS recording engineer Jim Reeves, which peaked at number 24 on 29 April 1972, and \"[[Sealed With a Kiss]]\" hitting number 19 on 19\u201326 August 1972.<ref name=Rogers/>  Despite the success of the two hits, Epic Records decided to drop Vinton from his contract the next year, claiming that his days of selling records were over.\n\nUndeterred, Vinton spent $50,000 of his own money on \"[[My Melody of Love]]\", partially self-written and partially sung in [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  The suggestion for the song came from Vinton's mother.<ref name=Disks/><ref name=Rogers/>  After Vinton was turned down by six major labels, [[ABC Records]] bought Vinton's idea, and the result was a multi-million-selling single of simple lyrics that hit number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 2 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox Top 100]] chart, and number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|AC]] chart in 1974.<ref name=Disks/><ref>Hyatt, Wesley (1999).

The Canonsburg town fathers had plans to erect a statue in Vinton's honor, but Vinton himself vetoed the idea, noting that the $100,000 planned cost could go to far more important town needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k7ciAAAAIBAJ&sjid=H7UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1150,7087216&dq=bobby+vinton+statue&hl=en|title=Vinton:Tribute is Just Too Much|date=28 December 2004|publisher=Beaver Country Times|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1960s===\nAfter two years' service in the [[United States Army]], where he served as a chaplain's assistant, Vinton was signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1960 as a bandleader: \"A Young Man With a Big Band\". The break for the Epic Records contract had come after Vinton and his band appeared on [[Guy Lombardo]]'s ''TV Talent Scouts'' program.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Slow/> However, two albums, ''Bobby Vinton Dancing At The Hop'' and ''Bobby Vinton Plays for his Lil Darlin's'' as well as several singles were not successful, and with Epic ready to drop him from its roster, Vinton found his first hit [[single (music)|single]] literally sitting in a reject pile.<ref name=Wilson/> The song was titled \"[[Roses Are Red (My Love)]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1220}}</ref> Vinton had to do his own promotion for the song; he bought one thousand copies and hired a young woman to deliver a copy of the record and a dozen red roses to every local DJ.<ref name=Hits/><ref name=Velvet>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OTkxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OXADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6287,560151&dq=stan+vinton&hl=en|title=Bobby Vinton still smooth as blue velvet|author=Hayes, John|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=2 March 2002|accessdate=2 May 2011}}</ref> It spent four weeks at [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1962|number one]] on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song was also a hit on the Country and R&B charts. The success of the song pushed Epic to renew Vinton's contract and change his status from bandleader to solo singer.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/\nEpic A&R man Bob Morgan had worked with Bobby on the sessions that created the material for the Roses are Red album which was rushed out to capitalize on the success of the hit single.  Morgan wanted to duplicate that records success with another nursery rhyme single and found it in a song called \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". There was only one problem. A small record label owned a recording that Vinton had made before the famous Roses Are Red session.  Anxious to capitalize on Vinton's sudden success, Diamond Records quickly pressed and released \"[[I Love You The Way You Are]]\" getting airplay around the country the week before Epic Records could release \"[[Rain Rain Go Away]]\". The result for Vinton was a trainwreck that had him calling radio stations asking them not to play his own song.  On August 25th 1962 Vinton had 3 45 singles on the \"[[Cashbox Hot 100 Singles Chart]]\" competing with each other for sales.<ref>The Polish Prince by Bobby Vinton 1978</ref>\nArguably, his most famous song is 1963's \"[[Blue Velvet (Tony Bennett song)|Blue Velvet]],\" originally a minor hit for [[Tony Bennett]] in 1951, that also went to [[List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1963|number one]]. 23 years later, [[David Lynch]] named his movie ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' after the song.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1990, \"Blue Velvet\" reached number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], after being featured in a [[Nivea]] commercial. The 1990 reissue also hit number 3 in the Irish Singles Chart and number 7 in Australia.\n\nIn 1964, Vinton had two number 1 hits, \"[[There! I've Said It Again]]\" (a number 1 hit in 1945 for [[Vaughn Monroe]]) and \"[[Mr. Lonely (Bobby Vinton song)|Mr. Lonely]]\".  Vinton's version of \"There! I've Said It Again\" is noteworthy for being the last U.S. ''Billboard'' number-one single of the pre-[[Beatles]] era, deposed from the Hot 100's summit by \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\".  Also noteworthy is the fact that Vinton continued to have big hit records during the [[British Invasion]], scoring 16 top-ten hits, while [[Connie Francis]], [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Shirelles]], and other major artists of the early 1960s struggled to reach even the Top 30, though many of them would remain popular in concerts or continue to have hits for certain periods of time.\n\nVinton wrote \"Mr. Lonely\" during his chaplain's assistant service in the U.S. Army in the late 1950s. The song was recorded during the same 1962 session that produced \"[[Roses Are Red (My Love)|Roses Are Red]]\" and launched Vinton's singing career.  It was released as an album track on the 1962 ''[[Roses Are Red (album)|Roses Are Red]] (and other songs for the young & sentimental)'' LP. Despite pressure from Vinton to release it as a single, Epic instead had [[Buddy Greco]] release it and it flopped.  Two years and millions of records sold later, Bobby prevailed on Epic to include \"Mr. Lonely\" on his ''[[Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits (1964 album)|Bobby Vinton's Greatest Hits]]'' LP.  Soon DJs picked up on the song and airplay resulted in demand for a single release. \"Mr. Lonely\" shot up the charts in the late fall of 1964 to reach number 1 on the Hot 100 on 12 December 1964.  Epic then released the LP ''[[Bobby Vinton Mr. Lonely]]'', giving the song a unique claim to fame since it now appeared on three Bobby Vinton albums released within two years.  The song has continued to spin gold for its [[composer]] in the 45 years since it hit number 1.  [[Harmony Korine]] named his 2007 film ''[[Mister Lonely]]'' after the latter and features the song in the film's opening, and it was also the basis for [[Akon]]'s 2005 hit, \"[[Lonely (Akon song)|Lonely]]\".\n[[File:Bobby Vinton 1969.JPG|thumb|180px|Vinton performing on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969]]\n\nIn 1965, Vinton continued his \"Lonely\" success streak with the self-written \"[[L-O-N-E-L-Y]]\".  \"[[Long Lonely Nights]]\" peaked at number 12 and spawned an album, ''[[Bobby Vinton Sings for Lonely Nights]]''. Vinton's self-written 1966 hit, \"[[Coming Home Soldier]]\", hit #11 on the Hot 100 and was a favorite on request shows on the [[American Forces Network]] during the [[Cold War]] and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] era, often called in by soldiers about to board the [[Government contract flight|Freedom Bird]] that would take them back to the \"Land of the Round Doorknobs\".  Vinton's lush 1967 remake of \"[[Please Love Me Forever]]\", which reached number 6 and sold over a million copies, began his string of twelve consecutive hits, all remakes, over a little less than five and a half years to reach the Hot 100.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  His 1968 hit, \"[[I Love How You Love Me]]\", surged to number 9, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250 250]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/250\n}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nIn the 1970s the future \"Polish Prince\" continued to hit the Top 40, notably with \"[[Ev'ry Day of My Life]]\", produced by [[Jimmy Bowen]] and CBS recording engineer Jim Reeves, which peaked at number 24 on 29 April 1972, and \"[[Sealed With a Kiss]]\" hitting number 19 on 19\u201326 August 1972.<ref name=Rogers/>  Despite the success of the two hits, Epic Records decided to drop Vinton from his contract the next year, claiming that his days of selling records were over.\n\nUndeterred, Vinton spent $50,000 of his own money on \"[[My Melody of Love]]\", partially self-written and partially sung in [[Polish language|Polish]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  The suggestion for the song came from Vinton's mother.<ref name=Disks/><ref name=Rogers/>  After Vinton was turned down by six major labels, [[ABC Records]] bought Vinton's idea, and the result was a multi-million-selling single of simple lyrics that hit number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 2 on the [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox Top 100]] chart, and number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|AC]] chart in 1974.<ref name=Disks/><ref>Hyatt, Wesley (1999).
