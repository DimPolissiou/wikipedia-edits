Furious at this humiliation, they suborned false testimony that Stephen had preached blasphemy against [[Moses]] and God.

Nevertheless, the Israelites turned to other gods.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|7:39\u201343}} This establishes the second main theme of Stephen's speech, Israel's disobedience to God.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Stephen faced two accusations: that he had declared that Jesus would destroy the Temple in Jerusalem and that he had changed the customs of Moses.

At the beginning of the 20 c. the Greek Orthodox Patriarchy built a church dedicated to the Protomartyr in their property in front of the gate, in an endeavour to pinpoint the tradition of the site, which was falling into oblivion following the construction of the Dominican church and monastery on the site of the Eudocian church of St. Stephen north of [[Damascus Gate]]. The Greek builders went so far as to maintain that, in digging the foundations of the new church, they had found a broken lintel with an engraved invocation to Saint Stephen, but their claim, accepted by Macalister and Vailh\u00e9, was promptly disproved by Vincent, who was able to show that the lintel came in fact from Beersheba.

It is a [[public holiday]] in many nations that were historically Catholic, Anglican or Lutheran, including Austria, Croatia, the [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland, Italy, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Catalonia and the Balearic Isles. In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom, the day is celebrated as \"[[Boxing Day]]\".\n\n===Western Christianity===\nIn the current norms for the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the feast is celebrated at the [[mass (liturgy)|Eucharist]], but, for the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], is restricted to the Hours during the day, with [[Vespers|Evening Prayer]] being reserved to the celebration of the [[octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of [[Christmas]]. Historically, the \"Invention of the Relics of Saint Stephen\" (i.e., their reputed discovery) was commemorated on 3 August.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', ed. David Hugh Farmer, corr. ed.

This day is also called the \"Third Day of the Nativity\" because it is the third day of the Christmas season.\n\nSome Orthodox churches, particularly in the west, follow a modified Julian calendar that places date names identically with the standard Gregorian calendar of widespread civil usage. In those churches, then, the date the feast is observed is generally known as 27 December. However, other Orthodox churches, including the Oriental Orthodox, continue to use the original Julian calendar. Throughout the 21st century, 27 December Julian will continue to fall on 9 January in the Gregorian calendar, and that is the date on which they observe the feast.\n\n===Armenian Liturgy===\nIn the Armenian Apostolic and Armenian Catholic Churches, Saint Stephen's Day falls on 25 December \u2013 the day on which the feast of the Nativity of Jesus (Christmas) falls in all other churches. This is because the Armenian churches maintain the decree of Constantine, which stipulated that the Nativity and Theophany of Jesus were to be celebrated on 6 January. In dioceses of the Armenian Church which use the Julian Calendar, Saint Stephen's Day falls on 7 January and Nativity/Theophany on 19 January (for the remainder of the 21st century Julian).\n\nIn the eucharistic celebration on this feast day, it is traditional for all deacons serving at the altar to wear a liturgical crown (Armenian: \u056d\u0578\u0575\u0580 ''khooyr''), which is one of the vestments worn only by priests on all other days of the year, the crown being in this instance a symbol of martyrdom.\n\n==Commemorative places==\n[[File:St-Stepanous-02.jpg|thumb|The [[Saint Stepanos Monastery|Saint Stephen Armenian Monastery]] of the 9th century near Jolfa, Iran]]\n[[File:StStephen GiacomoCavedone.jpg|thumb|Saint Stephen holding a [[Gospel Book]] in a 1601 painting by [[Giacomo Cavedone]].]]\n:'''''See also''': [[St. Stephen's Cathedral (disambiguation)|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], [[St. Stephen's Church (disambiguation)|St. Stephen's Church]]\nMany churches and other places commemorate Stephen.

According to Orthodox belief, he was the eldest and is therefore called \"archdeacon\".<ref name=oca>{{cite web|url=http://oca.org/saints/lives/2015/12/27/103659-protomartyr-and-archdeacon-stephen|title=Protomartyr and Archdeacon Stephen|publisher=}}</ref> As another deacon, Nicholas of Antioch, is specifically stated to have been a convert to [[Judaism]], it may be assumed that Stephen was born Jewish, but nothing more is known about his previous life.<ref name=\"Newadvent\"/> The reason for the appointment of the deacons is stated to have been dissatisfaction among [[Hellenistic]] (that is, Greek-influenced and Greek-speaking) Jews that their widows were being slighted in preference to Hebraic ones in the d . \n And then he saw thanos he thought it was a grape so he ate it. then he was in endgame for a little ans snapped hus  is Greek, it has been assumed that he was one of these Hellenistic Jews. Stephen is stated to have been full of faith and the Holy Spirit and\n to have performed miracles among the people.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|6:5, 8}} \n[[File:St stephen.jpg|thumb|upright|''Stoning of Saint Stephen'', altarpiece of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice, by Jacopo & Domenico [[Tintoretto]]]]\nIt seems to have been among synagogues of Hellenistic Jews that he performed his teachings and \"signs and wonders\" since it is said that he aroused the opposition of the \"[[Synagogue of the Libertines|Synagogue of the Freedmen]]\", and \"of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of them that were of Cilicia and Asia\".{{Bibleref2c|Acts|6:9}} Members of these synagogues had challenged Stephen's teachings, but Stephen had bested them in debate. Furious at this humiliation, they suborned false testimony that Stephen had preached blasphemy against [[Moses]] and God. They dragged him to appear before the [[Sanhedrin]], the supreme legal court of Jewish elders, accusing him of preaching against the [[Second Temple|Temple]] and the [[Torah|Mosaic Law]].{{Bibleref2c|Acts|6:9\u201314}} Stephen is said to have been unperturbed, his face looking like \"that of an angel\".<ref name=\"Newadvent\"/>\n\n===Speech to Sanhedrin===\nIn a long speech to the [[Sanhedrin]] comprising almost the whole of [[Acts 7|Acts chapter 7]], Stephen presents his view of the history of [[Israel]]. The God of glory, he says, appeared to [[Abraham]] in [[Mesopotamia]], thus establishing at the beginning of the speech one of its major themes, that God does not dwell only in one particular building (meaning the Temple).<ref name=\"Williams\">David J.

Nevertheless, the Israelites turned to other gods.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|7:39\u201343}} This establishes the second main theme of Stephen's speech, Israel's disobedience to God.<ref name=\"Williams\" /> Stephen faced two accusations: that he had declared that Jesus would destroy the Temple in Jerusalem and that he had changed the customs of Moses. [[Benedict XVI]] stated that St. Stephen appealed to the Jewish scriptures to prove how the laws of Moses were not subverted by Jesus but, instead, were being fulfilled.<ref>Kerr, David.

The Greek builders went so far as to maintain that, in digging the foundations of the new church, they had found a broken lintel with an engraved invocation to Saint Stephen, but their claim, accepted by Macalister and Vailh\u00e9, was promptly disproved by Vincent, who was able to show that the lintel came in fact from Beersheba.

It is a [[public holiday]] in many nations that were historically Catholic, Anglican or Lutheran, including Austria, Croatia, the [[Public holidays in the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]], Hungary, Ireland, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Poland, Italy, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Catalonia and the Balearic Isles. In Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom, the day is celebrated as \"[[Boxing Day]]\".\n\n===Western Christianity===\nIn the current norms for the [[liturgy]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the feast is celebrated at the [[mass (liturgy)|Eucharist]], but, for the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], is restricted to the Hours during the day, with [[Vespers|Evening Prayer]] being reserved to the celebration of the [[octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of [[Christmas]]. Historically, the \"Invention of the Relics of Saint Stephen\" (i.e., their reputed discovery) was commemorated on 3 August.<ref>''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'', ed. David Hugh Farmer, corr. ed. (Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1979), p. 361. {{ISBN|0198691203}}</ref> The feasts of both 26 December and 3 August have been used in dating clauses in historical documents produced in England.<ref>''Handbook of dates for students of British history'', ed. [[C. R. Cheney]]. New, rev. ed. (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 59, 85. {{ISBN|0521770955}}</ref>\n\n===Eastern Christianity===\n[[File:Saint Stephen 11cent.jpg|thumb|upright|Byzantine icon, 11th century]]\nIn the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], those [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] which follow the [[Byzantine Rite]], and in Oriental Orthodox Churches (e.g., Coptic, Syrian, Malankara) Saint Stephen's feast day is celebrated on 27 December. This day is also called the \"Third Day of the Nativity\" because it is the third day of the Christmas season.\n\nSome Orthodox churches, particularly in the west, follow a modified Julian calendar that places date names identically with the standard Gregorian calendar of widespread civil usage. In those churches, then, the date the feast is observed is generally known as 27 December. However, other Orthodox churches, including the Oriental Orthodox, continue to use the original Julian calendar. Throughout the 21st century, 27 December Julian will continue to fall on 9 January in the Gregorian calendar, and that is the date on which they observe the feast.\n\n===Armenian Liturgy===\nIn the Armenian Apostolic and Armenian Catholic Churches, Saint Stephen's Day falls on 25 December \u2013 the day on which the feast of the Nativity of Jesus (Christmas) falls in all other churches. This is because the Armenian churches maintain the decree of Constantine, which stipulated that the Nativity and Theophany of Jesus were to be celebrated on 6 January. In dioceses of the Armenian Church which use the Julian Calendar, Saint Stephen's Day falls on 7 January and Nativity/Theophany on 19 January (for the remainder of the 21st century Julian).\n\nIn the eucharistic celebration on this feast day, it is traditional for all deacons serving at the altar to wear a liturgical crown (Armenian: \u056d\u0578\u0575\u0580 ''khooyr''), which is one of the vestments worn only by priests on all other days of the year, the crown being in this instance a symbol of martyrdom.\n\n==Commemorative places==\n[[File:St-Stepanous-02.jpg|thumb|The [[Saint Stepanos Monastery|Saint Stephen Armenian Monastery]] of the 9th century near Jolfa, Iran]]\n[[File:StStephen GiacomoCavedone.jpg|thumb|Saint Stephen holding a [[Gospel Book]] in a 1601 painting by [[Giacomo Cavedone]].]]\n:'''''See also''': [[St. Stephen's Cathedral (disambiguation)|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], [[St. Stephen's Church (disambiguation)|St. Stephen's Church]]\nMany churches and other places commemorate Stephen.

It may take 2\u201314 days for symptoms to appear after initial exposure to the virus. Thirteen reporting hospitals have been designated to deal with cases. The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Ever since, movement outside the house is permitted to individuals only for ten specific reasons, grouped into seven categories: i) moving to or from one's workplace during work hours, ii) going to the pharmacy or visiting a doctor iii) going to a food store iv) going to the bank for services not possible online, v) assisting a person in need of help vi) going to a major ritual (funeral, marriage, baptism) or movement, for divorarced parents, which is essential for the contact with their children, and vii) moving outdoors, near one's home, for exercising or taking one's pet out, individually or in pairs. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as a signed attestation where the purpose/ category of travel is cited. The [[Hellenic Police]], the [[Municipal Police (Greece)|Municipal Police]], the [[Hellenic Coast Guard]] and the National Transparency Authority are empowered to enforce the restrictions and can issue fines for each offense.\n\n== Timeline ==\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Greece medical cases chart}}\n\n=== February ===\n\n* As of 26 February, the first case in Greece was confirmed.

On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended.
