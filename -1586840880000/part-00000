He was drafted by the [[St. Louis Rams]] in the first round of the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. He played [[college football]] at the [[University of Nebraska]]. He also played for the [[Washington Redskins]].\n\n==Early years==\nCarriker was born in [[Hastings, Nebraska]].  He moved to [[Kennewick, Washington]], at the age of three,<ref name=huskersbio>[http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=4&SPID=22&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=966&Q_SEASON=2006 \"Adam Carriker\".]  [http://www.huskers.com/ Huskers.com.] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ghdVXN4P?url=http://www.huskers.com//pdf7/134543.pdf |date=2009-05-12 }}  Retrieved 2016-02-14.</ref> and attended [[Kennewick High School]], where he played quarterback and defensive end.

He received all-state honors for his shot put prowess and long jump efforts as a senior.\n\n==College career==\nCarriker [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]]ed in 2002. In his 2003 freshman season he played extensively in passing situations before injuring his ankle against Utah State.

In his 2004 sophomore year Carriker was hampered for the second straight season by an ankle injury. He played in 10 games with eight starts in the 2004 campaign, and finished with 36 tackles, including seven tackles for loss and three sacks for 18 yards. Carriker added seven quarterback hurries during his sophomore season.\n\nAs a junior in 2005 Carriker started all 12 games at the base end spot, and finished with 9.5 sacks for 84 yards and 17 tackles for loss for 96 yards. His 9\u00bd sacks tied for the Big 12 Conference lead and ranked 19th nationally. He also led Nebraska with 21 quarterback hurries, 10 more than any other Husker defender. Carriker's 43 total tackles ranked seventh on the team and tied for the most among defensive linemen. He began his junior season by notching two of the Huskers' school-record tying 11 sacks in the team's 25-7 win over Maine. Carriker capped 2005 with one tackle in the [[Alamo Bowl]] victory over the [[University of Michigan]]. Adam was voted 2005 Nebraska Defensive MVP.\n\nAs a senior in 2006 Adam Carriker completed a dominant career in the 2006 season [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] against [[Auburn University]]. In 2006, Carriker earned Nebraska's Defensive MVP honor for the second straight season, and was honored as the Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year by the league's coaches. Carriker finished the season with a team-leading seven sacks and ranked second on the team with 16 tackles behind the line of scrimmage. His 52 total tackles led all Nebraska defensive linemen, and he also paced the Blackshirt defense with 12 quarterback hurries, while registering his first career interception. In addition to his selection as Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year, Carriker was a First-team All-Big 12 pick by the [[Big 12]] Coaches and the [[Associated Press]]. He was also a Third-team All-America selection by [[Rivals.com]].\n\nThe strong senior season put Carriker's name in a prominent position in the NU record books. He finished with 41 career tackles for loss to rank fifth in the program's history. Carriker has 20\u00bd career sacks to rank sixth on the Cornhusker charts.

With the Rams he was a \"3-technique\" defensive tackle in a 4-3 defensive scheme which did not work out and led to his trade to the Redskins. \"In St. Louis, we tried to make him a 3-technique and up-the-field rusher,\" said defensive coordinator [[Jim Haslett]]. \"For a guy who ran the 40 in 4.7 and was 6-6, 315 pounds, you'd think he could do that.

He's strong enough to set the edge on running plays, and he's even generating a pass rush on occasion.

She released her debut album, ''[[Yours Truly (Ariana Grande album)|Yours Truly]]'' (2013). A 1950s [[doo-wop]]-influenced [[pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, it debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned her first US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten single, \"[[The Way (Ariana Grande song)|The Way]]\".\n\nGrande's second studio album, ''[[My Everything (Ariana Grande album)|My Everything]]'' (2014), continued the pop-R&B sound of its predecessor and incorporated [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] elements. It topped the ''Billboard'' 200 and featured four US top-ten singles: \"[[Problem (song)|Problem]]\", \"[[Break Free (song)|Break Free]]\", \"[[Bang Bang (Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj song)|Bang Bang]]\", and \"[[Love Me Harder]]\", the most of any artist that year. Grande's third studio album, ''[[Dangerous Woman]]'' (2016) became her first of three consecutive number-one albums in the UK, and included the top-five single \"[[Side to Side]]\". Grande began experimenting with [[trap music|trap]] on her next albums, ''[[Sweetener (album)|Sweetener]]'' (2018) and ''[[Thank U, Next]]'' (2019), while maintaining her characteristic pop-R&B tones. Both debuted at number one in several countries and were acclaimed by music critics. The former won a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album]] and spawned the international top-three single \"[[No Tears Left to Cry]]\", while the latter was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and Best Pop Vocal Album at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]] and broke several streaming records upon release. With the release of the singles \"[[Thank U, Next (song)|Thank U, Next]]\", \"[[7 Rings]]\" and \"[[Break Up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored]]\", Grande became the first solo artist to hold the top three spots on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] simultaneously and the first female artist to succeed herself at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Additionally, she is the only artist to have the lead singles from each of their first five studio albums debut within the top ten in the US.\n\nGrande has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Ariana Grande|various accolades]], including one [[Grammy Award]], one [[Brit Award]], two [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], three [[American Music Awards]], and eight [[Guinness World Records]]. All five of Grande's full-length albums have been certified Platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

{"title_page": "Hessian matrix", "text_new": "{{short description|(Mathematical) matrix of second derivatives}}\n{{Calculus|Multivariable}}\n\nIn [[mathematic]]s, the '''Hessian matrix''' or '''Hessian''' is a [[square matrix]] of second-order [[partial derivative]]s of a scalar-valued [[function (mathematics)|function]], or [[scalar field]]. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables. The Hessian matrix was developed in the 19th century by the German mathematician [[Otto Hesse|Ludwig Otto Hesse]] and later named after him. Hesse originally used the term \"functional determinants\".\n\n== Definitions and properties ==\n\nSuppose {{math|''f'' : \u211d<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 \u211d}} is a function taking as input a vector {{math|'''x''' \u2208 \u211d<sup>''n''</sup>}} and outputting a scalar {{math|''f''('''x''') \u2208 \u211d}}. If all second [[partial derivative]]s of {{math|''f''}} exist and are continuous over the domain of the function, then the Hessian matrix {{math|'''H'''}} of {{math|''f''}} is a square {{math|''n''\u00d7''n''}} matrix, usually defined and arranged as follows:\n\n:<math>\\mathbf H = \\begin{bmatrix}\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1^2} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_1\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2^2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_2\\,\\partial x_n} \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\[2.2ex]\n  \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_1} & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n\\,\\partial x_2} & \\cdots & \\dfrac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_n^2}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nor, by stating an equation for the coefficients using indices i and j:\n:<math>\\mathbf H_{i,j} = \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x_i \\partial x_j}.</math>\n\nThe [[determinant]] of the above matrix is called the Hessian determinant.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Binmore |first1=Ken |authorlink1=Kenneth Binmore |last2=Davies |first2=Joan |year=2007 |title=Calculus Concepts and Methods |oclc=717598615 |isbn=978-0-521-77541-0 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=190 }}</ref>\n\nThe Hessian matrix of a function f is the transpose of the [[Jacobian matrix]] of the gradient of the function: {{math|'''H'''(''f''('''x''')) {{=}} '''J'''(\u2207''f''('''x'''))<sup>T</sup>}}.\n\nThe '''mixed partial derivatives''' of ''f'' are the entries outside the [[main diagonal]] in the Hessian.

The latter family of algorithms use approximations to the Hessian; one of the most popular quasi-Newton algorithms is [[Broyden\u2013Fletcher\u2013Goldfarb\u2013Shanno algorithm|BFGS]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Nocedal |first1=Jorge |authorlink1=Jorge Nocedal |last2=Wright |first2=Stephen |year=2000 |title=Numerical Optimization |isbn=978-0-387-98793-4 |publisher=Springer Verlag}}</ref>\n\nSuch approximations may use the fact that an optimization algorithm uses the Hessian only as a [[linear operator]] {{math|'''H'''('''v''')}}, and proceed by first noticing that the Hessian also appears in the local expansion of the gradient:\n\n:<math>\\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + \\Delta\\mathbf{x}) = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} + \\mathcal{O}(\\|\\Delta\\mathbf{x}\\|^2)</math>\n\nLetting {{math|\u0394'''x''' {{=}} ''r'''''v'''}} for some scalar {{mvar|r}}, this gives\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\Delta\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})r\\mathbf{v} = r\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) + \\mathcal{O}(r^2),</math>\n\ni.e.,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{x})\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{1}{r} \\Bigl[ \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x} + r\\mathbf{v}) - \\nabla f (\\mathbf{x}) \\Bigr] + \\mathcal{O}(r)</math>\n\nso if the gradient is already computed, the approximate Hessian can be computed by a linear (in the size of the gradient) number of scalar operations.

A sufficient condition for a local ''maximum'' is that these minors alternate in sign with the smallest one having the sign of (\u20131)<sup>''m''+1</sup>.  A sufficient condition for a local ''minimum'' is that all of these minors have the sign of (\u20131)<sup>''m''</sup>. (In the unconstrained case of ''m''=0 these conditions coincide with the conditions for the unbordered Hessian to be negative definite or positive definite respectively).\n\n=== Vector-valued functions ===\n\nIf {{math|''f''}} is instead a [[vector field]] {{math|'''f''' : \u211d<sup>''n''</sup> \u2192 \u211d<sup>''m''</sup>}}, i.e.\n\n:<math>\\mathbf f(\\mathbf x) = (f_1(\\mathbf x), f_2(\\mathbf x), \\dots, f_m(\\mathbf x)),</math>\n\nthen the collection of second partial derivatives is not a {{math|''n''\u00d7''n''}} matrix, but rather a third order [[tensor]]. This can be thought of as an array of {{math|''m''}} Hessian matrices, one for each component of {{math|'''f'''}}:\n:<math>\\mathbf H(\\mathbf f) = (\\mathbf H(f_1), \\mathbf H(f_2), \\dots, \\mathbf H(f_m))</math>\nThis tensor degenerates to the usual Hessian matrix when {{math|''m''}} = 1.\n\n=== Generalization to the complex case ===\n\nIn the context of [[several complex variables]], the Hessian may be generalized.  Suppose <math>f\\colon\\mathbb{C}^n\\longrightarrow\\mathbb{C}</math>, and we write <math>f\\left(z_1,\\ldots,z_n\\right)</math>.  Then one may generalize the Hessian to <math>\\frac{\\partial^2f}{\\partial z_i\\partial\\overline{z_j}}</math>.  Note that if <math>f</math> satisfies the n-dimensional [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations|Cauchy\u2013Riemann conditions]], then the complex Hessian matrix is identically zero.\n\n=== Generalizations to Riemannian manifolds ===\n\nLet <math>(M,g)</math> be a [[Riemannian manifold]] and <math>\\nabla</math> its [[Levi-Civita connection]]. Let <math>f:M \\to \\mathbb{R}</math> be a smooth function. We may define the Hessian tensor\n:<math>\\displaystyle \\mbox{Hess}(f) \\in \\Gamma(T^*M \\otimes T^*M) </math> by <math>\\mbox{Hess}(f):=\\nabla \\nabla f = \\nabla df</math>,\n\nwhere we have taken advantage of the first covariant derivative of a function being the same as its ordinary derivative. Choosing local coordinates <math>\\{x^i\\}</math> we obtain the local expression for the Hessian as\n\n:<math> \\mbox{Hess}(f)=\\nabla_i\\, \\partial_j f \\ dx^i \\!\\otimes\\! dx^j = \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^i \\partial x^j}-\\Gamma_{ij}^k \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^k} \\right) dx^i \\otimes dx^j </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Gamma^k_{ij}</math> are the [[Christoffel symbols]] of the connection. Other equivalent forms for the Hessian are given by\n:<math>\\mbox{Hess}(f)(X,Y)= \\langle \\nabla_X \\mbox{grad}f,Y \\rangle </math> and <math>\\mbox{Hess}(f)(X,Y)=X(Yf)-df(\\nabla_XY)</math>.\n\n== See also ==\n* The determinant of the Hessian matrix is a covariant; see [[Invariant of a binary form]]\n* [[Polarization identity]], useful for rapid calculations involving Hessians.\n* [[Jacobian matrix]]\n* [[Hessian equation]]s\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |first=David W. |last=Lewis |title=Matrix Theory |location=Singapore |publisher=World Scientific |year=1991 |isbn=978-981-02-0689-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/matrixtheory0000lewi }}\n* {{cite book |first=Jan R. |last=Magnus |first2=Heinz |last2=Neudecker |title=Matrix Differential Calculus : With Applications in Statistics and Econometrics |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |edition=Revised |year=1999 |isbn=0-471-98633-X |chapter=The Second Differential |pages=99\u2013115 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Hessian of a function|id=p/h047160}}\n* {{MathWorld|Hessian|Hessian}}\n\n{{Matrix classes}}\n\n[[Category:Differential operators]]\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n[[Category:Morse theory]]\n[[Category:Multivariable calculus]]\n[[Category:Singularity theory]]\n", "name_user": "Mikhail Ryazanov", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecond derivative test:punct., fmt.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_matrix"}
