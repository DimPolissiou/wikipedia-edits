Danner also provided excerpts of the ICRC report characterizing procedures used at the black sites, dubbed \"an [[alternative set of procedures]]\" by President Bush, and discussed whether they fit the definition of torture.\n\n==Controversy over the legality and secrecy==\n[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation.]]\n\nBlack sites are embroiled in controversy over the legal status of the detainees held there, the legal authority for the operation of the sites (including the collaboration between governments involved), and full (or even minimal) disclosure by the governments involved.\n\n===Legal status of detainees===\nAn important aspect of black site operation is that the legal status of black site detainees is not clearly defined. In practice, inmates in black sites have no rights other than those given by the captors.\n\nThe revelation of such black sites adds to the controversy surrounding US government policy regarding those whom it describes as \"[[unlawful enemy combatant]]s\". Approximately 30 detainees are considered the most dangerous or important terrorism suspects and are held by the CIA at black sites under the most secretive arrangements. More than 70 other detainees who may have originally been sent to black sites, but were soon delivered by the CIA to intelligence agencies in allied Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Egypt]]. A further 100 [[ghost detainee]]s kidnapped in Europe and \"rendered\" to other countries must be counted, according to Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]]'s report of January 2006. This process is called \"[[extraordinary rendition]]\". Marty also underlined that European countries probably had knowledge of these covert operations. Furthermore, the CIA apparently financially assists and directs the jails in these countries. While the US and host countries have signed the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], CIA officers are allowed to use what the agency calls \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\". These have been alleged to constitute \"severe pain or suffering\" under the UN convention, which would be a violation of the treaty and thus [[US law]].\n\n===Legal authority for operation===\nThere is little or no stated legal authority for the operation of black sites by the United States or the other countries believed to be involved. In fact, the specifics of the network of black sites remains controversial. The [[United Nations]] has begun to intervene in this aspect of black sites.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe fourteen European countries Marty listed as [[collaborationism|collaborators]] in \"unlawful inter-state transfers\" are Great Britain, Germany, the Isle of Man, Italy, Sweden, Bosnia, Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Spain, Cyprus, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Poland. Named airport bases include [[Glasgow Prestwick International Airport|Glasgow Prestwick Airport]] (Scotland), [[Shannon Airport|Shannon]] & [[Casement Aerodrome|Baldonnel]] (Ireland), [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein]] and [[Frankfurt Airport|Frankfurt]] (Germany), [[Aviano Air Base]] (Italy), [[Palma de Mallorca Airport]] (Spain), [[Tuzla Air Base]] (Bosnia-Herzegovina), [[Skopje Airport|Skopje]] (Republic of Macedonia), [[Athens International Airport|Athens]] (Greece), [[Larnaca International Airport|Larnaca]] (Cyprus), [[Ruzyn\u011b Airport|Prague]] (Czech Republic), [[Stockholm]] (Sweden), as well as [[Rabat-Sal\u00e9 Airport|Rabat]] (Morocco) and [[Houari Boumediene Airport|Algiers]] (Algeria).<ref name=BBC2006/> Polish Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz]] characterized the accusation as \"[[libel]]\", while Romania similarly said there was no evidence.\n\nBritish Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] said that the report \"added absolutely nothing new whatever to the information we have\".<ref name=BBC2006>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5056614.stm |title=Secret CIA jail claims rejected |work=BBC News |date=June 7, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1375123|publisher=ABC News|title=Sources Tell ABC News Top Al Qaeda Figures Held in Secret CIA Prisons|author1=Brian Ross |author2=Richard Esposito |date=2005-12-05|accessdate=2007-04-15 |df=mdy-all|author1-link=Brian Ross (journalist)}}</ref> Poland and Romania received the most direct accusals, as the report claims the evidence for these sites is \"strong\".

However, Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]]'s memorandum on \"alleged detention in Council of Europe states\" stated that about 100 persons have been kidnapped by the CIA on European territory and subsequently [[extraordinary rendition|rendered]] to countries where they may have been tortured.

This was apparently due to a misunderstanding that arose concerning the similarity of the spelling of El-Masri's name with the spelling of suspected terrorist [[Khalid al-Masri]]. Germany had issued warrants for 13 people suspected to be involved with the abduction, but dropped them in September 2007.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, the [[United States Supreme Court]] declined without comment to hear an appeal of El-Masri's civil lawsuit against the United States (''[[El-Masri v. Tenet]]''), letting stand an earlier verdict by a federal district court judge, which was upheld by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].  Those courts had agreed with the government that the case could not go forward without exposing [[state secrets]].  In May 2007, Masri was committed to a psychiatric institution after he was arrested in the southern German city of Neu-Ulm on suspicion of arson.  His attorney blamed his troubles on the CIA, saying the kidnapping and detention had left Masri a \"psychological wreck\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100900605_pf.html|title=Court Declines Case of Alleged CIA Torture Victim|first=Robert|last=Barnes|work=The Washington Post|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|Murat Kurnaz}}\n\n====Imam Rapito====\n{{Main|Imam Rapito affair}}\nThe CIA abducted [[Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr]] (also known as Abu Omar) in [[Milan]] and transferred him to Egypt, where he was allegedly tortured and abused.

The European Parliament voted a resolution condemning member states which accepted or ignore the practice. According to the report, the CIA had operated 1,245 flights, many of them to destinations where suspects could face torture. The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of Guantanamo. According to Giovanni Fava ([[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Socialist Party]]), who drafted the document, there was a \"strong possibility\" that the intelligence obtained under the extraordinary rendition illegal program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where \"an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture\".UK officials have further denied any claims and many investing officials agree to it that UK was not involved in the\ndetention and torture or about hosting prisons.

Danner also provided excerpts of the ICRC report characterizing procedures used at the black sites, dubbed \"an [[alternative set of procedures]]\" by President Bush, and discussed whether they fit the definition of torture.\n\n==Controversy over the legality and secrecy==\n[[File:US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program.pdf|thumb|The US Senate Report on CIA Detention Interrogation Program that details the use of torture during CIA detention and interrogation.]]\n\nBlack sites are embroiled in controversy over the legal status of the detainees held there, the legal authority for the operation of the sites (including the collaboration between governments involved), and full (or even minimal) disclosure by the governments involved.\n\n===Legal status of detainees===\nAn important aspect of black site operation is that the legal status of black site detainees is not clearly defined. In practice, inmates in black sites have no rights other than those given by the captors.\n\nThe revelation of such black sites adds to the controversy surrounding US government policy regarding those whom it describes as \"[[unlawful enemy combatant]]s\". Approximately 30 detainees are considered the most dangerous or important terrorism suspects and are held by the CIA at black sites under the most secretive arrangements. More than 70 other detainees who may have originally been sent to black sites, but were soon delivered by the CIA to intelligence agencies in allied Middle Eastern and Asian countries such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Morocco]], and [[Egypt]]. A further 100 [[ghost detainee]]s kidnapped in Europe and \"rendered\" to other countries must be counted, according to Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]]'s report of January 2006. This process is called \"[[extraordinary rendition]]\". Marty also underlined that European countries probably had knowledge of these covert operations. Furthermore, the CIA apparently financially assists and directs the jails in these countries. While the US and host countries have signed the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], CIA officers are allowed to use what the agency calls \"[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]\". These have been alleged to constitute \"severe pain or suffering\" under the UN convention, which would be a violation of the treaty and thus [[US law]].\n\n===Legal authority for operation===\nThere is little or no stated legal authority for the operation of black sites by the United States or the other countries believed to be involved. In fact, the specifics of the network of black sites remains controversial. The [[United Nations]] has begun to intervene in this aspect of black sites.{{fact|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe fourteen European countries Marty listed as [[collaborationism|collaborators]] in \"unlawful inter-state transfers\" are Great Britain, Germany, the Isle of Man, Italy, Sweden, Bosnia, Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Spain, Cyprus, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Romania and Poland.

In a 20-minute question-and-answer session with the audience, Hayden disputed assertions that the CIA has used [[waterboarding]], [[stress positions]], [[hypothermia]] and dogs to interrogate suspects\u2014all techniques that have been broadly criticized. \"That's a pretty good example of taking something to the darkest corner of the room and not reflective of what my agency does\" Hayden told one person from a [[human rights]] organization.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-09-07-502409224_x.htm|work=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|title=Hayden: CIA Had Fewer Than 100 Prisoners|author=Goldman, Adam|date=2007-09-07|accessdate=2007-09-07}}</ref>\n\n====Information derived from investigative reporting====\nThe vast majority of information that has been provided to the public about black sites has been the result of investigative reporting. For full details, see [[#Media and investigative history|the section below on the media and investigative history]].\n\n==Specific facts surrounding sites==\nAs discussed in the preceding section, many of the facts surrounding black sites remain controversial. The identity of detainees and the location of sites are known with varying degrees of certainty, though many facts have been discovered in substantial detail.\n\n===Detainees===\n{{Main|Detainees in CIA custody}}\nThe list of those thought to be held by the CIA include suspected al-Qaeda members [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin]], [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], and [[Abu Zubaydah]].  The total number of [[ghost detainee]]s is presumed to be at least one hundred, although the precise number cannot be determined because fewer than 10% have been charged or convicted.  However, Swiss senator [[Dick Marty]]'s memorandum on \"alleged detention in Council of Europe states\" stated that about 100 persons have been kidnapped by the CIA on European territory and subsequently [[extraordinary rendition|rendered]] to countries where they may have been tortured.  This number of 100 persons does not overlap, but adds itself to the U.S.-detained 100 ghost detainees.<ref name=\"Marty\">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/24_01_06_detention.pdf |title=Information memorandum II on the alleged secret detentions in Council of Europe state |author=Dick Marty|date=January 22, 2006}}</ref>\n\nA number of the alleged detainees listed above were transferred to the U.S.-run [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] prison on Cuba in the fall of 2006.  With this publicly announced act, the United States government ''de facto'' acknowledged the existence of secret prisons abroad in which these prisoners had been held.\n\n====Khaled el-Masri====\n{{Main|Khalid El-Masri}}\nKhalid El-Masri is a German citizen who was detained in Skopje, flown to Afghanistan, interrogated and tortured by the CIA for several months, and then released in remote Albania in May 2004 without having been charged with any offense. This was apparently due to a misunderstanding that arose concerning the similarity of the spelling of El-Masri's name with the spelling of suspected terrorist [[Khalid al-Masri]]. Germany had issued warrants for 13 people suspected to be involved with the abduction, but dropped them in September 2007.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, the [[United States Supreme Court]] declined without comment to hear an appeal of El-Masri's civil lawsuit against the United States (''[[El-Masri v. Tenet]]''), letting stand an earlier verdict by a federal district court judge, which was upheld by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]].  Those courts had agreed with the government that the case could not go forward without exposing [[state secrets]].  In May 2007, Masri was committed to a psychiatric institution after he was arrested in the southern German city of Neu-Ulm on suspicion of arson.  His attorney blamed his troubles on the CIA, saying the kidnapping and detention had left Masri a \"psychological wreck\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/09/AR2007100900605_pf.html|title=Court Declines Case of Alleged CIA Torture Victim|first=Robert|last=Barnes|work=The Washington Post|date=2007-10-09|accessdate=2007-10-09}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|Murat Kurnaz}}\n\n====Imam Rapito====\n{{Main|Imam Rapito affair}}\nThe CIA abducted [[Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr]] (also known as Abu Omar) in [[Milan]] and transferred him to Egypt, where he was allegedly tortured and abused.

Ultimately, 26 Americans (mostly suspected CIA agents) and nine Italians were indicted. On November 4, 2009, an Italian judge convicted ([[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']]) 23 of the Americans, including a U.S. Air Force (USAF) colonel.

The European Parliament voted a resolution condemning member states which accepted or ignore the practice.

The Parliament also called for the creation of an independent investigation commission and the closure of Guantanamo. According to Giovanni Fava ([[Italian Socialist Party (2007)|Socialist Party]]), who drafted the document, there was a \"strong possibility\" that the intelligence obtained under the extraordinary rendition illegal program had been passed on to EU governments who were aware of how it was obtained. The report also uncovered the use of secret detention facilities used in Europe, including Romania and Poland. The report defines extraordinary renditions as instances where \"an individual suspected of involvement in terrorism is illegally abducted, arrested and/or transferred into the custody of US officials and/or transported to another country for interrogation which, in the majority of cases involves incommunicado detention and torture\".UK officials have further denied any claims and many investing officials agree to it that UK was not involved in the\ndetention and torture or about hosting prisons.

{"title_page": "Production car speed record", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Fastest car|the Netflix series|Fastest Car}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2018}}\n\nThis is a list of the world's record-breaking top speeds achieved by [[Street-legal vehicle|street-legal]] [[production car]]s (as opposed to [[concept car]]s or [[modified car]]s). For the purposes of this list eligible cars are defined in the [[List of fastest production cars#List rules|list's rules]]. This list uses a different definition to the [[List of automotive superlatives]]. The variation is because the term [[production car]] is otherwise undefined.\n\n== List rules ==\n{{See|List of automotive superlatives}}\nBecause of the inconsistencies with the various definitions of production cars, dubious claims by manufacturers and self-interest groups, and inconsistent or changing application of the definitions this list has a defined set of requirements. For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the above link.\n\n=== Post 1945 and over {{convert|124|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} only ===\nThis list is also limited to post [[World War II]] production road cars which reached more than {{convert|124|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, older cars are excluded even if they were faster. The Benz Velo as the first petrol driven car is the only exception.\n\n=== Production car definition ===\nFor the purposes of this list, a production car is defined as a vehicle that is:\n\n# constructed principally for retail sale to consumers, for their personal use, to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible)\n# available for commercial sale to the public in the same specification as the vehicle used to achieve the record\n# manufactured in the record-claiming specification by a manufacturer whose WMI number is shown on the VIN, including vehicles that are modified by either professional tuners or others that result in a VIN with a WMI number in their name (for example, if a Porsche-based car is remanufactured by RUF and has RUF's WMI W09, it is eligible; but if it has Porsche's WMI, WP0, it is not eligible)\n# pre-1981 vehicles must be made by the original vehicle manufacturer and not modified by either professional tuners or individuals\n# street-legal in its intended markets, having fulfilled the homologation tests or inspections required under either a) United States of America, b) European Union law, or (c) Japan) to be granted this status\n# sold in more than one national market.\n\n=== Measurement of top speed ===\nTo establish the top speed for cars at least since the 1990s the requirement is, in addition to the above, an independent road test with a two-way run. The mean of the top speed for both runs is taken as the car's top speed.<ref name=\"Nunez_20140224\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |title=FIA World Land Speed Records |publisher=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101124551/https://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |archive-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> In instances where the top speed has been determined by removing the limiter, the test met these requirements, and the car is sold with the limiter on then the limited speed is accepted as meeting this requirement.

For further explanation of how these were arrived at see the above link.\n\n=== Post 1945 and over {{convert|124|mph|km/h|abbr=on|order=flip}} only ===\nThis list is also limited to post [[World War II]] production road cars which reached more than {{convert|124|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}, older cars are excluded even if they were faster. The Benz Velo as the first petrol driven car is the only exception.\n\n=== Production car definition ===\nFor the purposes of this list, a production car is defined as a vehicle that is:\n\n# constructed principally for retail sale to consumers, for their personal use, to transport people on public roads (no commercial or industrial vehicles are eligible)\n# available for commercial sale to the public in the same specification as the vehicle used to achieve the record\n# manufactured in the record-claiming specification by a manufacturer whose WMI number is shown on the VIN, including vehicles that are modified by either professional tuners or others that result in a VIN with a WMI number in their name (for example, if a Porsche-based car is remanufactured by RUF and has RUF's WMI W09, it is eligible; but if it has Porsche's WMI, WP0, it is not eligible)\n# pre-1981 vehicles must be made by the original vehicle manufacturer and not modified by either professional tuners or individuals\n# street-legal in its intended markets, having fulfilled the homologation tests or inspections required under either a) United States of America, b) European Union law, or (c) Japan) to be granted this status\n# sold in more than one national market.\n\n=== Measurement of top speed ===\nTo establish the top speed for cars at least since the 1990s the requirement is, in addition to the above, an independent road test with a two-way run. The mean of the top speed for both runs is taken as the car's top speed.<ref name=\"Nunez_20140224\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |title=FIA World Land Speed Records |publisher=Federation Internationale de l'Automobile |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171101124551/https://www.fia.com/sports/fia-world-land-speed-records |archive-date=1 November 2017}}</ref> In instances where the top speed has been determined by removing the limiter, the test met these requirements, and the car is sold with the limiter on then the limited speed is accepted as meeting this requirement. For the ''McLaren F1'' the estimation by ''Car and Driver'' about the speed at the rev-limiter is used.\n\n== Record-breaking production vehicles ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year\n!

Lt. [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]], from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to Alaska to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as \"Ikalikguigmyut\" in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of Sweden established a church and school south of the current site of Golovin. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire Seward Peninsula.

Lt. [[Lavrenty Zagoskin]], from the Imperial Russian Navy sent to Alaska to scout locations for trading posts, reported the village as \"Ikalikguigmyut\" in 1842. In 1867, the Mission Covenant of Sweden established a church and school south of the current site of Golovin. Around 1890, John Dexter established a trading post that became the center for swapping prospecting information for the entire Seward Peninsula. Gold was discovered in 1898 at [[Council, Alaska|Council]] and Golovin became a supply point for the gold fields.

The most recent strategy was published in December 2012.\n\nThe Cluster's ongoing strategic themes include:\n\n* 1. Continue Growth Activities \u2013 attract & develop investment.\n* 2. Support the National Skills Academy for the Process Industry skills development activities and \u2013 grow [[apprenticeships]].\n* 3. Grow Membership \u2013 develop supply chain interaction & sales.\n* 4. Continue to provide a 'Voice for the Sector'.\n\nThe new strategic themes introduced in 2012 were:\n* 1. Increase International awareness of the industry in the region.\n* 2. Improve connectivity and help bring alignment with other UK industry bodies.\n* 3. Develop or Support innovative projects for the rejuvenation, sustainability and growth of the industries in the process sector.\n* 4. Grow participation of [[Small & medium enterprises|Small & Medium Enterprises]](SMEs) in all the strategic themes of the Sector.\n\nThe Cluster's executive team are challenged to create and deliver projects and activities that deliver on these themes.\n\n==Measuring NEPIC's performance==\n\n===GVA creation===\nNEPIC's overall performance against its strategy and as a Cluster body is measured in terms of economic development within its region. This is monitored by its Industry Leadership Council and public sector observers through [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs). These mostly relate to the cluster's results in attracting and assisting both indigenous and [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) investment, as well as business growth in the local [[Small & medium enterprises|SME]] supply chain and any resulting job creation. These factors contribute to an overall performance measure of [[Gross Value Added]] (GVA). Results from the six year period 2005 to 2011 show that through its industry led activities, by 2017, NEPIC's activities are contributing significant levels of GVA to its local economy.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Journal|title=Major milestone for cluster group NEPIC|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/major-milestone-cluster-group-nepic-4442128|date=26 January 2011}}</ref> to the [[UK economy]].

An example of a Cluster collaboration in which NEPIC is a partner is the WIINTECH project, a worldwide intercluster initiative for new materials and processes focused on clean technologies.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Wiintech|title=Worldwide Intercluster Initiative for New materials and processes focused on clean TECHnologies|url=http://www.alplastics.net/Portals/0/Wiintech_flyer.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref> This collaborative project is aimed at building a common international strategy between 8 leading European clusters and to foster inter-cluster and transnational partnerships, extending international cooperation and developing a joint inter-cluster projects in areas such as technology and industrial partnerships, training & skills development, technology transfer, workforce and business mobility and business mentoring. NEPIC and the other Clusters involved have undertaken joint market visits to Japan, USA, Korea, Brazil, and India to promote the EU process industries while focusing on fast growing lead markets such as clean technology.

These were:\n\n# Provide market and industry input into the direction of research and hence the need for a practical forum to discuss market trends and future industry needs\n# Support and develop indigenous business and technical innovation and help turn these into economic growth\n# Enable access to critical facilities and equipment. Recognising that access can sometimes be cost prohibitive\n# Do more to attract corporate R&D centres to the region in order to move the region towards the achievement of 'critical mass' in different technologies\n# Help our Universities attract world class academics to the region. Recognising that having world class capability at a local university can, over time, have significant influence on the competence of local industry\n# Work to strengthen supply chains and customer networks in the region\n\nThe NEPIC innovation strategy led to studies into the establishment of biorefinery activity within the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which is being taken forward by the Cluster's Bioresources Team. It also identified the potential of the region to create innovation centres to support the process sector into the future.\n\nThe NEPIC Innovation Strategy established the region's industrial and academic innovation strengths within the [[chemistry]] and [[biotechnology]] based process sector. The work informed both public and private interests and has led directly to the creation of several innovation centres that are now managed through a national \"[[Catapult centres|catapult]]\" organisation \u2013 the [[Centre for Process Innovation]] \u2013 based at the [[Wilton Centre]], [[Redcar]] on [[Teesside]].

In County Durham: High Force Research, Newchem Technologies, Thomas Swan, Exwold Technology and Huntsman Tioxide, and Frutarom. In Tyne and Wear and Northumberland Kilfrost, [[Akzo]] & [[International Paint]] and Chemson all manufacture speciality chemicals while Aesica, Sterling Pharma Solutions and [[Piramal Enterprises Ltd|Piramal]] make and use fine chemical intermediates mostly as pharmaceutical intermediates. Companies in the NEPIC footprint are also involved in the scale up, manufacture and commercialisation of [[Graphene]], Applied Graphene Materials<ref>{{cite news|first= Rebecca|last= Burn-Callander|title= Graphene maker aims to build British, billion-pound venture|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/10936423/Graphene-maker-aims-to-build-British-billion-pound-venture.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> and Thomas Swan Limited.<ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Gibson | title=Consett firm Thomas Swan sees export success with grapheme |publisher=The Journal| url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/consett-firm-thomas-swan-sees-7243084|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> The UK Government has also chosen this Cluster to base its National Graphene Applications Centre.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Engineer|title=New UK graphene centre to focus on application development|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/channels/policy-and-business/news/new-uk-graphene-centre-to-focus-on-application-development/1018255.article|date=20 March 2014| accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe above chemical companies are also supported by specialist utility providers and speciality gas providers such as Sembcorp and BOC-Linde, bulk storage businesses such as Simon Storage and [[Vopak]], while speciality packaging and formulation of chemicals is provided by companies such as Banner Chemicals, MP Storage and Exwold who also all operate Teesside facilities. Throughout the whole region [[Northumbrian Water]] can provide bulk water and also [[waste water treatment]] facilities to the all sectors of the process industry. The region is self-sufficient in water and can allocate industrial quantities to new investors due to the development of the [[Kielder Water|Kielder Reservoir]].\n\n===Polymers===\nPolymer manufacturing in the northeast of England Process Industry Cluster has some large-scale activity based on Teesside. SABIC operate one of the world's biggest [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) plants,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Mike|publisher=Gazettelive|title=Duke of York told of SABIC challenges ahead|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/business/business-news/duke-york-told-sabic-challenges-3670258|date=6 September 2012}}</ref> which makes the United Kingdom a net exporter of LDPE. Lotte Chemical manufacture both [[purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET). [[Ineos]] manufacture [[acrylonitrile]], an intermediate used for [[Nylon 66]] and [[acrylate polymer|acrylics]]. Speciality polymer products are also made there. Ineos, for example, also manufacture aqueous [[polyvinylchloride]] PVC products in County Durham whilst [[Victrex]] manufacture all the monomer for their [[PEEK|polyether ether ketone (PEEK)]] product at their facility on Teesside. There are also new biopolymers and resins in development and scale up by companies such as Plaxica, which is developing new processes to commercialise [[polylactic acid]] (PLA) and Cambridge Biopolymers, who are commercialising functional bioresins; both are based at the Teesside process industry research centre [[Wilton International]].\n\nNew processes for the recycling of polymers have also been commercialised at Wilton. For example, Biffa Polymers recycle a large percentage of the UK's plastic milk bottles into polymer chip. This was one of the first technology applications which allowed food-grade polymer packaging to be recycled without passing through a melted phase.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Josh|publisher=Petcore Europe|title=Plastics recycling firm Biffa Polymers has officially opened its first large-scale dedicated mixed plastic sorting and reprocessing facility |url=http://www.petcore-europe.org/index.php?q=content/plastics-recycling-firm-biffa-polymers-has-officially-opened-its-first-large-scale-dedicated|date=18 March 2011}}</ref> In 2013, [[SNF Floerger|SNF]] announced that they intend to build a polymer manufacturing unit on Teesside to make [[polyacrylamide]] emulsion for the oil industry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Lindsay|publisher=Gazettelive|title=SNF Oil and Gas hope to bring jobs to Billingham|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/snf-oil-gas-hope-bring-3670570|date=15 September 2012}}</ref> Although not strictly a polymer, the acrylic [[Perspex]] is a well known plastic like material; it and other acrylic products are manufactured in Teesside and County Durham by [[Lucite|Lucite International]], which is a subsidiary of [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi corporation]].\n\nThe region also has a significant number of polymer extrusion and forming companies that supply a number of advanced engineering supply chains<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Ramsbotham|title=The North East's businesses lead the UK's export market|publisher=Make it Sunderland|url=http://www.makeitsunderland.com/index.aspx?articleid=6991|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> notably the automobile supply chain which, in northeast England, is dominated by [[Nissan]]'s European automobile manufacturing plant at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The automobile supply chain in this region is represented by the North East Automobile Alliance (NEAA).<ref>{{cite news|first= Mark|last= Richardson|newspaper= Northern Echo|title= North East Automotive Alliance launched|URL=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/11884637.North_East_Automotive_Alliance_launched/|date= 27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmaceuticals===\nThis region has an active, modern pharmaceutical industry and the northeast of England has a full capability in the pharmaceutical [[value chain]], including [[Drug discovery|pre-clinical drug discovery]] and development, clinical research and development, [[clinical trial]] management, pilot-scale manufacturing, full-scale pharmaceutical ingredient and intermediate manufacturing, as well as final product formulation, packaging and distribution. Furthermore, pharmaceutical businesses are underpinned by an experienced and successful supply chain. Within the NEPIC cluster there are companies that provide laboratory facilities, manufacturing sites, logistics, construction and procurement, analytical sciences, validation consultants, maintenance, operation and financial services, public relations and contingency planning.\n\nFundamental [[medical research]] is done in this region at several of its universities. For example, [[Newcastle University]] was the first to receive a licence in the UK to perform research on [[stem cells]] and this is a leading centre for such research today. Indeed [[Karim Nayernia]] was the first to isolate spermatagonial stem cells at this University. Many new healthcare developments have arisen from this research work.<ref>{{cite web|publisher =Durham University|first=Martin|last=Cox|title=Stem cell research and the North East England Stem Cell Institute|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/durham.first/summer07/stemcell/nesci/|year=2007|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial [[drug development]] continues at ARCINOVA in Alnwick. Small molecule drug [[Chemical engineering|scale-up]] and [[process development]] and manufacture is provided to [[current good manufacturing practice]](cGMP) standards to pharmaceutical companies around the world by several NEPIC Cluster members such as Aesica Pharmaceuticals, Sterling Pharma Solutions, [[Piramal Enterprises Ltd|Piramal]] Healthcare, all of which are based in [[Northumberland]] and also by Fine Organics on [[Teesside]]. Aesica, Sterling, Piramal (Northumberland) are companies that perform primary manufacture of [[active pharmaceutical ingredients]](APIs) to cGMP standards. While Aesica, Piramal, [[Merck Sharp and Dohme|MSD]] (Northumberland), [[Sanofi]] (Tyne & Wear), [[GlaxoSmithKline]], Quantum Pharmaceuticals<ref>{{cite news|first= Coreena |last= Ford|publisher= The Chronicle|title= Record Year for North East Pharma Company|url= http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/record-year-north-east-pharma-11309354|date= 18 May 2016|accessdate=28 March 2017}}</ref> and Bristol Laboratories<ref>{{cite news|first= Coreena|last= Ford|publisher=The Journal|title= Bristol Laboratories among businesses taking up North East industrial space|url= http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/bristol-laboratories-among-businesses-taking-7549342|date= 4 August 2017|accessdate= 28 March 2017}}</ref> in (County Durham) are all secondary pharmaceutical manufacturers with large facilities in the region.

Pharmaceuticals make up a significant proportion of the exports of the northeast of England. The region produces 33% of the UK's GDP in pharmaceutical \nmanufacturing with 95% of finished product exported to global markets<ref>{{cite article|first=North East Local Enterprise Partnership|last= NELEP|publisher= NE LEP|title= Life sciences healthy and growing|url= http://www.nelep.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Lifescience-Brochure-23-10-15-amended.pdf|page= 3|date= 23 October 2015|accessdate= 28 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Biotechnology===\nBiotechnology has become widely used in many industrial and academic activities and the following classifications have become established. [[Red Biotechnology]] \u2013 Medical, Health care and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. [[White Biotechnology]] \u2013 Biotechnology for industrial products. [[Green Biotechnology]] \u2013 Biotechnology applied to environmental issues. [[Blue Biotechnology]] \u2013 Biotechnology based on marine organisms. The northeast of England has strengths in all these areas.\n\nIndustrial and academic biotechnological research in [[Red Biotechnology]] has been well established in the northeast England and has developed into strengths in [[diagnostics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[Biomanufacturing]], [[Biocatalysis & Biotransformation|Biocatalysis & Bio-transformations]], [[Bioremediation]], Pharmaceutical research, Microbiological analysis and testing, Production of [[antibodies]], [[proteins]] and [[peptides]]. Leading edge research is done at the region's Universities, for example [[Newcastle University]] was the first institution in Europe, second in the world, to receive permission to pursue stem-cell research in human embryos.\n\nNew industries that have now developed form a significant sector in the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Fujifilm Diosynth Biologics at Billingham now employs over 550 people, the majority of them being graduate-level skills in biotechnology, to develop new products and innovative processes for the pharmaceutical industry. Within a mile of the Fujifilm complex are small companies working on the building blocks of life. Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) supports discovery research activities by providing custom-made research reagents, principally peptides and antibodies. In Sunderland, Immuno Diagnostic Systems (IDS) are producing medical test kits and in Hartlepool Hart Biologicals produce diagnostic products for use in the detection, prevention, and monitoring of a number of medical conditions. In Morpeth, Northumberland [[Piramal Healthcare]] invested into bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.\n\nAcross the region, companies such as Leica Biosystems, Orla Proteins, Helena Bioscience, Thermo Fischer Scientific and [[Millipore Corporation|Millipore]] are significant contributors to the growing strength of the sector and its supply chain.<ref>{{cite article|publisher=Life Science Clusters|title=Biotechnology Clusters \u2013 supporting the UK as Europe's No1 in Bioscience|pages=36\u201338|url=http://www.biopartner.co.uk/documents/clustersarticle.pdf|date=2007|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial, [[White Biotechnology]] includes manufacturing, alternative energy (or \"bioenergy\"), and biomaterials and is also well established in the region. The manufacturers of the food protein Quorn, Marlow Foods, now part of [[Premier Foods]], developed their technology here and still operate in this region. [[Northumbrian Water]] has invested in two large scale [[anaerobic digestion]] facilities to recover energy from their domestic and industrial waste water streams. In [[Stockton-on-Tees]], Cleveland Biotechnology has been pioneering natural solutions to handling effluents and waste materials. In [[Billingham]], Biochemica is applying new biotechnology solutions to industrial water treatment. Biotechnology is also being applied to manufacture polymers by Plaxica and functional resins by Cambridge Biopolymers. Several of the Cluster's Fine and Specialty chemical companies are utilising enzymatic transformations in their manufacturing processes. Developments such as these are being supported by The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) which hosts the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (NIBF) at [[Wilton International]].\n\n===Renewables and bioresources===\nMembers of the North East England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) are also focusing on development of [[biorefinery]] concepts which could impact on fine, speciality and [[commodity chemicals]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[agrochemicals]] and [[bio-fuels]] such as [[bioethanol]] and [[biodiesel]].<ref>{{cite report|publisher=nepic|title=Northeast of England Business Opportunities from Biomass & Waste Materials|url=http://www.northeastbiofuels.com/_assets/file/ne_businessopportunities2010.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> Large scale biofuels plants are already operating on [[Teesside]] by Ensus and Harvest Energy, while [[Greenergy]] (note: Harvest and Greenergy are all now part of the Interterminals Group) operate a biofuel blending facility. [[CF Industries]] (formerly GrowHow) who manufacture fertilizer is capturing [[carbon dioxide]] from their ammonia based fertilizer business and this is being used to aid the growing of tomatoes in an industrial market garden on Teesside.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Journal|title=Green(er)house is the right way to grow |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/greenerhouse-right-way-grow-4515105|date=27 November 2007}}</ref> This reduces emissions and eliminates road miles from former European imports. Sembcorp operate a 30 MW biomass power plant known as Wilton 10 using both waste wood and coppiced wood, which is integrated into the existing chemical processes on the Wilton Chemical Site. A number of other biomass and waste to energy plants are in development within the Cluster such as Wilton 11<ref>{{cite news|last=McLauchlan|first=Karen| publisher=Gazettelive|title=\u00a31.2bn deal will see new \u00a3200m Wilton power plant built|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/12bn-deal-see-new-200m-3664642|date=19 April 2013}}</ref> and MGT Power are building their [[Teesport Renewable Energy Plant]].<ref>{{cite news|first= Coreena|last= Ford|publisher= The Chronicle|title= Hundreds of jobs created as \u00a3650m North East energy plant is poised to start|url= http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/business/business-news/hundreds-jobs-created-650m-north-11739710|date= 12 August 2016|accessdate= 28 March 2017}}</ref> SITA already operate an energy from waste unit in Middlesbrough. Many of the Cluster companies working on Renewables and Bioresources projects to develop a lower carbon future for the sector collaborate through the NEPIC Clusters Bioresources Collaborative Thrust Team. The Cluster's growing strength in low carbon, sustainable industry has gained national recognition.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Hansard|title=Report on Northeast Renewable Industries|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2009/12/report-on-north-east-renewable-industries/|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe drive to industrialise [[biorefinery]] technologies within the NEPIC Cluster is mostly aimed at reducing [[carbon emissions]] or at making manufacturing more sustainable by counterbalancing the emissions by the reabsorption of [[carbon dioxide]] through the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Alternatively they are implementing technologies that enable the use of societal waste as a new basic raw material. The [[Chemical Engineering]] technologies that are being implemented include advanced [[gasification]] and [[Air Products]] are implementing their [[plasma gasification]] technology on Teesside, the company has announced that a second such unit is also to be built in this location.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Messenger|publisher=Waste Management News|title=Second Plasma Gasification Plant for Teesside Following Government Deal|url=http://www.waste-management-world.com/articles/2013/04/plasma-gasification-waste-to-energy-air-products-teesside-uk-government.html|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> Others are developing projects utilising [[pyrolysis]] to recover useful materials from carbon wastes and also new processes to manufacture [[synthetic natural gas|biosynthetic natural gas]] (SNG)and fuels from air being developed by Air Fuels Synthesis. [[Depolymerisation]] processes are also under investigation.\n\nThe Cluster companies and new investors collaborating through the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) on renewables and bioresources projects do so through the Cluster's Bioresources Thrust Team.\n\n==Supporting and developing an extensive supply chain==\nThe Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Speciality, Biotechnology companies cannot operate without the support of an extensive local [[supply chain]]. Supply Chain companies within NEPIC include [[Analytical chemistry|Analytical]] and [[Measurement Science and Technology|Measurement Science]] Companies, [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Control Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Process Engineering]], [[Project engineering methodology|Project Engineering]], [[Construction Engineering]], [[Maintenance engineering|Maintenance Engineering]], [[Toolmaker]]s, Business and Site Security, [[Safety management systems|Safety Management]], [[Disaster management|Disaster]] and Business Recovery Management, Engineering Equipment Suppliers, Laboratory Equipment Suppliers, Business Performance Improvement Consultants, Legal Firms, Management & Strategy Consultants, [[Process development|Process Development]], Publicity Firms, Publishers and Printers, Purchasing Companies, Recruitment Companies, Research Institutions etc.\n\nThe Cluster Leadership Team believe that the promotion of the capability of these supply chain companies is crucial to its ability to attract investment to the region.  Furthermore the Cluster promotes its supply chain members' businesses around the world to help them secure more business, locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThe concentration of such supply chain businesses in the northeast of England is internationally significant. In 2009 Service Network commissioned Shared Intelligence and Gavurin to undertake an assessment of the Knowledge Intensive Business & Services (KIBS) sector in the northeast of England. The report concludes that KIBS companies are distributed across the whole of the region. It identifies that the region has a particular strength in Architectural & Engineering Activities & Related Technical Consultancy (AETC) workplaces with 2810 such firms employing 13,385 people. The report also identifies that the concentration of ATEC business is the highest in the UK and around [[Stockton-on-Tees]] the concentration is amongst the highest for such businesses in Europe.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=One North East|title=Service Network Research |date=June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Role of clusters such as NEPIC in globalised industries==\n\nAccording to Christian Ketels of [[Harvard Business School]] \"[[Globalisation]] has not only raised the relative role of location and Clusters, it has raised the bar in terms of the demands that successful clusters have to meet.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ketels|first=Christian|publisher=European Petrochemical Association|title=The Role of Clusters in the Chemical Industry|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237833671|year=2007|page=13|accessdate= 27 March 2017}}</ref> Ketels suggests that this is because competition between clusters has increased and rival locations are vying for any new investment in their sectors. It is this that pressurises Cluster organisations to meet the best practice of clusters in other regions. Such competition has driven clusters to become more specialised and there is now much more differentiation, for example, some clusters are R&D Hubs while others focus on manufacturing or are service orientated. Ketels' premise is that this increasing level of specialisation has increased linkages between cluster bodies and that the ability of the cluster management teams to make such linkages and partnerships has become an important key strength. In the past, Ketels suggests, clusters were like islands competing with each other whereas now they are part of Global supply chains often competing and co-operating at the same time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ketels|first=Christian|publisher=European Petrochemical Association|title=The Role of Clusters in the Chemical Industry|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237833671|year=2007|accessdate= 27 March 2017|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nKetels' observations are borne out by the work of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which uses its cluster to cluster links in two ways to meet the strategic needs of its Industrial Leadership Council. Firstly, to meet its Internationalisation aims, NEPIC's cluster to cluster activities build up a wider international understanding of the capabilities of the industry in its region and also of its members specific businesses. Secondly, it uses cluster to cluster relationships to help develop the business, particularly of its [[Small and Medium Enterprise]] (SME) members, with the aim of strengthening SME businesses in its local supply chain. NEPIC does this by using its international linkages and partnerships to de-risk the initial development of international trade for its members. This is achieved by reciprocal knowledge and support of partner clusters and trade bodies and their members. NEPIC's approach is to develop formal Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)with industry clusters and business associations around the world and build partnerships to create knowledge sharing opportunities.\n\nIn Europe, NEPIC has projects and agreements with the following Cluster bodies: Axelera,<ref>{{cite news|first=Ruth|last=Mitchell|publisher=BDaily|title=NEPIC signs international collaboration|url=http://bdaily.co.uk/business/03-12-2007/nepic-signs-international-collaboration/|date=3 December 2007}}</ref> and through the WIINTECH consortium, Plastipolis in France, Proplast in Italy, Chemie-Cluster Bayern (CCB) in Germany, Clusterland in Austria, Plastival in Spain, Veneto Nanotech in Italy and Poolnet in Portugal.

The most recent strategy was published in December 2012.\n\nThe Cluster's ongoing strategic themes include:\n\n* 1. Continue Growth Activities - attract & develop investment.\n* 2. Support the National Skills Academy for the Process Industry skills development activities and - grow [[apprenticeships]].\n* 3. Grow Membership - develop supply chain interaction & sales.\n* 4. Continue to provide a 'Voice for the Sector'.\n\nThe new strategic themes introduced in 2012 were:\n* 1. Increase International awareness of the industry in the region.\n* 2. Improve connectivity and help bring alignment with other UK industry bodies.\n* 3. Develop or Support innovative projects for the rejuvenation, sustainability and growth of the industries in the process sector.\n* 4. Grow participation of [[Small & medium enterprises|Small & Medium Enterprises]](SMEs) in all the strategic themes of the Sector.\n\nThe Cluster's executive team are challenged to create and deliver projects and activities that deliver on these themes.\n\n==Measuring NEPIC's performance==\n\n===GVA creation===\nNEPIC's overall performance against its strategy and as a Cluster body is measured in terms of economic development within its region. This is monitored by its Industry Leadership Council and public sector observers through [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs). These mostly relate to the cluster's results in attracting and assisting both indigenous and [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI) investment, as well as business growth in the local [[Small & medium enterprises|SME]] supply chain and any resulting job creation.

These were:\n\n# Provide market and industry input into the direction of research and hence the need for a practical forum to discuss market trends and future industry needs\n# Support and develop indigenous business and technical innovation and help turn these into economic growth\n# Enable access to critical facilities and equipment. Recognising that access can sometimes be cost prohibitive\n# Do more to attract corporate R&D centres to the region in order to move the region towards the achievement of 'critical mass' in different technologies\n# Help our Universities attract world class academics to the region. Recognising that having world class capability at a local university can, over time, have significant influence on the competence of local industry\n# Work to strengthen supply chains and customer networks in the region\n\nThe NEPIC innovation strategy led to studies into the establishment of biorefinery activity within the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which is being taken forward by the Cluster's Bioresources Team. It also identified the potential of the region to create innovation centres to support the process sector into the future.\n\nThe NEPIC Innovation Strategy established the region's industrial and academic innovation strengths within the [[chemistry]] and [[biotechnology]] based process sector.

COGENT and NSAPI developed skills profiles for most jobs in the process sector and these are becoming the standards for the industry across the UK. These are known as the \"Gold Standards\". The Skills Academy is also accrediting those delivering apprenticeships and courses into the sector, effectively, approving quality of delivery and course content. COGENT also operate a very effective career web site known as the \"Career Pathway\" covering all the sub sectors of the Process Industry. It shows detailed job profiles and key skill requirements for most roles in the sector as well as career options.\n\n===Attracting young people into science and engineering===\nRegardless of gender, race or ethnicity, interest in science begins in early childhood.

They help improve resource efficiency, time management as well as bring in innovation in manufacturing practices.\" This notion of broad science-based industries linking together to address cross cutting issues such as growth, sustainability, skills, innovation, infrastructure, stakeholder engagement, sharing best practice and providing a significant representational voice is what brought together the chemical, pharmaceutical, polymer, speciality materials, biotechnology and renewable energy and materials companies based in the northeast of England to create a cluster body to coordinate their work.\n\nNEPIC has two offices in the region: one in the north in [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]] and one in the south at [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]] near Redcar in Teesside. At the Wilton location, NEPIC is amongst several process sector and supply chain companies that work out of the process industry research centre [[Wilton International]]. The UK Innovation Catapult, the  Centre for Process Innovation, is also based in this multi-occupancy technical development centre.\n\n===Chemicals===\nThe chemical companies in the membership of NEPIC can be categorised into three groups: [[petrochemical]], [[Commodity chemicals|commodity chemical]], [[Fine chemicals|fine]] and [[Speciality chemicals|speciality chemical]] companies. The petrochemical and commodity chemical companies are those most likely to utilise large infrastructure such as pipelines, storage facilities, utilities, power stations, port facilities and railways. These companies in this Cluster are almost exclusively based on Teesside, mostly on three chemical industrial parks at [[Wilton, Redcar and Cleveland|Wilton]], [[Billingham]] and [[Seal Sands]]. Examples of large scale commodity manufacturers in the NEPIC Cluster are Sabic making ethylene, low-density polyethylene and aromatics, [[Ineos]] acrylonitrile, [[GrowHow]] ammonia and ammonia based fertilizers, Ensus bioethanol and animal feed, [[Conoco Phillips]] oil refining, [[Omya]] Calcium Carbonate, [[Huntsman Corporation|Huntsman]] polyurethane intermediates and titanium dioxide, Harvest Energy biodiesel and [[Greenergy]] fuel blending. These commodity chemical companies used to share logistical, utility and other infrastructure with Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) who made steel in [[Redcar and Cleveland|Redcar]] until final closure in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Further support for former SSI workers|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-36494677|accessdate=10 July 2016|work=BBC News|date=9 June 2016}}</ref> This was Europe's second largest operational blast furnace. [[Tata Steel|TATA]] Steel still operate steel milling and rolling units on Teesside.\n\nThe speciality chemical and fine chemical companies in the NEPIC Cluster are spread across all the sub-regions of northeast England including Teesside, [[County Durham]], [[Tyne and Wear]] and [[Northumberland]]. Examples on Teesside: Fine Organics, Chemoxy, Vertellus, [[Johnson Matthey]], [[Koppers]], Lucite International and [[Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation|Mitsubishi Chemicals]]. In County Durham: High Force Research, Newchem Technologies, Thomas Swan, Exwold Technology and Huntsman Tioxide, and Frutarom. In Tyne and Wear and Northumberland Kilfrost, [[Akzo]] & [[International Paint]] and Chemson all manufacture speciality chemicals while Aesica, Sterling Pharma Solutions and [[Piramal Enterprises Ltd|Piramal]] make and use fine chemical intermediates mostly as pharmaceutical intermediates. Companies in the NEPIC footprint are also involved in the scale up, manufacture and commercialisation of [[Graphene]], Applied Graphene Materials<ref>{{cite news|first= Rebecca|last= Burn-Callander|title= Graphene maker aims to build British, billion-pound venture|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/10936423/Graphene-maker-aims-to-build-British-billion-pound-venture.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 July 2014|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref> and Thomas Swan Limited.<ref>{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Gibson | title=Consett firm Thomas Swan sees export success with grapheme |publisher=The Journal| url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/consett-firm-thomas-swan-sees-7243084|date=10 June 2014|accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> The UK Government has also chosen this Cluster to base its National Graphene Applications Centre.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Engineer|title=New UK graphene centre to focus on application development|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/channels/policy-and-business/news/new-uk-graphene-centre-to-focus-on-application-development/1018255.article|date=20 March 2014| accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe above chemical companies are also supported by specialist utility providers and speciality gas providers such as Sembcorp and BOC-Linde, bulk storage businesses such as Simon Storage and [[Vopak]], while speciality packaging and formulation of chemicals is provided by companies such as Banner Chemicals, MP Storage and Exwold who also all operate Teesside facilities. Throughout the whole region [[Northumbrian Water]] can provide bulk water and also [[waste water treatment]] facilities to the all sectors of the process industry. The region is self-sufficient in water and can allocate industrial quantities to new investors due to the development of the [[Kielder Water|Kielder Reservoir]].\n\n===Polymers===\nPolymer manufacturing in the northeast of England Process Industry Cluster has some large-scale activity based on Teesside. SABIC operate one of the world's biggest [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) plants,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Mike|publisher=Gazettelive|title=Duke of York told of SABIC challenges ahead|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/business/business-news/duke-york-told-sabic-challenges-3670258|date=6 September 2012}}</ref> which makes the United Kingdom a net exporter of LDPE. Lotte Chemical manufacture both [[purified terephthalic acid]] (PTA) and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET). [[Ineos]] manufacture [[acrylonitrile]], an intermediate used for [[Nylon 66]] and [[acrylate polymer|acrylics]]. Speciality polymer products are also made there. Ineos, for example, also manufacture aqueous [[polyvinylchloride]] PVC products in County Durham whilst [[Victrex]] manufacture all the monomer for their [[PEEK|polyether ether ketone (PEEK)]] product at their facility on Teesside. There are also new biopolymers and resins in development and scale up by companies such as Plaxica, which is developing new processes to commercialise [[polylactic acid]] (PLA) and Cambridge Biopolymers, who are commercialising functional bioresins; both are based at the Teesside process industry research centre [[Wilton International]].\n\nNew processes for the recycling of polymers have also been commercialised at Wilton. For example, Biffa Polymers recycle a large percentage of the UK's plastic milk bottles into polymer chip. This was one of the first technology applications which allowed food-grade polymer packaging to be recycled without passing through a melted phase.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Josh|publisher=Petcore Europe|title=Plastics recycling firm Biffa Polymers has officially opened its first large-scale dedicated mixed plastic sorting and reprocessing facility |url=http://www.petcore-europe.org/index.php?q=content/plastics-recycling-firm-biffa-polymers-has-officially-opened-its-first-large-scale-dedicated|date=18 March 2011}}</ref> In 2013, [[SNF Floerger|SNF]] announced that they intend to build a polymer manufacturing unit on Teesside to make [[polyacrylamide]] emulsion for the oil industry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bruce|first=Lindsay|publisher=Gazettelive|title=SNF Oil and Gas hope to bring jobs to Billingham|url=http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/news/local-news/snf-oil-gas-hope-bring-3670570|date=15 September 2012}}</ref> Although not strictly a polymer, the acrylic [[Perspex]] is a well known plastic like material; it and other acrylic products are manufactured in Teesside and County Durham by [[Lucite|Lucite International]], which is a subsidiary of [[Mitsubishi|Mitsubishi corporation]].\n\nThe region also has a significant number of polymer extrusion and forming companies that supply a number of advanced engineering supply chains<ref>{{cite web|first=James|last=Ramsbotham|title=The North East's businesses lead the UK's export market|publisher=Make it Sunderland|url=http://www.makeitsunderland.com/index.aspx?articleid=6991|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> notably the automobile supply chain which, in northeast England, is dominated by [[Nissan]]'s European automobile manufacturing plant at [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]]. The automobile supply chain in this region is represented by the North East Automobile Alliance (NEAA).<ref>{{cite news|first= Mark|last= Richardson|newspaper= Northern Echo|title= North East Automotive Alliance launched|URL=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/business/news/11884637.North_East_Automotive_Alliance_launched/|date= 27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Pharmaceuticals===\nThis region has an active, modern pharmaceutical industry and the northeast of England has a full capability in the pharmaceutical [[value chain]], including [[Drug discovery|pre-clinical drug discovery]] and development, clinical research and development, [[clinical trial]] management, pilot-scale manufacturing, full-scale pharmaceutical ingredient and intermediate manufacturing, as well as final product formulation, packaging and distribution. Furthermore, pharmaceutical businesses are underpinned by an experienced and successful supply chain. Within the NEPIC cluster there are companies that provide laboratory facilities, manufacturing sites, logistics, construction and procurement, analytical sciences, validation consultants, maintenance, operation and financial services, public relations and contingency planning.\n\nFundamental [[medical research]] is done in this region at several of its universities. For example, [[Newcastle University]] was the first to receive a licence in the UK to perform research on [[stem cells]] and this is a leading centre for such research today. Indeed [[Karim Nayernia]] was the first to isolate spermatagonial stem cells at this University. Many new healthcare developments have arisen from this research work.<ref>{{cite web|publisher =Durham University|first=Martin|last=Cox|title=Stem cell research and the North East England Stem Cell Institute|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/durham.first/summer07/stemcell/nesci/|year=2007|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial [[drug development]] continues at ARCINOVA in Alnwick.

[[Red Biotechnology]] \u2013 Medical, Health care and Pharmaceutical Biotechnology. [[White Biotechnology]] - Biotechnology for industrial products. [[Green Biotechnology]] - Biotechnology applied to environmental issues. [[Blue Biotechnology]] - Biotechnology based on marine organisms. The northeast of England has strengths in all these areas.\n\nIndustrial and academic biotechnological research in [[Red Biotechnology]] has been well established in the northeast England and has developed into strengths in [[diagnostics]], [[bioinformatics]], [[Biomanufacturing]], [[Biocatalysis & Biotransformation|Biocatalysis & Bio-transformations]], [[Bioremediation]], Pharmaceutical research, Microbiological analysis and testing, Production of [[antibodies]], [[proteins]] and [[peptides]]. Leading edge research is done at the region's Universities, for example [[Newcastle University]] was the first institution in Europe, second in the world, to receive permission to pursue stem-cell research in human embryos.\n\nNew industries that have now developed form a significant sector in the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). Fujifilm Diosynth Biologics at Billingham now employs over 550 people, the majority of them being graduate-level skills in biotechnology, to develop new products and innovative processes for the pharmaceutical industry. Within a mile of the Fujifilm complex are small companies working on the building blocks of life. Cambridge Research Biochemicals (CRB) supports discovery research activities by providing custom-made research reagents, principally peptides and antibodies. In Sunderland, Immuno Diagnostic Systems (IDS) are producing medical test kits and in Hartlepool Hart Biologicals produce diagnostic products for use in the detection, prevention, and monitoring of a number of medical conditions. In Morpeth, Northumberland [[Piramal Healthcare]] invested into bio-pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.\n\nAcross the region, companies such as Leica Biosystems, Orla Proteins, Helena Bioscience, Thermo Fischer Scientific and [[Millipore Corporation|Millipore]] are significant contributors to the growing strength of the sector and its supply chain.<ref>{{cite article|publisher=Life Science Clusters|title=Biotechnology Clusters \u2013 supporting the UK as Europe's No1 in Bioscience|pages=36\u201338|url=http://www.biopartner.co.uk/documents/clustersarticle.pdf|date=2007|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIndustrial, [[White Biotechnology]] includes manufacturing, alternative energy (or \"bioenergy\"), and biomaterials and is also well established in the region. The manufacturers of the food protein Quorn, Marlow Foods, now part of [[Premier Foods]], developed their technology here and still operate in this region. [[Northumbrian Water]] has invested in two large scale [[anaerobic digestion]] facilities to recover energy from their domestic and industrial waste water streams. In [[Stockton-on-Tees]], Cleveland Biotechnology has been pioneering natural solutions to handling effluents and waste materials. In [[Billingham]], Biochemica is applying new biotechnology solutions to industrial water treatment. Biotechnology is also being applied to manufacture polymers by Plaxica and functional resins by Cambridge Biopolymers. Several of the Cluster's Fine and Specialty chemical companies are utilising enzymatic transformations in their manufacturing processes. Developments such as these are being supported by The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI) which hosts the National Industrial Biotechnology Facility (NIBF) at [[Wilton International]].\n\n===Renewables and bioresources===\nMembers of the North East England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) are also focusing on development of [[biorefinery]] concepts which could impact on fine, speciality and [[commodity chemicals]], [[pharmaceuticals]], [[agrochemicals]] and [[bio-fuels]] such as [[bioethanol]] and [[biodiesel]].<ref>{{cite report|publisher=nepic|title=Northeast of England Business Opportunities from Biomass & Waste Materials|url=http://www.northeastbiofuels.com/_assets/file/ne_businessopportunities2010.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref> Large scale biofuels plants are already operating on [[Teesside]] by Ensus and Harvest Energy, while [[Greenergy]] (note: Harvest and Greenergy are all now part of the Interterminals Group) operate a biofuel blending facility.

Many of the Cluster companies working on Renewables and Bioresources projects to develop a lower carbon future for the sector collaborate through the NEPIC Clusters Bioresources Collaborative Thrust Team. The Cluster's growing strength in low carbon, sustainable industry has gained national recognition.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Hansard|title=Report on Northeast Renewable Industries|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2009/12/report-on-north-east-renewable-industries/|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe drive to industrialise [[biorefinery]] technologies within the NEPIC Cluster is mostly aimed at reducing [[carbon emissions]] or at making manufacturing more sustainable by counterbalancing the emissions by the reabsorption of [[carbon dioxide]] through the growth of an equivalent amount of biomass. Alternatively they are implementing technologies that enable the use of societal waste as a new basic raw material. The [[Chemical Engineering]] technologies that are being implemented include advanced [[gasification]] and [[Air Products]] are implementing their [[plasma gasification]] technology on Teesside, the company has announced that a second such unit is also to be built in this location.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Messenger|publisher=Waste Management News|title=Second Plasma Gasification Plant for Teesside Following Government Deal|url=http://www.waste-management-world.com/articles/2013/04/plasma-gasification-waste-to-energy-air-products-teesside-uk-government.html|date=12 April 2013}}</ref> Others are developing projects utilising [[pyrolysis]] to recover useful materials from carbon wastes and also new processes to manufacture [[synthetic natural gas|biosynthetic natural gas]] (SNG)and fuels from air being developed by Air Fuels Synthesis. [[Depolymerisation]] processes are also under investigation.\n\nThe Cluster companies and new investors collaborating through the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) on renewables and bioresources projects do so through the Cluster's Bioresources Thrust Team.\n\n==Supporting and developing an extensive supply chain==\nThe Chemical, Pharmaceutical, Speciality, Biotechnology companies cannot operate without the support of an extensive local [[supply chain]]. Supply Chain companies within NEPIC include [[Analytical chemistry|Analytical]] and [[Measurement Science and Technology|Measurement Science]] Companies, [[Chemical Engineering]], [[Control Engineering]], [[Mechanical Engineering]], [[Process Engineering]], [[Project engineering methodology|Project Engineering]], [[Construction Engineering]], [[Maintenance engineering|Maintenance Engineering]], [[Toolmaker]]s, Business and Site Security, [[Safety management systems|Safety Management]], [[Disaster management|Disaster]] and Business Recovery Management, Engineering Equipment Suppliers, Laboratory Equipment Suppliers, Business Performance Improvement Consultants, Legal Firms, Management & Strategy Consultants, [[Process development|Process Development]], Publicity Firms, Publishers and Printers, Purchasing Companies, Recruitment Companies, Research Institutions etc.\n\nThe Cluster Leadership Team believe that the promotion of the capability of these supply chain companies is crucial to its ability to attract investment to the region.  Furthermore the Cluster promotes its supply chain members' businesses around the world to help them secure more business, locally, nationally and internationally.\n\nThe concentration of such supply chain businesses in the northeast of England is internationally significant. In 2009 Service Network commissioned Shared Intelligence and Gavurin to undertake an assessment of the Knowledge Intensive Business & Services (KIBS) sector in the northeast of England. The report concludes that KIBS companies are distributed across the whole of the region. It identifies that the region has a particular strength in Architectural & Engineering Activities & Related Technical Consultancy (AETC) workplaces with 2810 such firms employing 13,385 people. The report also identifies that the concentration of ATEC business is the highest in the UK and around [[Stockton-on-Tees]] the concentration is amongst the highest for such businesses in Europe.<ref>{{cite report|publisher=One North East|title=Service Network Research |date=June 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Role of clusters such as NEPIC in globalised industries==\n\nAccording to Christian Ketels of [[Harvard Business School]] \"[[Globalisation]] has not only raised the relative role of location and Clusters, it has raised the bar in terms of the demands that successful clusters have to meet.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ketels|first=Christian|publisher=European Petrochemical Association|title=The Role of Clusters in the Chemical Industry|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237833671|year=2007|page=13|access-date= 27 March 2017}}</ref> Ketels suggests that this is because competition between clusters has increased and rival locations are vying for any new investment in their sectors. It is this that pressurises Cluster organisations to meet the best practice of clusters in other regions. Such competition has driven clusters to become more specialised and there is now much more differentiation, for example, some clusters are R&D Hubs while others focus on manufacturing or are service orientated. Ketels' premise is that this increasing level of specialisation has increased linkages between cluster bodies and that the ability of the cluster management teams to make such linkages and partnerships has become an important key strength. In the past, Ketels suggests, clusters were like islands competing with each other whereas now they are part of Global supply chains often competing and co-operating at the same time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ketels|first=Christian|publisher=European Petrochemical Association|title=The Role of Clusters in the Chemical Industry|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237833671|year=2007|access-date= 27 March 2017|pages=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nKetels' observations are borne out by the work of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC) which uses its cluster to cluster links in two ways to meet the strategic needs of its Industrial Leadership Council. Firstly, to meet its Internationalisation aims, NEPIC's cluster to cluster activities build up a wider international understanding of the capabilities of the industry in its region and also of its members specific businesses. Secondly, it uses cluster to cluster relationships to help develop the business, particularly of its [[Small and Medium Enterprise]] (SME) members, with the aim of strengthening SME businesses in its local supply chain. NEPIC does this by using its international linkages and partnerships to de-risk the initial development of international trade for its members. This is achieved by reciprocal knowledge and support of partner clusters and trade bodies and their members. NEPIC's approach is to develop formal Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)with industry clusters and business associations around the world and build partnerships to create knowledge sharing opportunities.\n\nIn Europe, NEPIC has projects and agreements with the following Cluster bodies: Axelera,<ref>{{cite news|first=Ruth|last=Mitchell|publisher=BDaily|title=NEPIC signs international collaboration|url=http://bdaily.co.uk/business/03-12-2007/nepic-signs-international-collaboration/|date=3 December 2007}}</ref> and through the WIINTECH consortium, Plastipolis in France, Proplast in Italy, Chemie-Cluster Bayern (CCB) in Germany, Clusterland in Austria, Plastival in Spain, Veneto Nanotech in Italy and Poolnet in Portugal.

The Ancient Beech Forests of Germany include five locations, cover 4,391 hectares and were added in 2011.\n\nThe Carpathian site covers a total area of {{convert|77971.6|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, out of which only {{convert|29278.9|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are part of the actual preserved area, while the rest is considered a \"buffer zone\". Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians cover areas of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] and [[Pre\u0161ov Region]]s. Over 70% of the site is located in [[Ukraine]]. The area includes two [[national park]]s, and some habitat controlled areas, mostly in Slovakia. Both national parks, along with a neighboring area in Poland, compose a separate [[biosphere reserve]], the [[East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve]]. Besides Have\u0161ov\u00e1, Ro\u017eok, and [[Stu\u017eica]] (all of them located in Bukovsk\u00e9 vrchy), there is a fourth component situated in Slovakia, named Kyjovsk\u00fd prales of Vihorlat. Ukrainian locations include [[Chornohora]], Kuziy-Trybushany, Maramarosh, Stuzhytsia\u2013Uzhok, Svydovets, and Uholka\u2013Shyrikyi Luh. Only a few of the ten components are accessible to visitors. Stu\u017eica is the only one of three locations in Bukovsk\u00e9 vrchy (Slovakia) with available hiking trails. In 2017, UNESCO extended the site, adding forests in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1133 |title=Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref>{{web cite | title = Unesco approves the extension of the Carpathian Primary Beech forests | url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1686}}</ref>\n\nThe last intact virgin forest in the temperate latitudes of Europe is to be found in the Carpathians. Trees can live to a hundred years old in these forests, providing an important habitat for organisms such as mushrooms, moss, lichen, insects, rare birds (e.g. [[capercaillie]] and [[black grouse]]) and [[mammals]] (e.g. bats, brown bear, wolf and lynx). Large parts of the forest in the Romanian part of the Carpathians have been lost due to deforestation. The pressure on timber as a resource may increase due to international demand and European companies may start large-scale felling in neighbouring Ukraine. Currently unprotected areas of virgin forest can be permanently preserved in the Ukrainian Carpathians by expanding and reinforcing conservation areas. In the Ukrainian Carpathians there are nine national parks and two biosphere reserves. There is a general ban on tree felling in coniferous forest areas above 1,100 metres. If park administrations are shown to work, management of larger, previously unprotected areas of virgin forest to preserve them on a permanent basis, may occur. There are roughly 100,000 additional hectares of forest which could be integrated into the existing conservation areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fzs.org/en/projects/ukraine/ |title=Protecting virgin forest in the Ukrainian Carpathians}}</ref>\n\nThese forest are mainly located in the Europe's [[tropical rainforest climate]] regions. Some of them are located in a [[subtropical highland climate]] or in another wise called called [[Oceanic climate|monsoon-influenced temperate oceanic climate]]. This gives these forest a high number of plant and animal species.\n\n== Forests ==\n{{anchor|Map}}\n{{Location map+ |Europe |width=600 |float=none |color=  green pog.svg|caption=Location of the Primary Beech World Heritage Sites in Europe. |places=\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.453340 |long=19.958962 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.204946 |long=20.477899 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.828102 |long=15.258325 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.834114 |long=14.357073 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=50.782723 |long=4.428832 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.718744 |long=24.688074 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=53.343552 |long=13.202150 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=54.548303 |long=13.647945 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=53.006820 |long=13.826587 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=51.083822 |long=10.464536 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=51.140473 |long=8.970342 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.764979 |long=14.986494 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.334086 |long=15.492712 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.954684 |long=21.867079 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.664582 |long=25.169769 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.443348 |long=25.627361 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.331614 |long=24.325320 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.941785 |long=22.468515 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.549650 |long=24.185683 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.120726 |long=22.065646 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.625775 |long=24.072916 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.572434 |long=14.468223 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.542089 |long=14.769084 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.471802 |long=24.299369 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.960574 |long=23.651330 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.174236 |long=26.251514 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.521155 |long=23.713665 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.413499 |long=23.132140 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.306294 |long=23.701568 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.189124 |long=24.226794 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.006420 |long=22.604355 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.137460 |long=24.396995 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.939138 |long=24.140416 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.936659 |long=24.326196 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.832230 |long=13.728482 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.846737 |long=13.705104 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.860286 |long=13.846763 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.786797 |long=13.743790 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.754162 |long=13.885963 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=39.906195 |long=16.100918 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.807476 |long=15.977574 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.408223 |long=12.201200 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.171800 |long=12.155975 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.844359 |long=11.802980 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.221694 |long=-3.370433 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.172500 |long=-4.987778 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.171111 |long=-4.889167 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.112222 |long=-3.499444 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.006389 |long=-1.112778 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.910833 |long=-0.816111 |label=|position=bottom}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Ancient Beech Forests of Germany include five locations, cover 4,391 hectares and were added in 2011.\n\nThe Carpathian site covers a total area of {{convert|77971.6|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, out of which only {{convert|29278.9|ha|acre|abbr=on}} are part of the actual preserved area, while the rest is considered a \"buffer zone\". Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians cover areas of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]] and [[Pre\u0161ov Region]]s. Over 70% of the site is located in [[Ukraine]]. The area includes two [[national park]]s, and some habitat controlled areas, mostly in Slovakia. Both national parks, along with a neighboring area in Poland, compose a separate [[biosphere reserve]], the [[East Carpathian Biosphere Reserve]]. Besides Have\u0161ov\u00e1, Ro\u017eok, and [[Stu\u017eica]] (all of them located in Bukovsk\u00e9 vrchy), there is a fourth component situated in Slovakia, named Kyjovsk\u00fd prales of Vihorlat. Ukrainian locations include [[Chornohora]], Kuziy-Trybushany, Maramarosh, Stuzhytsia\u2013Uzhok, Svydovets, and Uholka\u2013Shyrikyi Luh. Only a few of the ten components are accessible to visitors. Stu\u017eica is the only one of three locations in Bukovsk\u00e9 vrchy (Slovakia) with available hiking trails. In 2017, UNESCO extended the site, adding forests in Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, and Spain.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1133 |title=Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |publisher=UNESCO}}</ref><ref>{{web cite | title = Unesco approves the extension of the Carpathian Primary Beech forests | url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1686}}</ref>\n\nThe last intact virgin forest in the temperate latitudes of Europe is to be found in the Carpathians. Trees can live to a hundred years old in these forests, providing an important habitat for organisms such as mushrooms, moss, lichen, insects, rare birds (e.g. [[capercaillie]] and [[black grouse]]) and [[mammals]] (e.g. bats, brown bear, wolf and lynx). Large parts of the forest in the Romanian part of the Carpathians have been lost due to deforestation. The pressure on timber as a resource may increase due to international demand and European companies may start large-scale felling in neighbouring Ukraine. Currently unprotected areas of virgin forest can be permanently preserved in the Ukrainian Carpathians by expanding and reinforcing conservation areas. In the Ukrainian Carpathians there are nine national parks and two biosphere reserves. There is a general ban on tree felling in coniferous forest areas above 1,100 metres. If park administrations are shown to work, management of larger, previously unprotected areas of virgin forest to preserve them on a permanent basis, may occur. There are roughly 100,000 additional hectares of forest which could be integrated into the existing conservation areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fzs.org/en/projects/ukraine/ |title=Protecting virgin forest in the Ukrainian Carpathians}}</ref>\n\n== Forests ==\n{{anchor|Map}}\n{{Location map+ |Europe |width=600 |float=none |color=  green pog.svg|caption=Location of the Primary Beech World Heritage Sites in Europe. |places=\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.453340 |long=19.958962 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.204946 |long=20.477899 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.828102 |long=15.258325 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.834114 |long=14.357073 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=50.782723 |long=4.428832 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.718744 |long=24.688074 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=53.343552 |long=13.202150 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=54.548303 |long=13.647945 |label=|position=top}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=53.006820 |long=13.826587 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=51.083822 |long=10.464536 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=51.140473 |long=8.970342 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.764979 |long=14.986494 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.334086 |long=15.492712 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.954684 |long=21.867079 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.664582 |long=25.169769 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.443348 |long=25.627361 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.331614 |long=24.325320 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=44.941785 |long=22.468515 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.549650 |long=24.185683 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.120726 |long=22.065646 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.625775 |long=24.072916 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.572434 |long=14.468223 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=45.542089 |long=14.769084 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.471802 |long=24.299369 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.960574 |long=23.651330 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.174236 |long=26.251514 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.521155 |long=23.713665 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.413499 |long=23.132140 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.306294 |long=23.701568 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.189124 |long=24.226794 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=49.006420 |long=22.604355 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=48.137460 |long=24.396995 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.939138 |long=24.140416 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=47.936659 |long=24.326196 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.832230 |long=13.728482 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.846737 |long=13.705104 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.860286 |long=13.846763 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.786797 |long=13.743790 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.754162 |long=13.885963 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=39.906195 |long=16.100918 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.807476 |long=15.977574 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.408223 |long=12.201200 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.171800 |long=12.155975 |label=|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.844359 |long=11.802980 |label=|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.221694 |long=-3.370433 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.172500 |long=-4.987778 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.171111 |long=-4.889167 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=41.112222 |long=-3.499444 |label=|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=43.006389 |long=-1.112778 |label=}}\n{{location map~ |Europe |lat=42.910833 |long=-0.816111 |label=|position=bottom}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

At the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]] the population was 470, with a 2018 estimate of 469 inhabitants. Galena was established in 1918, and a military airfield was built adjacent to the city during [[World War II]]. The city was incorporated in 1971.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early history===\nThe Koyukon [[Athabascan]]s had seasonal camps in the area and moved as the wild game migrated. In the summer many families floated on rafts to the [[Yukon River]] to fish for salmon. There were 12 summer fish camps located on the Yukon River between the [[Koyukuk River]] and the [[Nowitna River]]. Galena was established in 1918 near an Athabascan fish camp called Henry's Point. It became a supply and point for nearby [[Galena|lead ore]] mines that opened in 1918 and 1919, and from which the place takes its name.<ref name=\"dec\">[http://www.dec.state.ak.us/SPAR/CSP/sites/galena.htm state.ak.us]</ref>\n\n===Military air base===\nIn 1941 and 1942, during World War II,<ref name=\"dec\" /> a military air field was built adjacent to the civilian airport, and the two facilities shared the runway and flight line facilities. This air field was designated Galena Air Force Station shortly after the split of the [[United States Air Force]] from the [[United States Army]], which occurred as a result of the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. During the 1950s, the construction of additional military facilities at Galena and the nearby [[Campion Air Force Station]], in support of Galena's mission as a [[forward operating base]] under the auspices of the 5072nd Air Base Group, headquartered at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]], near [[Anchorage]], provided improvements to the airport and the local infrastructure, causing economic growth for the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Cold War]], in 1993, operation of Galena Air Force Station was turned over to a contractor, and all military personnel were withdrawn with only small groups of active personnel visiting the base on an as-needed basis.<ref name=\"dec\" /> The former military facility remains in use effectively as a [http://www.ciponline.org/facts/fol.htm forward operating location] that is used{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}<!-- is it still used, in 2013?  no source indicates that it is. --> occasionally by the military. This use came under scrutiny by the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Committee in the late 2000s<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/org/news/2005/050702-brac-galena.htm]</ref> and was officially closed October 1, 2010. The Air Force retains responsibility for toxin cleanup in the area and engineers from [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in Fairbanks still visit the site on occasion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The base is now totally controlled by the City of Galena, the Galena School District and the Alaska Department of Transportation. The Alaska Wing of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] (CAP) was pursuing{{when|date=October 2013}} retaining one of the F-16 fighter hangars as a CAP facility for the CAP Wing in Galena, the \"Yukon Squadron\".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Modern era===\nThe City of Galena gained notoriety in 2011 when it was noted in media reports as being the US community which received the most benefits from lobbying efforts. The town evaded bankruptcy by aggressively lobbying for state and federal funds for the GILA boarding school in the town, which produced funds that turned the city's finances around.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn May 2013, Galena suffered a  freak catastrophic flood when the spring breakup on the Yukon River caused an ice jam approximately 20 miles downstream, backing up the river and affecting 90% of homes in the city.  This flood was on the scale of a flood never seen before by Galena residents.  In the part of town closest to the river, houses were submerged to the roofs in water, and properties on higher ground suffered damage also.

Along with other such cities across Alaska, Galena's school district operates a [[boarding school]] and a correspondence study program, to increase state funding which would not otherwise be available with the local pupil base.\n\nGalena has three schools. Galena City School is primarily for local K\u201312 students.  There is a public library located in the Sidney C. Huntington School.  Huntington (1915&ndash;2015)<ref>[https://www.adn.com/article/20151208/sidney-huntington-athabascan-elder-and-author-dies-100 Sidney Huntington dies at 100]</ref> was a longtime resident of Galena and the author of ''Shadows on the Koyukuk'', a popular book on Alaska.\n\nThe vocational Galena Interior Learning Academy (GILA) is a boarding school which draws students from around the state.  GILA is located on the site of the former [[Galena Air Force Station]] and is one of three public boarding high schools in Alaska; the second in size behind [[Mount Edgecumbe High School]] in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. The third is the Nenana Living School in Nenana. GILA uses the former barracks as a dorm, the former PX and headquarters buildings as class rooms and the dining hall as a cafeteria, along with the gym and other facilities. GILA provides educational and vocational training to young men and women from all over Alaska, grades 9-12, with most students coming from remote Native Alaskan villages from the Interior, North Slope and Aleutian Islands. GILA hosts various training and regional conferences throughout the year. GILA student enrollment grew from 110 to 180 in the 2009-10 school year.\n\nGalena's third school is [http://www.ideafamilies.org Interior Distance Education of Alaska], a statewide [[homeschool]] support program that serves 3,500 students across the state.

Eye and dental services are provided to Alaskan natives on a visiting provider basis. Medical emergencies are stabilized at Nollner Clinic and flown by air ambulance to Fairbanks or Anchorage.  Dire pediatric emergencies are flown to Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nPublic radio station [[KIYU (AM)|KIYU]], based in Galena, serves the city, along with the five surrounding villages of [[Kaltag]], [[Nulato]], [[Ruby, AK|Ruby]], [[Koyukuk, Alaska|Koyukuk]], and [[Huslia]].\n\n===Energy===\n{{further|Galena Nuclear Power Plant}}\nGalena's remote location, apart from Alaska's urban transportation and utility distribution networks, means that the city must transport and store fuel oil in large-volume quantities. In 2004, the Galena City Council tentatively accepted a proposal from [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] to build the Galena Nuclear Power Plant, a small, self-contained [[nuclear power plant]].  In 2010, the plan was abandoned after local start-up costs to build a $27 million reactor core proved prohibitive for the community.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0330/Nuclear-power-Obama-team-touts-mini-nukes-to-fight-global-warming</ref> The demonstration plant, the prototype for a line which Toshiba hoped to sell to similar communities in the U.S. and Canada, would have been the first civilian nuclear plant in Alaska; [[Fort Greely, Alaska]],{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nhad a small military SM-4 reactor until the early 1970s.<ref>Buske, Norman, Pamela Miller & Lorraine Eckstein, \"The Nuclear Reactor at Fort Greely.\" (Anchorage: Alaska Community Action on Toxins, 2000)</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nThe [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] goes through Galena (on even years), as does the [[Tesoro Iron Dog]] trans-Alaska snowmobile race.  Galena is the halfway point of the Yukon 800, an annual summer speedboat race beginning in Fairbanks and taking place along the [[Tanana River|Tanana]] and [[Yukon River]]s.\n\nThe Galena high school boys' and girls' basketball teams were regional champions from 2004 to 2007. The boys' basketball team won the state championship in 2008.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Frostbite (G.I. Joe)|Frostbite]], a character from the [[G.I.

At the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]] the population was 470, with a 2018 estimate of 469 inhabitants. Galena was established in 1918, and a military airfield was built adjacent to the city during [[World War II]]. The city was incorporated in 1971.\n\n==History==\n\n===Prehistory and early history===\nThe Koyukon [[Athabascan]]s had seasonal camps in the area and moved as the wild game migrated. In the summer many families floated on rafts to the [[Yukon River]] to fish for salmon. There were 12 summer fish camps located on the Yukon River between the [[Koyukuk River]] and the [[Nowitna River]]. Galena was established in 1918 near an Athabascan fish camp called Henry's Point. It became a supply and point for nearby [[Galena|lead ore]] mines that opened in 1918 and 1919, and from which the place takes its name.<ref name=\"dec\">[http://www.dec.state.ak.us/SPAR/CSP/sites/galena.htm state.ak.us]</ref>\n\n===Military air base===\nIn 1941 and 1942, during World War II,<ref name=\"dec\" /> a military air field was built adjacent to the civilian airport, and the two facilities shared the runway and flight line facilities. This air field was designated Galena Air Force Station shortly after the split of the [[United States Air Force]] from the [[United States Army]], which occurred as a result of the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. During the 1950s, the construction of additional military facilities at Galena and the nearby [[Campion Air Force Station]], in support of Galena's mission as a [[forward operating base]] under the auspices of the 5072nd Air Base Group, headquartered at [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]], near [[Anchorage]], provided improvements to the airport and the local infrastructure, causing economic growth for the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nFollowing the end of the [[Cold War]], in 1993, operation of Galena Air Force Station was turned over to a contractor, and all military personnel were withdrawn with only small groups of active personnel visiting the base on an as-needed basis.<ref name=\"dec\" /> The former military facility remains in use effectively as a [http://www.ciponline.org/facts/fol.htm forward operating location] that is used{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}<!-- is it still used, in 2013?  no source indicates that it is. --> occasionally by the military.

The Air Force retains responsibility for toxin cleanup in the area and engineers from [[Eielson Air Force Base]] in Fairbanks still visit the site on occasion.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The base is now totally controlled by the City of Galena, the Galena School District and the Alaska Department of Transportation. The Alaska Wing of the [[Civil Air Patrol]] (CAP) was pursuing{{when|date=October 2013}} retaining one of the F-16 fighter hangars as a CAP facility for the CAP Wing in Galena, the \"Yukon Squadron\".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Modern era===\nThe City of Galena gained notoriety in 2011 when it was noted in media reports as being the US community which received the most benefits from lobbying efforts. The town evaded bankruptcy by aggressively lobbying for state and federal funds for the GILA boarding school in the town, which produced funds that turned the city's finances around.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nIn May 2013, Galena suffered a  freak catastrophic flood when the spring breakup on the Yukon River caused an ice jam approximately 20 miles downstream, backing up the river and affecting 90% of homes in the city.  This flood was on the scale of a flood never seen before by Galena residents.  In the part of town closest to the river, houses were submerged to the roofs in water, and properties on higher ground suffered damage also.

Along with other such cities across Alaska, Galena's school district operates a [[boarding school]] and a correspondence study program, to increase state funding which would not otherwise be available with the local pupil base.\n\nGalena has three schools. Galena City School is primarily for local K\u201312 students.  There is a public library located in the Sidney C. Huntington School.  Huntington (1915&ndash;2015)<ref>[https://www.adn.com/article/20151208/sidney-huntington-athabascan-elder-and-author-dies-100 Sidney Huntington dies at 100]</ref> was a longtime resident of Galena and the author of ''Shadows on the Koyukuk'', a popular book on Alaska.\n\nThe vocational Galena Interior Learning Academy (GILA) is a boarding school which draws students from around the state.  GILA is located on the site of the former [[Galena Air Force Station]] and is one of three public boarding high schools in Alaska; the second in size behind [[Mount Edgecumbe High School]] in [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]]. The third is the Nenana Living School in Nenana. GILA uses the former barracks as a dorm, the former PX and headquarters buildings as class rooms and the dining hall as a cafeteria, along with the gym and other facilities. GILA provides educational and vocational training to young men and women from all over Alaska, grades 9-12, with most students coming from remote Native Alaskan villages from the Interior, North Slope and Aleutian Islands. GILA hosts various training and regional conferences throughout the year. GILA student enrollment grew from 110 to 180 in the 2009-10 school year.\n\nGalena's third school is [http://www.ideafamilies.org Interior Distance Education of Alaska], a statewide [[homeschool]] support program that serves 3,500 students across the state. As correspondence programs are tabulated by the [[Alaska Department of Education & Early Development]] as a single school, IDEA is considered the largest school by enrollment in all of Alaska.\n\n==Transportation, utilities and other facilities==\nGalena's [[Edward G. Pitka Sr. Airport]] (Code GAL) is the former Galena Air Force Station field and with a paved runway of over 8000 feet is the largest public, state-maintained airport in the Interior of Alaska.{{Clarify|date=September 2012|reason=\"The Interior of Alaska\" covers a lot of ground, no pun intended.

The Airport is also the home of the \"Yukon Squadron\" of the AK Wing, Civil Air Patrol (CAP), which covers much of lp the interior region to the Bering Sea for Search and Rescue (SAR).

Eye and dental services are provided to Alaskan natives on a visiting provider basis. Medical emergencies are stabilized at Nollner Clinic and flown by air ambulance to Fairbanks or Anchorage.  Dire pediatric emergencies are flown to Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nPublic radio station [[KIYU (AM)|KIYU]], based in Galena, serves the city, along with the five surrounding villages of [[Kaltag]], [[Nulato]], [[Ruby, AK|Ruby]], [[Koyukuk, Alaska|Koyukuk]], and [[Huslia]].\n\n===Energy===\n{{further|Galena Nuclear Power Plant}}\nGalena's remote location, apart from Alaska's urban transportation and utility distribution networks, means that the city must transport and store fuel oil in large-volume quantities. In 2004, the Galena City Council tentatively accepted a proposal from [[Toshiba|Toshiba Corporation]] to build the Galena Nuclear Power Plant, a small, self-contained [[nuclear power plant]].  In 2010, the plan was abandoned after local start-up costs to build a $27 million reactor core proved prohibitive for the community.<ref>http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0330/Nuclear-power-Obama-team-touts-mini-nukes-to-fight-global-warming</ref> The demonstration plant, the prototype for a line which Toshiba hoped to sell to similar communities in the U.S. and Canada, would have been the first civilian nuclear plant in Alaska; [[Fort Greely, Alaska]],{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nhad a small military SM-4 reactor until the early 1970s.<ref>Buske, Norman, Pamela Miller & Lorraine Eckstein, \"The Nuclear Reactor at Fort Greely.\" (Anchorage: Alaska Community Action on Toxins, 2000)</ref>\n\n==Sports==\nThe [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]] goes through Galena (on even years), as does the [[Tesoro Iron Dog]] trans-Alaska snowmobile race.  Galena is the halfway point of the Yukon 800, an annual summer speedboat race beginning in Fairbanks and taking place along the [[Tanana River|Tanana]] and [[Yukon River]]s.\n\nThe Galena high school boys' and girls' basketball teams were regional champions from 2004 to 2007. The boys' basketball team won the state championship in 2008.\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Frostbite (G.I. Joe)|Frostbite]], a character from the [[G.I.

It is the first color television broadcast in the [[Mainland Southeast Asia]]. It was owned by the [[Royal Thai Army]] on Analog transmission. Its headquarters are located in [[Bangkok|Mo Chit]], [[Chatuchak District|Chatuchak]], [[Bangkok]]. Similar to a British [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]], America [[NBC]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[CBS]].\n\n==History==\n\nThe channel was launched in a ceremony on 27 November 1967 at 7:00 pm [[Thailand Standard Time|Bangkok Time]]. It was presided over by the then [[Prime Minister of Thailand]] [[Field Marshal]] [[Thanom Kittikachorn]]. The first programme to air was the 1967 [[Miss Thailand]] Pageant. Channel 7 was known back then as \"Bangkok Color Television\", airing on channel 5. On 1 January 1972, it started broadcasting nationwide.<ref>https://positioningmag.com/1152490</ref><ref>http://www.ch7.com/about_us</ref>\n\nChannel 7 launched its [[high-definition television]] feed on 25 April 2014 on its digital terrestrial television system (DTT) on channel 35. Three years later, on 19 June 2017, Channel 7 was given authorisation from the [[National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission]] to shut down its analogue frequencies in the rest of the country, in order to replace them with its digital channels on DTT. Thus, the network was expected to stop broadcasting on analogue 1 January 2018, but the process was postponed to 16 May 2018 and eventually completed on 16 June.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Television in Thailand]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official|http://www.ch7.com/|BBTV Channel 7 (Official Site)}}\n\n{{Smart Alliance}}\n{{TV in Thailand}}\n\n[[Category:Television stations in Thailand]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1967]]\n[[Category:Media in Bangkok]]\n[[Category:Military broadcasting]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox TV channel\n| name             = Channel 7 HD<br><small>Bangkok Broadcasting Television Channel 7</small>\n| logofile         = BBTV Channel 7.png\n| logosize         = 200px\n| logoalt          = [[\u0e15\u0e23\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e13\u0e4c]]\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30[[\u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e21\u0e32\u0e22\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e04\u0e49\u0e32]]\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07'''\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e42\u0e17\u0e23\u0e17\u0e31\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e31\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 7'''\n| launch           = {{Start date and age|1967|11|27|df=y}}\n| picture format   = [[1080i]] [[16:9]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]])\n| network          = Bangkok Television\n| owner            = Bangkok Broadcasting Television\n| slogan           = {{lang|th|\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 7HD \u0e17\u0e35\u0e27\u0e35\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e04\u0e38\u0e13}}<br />{{small|(Channel 7 In [[High-definition television|HD]], Telly For You)}}\n| country          = [[Thailand]]\n| language         = [[Thai language|Thai]]\n| broadcast area   = [[Thailand]]<br>[[Laos]]<br>[[Cambodia]]<br>[[Myanmar]]<br>[[Malaysia]]<br>[[Vietnam]]<br>[[Singapore]]<br>[[Indonesia]]\n| headquarters     = [[Chatuchak District |Chatuchak]], [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]\n| web              = [http://www.ch7.com/ www.ch7.com]\n| terr serv 1      = [[Digital television in Thailand|Digital terrestrial television]]\n| terr chan 1      = Channel 35 ([[High-definition television|HD]]) (TV5 MUX2)\n| sat serv 1       = [[Must-carry]]\n| sat chan 1       = Channel 35 ([[High-definition television|HD]])\n| cable serv 1     = [[TrueVisions]]\n| cable chan 1     = Channel 35 ([[High-definition television|HD]])\n| online serv 1    = [[List of television stations in Bangkok|BBTV]]'s Official ([[Thailand]])\n| online chan 1    = {{URL|http://www.ch7.com/live.html|Watch live}}\n| online serv 2    = Guchill ([[Thailand]])\n| online chan 2    = {{URL|http://tv.guchill.com/CH7-Live.html|Watch live}}\n| online serv 3    = [[True Corporation|TrueID]] ([[International]])\n| online chan 3    = {{URL|http://tv.trueid.net/live/ch7|Watch live}}\n}}\n'''Channel 7''' or '''Channel 7 HD''', fully known as '''Bangkok Broadcasting & Television Company Limited Channel 7''' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e16\u0e32\u0e19\u0e35\u0e42\u0e17\u0e23\u0e17\u0e31\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e35\u0e01\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e17\u0e31\u0e1e\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07 7}}) or '''BBTV Channel 7''', '''Bangkok Broadcasting Television Channel 7''' ({{lang-th|\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e08\u0e47\u0e14}}; {{RTGS|Chong Chet}}; literal: '''Channel 7''') is a [[Television in Thailand|Thailand national free-to-air terrestrial television station]].
