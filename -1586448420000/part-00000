Her father was [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]], the second child of King [[William I of the Netherlands]] and [[Wilhelmine of Prussia (1774\u20131837)|Wilhelmina of Prussia]]. Her mother [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1808\u20131870)|Louise]] was the eighth child of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. Her education was to large extent entrusted to her Belgian governess Victoire Wauthier, and she studied French, German, English, Russian and piano.\n\nIn 1849, Louise was selected as a suitable spouse for [[Charles XV of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles]], the son of [[Oscar I of Sweden|King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway]] and [[Josephine of Leuchtenberg]]. The marriage was arranged after the negotiations to arrange a marriage between Charles and her cousin [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1829\u20131901)|Princess Louise of Prussia]] had failed. King Oscar I of Sweden wished to secure royal family connections between the new [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte dynasty]] and the old [[royal houses|royal dynasties]] of Europe, and a [[Protestant]] princess was also seen as a necessary queen of the Protestant Sweden-Norway after two Catholic predecessors. Louise fulfilled these credentials, and a great [[dowry]] was expected from the rich [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Cabinet secretary L Manderstr\u00f6m was sent to inspect her, and diplomatically let it be known in his report that Louise had an excellent education and a good character but that she was not attractive.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lovisa, urn:sbl:9717, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Nils F Holm), h\u00e4mtad 2013-11-01.</ref> In August 1849, a meeting was arranged between Louise and Charles in the Hague. Reportedly, Louise fell in love with Charles and felt an immediate attraction, while Charles in contrast was disappointed in her appearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Charles, however, was convinced to agree to the marriage by the King.\n\nThe engagement was officially declared in February 1850. The expectations of her great fortune was debated in Sweden, both in the parliament during the discussions about the allowance, and in the radical press, who suggested that the monarch would now be able to finance the construction of the Swedish [[rail road]] net by himself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In reality, however, her dowry turned out to be very small. During the engagement, Louise studied the Swedish language and history; she never learnt Norwegian, however. Because the Dutch government had supported the marriage, she did not have to renounce her rights to the Dutch throne upon her marriage.\n\n==Crown princess==\n[[File:Karl XV och Lovisas av Nassau-Oraniens f\u00f6rm\u00e4lning 1850.

Returning home to the castle]]\n\nLouise left Germany by a Swedish boat from [[Travem\u00fcnde]] and arrived to Sweden with her parents and sister [[Princess Marie of the Netherlands|Marie]], who were present at her wedding. Princess Louise and Crown Prince Charles married at ''[[Storkyrkan]]'' in [[Stockholm]] on 19 June 1850.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/royalFamily_Sweden.php | title=The Royal Family of Sweden | first=William | last=Bortrick | publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]] | accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref>  She was given Countess [[Elisabet Piper]] as her ''hovm\u00e4starinna'' (senior lady-in-waiting) and Ottiliana Sparre and Ulrika Sprengsporten as maids-of-honor.  After the wedding, her father-in-law the King took her on a tour through Sweden to introduce her to the country.  \n\nThe relationship between Louise and Charles was unhappy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The couple had dissimilar personalities, with Louise being introverted, shy and with a preference for a simple life, and Charles [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverted]] and with a love for parties and social life. Louise was reportedly unhappily in love with Charles, who found her unattractive and was unfaithful to her, which pained her considerably. \n\nFrom 1852 until 1860, Charles had a relationship with [[Josephine Sparre]], [[maid of honor]] to Louise, which caused a scandal. Sparre was described as so dominant that the Crown Princess and her maid of honor was said to have changed places with each other and Louise being the lady-in-waiting to Josephine Sparre rather than the other way around. [[Fritz von Dardel]] described Sparre: \"The lady in question is a great favorite of the Crown Prince as well as with the Crown Princess, and she governs them both entirely in everything about their daily life. Gifted with an unusual talent to please and make herself indispensable, she has managed to capture the Crown Prince to a strange degree.\" <ref>Robert Braun (1950). Silvertronen, En bok om drottning Josefine av Sverige-Norge. (The Silver Throne. A Book about Queen Josefine of Sweden-Norway) Stockholm: Norlin F\u00f6rlag AB. ISBN (Swedish) page 99</ref>\n\nLouise was given sympathy and Charles was considered to be treating her with neglect. A known episode which attracted attention took place at the birthday garden party of Louise at [[Drottningholm Palace]] in 1857, when the Crown Prince proposed a toast to his \"secret love\" with both Louise and Josephine Sparre present. This caused a scene, and his brother, Prince Oscar, reprimanded him indirectly by asking his own spouse, [[Sofia of Nassau]], to toast with him. This scene caused Louise to burst into tears and suffer a nervous attack.<ref>Anne-Marie Riiber (1959). Drottning Sophia. (Queen Sophia) Uppsala: J. A. Lindblads F\u00f6rlag. ISBN. page 39 (Swedish)</ref> \n\nLouise bore two children; [[Louise of Sweden|Princess Louise]] in 1851, and [[Prince Carl Oscar, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Prince Carl Oscar]] in 1852. Due to [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] that arose at the birth of Prince Carl Oscar, Louise was unable to have any more children. In 1854, her 2-year-old son, Carl Oscar, died of pneumonia. As the [[Salic law]] prevailed at that time in Sweden (having been introduced by the [[Swedish constitution of 1809|constitution of 1809]]), Louise's daughter was not eligible to ascend the throne. Charles was very chagrined and disappointed because this meant that his progeny would not be the next monarch of Sweden; his heir would be his brother [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar]]. Louise offered Charles a divorce so he could remarry and produce a male heir, but he declined the offer.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCrown Princess Louise was not considered a social success, and her timid and shy nature was not appreciated in society because of her official position. Between 1857 and 1859, Crown Prince Charles was named regent during the incapacity of his father, and she took over the representational duties of first lady from her mother-in-law. During her spouse's reign as prince regent, she was described in the well-known court chronicle of [[Fritz von Dardel]]: \n:\"A more lovable and talented woman would have entirely recreated the atmosphere in this circle and also exerted a good influence upon the Prince, who, of a good nature, easily let himself be led by those he likes, especially women. Although good, dutiful and not one to plot, the crown princess lacks higher qualities. She is a good housewife but thinks only of her husband, herself and those closest to her and she has not the good influence on him which her good character gives her the right to have. Because of her inborn shyness, she lacks the courage to meddle in his affairs, and her only wish is to gain his love. With one word; she seems not mature enough for her great task\".<ref>Dardel, Fritz von, Minnen, Stockholm 1912</ref>\n\n==Queen==\n\n[[File:Greater coat of arms of Queen Louise of Sweden.svg|upright|thumb|150px|Louise's coat of arms as queen of Sweden and Norway]]\n[[File:Johan Christoffer Boklund-Lovisa.jpg|left|thumb|Louise of the Netherlands]]\nLouise became Queen of Sweden and Norway at the death of her father-in-law on 8 July 1859. She was the first queen of the union of Sweden-Norway to be crowned in both Sweden and Norway, as Norway had refused to crown her two predecessors because they were Catholics. Louise was crowned Queen of Sweden in Stockholm on 3 May 1859 and Queen of Norway in [[Trondheim]] on 5 August 1860. She was the first queen to be crowned in Norway since the Middle Ages. Louise was very celebrated in Norway during her stay there.  \n \nLouise exerted no influence upon state affairs whatsoever, nor did she show any ambition to do so. The fact that she did not meddle in politics was seen as a good role model and was favorably compared to previous queens who had, such as her predecessor, Queen Josephine, and this view is described in a contemporary encyclopedia from 1864: \"At last, the two kingdoms can rejoice in the blessing of again having a Queen, who does not proceed the governmental power with her own thoughts, but calmly observes the natural process through King and legitimate authority. Loved by the Swedish people, she has enough opportunity for her noble wish to occupy herself in charity\".<ref>Wilhelmina St\u00e5lberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864)</ref> She did not lack political views, however: she disliked the parliamentary reform of 1865, and she did not share the anti-German view of Charles.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLouise preferred to use her royal position for philanthropy, which was also expected of a female member of the royalty and upper class. She founded the charity organisations: \"Kronprinsessan Lovisas v\u00e5rdanstalt f\u00f6r sjuka barn\" (The Crown Princess Louise's Asylum for Sick Children) in 1854; \"Fem\u00f6ref\u00f6reningen till inr\u00e4ttande av barnhem i Lappland\" (The Five \u00d6re Foundation for Orphanages in Lappland) in 1864; \n\"Lotten Wennbergs fond f\u00f6r hj\u00e4lpbeh\u00f6vande\" (The [[Lotten Wennberg]] Foundation for the Needing) in 1864; \"Drottning Lovisas underst\u00f6dsf\u00f6rening\" \n(The Queen Louise Charity Foundation) in 1866; \"Allm\u00e4nna institutet f\u00f6r d\u00f6vstumma och blinda\" (The Public Institution of the Deaf and Blind); \n\"S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r inr\u00e4ttande av sm\u00e5barnsskolor\" (The Society for Elementary Education School's Foundation); \"Den fosterl\u00e4ndska f\u00f6reningen till uppmuntran av sj\u00e4lverksamhet f\u00f6r framtida oberoende\" (The Patriotic Society for the Encouragement of Self Employments for Future Independence); and the \"Tysta skolan, eller uppfostrings- och undervisningsanstalten f\u00f6r d\u00f6vstumma barn\" (Silent School, or The Nursing- and Education Institution for Deaf and Mute Children) by [[Johanna Berglind]].<ref>Nordisk familjebok / 1800-talsutg\u00e5van. 10.

On at least one occasion, during a boat trip on [[M\u00e4laren]], she suffered some kind of a fit (possibly an epileptic seizure from contemporary descriptions), which was interpreted to have been a hysterical reaction to her husband's neglect. The court gathered to conceal her from public view, and the King quickly took her below deck. In this issue, it is reported that: \"Lovisa could at any time faint and in connection to this, she could have what is called nerve- or cramp-attacks\". In 1864, during a visit to court by a former lover of Charles, Josephine Sparre, Fritz von Dardel noted: \"Initially the Queen is said to have felt worried for this visit; one evening, Her Majesty was about to have convulsions in the billiard hall, but this they attempted to conceal by claiming that it was caused by her chamberlain Liljenkrantz, who was supposed to have pushed her accidentally with his billiard pole...\" <ref>Robert Braun (1950).

Her father was [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]], the second child of King [[William I of the Netherlands]] and [[Wilhelmine of Prussia (1774\u20131837)|Wilhelmina of Prussia]]. Her mother [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1808\u20131870)|Louise]] was the eighth child of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]]. Her education was to large extent entrusted to her Belgian governess Victoire Wauthier, and she studied French, German, English, Russian and piano.\n\nIn 1849, Louise was selected as a suitable spouse for [[Charles XV of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles]], the son of [[Oscar I of Sweden|King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway]] and [[Josephine of Leuchtenberg]]. The marriage was arranged after the negotiations to arrange a marriage between Charles and her cousin [[Princess Louise of Prussia (1829\u20131901)|Princess Louise of Prussia]] had failed. King Oscar I of Sweden wished to secure royal family connections between the new [[House of Bernadotte|Bernadotte dynasty]] and the old [[royal houses|royal dynasties]] of Europe, and a [[Protestant]] princess was also seen as a necessary queen of the Protestant Sweden-Norway after two Catholic predecessors. Louise fulfilled these credentials, and a great [[dowry]] was expected from the rich [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. Cabinet secretary L Manderstr\u00f6m was sent to inspect her, and diplomatically let it be known in his report that Louise had an excellent education and a good character but that she was not attractive.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Lovisa, urn:sbl:9717, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Nils F Holm), h\u00e4mtad 2013-11-01.</ref> In August 1849, a meeting was arranged between Louise and Charles in the Hague. Reportedly, Louise fell in love with Charles and felt an immediate attraction, while Charles in contrast was disappointed in her appearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Charles, however, was convinced to agree to the marriage by the King.\n\nThe engagement was officially declared in February 1850. The expectations of her great fortune was debated in Sweden, both in the parliament during the discussions about the allowance, and in the radical press, who suggested that the monarch would now be able to finance the construction of the Swedish [[rail road]] net by himself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In reality, however, her dowry turned out to be very small. During the engagement, Louise studied the Swedish language and history; she never learnt Norwegian, however. Because the Dutch government had supported the marriage, she did not have to renounce her rights to the Dutch throne upon her marriage.\n\n==Crown princess==\n[[File:Karl XV och Lovisas av Nassau-Oraniens f\u00f6rm\u00e4lning 1850.

Returning home to the castle]]\n\nLouise left Germany by a Swedish boat from [[Travem\u00fcnde]] and arrived to Sweden with her parents and sister [[Princess Marie of the Netherlands|Marie]], who were present at her wedding. Princess Louise and Crown Prince Charles married at ''[[Storkyrkan]]'' in [[Stockholm]] on 19 June 1850.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.burkespeerage.com/royalFamily_Sweden.php | title=The Royal Family of Sweden | first=William | last=Bortrick | publisher=[[Burke's Peerage]] | accessdate=18 June 2016}}</ref>  She was given Countess [[Elisabet Piper]] as her senior lady-in-waiting and Ottiliana Sparre and Ulrika Sprengsporten as maids-of-honor.  After the wedding, her father-in-law the King took her on a tour through Sweden to introduce her to the country.  \n\nThe relationship between Louise and Charles was unhappy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The couple had dissimilar personalities, with Louise being introverted, shy and with a preference for a simple life, and Charles [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverted]] and with a love for parties and social life. Louise was reportedly unhappily in love with Charles, who found her unattractive and was unfaithful to her, which pained her considerably. \n\nFrom 1852 until 1860, Charles had a relationship with [[Josephine Sparre]], [[maid of honor]] to Louise, which caused a scandal. Sparre was described as so dominant that the Crown Princess and her maid of honor was said to have changed places with each other and Louise being the lady-in-waiting to Josephine Sparre rather than the other way around. [[Fritz von Dardel]] described Sparre: \"The lady in question is a great favorite of the Crown Prince as well as with the Crown Princess, and she governs them both entirely in everything about their daily life. Gifted with an unusual talent to please and make herself indispensable, she has managed to capture the Crown Prince to a strange degree.\" <ref>Robert Braun (1950). Silvertronen, En bok om drottning Josefine av Sverige-Norge. (The Silver Throne. A Book about Queen Josefine of Sweden-Norway) Stockholm: Norlin F\u00f6rlag AB. ISBN (Swedish) page 99</ref>\n\nLouise was given sympathy and Charles was considered to be treating her with neglect. A known episode which attracted attention took place at the birthday garden party of Louise at [[Drottningholm Palace]] in 1857, when the Crown Prince proposed a toast to his \"secret love\" with both Louise and Josephine Sparre present. This caused a scene, and his brother, Prince Oscar, reprimanded him indirectly by asking his own spouse, [[Sofia of Nassau]], to toast with him. This scene caused Louise to burst into tears and suffer a nervous attack.<ref>Anne-Marie Riiber (1959). Drottning Sophia. (Queen Sophia) Uppsala: J. A. Lindblads F\u00f6rlag. ISBN. page 39 (Swedish)</ref> \n\nLouise bore two children; [[Louise of Sweden|Princess Louise]] in 1851, and [[Prince Carl Oscar, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Prince Carl Oscar]] in 1852. Due to [[Complications of pregnancy|complications]] that arose at the birth of Prince Carl Oscar, Louise was unable to have any more children. In 1854, her 2-year-old son, Carl Oscar, died of pneumonia. As the [[Salic law]] prevailed at that time in Sweden (having been introduced by the [[Swedish constitution of 1809|constitution of 1809]]), Louise's daughter was not eligible to ascend the throne. Charles was very chagrined and disappointed because this meant that his progeny would not be the next monarch of Sweden; his heir would be his brother [[Oscar II of Sweden|Oscar]]. Louise offered Charles a divorce so he could remarry and produce a male heir, but he declined the offer.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCrown Princess Louise was not considered a social success, and her timid and shy nature was not appreciated in society because of her official position. Between 1857 and 1859, Crown Prince Charles was named regent during the incapacity of his father, and she took over the representational duties of first lady from her mother-in-law. During her spouse's reign as prince regent, she was described in the well-known court chronicle of [[Fritz von Dardel]]: \n:\"A more lovable and talented woman would have entirely recreated the atmosphere in this circle and also exerted a good influence upon the Prince, who, of a good nature, easily let himself be led by those he likes, especially women. Although good, dutiful and not one to plot, the crown princess lacks higher qualities. She is a good housewife but thinks only of her husband, herself and those closest to her and she has not the good influence on him which her good character gives her the right to have. Because of her inborn shyness, she lacks the courage to meddle in his affairs, and her only wish is to gain his love. With one word; she seems not mature enough for her great task\".<ref>Dardel, Fritz von, Minnen, Stockholm 1912</ref>\n\n==Queen==\n\n[[File:Greater coat of arms of Queen Louise of Sweden.svg|upright|thumb|150px|Louise's coat of arms as queen of Sweden and Norway]]\n[[File:Johan Christoffer Boklund-Lovisa.jpg|left|thumb|Louise of the Netherlands]]\nLouise became Queen of Sweden and Norway at the death of her father-in-law on 8 July 1859. She was the first queen of the union of Sweden-Norway to be crowned in both Sweden and Norway, as Norway had refused to crown her two predecessors because they were Catholics. Louise was crowned Queen of Sweden in Stockholm on 3 May 1859 and Queen of Norway in [[Trondheim]] on 5 August 1860. She was the first queen to be crowned in Norway since the Middle Ages. Louise was very celebrated in Norway during her stay there.  \n \nLouise exerted no influence upon state affairs whatsoever, nor did she show any ambition to do so. The fact that she did not meddle in politics was seen as a good role model and was favorably compared to previous queens who had, such as her predecessor, Queen Josephine, and this view is described in a contemporary encyclopedia from 1864: \"At last, the two kingdoms can rejoice in the blessing of again having a Queen, who does not proceed the governmental power with her own thoughts, but calmly observes the natural process through King and legitimate authority. Loved by the Swedish people, she has enough opportunity for her noble wish to occupy herself in charity\".<ref>Wilhelmina St\u00e5lberg: Anteckningar om svenska qvinnor (1864)</ref> She did not lack political views, however: she disliked the parliamentary reform of 1865, and she did not share the anti-German view of Charles.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nLouise preferred to use her royal position for philanthropy, which was also expected of a female member of the royalty and upper class. She founded the charity organisations: \"Kronprinsessan Lovisas v\u00e5rdanstalt f\u00f6r sjuka barn\" (The Crown Princess Louise's Asylum for Sick Children) in 1854; \"Fem\u00f6ref\u00f6reningen till inr\u00e4ttande av barnhem i Lappland\" (The Five \u00d6re Foundation for Orphanages in Lappland) in 1864; \n\"Lotten Wennbergs fond f\u00f6r hj\u00e4lpbeh\u00f6vande\" (The [[Lotten Wennberg]] Foundation for the Needing) in 1864; \"Drottning Lovisas underst\u00f6dsf\u00f6rening\" \n(The Queen Louise Charity Foundation) in 1866; \"Allm\u00e4nna institutet f\u00f6r d\u00f6vstumma och blinda\" (The Public Institution of the Deaf and Blind); \n\"S\u00e4llskapet f\u00f6r inr\u00e4ttande av sm\u00e5barnsskolor\" (The Society for Elementary Education School's Foundation); \"Den fosterl\u00e4ndska f\u00f6reningen till uppmuntran av sj\u00e4lverksamhet f\u00f6r framtida oberoende\" (The Patriotic Society for the Encouragement of Self Employments for Future Independence); and the \"Tysta skolan, eller uppfostrings- och undervisningsanstalten f\u00f6r d\u00f6vstumma barn\" (Silent School, or The Nursing- and Education Institution for Deaf and Mute Children) by [[Johanna Berglind]].<ref>Nordisk familjebok / 1800-talsutg\u00e5van. 10.

On at least one occasion, during a boat trip on [[M\u00e4laren]], she suffered some kind of a fit (possibly an epileptic seizure from contemporary descriptions), which was interpreted to have been a hysterical reaction to her husband's neglect. The court gathered to conceal her from public view, and the King quickly took her below deck. In this issue, it is reported that: \"Lovisa could at any time faint and in connection to this, she could have what is called nerve- or cramp-attacks\". In 1864, during a visit to court by a former lover of Charles, Josephine Sparre, Fritz von Dardel noted: \"Initially the Queen is said to have felt worried for this visit; one evening, Her Majesty was about to have convulsions in the billiard hall, but this they attempted to conceal by claiming that it was caused by her chamberlain Liljenkrantz, who was supposed to have pushed her accidentally with his billiard pole...\" <ref>Robert Braun (1950).

Exhausted, she contracted pneumonia during a walk by carriage. On her death bed, she had long conversations with her family, which have been described as dramatic. Her daughter claimed: \"It was as if mother exposed her entire life to us\".<ref name=\"Anne-Marie Riiber 1959 page 78\">Anne-Marie Riiber (1959). Drottning Sophia. (Queen Sophia) Uppsala: J. A.

investment is spread along separate sub-managers investing in their own strategy.\n*Withdraw holding: a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for 90 days prior to and after the hedge fund is created and established.\n*[[130-30 funds]]: equity funds with 130% long and 30% short positions, leaving a net long position of 100%.\n*[[Risk parity]]: equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging.\n*AI driven: using [[big data]] and sophisticated [[machine learning]] models to predict prices.\n\n==Risk==\nFor an investor who

They play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt [[index fund]] products provide investable access to most [[developed market]]s in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data. None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns.<ref>A source for hedge fund track records is the [https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917052031/http://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html |date=17 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n====Non-investable indices====\nNon-investable indices are indicative in nature, and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median, or weighted mean from a hedge fund database. The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds. This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.\n\nAlthough they aim to be representative, non-investable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of [[Selection bias|biases]]. Funds' participation in a database is voluntary, leading to [[self-selection bias]] because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole. For example, some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money..\n\nThe short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year, which raises the problem of [[Attrition bias|survivorship bias]]. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.\n\nWhen a fund is added to a database for the first time, all or part of its historical data is recorded ex-post in the database. It is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable, so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated. This is known as \"instant history bias\" or \"backfill bias\".\n\nIn 2003, EDHEC-Risk Institute created the [https://risk.edhec.edu/indices-investment-solutions#tab_374 EDHEC-Risk Alternative Indices] which are computed for thirteen investment investment styles, that represent typical hedge fund strategies (Convertible Arbitrage, CTA Global, Distressed Securities, Emerging Markets, Equity Market Neutral, Event Driven, Fixed Income Arbitrage, Funds of Funds, Global Macro, Long/Short Equity, Merger Arbitrage, Relative Value, Short Selling). Published monthly, those indices aggregate and synthesise information from different index providers, so as to provide investors with representative benchmarks.\n\n====Investable indices====\nInvestable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders. To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index. When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.\n\nTo make the index investable, hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor. To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable. This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds. Most seriously, they under-represent more successful managers, who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols.\n\n====Hedge fund replication====\nThe most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner. Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns, and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets. This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets. This makes the index investable, and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed. However, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process. Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.\n\n=== Closures ===\nIn March 2017, HFR \u2013 a hedge fund research data and service provider \u2013 reported that there were more hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession. According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds\u2019 subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.\n\nDespite the hedge fund industry topping $3 trillion for the first time ever in 2016, the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of levels before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].

In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy. The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing [[counterparty]] banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.\n\nAn August 2012 survey by the [[Financial Services Authority]] concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result, ''inter alia'', of larger [[margin (finance)|margin]]s being required by counterparty banks, but might change rapidly according to market conditions. In stressed market conditions, investors might suddenly withdraw large sums, resulting in forced asset sales. This might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund.<ref>\n{{cite web|url= http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/hedge-fund-report-aug2012.pdf|title= Assessing the possible sources of systemic risk from hedge funds|publisher = Financial Services Authority|date= August 2012|access-date= 18 July 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121110212234/http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/hedge-fund-report-aug2012.pdf|archive-date = 10 November 2012|url-status = live|df= dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Transparency===\nHedge funds are structured to avoid most direct [[financial regulation|regulation]] (although their managers may be regulated), and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or [[exchange-traded fund]], which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.<ref>Carrie Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html \"Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209234404/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html |date=9 February 2017 }} ''The Washington Post'' (29 June 2006).

One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular [[market neutral]] and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.<ref name=\"Roadmap\"/>\n\nHowever, there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds. These reasons are:\n* Hedge funds are highly individual, and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks.\n* Hedge funds' low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events, making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear.\n* Hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds.<ref>''Portfolio Efficiency with Performance Fees'', Economics and Political Strategy (newsletter), February 2007, Peter L. Bernstein Inc.</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hulbert |first=Mark |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |title=Hulbert, Mark ''2 + 20, and Other Hedge Fund Math'', ''New York Times'', 4 March 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209204544/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |archive-date=9 December 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds took no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.\n\nThe other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity [[bear market]]s, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value.<ref name=\"Roadmap\"/> For example, in January\u2013September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index was down 9.87%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |title=Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Index web page |website=HedgeIndex.com |accessdate=14 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819170411/http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |archive-date=19 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to the same index series, even \"dedicated short bias\" funds had a return of \u22126.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Activist shareholder]]\n*[[Alternative investment]]\n* [[Board of directors]]\n* [[Corporate governance]]\n* [[Fund governance]]\n* [[Investment banking]]\n* [[List of hedge funds]]\n* [[Vulture fund]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Thomas P.

investment is spread along separate sub-managers investing in their own strategy.\n*Withdraw holding: a hold is placed on all major withdrawals for 90 days prior to and after the hedge fund is created and established.\n*[[130-30 funds]]: equity funds with 130% long and 30% short positions, leaving a net long position of 100%.\n*[[Risk parity]]: equalizing risk by allocating funds to a wide range of categories while maximizing gains through financial leveraging.\n*AI driven: using [[big data]] and sophisticated [[machine learning]] models to predict prices.\n\n==Risk==\nFor an investor who

They play a central and unambiguous role in traditional asset markets, where they are widely accepted as representative of their underlying portfolios. Equity and debt [[index fund]] products provide investable access to most [[developed market]]s in these asset classes. Hedge funds, however, are actively managed, so that tracking is impossible. Non-investable hedge fund indices on the other hand may be more or less representative, but returns data on many of the reference group of funds is non-public. This may result in biased estimates of their returns. In an attempt to address this problem, clone indices have been created in an attempt to replicate the statistical properties of hedge funds without being directly based on their returns data. None of these approaches achieves the accuracy of indices in other asset classes for which there is more complete published data concerning the underlying returns.<ref>A source for hedge fund track records is the [https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html Cambridge Associates Private Equity Index] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917052031/http://www.cambridgeassociates.com/foundations_endowments/working_together/specialized_expertise/alternative_assets/indicies_benchmarking.html |date=17 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\n====Non-investable indices====\nNon-investable indices are indicative in nature, and aim to represent the performance of some database of hedge funds using some measure such as mean, median, or weighted mean from a hedge fund database. The databases have diverse selection criteria and methods of construction, and no single database captures all funds. This leads to significant differences in reported performance between different indices.\n\nAlthough they aim to be representative, non-investable indices suffer from a lengthy and largely unavoidable list of [[Selection bias|biases]]. Funds' participation in a database is voluntary, leading to [[self-selection bias]] because those funds that choose to report may not be typical of funds as a whole. For example, some do not report because of poor results or because they have already reached their target size and do not wish to raise further money..\n\nThe short lifetimes of many hedge funds means that there are many new entrants and many departures each year, which raises the problem of [[Attrition bias|survivorship bias]]. If we examine only funds that have survived to the present, we will overestimate past returns because many of the worst-performing funds have not survived, and the observed association between fund youth and fund performance suggests that this bias may be substantial.\n\nWhen a fund is added to a database for the first time, all or part of its historical data is recorded ex-post in the database. It is likely that funds only publish their results when they are favorable, so that the average performances displayed by the funds during their incubation period are inflated. This is known as \"instant history bias\" or \"backfill bias\".\n\n====Investable indices====\nInvestable indices are an attempt to reduce these problems by ensuring that the return of the index is available to shareholders. To create an investable index, the index provider selects funds and develops structured products or derivative instruments that deliver the performance of the index. When investors buy these products the index provider makes the investments in the underlying funds, making an investable index similar in some ways to a fund of hedge funds portfolio.\n\nTo make the index investable, hedge funds must agree to accept investments on the terms given by the constructor. To make the index liquid, these terms must include provisions for redemptions that some managers may consider too onerous to be acceptable. This means that investable indices do not represent the total universe of hedge funds. Most seriously, they under-represent more successful managers, who typically refuse to accept such investment protocols.\n\n====Hedge fund replication====\nThe most recent addition to the field approach the problem in a different manner. Instead of reflecting the performance of actual hedge funds they take a statistical approach to the analysis of historic hedge fund returns, and use this to construct a model of how hedge fund returns respond to the movements of various investable financial assets. This model is then used to construct an investable portfolio of those assets. This makes the index investable, and in principle they can be as representative as the hedge fund database from which they were constructed. However, these clone indices rely on a statistical modelling process. Such indices have too short a history to state whether this approach will be considered successful.\n\n=== Closures ===\nIn March 2017, HFR \u2013 a hedge fund research data and service provider \u2013 reported that there were more hedge-fund closures in 2016 than during the 2009 recession. According to the report, several large public pension funds pulled their investments in hedge funds, because the funds\u2019 subpar performance as a group did not merit the high fees they charged.\n\nDespite the hedge fund industry topping $3 trillion for the first time ever in 2016, the number of new hedge funds launched fell short of levels before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].

In addition, while most hedge funds make only modest use of leverage, hedge funds differ from many other market participants, such as banks and mutual funds, in that there are no regulatory constraints on their use of leverage, and some hedge funds seek large amounts of leverage as part of their market strategy. The extensive use of leverage can lead to forced liquidations in a crisis, particularly for hedge funds that invest at least in part in illiquid investments. The close interconnectedness of the hedge funds with their prime brokers, typically investment banks, can lead to domino effects in a crisis, and indeed failing [[counterparty]] banks can freeze hedge funds. These systemic risk concerns are exacerbated by the prominent role of hedge funds in the financial markets. The global hedge fund industry has over $2 trillion in assets, and this does not take into account the full effect of leverage, which by definition is market exposure in excess of the amount invested.\n\nAn August 2012 survey by the [[Financial Services Authority]] concluded that risks were limited and had reduced as a result, ''inter alia'', of larger [[margin (finance)|margin]]s being required by counterparty banks, but might change rapidly according to market conditions. In stressed market conditions, investors might suddenly withdraw large sums, resulting in forced asset sales. This might cause liquidity and pricing problems if it occurred across a number of funds or in one large highly leveraged fund.<ref>\n{{cite web|url= http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/hedge-fund-report-aug2012.pdf|title= Assessing the possible sources of systemic risk from hedge funds|publisher = Financial Services Authority|date= August 2012|access-date= 18 July 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121110212234/http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/other/hedge-fund-report-aug2012.pdf|archive-date = 10 November 2012|url-status = live|df= dmy-all\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Transparency===\nHedge funds are structured to avoid most direct [[financial regulation|regulation]] (although their managers may be regulated), and are not required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or [[exchange-traded fund]], which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.<ref>Carrie Johnson, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html \"Scrutiny Urged for Hedge Funds\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209234404/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062801909.html |date=9 February 2017 }} ''The Washington Post'' (29 June 2006).

One of the attractive features of hedge funds (in particular [[market neutral]] and similar funds) is that they sometimes have a modest correlation with traditional assets such as equities. This means that hedge funds have a potentially quite valuable role in investment portfolios as diversifiers, reducing overall portfolio risk.<ref name=\"Roadmap\"/>\n\nHowever, there are three reasons why one might not wish to allocate a high proportion of assets into hedge funds. These reasons are:\n* Hedge funds are highly individual, and it is hard to estimate the likely returns or risks.\n* Hedge funds' low correlation with other assets tends to dissipate during stressful market events, making them much less useful for diversification than they may appear.\n* Hedge fund returns are reduced considerably by the high fee structures that are typically charged.\n\nSeveral studies have suggested that hedge funds are sufficiently diversifying to merit inclusion in investor portfolios, but this is disputed for example by Mark Kritzman who performed a mean-variance optimization calculation on an opportunity set that consisted of a stock index fund, a bond index fund, and ten hypothetical hedge funds.<ref>''Portfolio Efficiency with Performance Fees'', Economics and Political Strategy (newsletter), February 2007, Peter L. Bernstein Inc.</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hulbert |first=Mark |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |title=Hulbert, Mark ''2 + 20, and Other Hedge Fund Math'', ''New York Times'', 4 March 2007 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 March 2007 |accessdate=26 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209204544/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/business/yourmoney/04stra.html |archive-date=9 December 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The optimizer found that a mean-variance efficient portfolio did not contain any allocation to hedge funds, largely because of the impact of performance fees. To demonstrate this, Kritzman repeated the optimization using an assumption that the hedge funds took no performance fees. The result from this second optimization was an allocation of 74% to hedge funds.\n\nThe other factor reducing the attractiveness of hedge funds in a diversified portfolio is that they tend to perform poorly during equity [[bear market]]s, just when an investor needs part of their portfolio to add value.<ref name=\"Roadmap\"/> For example, in January\u2013September 2008, the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index was down 9.87%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |title=Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Index web page |website=HedgeIndex.com |accessdate=14 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819170411/http://www.hedgeindex.com/hedgeindex/en/default.aspx?cy=USD |archive-date=19 August 2010 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> According to the same index series, even \"dedicated short bias\" funds had a return of \u22126.08% during September 2008. In other words, even though low average correlations may appear to make hedge funds attractive this may not work in turbulent period, for example around the collapse of [[Lehman Brothers]] in September 2008.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Activist shareholder]]\n*[[Alternative investment]]\n* [[Board of directors]]\n* [[Corporate governance]]\n* [[Fund governance]]\n* [[Investment banking]]\n* [[List of hedge funds]]\n* [[Vulture fund]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Thomas P.
