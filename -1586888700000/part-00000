From 1910\u20131915 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. He took courses philosophy, architecture and [[agronomy]]. On his return to Krak\u00f3w he entered the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], and also worked in his father's studio. In 1915 he began to travel frequently to [[Zakopane]] where he spent extensive periods, to climb, ski and paint, until the [[outbreak of World War II]]. He joined the local [[Mountain rescue]] team, [[Tatrza\u0144skie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe|TOPR]]. However in 1917 on the south face of \"Zamar\u0142a Turnia\" he and his climbing companion, Stanis\u0142aw Bronikowski, were caught in a climbing accident in which his friend died, while Malczewski clung to a hook all night awaiting rescue.\n\nIn October 1917 he married Bronis\u0142awa Dziadosz, an English teacher four years his senior and a [[US citizen]] of Polish descent who had immigrated into Poland. In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child, Zofia. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1932 he joined the \"Rhythm Association of artists (Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d) and was a set designer for productions of [[Strindberg]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz]] at the ''Formistyczny Theatre'' in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\n[[File:Rafal Malczewski Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Rafa\u0142 Malczewski in [[Ottawa]]. He settled in [[Canada]] in 1942]]\nIn 1939 after the [[outbreak of World War II]], having already abandoned his wife and children, he escaped over the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border, with his partner Zofia Mikucka, and via [[Budapest]] and [[Venice]] made his way to [[Paris]]. Here he fell on the generosity of the Polish embassy there to help him out of another financial difficulty. In 1940 they travelled on to [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], where they stayed for four months. At the beginning of 1941 they moved to [[Brazil]]. At first they stayed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where he was able to sell some of his paintings which consisted of water colour landscapes of Rio, [[Curitiba]] and of [[Paran\u00e1 (state)|Parana]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=CANADIAN ART CRITICS ON RAFA\u0141 MALCZEWSKI|author= Krzy\u017canowski, Jerzy R.|journal=The Polish Review|volume= 38, No. 2 |date=1993|pages=191-201}}</ref><ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nIn 1942 they moved to Curitiba to stay with his cousin, Maria Bochdan-Niedenthal. Shortly after, he succeeded in obtaining Canadian visas for himself and his girlfriend, Zofia, for travel to [[Ottawa]]. By December 1942 he held his first Canadian exhibition in the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]. He managed to persuade the [[Canadian railways]] to sponsor him and Zofia to travel across [[Canada]] and the [[USA]] in search of artistic subjects. He spent the winter of 1943 in the [[Rocky Mountains]], which led to a series of canvases that kept him supplied for many exhibitions until 1949. A stay in [[New York City|New York]] in 1950 was fruitful enough for further sales of his work. \n\nDespite developing problems with his sight, like his father before him, the ensuing years saw a great flowering of his painting and writing. After his wife, Bronislawa died in Warsaw in 1953, he finally married Zofia Mikucka. A stroke in 1957 led to a partial paralysis which obliged him to give up painting in oils, but he was able to continue with water colours. He managed to obtain sponsorship from the CIA-controlled [[Radio Free Europe]] and from [[Quebec City]]. In 1959 the daughter of Zofia Malczewska-Kondracka invited him to visit Poland. Despite great nostalgia for the south of the country, he  resolved to remain in Canada, but his journey was described in his memoir, ''Wspomnieniach z Polski'' and serialised in the [[London]] \u00e9migr\u00e9 paper,[[Wiadomo\u015bci (London magazine)|Wiadomo\u015bci]]. From 1961 he was kept by his daughter, Zofia, and three years later, in 1964 his last exhibition took place in [[Montreal]]. He died and was buried there in 1965.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Characteristics of his art ==\nMagdalena Ma\u0142etko has emphasised several pointers to understand Malczewski's art. His successful artist father wished him to have a more reliable career than his. While at the University of Vienna Malczewski studied [[Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]] as part of the philosophy course, but he failed to complete his degree. He never got over the death of his close friend and climbing partner Bronikowski, who died on a climb they did together in 1917. His first marriage was an attempt to get over his grief and was loveless, and more of a duty due to Bronis\u0142awa's pregnancy. Painting came to him instinctually as he watched his prolific father working in his studio. Malczewski was an artist difficult to categorise, although he developed his own distinctive style. This has been called \"hyper realism\" (Witkacy) and \"naive\". His themes were predominantly empty vistas, mountain scenery, snowscapes and glassy lakes. He also did portraits, cartoons and a series of rally cars and industrial scenery in [[Silesia]]. The great hiatus of his life was leaving his family and his beloved Zakopane in 1939. Three years later he had settled in Canada having travelled through Southern Europe and Brazil, where his palette responded to the colour and light. His later life was a struggle with increasing blindness and paralysis which allowed him only to use water colour, alongside his writing, which he managed to do until his death.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ma\u0142etko, Magdalena|title= Rafa\u0142 Malczewski i jego widzenie nowoczesno\u015bci|date=2009   |url=https://www.kul.pl/files/564/public/ARTykuly/ARTykuly002/ARTykuly_nr002_2009_MM_s22.pdf|lang=pl|publisher=www.kul.pl|access-date=2020-04-14|trans-title=Rafa\u0142 Malczewski and his vision of modernity}}</ref>\n\n== Selected exhibitions and awards==\nMalczewski's first public show was with [[Witkacy]] at Garlinski's Salon in Warsaw in 1924.<ref name = \"IK\"/> Solo shows followed in:\n* Zakopane (1926)\n* Warsaw (1928, 1929, 1935, 1938)\n* Krak\u00f3w (1930, 1932) \n* [[Lodz|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] (1935)\n* [[Katowice]] (1938) \n* Montreal Museum of Arts ( 1942)\n* Dominion Gallery (1949)  \n* Corcoran Gallery, [[Washington, D.C.]] (1944).<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\nAs a member of the Society for the Propagation of Polish Art Abroad, he participated in the following group exhibitions:\n* [[Prague]] and [[Helsinki]] (1929)\n* Vienna and Paris (1928) \n* [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]] (1929)\n* Budapest and [[Copenhagen]] (1930)\n* Venice (13th Biennale) and [[Los Angeles]] (1932)\n* [[Moscow]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[San Francisco]] (1933)\n* New York (1933)\n* [[Berlin]] (1936)\n* [[Pittsburgh]] (1938)\n* [[Ottawa]] (1942)\n* [[Detroit]] (1945) \n* [[Montreal]] (1954). \nAmong the many awards he received were:\n* President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] prize 1930\n* Golden laurel of ''Polska Akademia Literatury'' 1937\n* Gold Medal for his ''Wiosna w g\u00f3rach'' [\"Spring in the mountains\"] at the Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] 1937\n* ''The Visual Arts Prize'' of Paris-based Polish-language monthly, ''[[Kultura]]'' 1962.<ref name = \"IK\"/>\n\n== Selected written work ==\nIn his writing Rafa\u0142 Malczewski evoked the atmosphere of [[Interbellum Poland|interbellum]] Zakopane:\n* ''Od cepra do wariata'', [From Lowland Dweller to Madman]\n* ''Narkotyk g\u00f3r.

From 1910\u20131915 he studied at the [[University of Vienna]]. He took courses philosophy, architecture and [[agronomy]]. On his return to Krak\u00f3w he entered the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]], and also worked in his father's studio. In 1915 he began to travel frequently to [[Zakopane]] where he spent extensive periods, to climb, ski and paint, until the [[outbreak of World War II]]. He joined the local [[Mountain rescue]] team, [[Tatrza\u0144skie Ochotnicze Pogotowie Ratunkowe|TOPR]]. However in 1917 on the south face of \"Zamar\u0142a Turnia\" he and his climbing companion, Stanis\u0142aw Bronikowski, were caught in a climbing accident in which his friend died, while Malczewski clung to a hook all night awaiting rescue.\n\nIn October 1917 he married Bronis\u0142awa Dziadosz, an English teacher four years his senior and a [[US citizen]] of Polish descent who had immigrated into Poland. In November of the same year, their son Krzysztof was born. Despite an unhappy partnership, the couple went on to have a second child, Zofia. Their poor financial situation led to Rafa\u0142's artist father helping them out. In 1923 he bought for them a chalet called \"Marysin\".\n\nRafa\u0142 Malczewski was an associate and friend of a group of artists, musicians and intellectuals who would congregate in the [[Mountain resort]] of Zakopane in the early part of the 20th century. They included [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Karol Szymanowski]], [[Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski]], [[Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz]]. In 1932 he joined the \"Rhythm Association of artists (Stowarzyszenie Artyst\u00f3w Polskich \u201eRytm\u201d) and was a set designer for productions of [[Strindberg]] and [[Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz]] at the ''Formistyczny Theatre'' in Zakopane. In 1937 he was awarded the \"Wawrzyn Akademicki\" award from the [[Polska Akademia Literatury]] \"for services to Polish art\".<ref>Rocznik Polskiej Akademii Literatury 1937\u20131938, Warsaw 1939, p. 175.</ref> 1938 he donated part of his artistic output to the newly re-opened [[National Museum of Warsaw]] to which, several years earlier on account of his material difficulties, he had sold the entirety of his father's work left to him by Malczewski Sr.\n\n== Travels ==\n[[File:Rafal Malczewski Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Rafa\u0142 Malczewski in [[Ottawa]].

She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first [[ichthyosaur]] skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete [[plesiosaur]] skeletons found; the first [[pterosaur]] skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that [[coprolite]]s, known as [[bezoar]] stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossils contained fossilised [[ink sac]]s like those of modern [[cephalopods]]. When geologist [[Henry De la Beche]] painted ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.\n\nA [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] and a woman, Anning did not fully participate in the [[scientific community]] of 19th-century Britain, who were mostly [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[gentlemen]]. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.\n\nShe became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of [[anatomy]] as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the [[Geological Society of London]] and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: \"The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.\"<ref name=Dickens/> The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\">{{Harvnb|Torrens|1995}}</ref>\n\nAfter her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in ''[[All the Year Round]]'', edited by [[Charles Dickens]], wrote of her in 1865 that \"[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it.\"<ref name=Dickens/> It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue-twister \"She sells seashells on the seashore\" by Terry Sullivan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053150/http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/ |archivedate=20 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/05/21/mary-anning-from-selling-seashells-to-one-of-historys-most-important-paleontologists/ |title=Mary Anning: From Selling Seashells to One of History's Most Important Paleontologists |last=Montanar |first=Shaena |date=2015-05-21 |website=Forbes [Internet Archive cache] |access-date=2016-11-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317223109/http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/05/21/mary-anning-from-selling-seashells-to-one-of-historys-most-important-paleontologists/ |archivedate=17 March 2016 }}</ref> In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the [[Royal Society]] included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.<ref name=\"mostInfluential\"/>\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n===  Early childhood ===\n[[image:Lyme Regis - Dorset dot.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Map of the UK|[[Lyme Regis]], Dorset]]\nAnning was born in [[Lyme Regis]] in Dorset, England. Her father, Richard Anning (''c''.1766\u20131810), was a [[cabinetmaker]] and carpenter who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists; her mother was Mary Moore (''c''.1764\u20131842) known as Molly.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=2004-09-23|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/568|pages=ref:odnb/568|editor-last=Matthew|editor-first=H.

Her parents married on 8 August 1793 in [[Blandford Forum]] and moved to Lyme, living in a house built on the town's bridge. They attended the [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] chapel on Coombe Street, whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. [[Shelley Emling]] writes that the family lived so near to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings' home, on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned.<ref name=Emling11/>\n\n[[image:Mary Anning Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Oval blue plaque marking site of Anning's house|[[Blue plaque]] where Mary Anning was born and had her first fossil shop, now the [[Lyme Regis Museum]]]][[image:Mary Anning's house and shop in Lyme Regis, drawn in 1842.JPG|thumb|1842 sketch of Anning's house|alt=Sketch of house with two large front windows on either side of a front door and next to the steps leading up from the street to the door are two partially open cellar doors]]\n\nMolly and Richard had ten children.<ref name=\"Goodhue10\">{{Harvnb|Goodhue|2002|p=10}}</ref> The first child, Mary, was born in 1794. She was followed by another daughter, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire.<ref name=Emling11/> The incident was reported in the ''[[Bath Chronicle]]'' on 27 December 1798: \"A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death.\"<ref name=Cadbury5/> When another daughter was born five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived more than a year or two. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood.<ref name=\"Emling11\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not unusual. Almost half the children born in the UK in the 19th century died before the age of five, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] were common.<ref name=\"Goodhue10\"/>\n\nOn 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, an event occurred that became part of local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree-killing all three women below.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hawkes |first1=Jaquetta |title=A Land |date=1953 |publisher=Readers United |location=London |pages=56\u201357}}</ref> Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water.<ref name=\"Cadbury5\">{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family said she had been a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=14\u201316}}</ref>\n\nHer education was extremely limited. She was able to attend a Congregationalist [[Sunday school]] where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised the importance of education for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the ''Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review'', in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=26}}</ref>\n\n===Fossils as a family business===\n{{further|Jurassic coast|List of fossil sites}}\n[[File:Blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Cliff wall with layers of rock next to a rocky beach|[[Blue Lias]] cliffs, Lyme Regis]]\n[[File:Golden Cap from Charmouth beach.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Cliffs in the distance, seashore in the foreground|The Jurassic coast at [[Charmouth]], Dorset, where the Annings made some of their finds]]\n\nBy the late 18th century, Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle-class tourists were arriving there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=4}}</ref> Even before Mary's time, locals supplemented their income by selling what were called \"curios\" to visitors. These were fossils with colourful local names such as \"snake-stones\" ([[Ammonoidea|ammonites]]), \"devil's fingers\" ([[belemnite]]s), and \"verteberries\" ([[vertebrae]]), to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=6\u20138}}</ref> Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood.\n\nThe source of most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a geological formation known as the [[Blue Lias]]. This consists of alternating layers of [[limestone]] and [[shale]], laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210\u2013195&nbsp;million years ago). It is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/>\n\nTheir father, Richard, often took Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to supplement the family's income. They offered their discoveries for sale to tourists on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the family's status as religious dissenters\u2014not followers of the [[Church of England]]\u2014attracted discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions.<ref name=Emling11/> Her father had been suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff. When he died in November 1810 (aged 44), he left the family with significant debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for [[Poor Relief Act 1662|parish relief]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe family continued collecting and selling fossils together, and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.<ref name=\"Dean58\">{{Harvnb|Dean|1999|p=58ff}}</ref>\n[[File:AnningIchthyosaurSkull.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of side view of a long thin skull with needle like teeth and a large eye socket|Drawing from an 1814 paper<ref name=\"Home1814\">{{Harvnb|Home|1814}}</ref> by [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Everard Home]] showing the ''[[Ichthyosaurus platyodon]]'' skull found by Joseph Anning in 1811]]\nTheir first well-known find was in 1811, when Mary was 12; Joseph dug up a 4-foot [[ichthyosaur]] skull, and a few months later Mary found the rest of the skeleton.

There it generated considerable interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical account of creation]], [[Dating creation#Biblical creation dates|which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old]],<ref name=\"academy_of_sci\"/> it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself. It was later sold for \u00a345 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a \"Crocodile in a Fossil State\" to [[Charles Konig]], of the [[British Museum]], who had already suggested the name ''Ichthyosaurus'' for it.<ref name=\"Howe12\">{{Harvnb|Howe|Sharpe|Torrens|1981|p=12}}</ref>\n\nMary's mother Molly initially ran the fossil business after Richard's death, but it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an [[upholsterer]], but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\n===Birch auction===\nOne of the family's keenest customers was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, a wealthy collector from [[Lincolnshire]], who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist [[Gideon Mantell]] on 5 March that year to say that the sale was \"for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost ''all'' the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied.\" The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised \u00a3400 (worth the equivalent of over \u00a326,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.<ref name=Dean58/>\n\n===Fossil shop and growing expertise in a risky occupation===\n[[File:Mary Anning.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Sketch of woman in heavy clothing with top hat holding a rock hammer and looking down at a sandy beach|Sketch of Mary Anning at work by [[Henry De la Beche]]]]\nAnning continued to support herself selling fossils. Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as [[ammonite]] and [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. [[Vertebrate]] fossils, such as ichthyosaur skeletons, sold for more, but were much rarer.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\">{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=14\u201321}}</ref> Collecting them was dangerous winter work. In 1823, an article in ''The Bristol Mirror'' said of her:\n\n{{Quotation|This persevering female has for years gone daily in search of fossil remains of importance at every tide, for many miles under the hanging cliffs at Lyme, whose fallen masses are her immediate object, as they alone contain these valuable relics of a former world, which must be snatched at the moment of their fall, at the continual risk of being crushed by the half suspended fragments they leave behind, or be left to be destroyed by the returning tide:{{spaced ndash}}to her exertions we owe nearly all the fine specimens of Ichthyosauri of the great collections&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Torrens1995\" />}}\n\nThe risks of her profession were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\" /> She wrote to a friend, [[Charlotte Murchison]], in November of that year: \"Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodhue|2004|p=84}}</ref>\n\nAs Anning continued to make important finds, her reputation grew. On 10&nbsp;December 1823, she found the first complete ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'', and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as [[pterosaur]]s, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a ''[[Squaloraja]]'' fish skeleton in 1829.<ref name=\"TorrensODNB\" /> Despite her limited education, she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain, and often, laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\" /> She also dissected modern animals including both fish and [[cuttlefish]] to gain a better understanding of the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working. Lady Harriet Silvester, the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London, visited Lyme in 1824 and described Anning in her diary:\n[[File:Mary Anning Plesiosaurus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Drawing of partially complete skeleton of creature with long thin neck, small skull, and paddles|Letter and drawing from Mary Anning announcing the discovery of a fossil animal now known as ''[[Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus]]'', 26&nbsp;December 1823]]\n\n{{Quotation|The extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong.

The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme, including the geologist [[George William Featherstonhaugh]], who called Anning a \"very clever funny Creature.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Berkeley|1988|p=66}}</ref> He purchased fossils from her for the newly opened [[New York Academy of Sciences|New York Lyceum of Natural History]] in 1827. King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=98\u201399, 190\u2013191}}</ref> The king's physician and aide, [[Carl Gustav Carus]], wrote in his journal:\n\n{{Quotation|We had alighted from the carriage and were proceeding on foot, when we fell in with a shop in which the most remarkable petrifications and fossil remains\u2014the head of an ''Ichthyosaurus''\u2014beautiful ammonites, etc. were exhibited in the window. We entered and found the small shop and adjoining chamber completely filled with fossil productions of the coast ... I found in the shop a large slab of blackish clay, in which a perfect ''Ichthyosaurus'' of at least six feet, was embedded. This specimen would have been a great acquisition for many of the cabinets of natural history on the Continent, and I consider the price demanded, \u00a315 sterling, as very moderate.<ref name=Carus />}}\n\nCarus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference\u2014she wrote it as \"Mary Annins\"\u2014and when she handed it back to him she told him: \"I am well known throughout the whole of Europe.\"<ref name=\"Carus\">{{Harvnb|Carus|1846|p=197}}\n* also see {{Harvnb|Gordon|1894|p=115}}</ref> As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark ''[[Hybodus]]'' represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Anning|first=Mary|title=Extract of a letter from Miss Anning |url=https://books.google.com/?id=epY5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA605|journal=The Magazine of Natural History|volume=3|page=605|year=1839|id={{BHLpage|2270489}}|series=N.S.|issue=36}}</ref> The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime.

At the time in Britain women were not allowed to vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential [[Geological Society of London]] did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=40}}</ref> The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/>\n\nAlthough Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/> Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: \"She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\nAlong with purchasing specimens, many geologists visited her to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. [[Henry De la Beche]] and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain's leading geologists.<ref name=\"Emling35\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=35}}</ref> [[William Buckland]], who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=26\u201327}}\n* {{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=53\u201356}}</ref> It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects [[coprolites]].<ref name=\"Rudwick154\"/> In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and [[Richard Owen]] visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=173\u2013176}}</ref>\n\nShe also assisted [[Thomas Hawkins (geologist)|Thomas Hawkins]] with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to \"enhance\" the fossils he collected. She wrote: \"he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=131}}</ref> A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=133\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nThe Swiss palaeontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] visited Lyme Regis in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. He was so impressed by her and her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]] that he wrote in his journal: \"Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the icthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types.\" He thanked both of them for their help in his book, ''Studies of Fossil Fish''.<ref name=Emling169/>\n\nAnother leading British geologist, [[Roderick Murchison]], did some of his first field work in southwest England, including Lyme, accompanied by his wife, Charlotte. Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to \"become a good practical fossilist, by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place...\". Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and Anning stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829.\n\n[[Gideon Mantell]], discoverer of the dinosaur [[Iguanodon]], also visited her at her shop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=99\u2013101, 124\u2013125, 171}}</ref>\n\nAnning's correspondents included [[Charles Lyell]], who wrote to her to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme, as well as [[Adam Sedgwick]]\u2014one of her earliest customers\u2014who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered [[Charles Darwin]] among his students.\n\n===Financial difficulties and change in church affiliation===\n[[File:Duria Antiquior Scharf.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white print of prehistoric animals and plants living in the sea and on the nearby shore; foreground figures include pterosaurs fighting in the air above the sea and an ichthyosaur biting into the long neck of a plesiosaur.|The [[lithograph]] print of ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', made by Scharf based on De la Beche's original [[watercolour]]]]\nBy 1830, because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning [[George Johann Scharf|Georg Scharf]] to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as [[deep time]] to be widely circulated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1992|pp=42\u201347}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=139\u2013145}}</ref> In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur, which sold for \u00a3200.<ref name=\"Emling143\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=143}}</ref>\n\nIt was around this time that she switched from attending the local Congregational church, where she had been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was [[List of Christian thinkers in science|devoutly religious]], actively supported her new church as she had her old.<ref name=\"Emling143\"/>\n\nShe suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings, about \u00a3300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. [[Deborah Cadbury]] says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=231}}</ref> but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the British government to award her an [[Life annuity|annuity]], known as a [[Civil List pension|civil list pension]], in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The \u00a325 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:MaryAnningGravestone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo of upright gravestone|Gravestone of Anning and her brother Joseph in St Michael's churchyard]]\nAnning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847. Her work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness, and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of [[laudanum]] she was taking for the pain, there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brice|2001}}</ref> The regard in which she was held by the geological community was shown in 1846 when, upon learning of her cancer diagnosis, the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses and the council of the newly created [[Dorset County Museum]] made her an honorary member.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of [[Lyme Regis#Religion|St Michael's]], the local parish church.<ref name=\"TorrensODNB\">{{Harvnb|Torrens|2008}}</ref> Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained-glass window in her memory, unveiled in 1850.

These were honours normally only accorded to fellows of the society, which did not admit women until 1904. The eulogy began:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without adverting to that of one, who though not placed among even the easier classes of society, but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour, yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great [[Enalio-Saurians]], and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ...<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YR0RAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR24 |title=Anniversary Address of the President |journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=4 |year=1848 |page=xxv |author=Anon}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Charles Dickens]] wrote an article about her life in February 1865 in his literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' that emphasised the difficulties she had overcome, especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople.

Its notoriety increased when [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Sir Everard Home]] wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society.

When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Conybeare|1824}}</ref> The second fossil was named and described as ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'' and is the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] ([[holotype]]) of this species, which itself is the [[type species]] of the [[genus]].\n\nConybeare's presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAnning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named ''Plesiosaurus macrocephalus'' by [[William Buckland]] and was described in an 1840 paper by [[Richard Owen]].<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it.<ref name=\"Emling143\"/>\n\n===Fossil fish and pterosaur===\n[[File:Pterodactylus macronyx.jpg|thumb|alt=sketch|The holotype specimen of ''[[Dimorphodon macronyx]]'' found by Mary Anning in 1828]]\nAnning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an unrivalled specimen of ''[[Dapedium|Dapedium politum]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1828}}</ref> This was a ray-finned fish, which would be described in 1828. In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a [[pterosaur]]. In 1829 William Buckland described it as ''Pterodactylus macronyx'' (later renamed ''[[Dimorphodon]] macronyx'' by Richard Owen), and unlike many other such occasions, Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper.\n\nIt was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, ''[[Squaloraja]]'', which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]].<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\n===Invertebrates and trace fossils===\nVertebrate fossil finds, especially of [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]], made Anning's reputation, but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]], which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil [[cephalopod]]s, and this led [[William Buckland]] to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=20}}\n* {{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=109}}</ref> It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as \"bezoar stones\" were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them [[coprolites]]. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[File:Duria Antiquior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Watercolour of prehistoric animals and plants living in the sea and on the nearby shore; foreground figures include pterosaurs fighting in the air above the sea and an ichthyosaur byting into the long neck of a plesiosaur.|The geologist Henry De la Beche painted the influential watercolour ''Duria Antiquior'' in 1830 based largely on fossils found by Anning.<ref name=\"Rudwick154\"/>]]\n\nAnning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for [[extinction]]. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of [[mammal]]s such as [[mammoth]]s. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct\u2014in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, \u2014 some, such as the [[plesiosaur]], so unlike any known living creature \u2014 struck a major blow against this idea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=48\u201350, 88}}</ref>\n\nThe ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and [[pterosaur]] she found, along with the first [[dinosaur]] fossils which were discovered by [[Gideon Mantell]] and [[William Buckland]] during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"[[Mesozoic|age of reptiles]]\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled \"The Age of Reptiles\" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=171\u2013175}}</ref> These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. This discipline eventually came to be called [[paleontology|palaeontology]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=57\u201358, 72}}</ref> Illustrations of scenes from \"deep time\" (now known as [[palaeoart]]), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting ''Duria Antiquior'', helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the [[food chain]] of the [[early Jurassic|Lias]] by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. The study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.<ref name=\"Rudwick154\">{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154\u2013158}}</ref>\n[[File:Mary Anning by B.

Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969) by [[John Fowles]], who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> As her biographer Shelley Emling noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and [[Roderick Murchison]], who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, [[Louis Agassiz]]. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her\u2014''[[Acrodus anningiae]]'', and ''Belenostomus anningiae''\u2014and another after her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]]. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.<ref name=\"Emling169\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=169\u2013170}}</ref> After her death, other species, including the [[ostracod]] ''Cytherelloidea anningi'', and two genera, the [[Therapsida|therapsid]] reptile genus ''Anningia'', and the [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] mollusc genus ''Anningella'', were named in her honour.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Paleontology|contribution=ANNING, MARY |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routpaleont/anning_mary|format=CREDO subscription required|year=1999}}</ref> In 2012, the plesiosaur genus ''[[Anningasaura]]'' was named after her,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vincent | first1 = P. | last2 = Benson | first2 = R.

She nearly died in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first [[ichthyosaur]] skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete [[plesiosaur]] skeletons found; the first [[pterosaur]] skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that [[coprolite]]s, known as [[bezoar]] stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossils contained fossilised [[ink sac]]s like those of modern [[cephalopods]]. When geologist [[Henry De la Beche]] painted ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.\n\nA [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] and a woman, Anning did not fully participate in the [[scientific community]] of 19th-century Britain, who were mostly [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[gentlemen]]. She struggled financially for much of her life. Her family was poor, and her father, a cabinetmaker, died when she was eleven.\n\nShe became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of [[anatomy]] as well as about collecting fossils. Nonetheless, as a woman, she was not eligible to join the [[Geological Society of London]] and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. Indeed, she wrote in a letter: \"The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone.\"<ref name=Dickens/> The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine's editor questioning one of its claims.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\">{{Harvnb|Torrens|1995}}</ref>\n\nAfter her death in 1847, her unusual life story attracted increasing interest. An uncredited author in ''[[All the Year Round]]'', edited by [[Charles Dickens]], wrote of her in 1865 that \"[t]he carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it.\"<ref name=Dickens/> It has often been claimed that her story was the inspiration for the 1908 tongue-twister \"She sells seashells on the seashore\" by Terry Sullivan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053150/http://www.factfixx.com/2012/06/20/tongue-twisters-she-sells-sea-shells/ |archivedate=20 September 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/05/21/mary-anning-from-selling-seashells-to-one-of-historys-most-important-paleontologists/ |title=Mary Anning: From Selling Seashells to One of History's Most Important Paleontologists |last=Montanar |first=Shaena |date=2015-05-21 |website=Forbes [Internet Archive cache] |access-date=2016-11-03 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317223109/http://www.forbes.com/sites/shaenamontanari/2015/05/21/mary-anning-from-selling-seashells-to-one-of-historys-most-important-paleontologists/ |archivedate=17 March 2016 }}</ref> In 2010, one hundred and sixty-three years after her death, the [[Royal Society]] included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.<ref name=\"mostInfluential\"/>\n\n== Life and career ==\n\n===  Early childhood ===\n[[image:Lyme Regis - Dorset dot.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=Map of the UK|[[Lyme Regis]], Dorset]]\nAnning was born in [[Lyme Regis]] in Dorset, England. Her father, Richard Anning (''c''.1766\u20131810), was a [[cabinetmaker]] and carpenter who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists; her mother was Mary Moore (''c''.1764\u20131842) known as Molly.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|date=2004-09-23|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/568|pages=ref:odnb/568|editor-last=Matthew|editor-first=H.

Her parents married on 8 August 1793 in [[Blandford Forum]] and moved to Lyme, living in a house built on the town's bridge. They attended the [[English Dissenters|Dissenter]] chapel on Coombe Street, whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as [[Congregational church|Congregationalists]]. [[Shelley Emling]] writes that the family lived so near to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings' home, on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid being drowned.<ref name=Emling11/>\n\n[[image:Mary Anning Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Oval blue plaque marking site of Anning's house|[[Blue plaque]] where Mary Anning was born and had her first fossil shop, now the [[Lyme Regis Museum]]]][[image:Mary Anning's house and shop in Lyme Regis, drawn in 1842.JPG|thumb|1842 sketch of Anning's house|alt=Sketch of house with two large front windows on either side of a front door and next to the steps leading up from the street to the door are two partially open cellar doors]]\n\nMolly and Richard had ten children.<ref name=\"Goodhue10\">{{Harvnb|Goodhue|2002|p=10}}</ref> The first child, Mary, was born in 1794. She was followed by another daughter, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire.<ref name=Emling11/> The incident was reported in the ''[[Bath Chronicle]]'' on 27 December 1798: \"A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl's clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death.\"<ref name=Cadbury5/> When another daughter was born five months later, she was named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived more than a year or two. Only Mary and Joseph survived to adulthood.<ref name=\"Emling11\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=11\u201314}}</ref> The high childhood mortality rate for the Anning family was not unusual. Almost half the children born in the UK in the 19th century died before the age of five, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like [[smallpox]] and [[measles]] were common.<ref name=\"Goodhue10\"/>\n\nOn 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, an event occurred that became part of local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen, when lightning struck the tree-killing all three women below.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hawkes |first1=Jaquetta |title=A Land |date=1953 |publisher=Readers United |location=London |pages=56\u201357}}</ref> Onlookers rushed the infant home where she was revived in a bath of hot water.<ref name=\"Cadbury5\">{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=5\u20136}}</ref> A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Her family said she had been a sickly baby before the event but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterward members of her community would attribute the child's curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=14\u201316}}</ref>\n\nHer education was extremely limited. She was able to attend a Congregationalist [[Sunday school]] where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised the importance of education for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the ''Dissenters' Theological Magazine and Review'', in which the family's pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=26}}</ref>\n\n===Fossils as a family business===\n{{further|Jurassic coast|List of fossil sites}}\n[[File:Blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Cliff wall with layers of rock next to a rocky beach|[[Blue Lias]] cliffs, Lyme Regis]]\n[[File:Golden Cap from Charmouth beach.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Cliffs in the distance, seashore in the foreground|The Jurassic coast at [[Charmouth]], Dorset, where the Annings made some of their finds]]\n\nBy the late 18th century, Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle-class tourists were arriving there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=4}}</ref> Even before Mary's time, locals supplemented their income by selling what were called \"curios\" to visitors. These were fossils with colourful local names such as \"snake-stones\" ([[Ammonoidea|ammonites]]), \"devil's fingers\" ([[belemnite]]s), and \"verteberries\" ([[vertebrae]]), to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=6\u20138}}</ref> Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood.\n\nThe source of most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a geological formation known as the [[Blue Lias]]. This consists of alternating layers of [[limestone]] and [[shale]], laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210\u2013195&nbsp;million years ago). It is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain caused landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/>\n\nTheir father, Richard, often took Mary and Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to supplement the family's income. They offered their discoveries for sale to tourists on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England's poor; the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the family's status as religious dissenters\u2014not followers of the [[Church of England]]\u2014attracted discrimination. Dissenters were not allowed into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions.<ref name=Emling11/> Her father had been suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff. When he died in November 1810 (aged 44), he left the family with significant debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for [[Poor Relief Act 1662|parish relief]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=9}}</ref>\n\nThe family continued collecting and selling fossils together, and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and her parents had sold significant fossils before the father's death.<ref name=\"Dean58\">{{Harvnb|Dean|1999|p=58ff}}</ref>\n[[File:AnningIchthyosaurSkull.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of side view of a long thin skull with needle like teeth and a large eye socket|Drawing from an 1814 paper<ref name=\"Home1814\">{{Harvnb|Home|1814}}</ref> by [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Everard Home]] showing the ''[[Ichthyosaurus platyodon]]'' skull found by Joseph Anning in 1811]]\nTheir first well-known find was in 1811, when Mary was 12; Joseph dug up a 4-foot [[ichthyosaur]] skull, and a few months later Mary found the rest of the skeleton. Henry Hoste Henley of [[Sandringham House]] in [[Sandringham, Norfolk]], who was lord of the manor of Colway, near Lyme Regis, paid the family about \u00a323 for it,<ref name=\"Sharpe15\">Sharpe and McCartney, 1998, p. 15.</ref> and in turn he sold it to [[William Bullock (collector)|William Bullock]], a well-known collector, who displayed it in London. There it generated considerable interest, because at a time when most people in England still believed in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Biblical account of creation]], [[Dating creation#Biblical creation dates|which implied that the Earth was only a few thousand years old]],<ref name=\"academy_of_sci\"/> it raised questions about the history of living things and of the Earth itself. It was later sold for \u00a345 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a \"Crocodile in a Fossil State\" to [[Charles Konig]], of the [[British Museum]], who had already suggested the name ''Ichthyosaurus'' for it.<ref name=\"Howe12\">{{Harvnb|Howe|Sharpe|Torrens|1981|p=12}}</ref>\n\nMary's mother Molly initially ran the fossil business after Richard's death, but it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an [[upholsterer]], but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the leading role in the family business.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\n===Birch auction===\nOne of the family's keenest customers was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, a wealthy collector from [[Lincolnshire]], who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family's poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction the fossils he had purchased from them on their behalf. He wrote to the palaeontologist [[Gideon Mantell]] on 5 March that year to say that the sale was \"for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost ''all'' the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied.\" The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised \u00a3400 (worth the equivalent of over \u00a326,000 in 2010). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family's profile within the geological community.<ref name=Dean58/>\n\n===Fossil shop and growing expertise in a risky occupation===\n[[File:Mary Anning.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Sketch of woman in heavy clothing with top hat holding a rock hammer and looking down at a sandy beach|Sketch of Mary Anning at work by [[Henry De la Beche]]]]\nAnning continued to support herself selling fossils. Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as [[ammonite]] and [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. [[Vertebrate]] fossils, such as ichthyosaur skeletons, sold for more, but were much rarer.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\">{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=14\u201321}}</ref> Collecting them was dangerous winter work. In 1823, an article in ''The Bristol Mirror'' said of her:\n\n{{Quotation|This persevering female has for years gone daily in search of fossil remains of importance at every tide, for many miles under the hanging cliffs at Lyme, whose fallen masses are her immediate object, as they alone contain these valuable relics of a former world, which must be snatched at the moment of their fall, at the continual risk of being crushed by the half suspended fragments they leave behind, or be left to be destroyed by the returning tide:{{spaced ndash}}to her exertions we owe nearly all the fine specimens of Ichthyosauri of the great collections&nbsp;...<ref name=\"Torrens1995\" />}}\n\nThe risks of her profession were illustrated when on October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\" /> She wrote to a friend, [[Charlotte Murchison]], in November of that year: \"Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Goodhue|2004|p=84}}</ref>\n\nAs Anning continued to make important finds, her reputation grew. On 10&nbsp;December 1823, she found the first complete ''[[Plesiosaurus]]'', and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as [[pterosaur]]s, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a ''[[Squaloraja]]'' fish skeleton in 1829.<ref name=\"TorrensODNB\" /> Despite her limited education, she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain, and often, laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy she made of an 1824 paper by [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard pressed to tell apart from the original.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\" /> She also dissected modern animals including both fish and [[cuttlefish]] to gain a better understanding of the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working. Lady Harriet Silvester, the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London, visited Lyme in 1824 and described Anning in her diary:\n[[File:Mary Anning Plesiosaurus.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Drawing of partially complete skeleton of creature with long thin neck, small skull, and paddles|Letter and drawing from Mary Anning announcing the discovery of a fossil animal now known as ''[[Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus]]'', 26&nbsp;December 1823]]\n\n{{Quotation|The extraordinary thing in this young woman is that she has made herself so thoroughly acquainted with the science that the moment she finds any bones she knows to what tribe they belong.

The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited Anning at Lyme, including the geologist [[George William Featherstonhaugh]], who called Anning a \"very clever funny Creature.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Berkeley|Berkeley|1988|p=66}}</ref> He purchased fossils from her for the newly opened [[New York Academy of Sciences|New York Lyceum of Natural History]] in 1827. King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=98\u201399, 190\u2013191}}</ref> The king's physician and aide, [[Carl Gustav Carus]], wrote in his journal:\n\n{{Quotation|We had alighted from the carriage and were proceeding on foot, when we fell in with a shop in which the most remarkable petrifications and fossil remains\u2014the head of an ''Ichthyosaurus''\u2014beautiful ammonites, etc. were exhibited in the window. We entered and found the small shop and adjoining chamber completely filled with fossil productions of the coast ... I found in the shop a large slab of blackish clay, in which a perfect ''Ichthyosaurus'' of at least six feet, was embedded. This specimen would have been a great acquisition for many of the cabinets of natural history on the Continent, and I consider the price demanded, \u00a315 sterling, as very moderate.<ref name=Carus />}}\n\nCarus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference\u2014she wrote it as \"Mary Annins\"\u2014and when she handed it back to him she told him: \"I am well known throughout the whole of Europe.\"<ref name=\"Carus\">{{Harvnb|Carus|1846|p=197}}\n* also see {{Harvnb|Gordon|1894|p=115}}</ref> As time passed, Anning's confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the ''[[Journal of Natural History|Magazine of Natural History]]'' to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark ''[[Hybodus]]'' represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=172}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Anning|first=Mary|title=Extract of a letter from Miss Anning |url=https://books.google.com/?id=epY5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA605|journal=The Magazine of Natural History|volume=3|page=605|year=1839|id={{BHLpage|2270489}}|series=N.S.|issue=36}}</ref> The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning's published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by her, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.<ref>{{Harvnb|Grant|1825|pp=131\u2013133, 172\u2013173}}</ref>\n\n===Interactions with the scientific community===\n{{Paleontology|cTopic=History of paleontology}}\nAs a woman, Anning was an outsider to the scientific community. At the time in Britain women were not allowed to vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential [[Geological Society of London]] did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=40}}</ref> The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opening factories.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/>\n\nAlthough Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention her name. She became resentful of this.<ref name=\"McGowan14-21\"/> Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: \"She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=203\u2013204}}</ref> Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\nAlong with purchasing specimens, many geologists visited her to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. [[Henry De la Beche]] and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Mary, and sometimes Mary's brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain's leading geologists.<ref name=\"Emling35\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=35}}</ref> [[William Buckland]], who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=26\u201327}}\n* {{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=53\u201356}}</ref> It was to him she made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones, were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects [[coprolites]].<ref name=\"Rudwick154\"/> In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and [[Richard Owen]] visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=173\u2013176}}</ref>\n\nShe also assisted [[Thomas Hawkins (geologist)|Thomas Hawkins]] with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to \"enhance\" the fossils he collected. She wrote: \"he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...\".<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=131}}</ref> A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum's collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=133\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nThe Swiss palaeontologist [[Louis Agassiz]] visited Lyme Regis in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. He was so impressed by her and her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]] that he wrote in his journal: \"Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the icthyodorulites dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types.\" He thanked both of them for their help in his book, ''Studies of Fossil Fish''.<ref name=Emling169/>\n\nAnother leading British geologist, [[Roderick Murchison]], did some of his first field work in southwest England, including Lyme, accompanied by his wife, Charlotte. Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to \"become a good practical fossilist, by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place...\". Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and Anning stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829.\n\n[[Gideon Mantell]], discoverer of the dinosaur [[Iguanodon]], also visited her at her shop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=99\u2013101, 124\u2013125, 171}}</ref>\n\nAnning's correspondents included [[Charles Lyell]], who wrote to her to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme, as well as [[Adam Sedgwick]]\u2014one of her earliest customers\u2014who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered [[Charles Darwin]] among his students.\n\n===Financial difficulties and change in church affiliation===\n[[File:Duria Antiquior Scharf.jpg|thumb|alt=Black and white print of prehistoric animals and plants living in the sea and on the nearby shore; foreground figures include pterosaurs fighting in the air above the sea and an ichthyosaur biting into the long neck of a plesiosaur.|The [[lithograph]] print of ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', made by Scharf based on De la Beche's original [[watercolour]]]]\nBy 1830, because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend the geologist Henry De la Beche assisted her by commissioning [[George Johann Scharf|Georg Scharf]] to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche's watercolour painting, ''[[Duria Antiquior]]'', portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was largely based on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to her. It became the first such scene from what later became known as [[deep time]] to be widely circulated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|1992|pp=42\u201347}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=139\u2013145}}</ref> In December 1830 she finally made another major find, a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur, which sold for \u00a3200.<ref name=\"Emling143\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=143}}</ref>\n\nIt was around this time that she switched from attending the local Congregational church, where she had been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning's gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was [[List of Christian thinkers in science|devoutly religious]], actively supported her new church as she had her old.<ref name=\"Emling143\"/>\n\nShe suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings, about \u00a3300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. [[Deborah Cadbury]] says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money,<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|p=231}}</ref> but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the British government to award her an [[Life annuity|annuity]], known as a [[Civil List pension|civil list pension]], in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The \u00a325 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=171\u2013172}}</ref>\n\n===Illness and death===\n[[File:MaryAnningGravestone.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo of upright gravestone|Gravestone of Anning and her brother Joseph in St Michael's churchyard]]\nAnning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847. Her work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness, and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of [[laudanum]] she was taking for the pain, there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brice|2001}}</ref> The regard in which she was held by the geological community was shown in 1846 when, upon learning of her cancer diagnosis, the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses and the council of the newly created [[Dorset County Museum]] made her an honorary member.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of [[Lyme Regis#Religion|St Michael's]], the local parish church.<ref name=\"TorrensODNB\">{{Harvnb|Torrens|2008}}</ref> Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained-glass window in her memory, unveiled in 1850.

These were honours normally only accorded to fellows of the society, which did not admit women until 1904. The eulogy began:\n\n<blockquote>I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without adverting to that of one, who though not placed among even the easier classes of society, but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour, yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great [[Enalio-Saurians]], and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ...<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YR0RAAAAIAAJ&pg=PR24 |title=Anniversary Address of the President |journal=The Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London |volume=4 |year=1848 |page=xxv |author=Anon}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Charles Dickens]] wrote an article about her life in February 1865 in his literary magazine ''[[All the Year Round]]'' that emphasised the difficulties she had overcome, especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople.

In 1811 (some sources say 1810 or 1809) her brother Joseph found a {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} skull, but failed to locate the rest of the animal.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\" /> After Joseph told her to look between the cliffs at Lyme Regis and Charmouth, Mary found the skeleton\u2014{{convert|17|ft|abbr=on}} long in all\u2014a few months later.

Its notoriety increased when [[Sir Everard Home, 1st Baronet|Sir Everard Home]] wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock's museum.<ref name=\"Home1814\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=33\u201341}}</ref> Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it was a kind of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the [[platypus|duck-billed platypus]] (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus.<ref name=\"Rudwick26-30\">{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=26\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"Home1819\">{{Harvnb|Home|1819}}</ref> By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name ''Ichthyosaurus'' (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck.

In 1821 [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] and Henry De la Beche, both members of the Geological Society of London, collaborated on a paper that analysed in detail the specimens found by Anning and others.

The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch.<ref>Evans, M., 2010, \"The roles played by museums, collections, and collectors in the early history of reptile palaeontology\", pp. 5-31 in: Richard Moody, E.

Geological Society of London</ref> Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821.

No records by Anning of the find are known.<ref name=\"McGowan 2001 23\u201326\">{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|pp=23\u201326}}</ref> The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.<ref name=\"Conybeare1821\"/><ref name=\"McGowan 2001 23\u201326\"/>\n\n[[File:Macrocephalus.jpg|thumb|left|alt1=Photo of cast of skeleton of creature with long curved neck, and paddles|Cast of ''[[Plesiosaurus macrocephalus]]'' found by Mary Anning in 1830, [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle]], Paris]]\nIn 1823, Anning discovered a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen BMNH 22656. When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and she had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare's presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=75}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Conybeare|1824}}</ref> The second fossil was named and described as ''Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus'' and is the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] ([[holotype]]) of this species, which itself is the [[type species]] of the [[genus]].\n\nConybeare's presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur's long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] when he reviewed Anning's drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning's ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier's accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nAnning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named ''Plesiosaurus macrocephalus'' by [[William Buckland]] and was described in an 1840 paper by [[Richard Owen]].<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it.<ref name=\"Emling143\"/>\n\n===Fossil fish and pterosaur===\n[[File:Pterodactylus macronyx.jpg|thumb|alt=sketch|The holotype specimen of ''[[Dimorphodon macronyx]]'' found by Mary Anning in 1828]]\nAnning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an unrivalled specimen of ''[[Dapedium|Dapedium politum]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Anonymous|1828}}</ref> This was a ray-finned fish, which would be described in 1828. In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a [[pterosaur]]. In 1829 William Buckland described it as ''Pterodactylus macronyx'' (later renamed ''[[Dimorphodon]] macronyx'' by Richard Owen), and unlike many other such occasions, Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper.\n\nIt was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, ''[[Squaloraja]]'', which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and [[Batoidea|rays]].<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/>\n\n===Invertebrates and trace fossils===\nVertebrate fossil finds, especially of [[Marine reptile|marine reptiles]], made Anning's reputation, but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 she discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a [[belemnoidea|belemnite]] fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]], which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil [[cephalopod]]s, and this led [[William Buckland]] to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do.<ref>{{Harvnb|McGowan|2001|p=20}}\n* {{Harvnb|Emling|2009|p=109}}</ref> It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as \"bezoar stones\" were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them [[coprolites]]. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\n==Impact and legacy==\n[[File:Duria Antiquior.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Watercolour of prehistoric animals and plants living in the sea and on the nearby shore; foreground figures include pterosaurs fighting in the air above the sea and an ichthyosaur byting into the long neck of a plesiosaur.|The geologist Henry De la Beche painted the influential watercolour ''Duria Antiquior'' in 1830 based largely on fossils found by Anning.<ref name=\"Rudwick154\"/>]]\n\nAnning's discoveries became key pieces of evidence for [[extinction]]. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of [[mammal]]s such as [[mammoth]]s. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct\u2014in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God's creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning, \u2014 some, such as the [[plesiosaur]], so unlike any known living creature \u2014 struck a major blow against this idea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=48\u201350, 88}}</ref>\n\nThe ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and [[pterosaur]] she found, along with the first [[dinosaur]] fossils which were discovered by [[Gideon Mantell]] and [[William Buckland]] during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier's: that there had been an \"[[Mesozoic|age of reptiles]]\" when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled \"The Age of Reptiles\" that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles has swarmed the land, air, and sea.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cadbury|2000|pp=171\u2013175}}</ref> These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. This discipline eventually came to be called [[paleontology|palaeontology]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=57\u201358, 72}}</ref> Illustrations of scenes from \"deep time\" (now known as [[palaeoart]]), such as Henry De la Beche's ground-breaking painting ''Duria Antiquior'', helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the [[food chain]] of the [[early Jurassic|Lias]] by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. The study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.<ref name=\"Rudwick154\">{{Harvnb|Rudwick|2008|pp=154\u2013158}}</ref>\n[[File:Mary Anning by B.

Forde and his ''The Heroine of Lyme Regis: The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist'' (1925), a number of writers saw Anning's life as inspirational. According to P.&nbsp;J.

Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in ''[[The French Lieutenant's Woman]]'' (1969) by [[John Fowles]], who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/> As her biographer Shelley Emling noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and [[Roderick Murchison]], who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, [[Louis Agassiz]]. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her\u2014''[[Acrodus anningiae]]'', and ''Belenostomus anningiae''\u2014and another after her friend [[Elizabeth Philpot]]. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834.<ref name=\"Emling169\">{{Harvnb|Emling|2009|pp=169\u2013170}}</ref> After her death, other species, including the [[ostracod]] ''Cytherelloidea anningi'', and two genera, the [[Therapsida|therapsid]] reptile genus ''Anningia'', and the [[Bivalvia|bivalve]] mollusc genus ''Anningella'', were named in her honour.<ref name=\"Torrens1995\"/><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Paleontology|contribution=ANNING, MARY |url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/routpaleont/anning_mary|format=CREDO subscription required|year=1999}}</ref> In 2012, the plesiosaur genus ''[[Anningasaura]]'' was named after her,<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Vincent | first1 = P. | last2 = Benson | first2 = R.
