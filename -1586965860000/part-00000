It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMBs]]) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. In 1999, HP split into two companies: one retaining the original company name, the other named [[Agilent Technologies]]. The first product line of Hewlett-Packard, test and measurement equipment, went to Agilent Technologies, while HP retained focus on its later products including computers and printers. In 2015, HP again was split into two separate companies, [[HP Inc.]] and [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]]. \n\nThe company was founded in a one-car garage in [[Palo Alto, California]] by [[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The [[HP Garage]] at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark and is marked with a plaque calling it the  \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\". The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' hugely successful animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. This success led Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on 1 January 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way which was adopted by other businesses worldwide.

It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMBs]]) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. In 1999, HP split into two companies: one retaining the original company name, the other named [[Agilent Technologies]]. The first product line of Hewlett-Packard, test and measurement equipment, went to Agilent Technologies, while HP retained focus on its later products including computers and printers. In 2015, HP again was split into two separate companies, [[HP Inc.]] and [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]]. \n\nThe company was founded in a one-car garage in [[Palo Alto, California]] by [[Bill Hewlett]] and [[David Packard]], and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The [[HP Garage]] at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark and is marked with a plaque calling it the  \"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\". The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of [[Walt Disney Pictures]]' hugely successful animated film ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''. This success led Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on 1 January 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way which was adopted by other businesses worldwide.

He is particularly noted for his appearances in 21 of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 30 films (more than any other actor), including as a lead actor in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950), ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952) and ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954).<ref>[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0155790.htm Takashi Shimura] on [[Japanese Movie Database|JMDB]]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nShimura was born in [[Ikuno]], [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]], Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_p.php?num_p=46229 |title=\u5fd7\u6751\u55ac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 \u6620\u753b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9 |publisher=allcinema |date= |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref> His birth-name was Shimazaki Sh\u014dji (\u5cf6\u5d0e\u6377\u723e). His forebears were members of the [[samurai]] class: in 1868 his grandfather took part in the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] during the [[Boshin War]]. Shimura entered Ikuno Primary School in 1911 and [[Kobe]] First Middle School in 1917. He missed two years of schooling because of a mild case of [[tuberculosis]], and subsequently moved to the prefectural middle school in [[Nobeoka]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], where his father had been transferred by his employer, Mitsubishi Mining. At Nobeoka Middle School, he excelled in English and became active on the literary society's magazine, to which he contributed poetry. He also became a star of the rowing club. In 1923, he entered [[Kansai University]], but after his father's retirement the family could no longer afford the fees for a full-time course and he switched to the part-time evening course in English literature, supporting himself by working at the [[Osaka]] municipal waterworks. Among the teachers in the English Literature Department were the playwright Toyo-oka Sa-ichir\u014d (\u8c4a\u5ca1\u4f50\u4e00\u90ce) and the Shakespeare scholar Tsubouchi Shik\u014d (\u576a\u5185\u58eb\u884c). These two inspired in Shimura an enthusiasm for drama. He joined the University's Theatre Studies Society and in 1928 formed an amateur theatrical group, the Shichigatsu-za (\u4e03\u6708\u5ea7) with Toyo-oka as director. He began to miss work because of the time he spent on theatrical activities and eventually lost his job. He then left university to try to earn a living in the theatre. The Shichigatsu-za turned professional and began to tour, but got into financial difficulties and folded.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter the failure of the Shichigatsu-za, Shimura went back to Osaka, where he began to get roles in radio plays. In 1930 he joined the Kindaiza (\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5ea7) theatre company and became a fully professional actor. He toured China and Japan with the Kindaiza, but in 1932 he left the company and returned again to Osaka, where he appeared with the Shinseigeki (\u65b0\u58f0\u5287) and Shinsenza (\u65b0\u9078\u5ea7) troupes. Talking pictures were just then coming in and Shimura realised they would provide opportunities for stage-trained actors. In 1932 he joined the [[Kyoto]] studios of the film production company [[Shink\u014d Kinema]]. He made his film debut in the 1934 silent ''Ren'ai-gai itch\u014dme'' (\u604b\u611b\u8857\u4e00\u4e01\u76ee: ''Number One, Love Street''). The first film in which he had a speaking part was the 1935 ''Ch\u016bji uridasu'' (\u5fe0\u6b21\u58f2\u51fa\u3059), directed by [[Mansaku Itami]]. His first substantial film role was as a detective in [[Mizoguchi Kenji]]'s 1936 ''Osaka Elegy'' (''Naniwa erejii''; \u6d6a\u83ef\u60b2\u6b4c).<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref>\n \n[[File:Ikiru 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shimura as a terminally ill bureaucrat in Kurosawa's ''[[Ikiru]]'']]\n\nThe film which established his reputation as a first-rate actor was Itami Mansaku's 1936 ''Akanishi Kakita'' (\u8d64\u897f\u8823\u592a: ''Capricious Young Man''). In 1937 he moved to [[Nikkatsu]] film corporation's Kyoto studios, and between then and 1942 appeared in nearly 100 films. His most notable role in these years was that of Keishir\u014d in the long-running series ''Umon Torimono-ch\u014d'' (\u53f3\u9580\u6355\u7269\u5e16), starring [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]]. He also demonstrated his considerable ability as a singer in the 1939 \"cine-operetta\", ''[[Singing Lovebirds]]''. During this time the political regime in Japan was growing ever more oppressive, and Shimura was arrested by the Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu]], known as Tokk\u014d) and held for about three weeks because of his earlier association with left-wing theatre groups. He was eventually released on the recognisance of his wife Masako and fellow-actor [[Ry\u016bnosuke Tsukigata]]. He is said to have made use of this experience later when playing a Tokk\u014d official in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1946 ''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]''. When Nikkatsu and [[Daiei]] merged in 1942, Shimura moved to the K\u014da Eiga studios and then in 1943 to [[Toho|T\u014dh\u014d]].<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> A few weeks before the end of the [[Pacific War]] in August 1945, Shimura's elder brother was killed in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1943, Shimura appeared as the old [[jujutsu]] teacher Murai Hansuke, a character based in the historical [[Hansuke Nakamura]], in Kurosawa's debut movie, ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]''.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> Along with [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]], Shimura is the actor most closely associated with Kurosawa: he eventually appeared in 21 of Kurosawa's 30 films. In fact, Kurosawa's cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from ''Sanshiro Sugata'' in 1943 to ''[[Kagemusha]]'' in 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948\u201365). Shimura's performances for Kurosawa included the doctor in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), the veteran detective in ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949), the flawed lawyer in ''[[Scandal (1950 film)|Scandal]]'' (1950), the woodcutter in ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952), and the lead samurai Kambei in ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954). Kurosawa wrote the part in ''Kagemusha'' specifically for Shimura, but the scenes were cut from the Western release, so many in the West did not know that he had been in the film. The DVD release of the film by [[The Criterion Collection]] restored Shimura's footage.\n\nShimura appeared in a number of T\u014dh\u014d ''[[kaiju]]'' (giant monster) and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' (special effects) films, many of which were directed by Kurosawa's good friend and colleague [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]. Shimura's roles included Professor Kyohei Yamane in the original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954), a character he briefly reprised in ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955).\n\n==Death==\nShimura died on February 11, 1982 in Tokyo, Japan, from [[emphysema]] at the age of 76.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> His effects were presented to the Film Centre of the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Number One, Love Street'' (1934) as Osachi's father\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi - Ranma hen'' (1935) as Santa\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi'' (1935)\n*''Ch\u00fbji uridasu'' (1935)\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi - Saiketsu hen'' (1936)\n*''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936) as Inspector\n*''Shura hakk\u014d: Dai-san-pen'' (1936)\n*''Ch\u00fbretsu nikudan sany\u00fbshi'' (1936)\n*''Akanishi Kakita'' (1936) as Taranoshin Tsunomata\n*''Seishun gonin otoko: Zempen'' (1937)\n*''Seishun gonin otoko: K\u014dhen'' (1937)\n*''Taki no shiraito'' (1937)\n*''Mitokomon kaikokuki'' (1937)\n*''Jiraiya'' (1937) as Gunday\u016b Yao\n*''Chikemuri Takadanobaba'' (1937) as Takusan\n*''The Skull Coin'' (1938)\n*''Kurama Tengu'' (1938) as Kichinosuke Saig\u014d\n*''Shamisen yakuza'' (1938) as Heisuke\n*''Yami no kageb\u014dshi'' (1938)\n*''Jigoku no mushi'' (1938)\n*''Akagaki Genz\u014d'' (1938) as J\u014dzaemon Sakaya\n*''Yajikita d\u014dch\u016bki'' (1938)\n*''Shusse taikoki'' (1938)\n*''Maz\u014d'' (1938)\n*''Zoku maz\u014d - Ibara Ukon'' (1939)\n*''Edo no akutar\u014d'' (1939)\n*''[[Singing Lovebirds]]'' (1939) as Ky\u014dsai Shimura\n*''Tsubanari ronin'' (1939) as Sherikov\n*''Shunj\u016b itt\u014dry\u016b'' (1939) as J\u016bbei Tamon\n*''Miyamoto Musashi: Dai-san-bu - Kenshin ichiro'' (1940)\n*''Zoku Shimizu minato'' (1940)\n*''Phantom Castle'' (1940)\n*''Oda Nobunaga'' (1940)\n*''Umi wo wataru sairei'' (1941)\n*''Sugata naki fukush\u016b'' (1941)\n*''Edo saigo no hi'' (1941)\n*''Miyamoto Musashi: Ichijoji ketto'' (1942)\n*''Hahakogusa'' (1942)\n*''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (1943, Kurosawa) as Hansuke Murai\n*''Himetaru kakugo'' (1943) as Ry\u014dkichi Ishikawa\n*''Kaigun'' (1943)\n*''Haha no kinembi'' (1943)\n*''Kato hayabusa sento-tai'' (1944)\n*''[[The Most Beautiful]]'' aka ''Most Beautifully'' (1944, Kurosawa) as Chief Goro Ishida\n*''Shibaid\u014d'' (1944)\n*''San-jaku sagohei'' (1944) as Yasukichi Ito\n*''Nichij\u014d no tatakai'' (1944)\n*''Tokkan ekich\u014d'' (1945)\n*''Ai to chikai'' (1945) as Murai's father, principle\n*''Kita no san-nin'' (1945) as Masaki\n*''Koi no fuunjii'' (1945) as Lieutenant Okamoto\n*''[[The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail]]'' (1945, Kurosawa) as Kataoka\n*''[[Minsh\u016b no Teki]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Those Who Make Tomorrow]]'' (1946) as Theatre manager\n*''Juichinin no jogakusei'' (1946)\n*''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]'' (1946, Kurosawa) as Police Commissioner 'Poison Strawberry' Dokuichigo\n*''[[Aru yo no Tonosama]]'' (1946)\n*''Yottsu no koi no monogatari'' (1947) as Masao's father (episode 1)\n*''Chikagai nijuyojikan'' (1947)\n*''[[Snow Trail]]'' (1947) as Nojiro\n*''Haru no mezame'' (1947) as Kenz\u014d Ogura\n*''Daini no jinsei'' (1948)\n*''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948, Kurosawa) as Doctor Sanada\n*''Onna no issho'' (1949)\n*''[[The Quiet Duel]]'' (1949, Kurosawa) as Dr. Konosuke Fujisaki\n*''Jigoku no kifujin'' (1949) as Chief of Police\n*''Mori no Ishimatsu'' (1949)\n*''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949, Kurosawa) as Detective Sato.

He is particularly noted for his appearances in 21 of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 30 films (more than any other actor), including as a lead actor in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950), ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952) and ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954).<ref>[http://www.jmdb.ne.jp/person/p0155790.htm Takashi Shimura] on [[JMDB]]</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nShimura was born in [[Ikuno]], [[Hy\u014dgo Prefecture]], Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allcinema.net/prog/show_p.php?num_p=46229 |title=\u5fd7\u6751\u55ac\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 \u6620\u753b\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf\u30d9\u30fc\u30b9 |publisher=allcinema |date= |accessdate=2020-03-11}}</ref> His birth-name was Shimazaki Sh\u014dji (\u5cf6\u5d0e\u6377\u723e). His forebears were members of the [[samurai]] class: in 1868 his grandfather took part in the [[Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi]] during the [[Boshin War]]. Shimura entered Ikuno Primary School in 1911 and [[Kobe]] First Middle School in 1917. He missed two years of schooling because of a mild case of [[tuberculosis]], and subsequently moved to the prefectural middle school in [[Nobeoka]], [[Miyazaki Prefecture]], where his father had been transferred by his employer, Mitsubishi Mining. At Nobeoka Middle School, he excelled in English and became active on the literary society's magazine, to which he contributed poetry. He also became a star of the rowing club. In 1923, he entered [[Kansai University]], but after his father's retirement the family could no longer afford the fees for a full-time course and he switched to the part-time evening course in English literature, supporting himself by working at the [[Osaka]] municipal waterworks. Among the teachers in the English Literature Department were the playwright Toyo-oka Sa-ichir\u014d (\u8c4a\u5ca1\u4f50\u4e00\u90ce) and the Shakespeare scholar Tsubouchi Shik\u014d (\u576a\u5185\u58eb\u884c). These two inspired in Shimura an enthusiasm for drama. He joined the University's Theatre Studies Society and in 1928 formed an amateur theatrical group, the Shichigatsu-za (\u4e03\u6708\u5ea7) with Toyo-oka as director. He began to miss work because of the time he spent on theatrical activities and eventually lost his job. He then left university to try to earn a living in the theatre. The Shichigatsu-za turned professional and began to tour, but got into financial difficulties and folded.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter the failure of the Shichigatsu-za, Shimura went back to Osaka, where he began to get roles in radio plays. In 1930 he joined the Kindaiza (\u8fd1\u4ee3\u5ea7) theatre company and became a fully professional actor. He toured China and Japan with the Kindaiza, but in 1932 he left the company and returned again to Osaka, where he appeared with the Shinseigeki (\u65b0\u58f0\u5287) and Shinsenza (\u65b0\u9078\u5ea7) troupes. Talking pictures were just then coming in and Shimura realised they would provide opportunities for stage-trained actors. In 1932 he joined the [[Kyoto]] studios of the film production company [[Shink\u014d Kinema]]. He made his film debut in the 1934 silent ''Ren'ai-gai itch\u014dme'' (\u604b\u611b\u8857\u4e00\u4e01\u76ee: ''Number One, Love Street''). The first film in which he had a speaking part was the 1935 ''Ch\u016bji uridasu'' (\u5fe0\u6b21\u58f2\u51fa\u3059), directed by [[Mansaku Itami]]. His first substantial film role was as a detective in [[Mizoguchi Kenji]]'s 1936 ''Osaka Elegy'' (''Naniwa erejii''; \u6d6a\u83ef\u60b2\u6b4c).<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref>\n \n[[File:Ikiru 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Shimura as a terminally ill bureaucrat in Kurosawa's ''[[Ikiru]]'']]\n\nThe film which established his reputation as a first-rate actor was Itami Mansaku's 1936 ''Akanishi Kakita'' (\u8d64\u897f\u8823\u592a: ''Capricious Young Man''). In 1937 he moved to [[Nikkatsu]] film corporation's Kyoto studios, and between then and 1942 appeared in nearly 100 films. His most notable role in these years was that of Keishir\u014d in the long-running series ''Umon Torimono-ch\u014d'' (\u53f3\u9580\u6355\u7269\u5e16), starring [[Kanj\u016br\u014d Arashi]]. He also demonstrated his considerable ability as a singer in the 1939 \"cine-operetta\", ''[[Singing Lovebirds]]''. During this time the political regime in Japan was growing ever more oppressive, and Shimura was arrested by the Special Higher Police ([[Tokubetsu K\u014dt\u014d Keisatsu]], known as Tokk\u014d) and held for about three weeks because of his earlier association with left-wing theatre groups. He was eventually released on the recognisance of his wife Masako and fellow-actor [[Ry\u016bnosuke Tsukigata]]. He is said to have made use of this experience later when playing a Tokk\u014d official in [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1946 ''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]''. When Nikkatsu and [[Daiei]] merged in 1942, Shimura moved to the K\u014da Eiga studios and then in 1943 to [[Toho|T\u014dh\u014d]].<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> A few weeks before the end of the [[Pacific War]] in August 1945, Shimura's elder brother was killed in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1943, Shimura appeared as the old [[jujutsu]] teacher Murai Hansuke, a character based in the historical [[Hansuke Nakamura]], in Kurosawa's debut movie, ''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]''.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> Along with [[Toshir\u014d Mifune]], Shimura is the actor most closely associated with Kurosawa: he eventually appeared in 21 of Kurosawa's 30 films. In fact, Kurosawa's cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from ''Sanshiro Sugata'' in 1943 to ''[[Kagemusha]]'' in 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948\u201365). Shimura's performances for Kurosawa included the doctor in ''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948), the veteran detective in ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949), the flawed lawyer in ''[[Scandal (1950 film)|Scandal]]'' (1950), the woodcutter in ''[[Rashomon]]'' (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in ''[[Ikiru]]'' (1952), and the lead samurai Kambei in ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954). Kurosawa wrote the part in ''Kagemusha'' specifically for Shimura, but the scenes were cut from the Western release, so many in the West did not know that he had been in the film. The DVD release of the film by [[The Criterion Collection]] restored Shimura's footage.\n\nShimura appeared in a number of T\u014dh\u014d ''[[kaiju]]'' (giant monster) and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' (special effects) films, many of which were directed by Kurosawa's good friend and colleague [[Ishir\u014d Honda]]. Shimura's roles included Professor Kyohei Yamane in the original ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' (1954), a character he briefly reprised in ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'' (1955).\n\n==Death==\nShimura died on February 11, 1982 in Tokyo, Japan, from [[emphysema]] at the age of 76.<ref name=\"Kodansha-EoJ\">Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). \u2014 Kodansha Ltd, 1999. \u2014 {{ISBN|978-4062099370}}.</ref> His effects were presented to the Film Centre of the [[National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo]].\n\n==Filmography==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*''Number One, Love Street'' (1934) as Osachi's father\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi - Ranma hen'' (1935) as Santa\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi'' (1935)\n*''Ch\u00fbji uridasu'' (1935)\n*''Umon torimonoch\u014d: Harebare goj\u00fbsantsugi - Saiketsu hen'' (1936)\n*''[[Osaka Elegy]]'' (1936) as Inspector\n*''Shura hakk\u014d: Dai-san-pen'' (1936)\n*''Ch\u00fbretsu nikudan sany\u00fbshi'' (1936)\n*''Akanishi Kakita'' (1936) as Taranoshin Tsunomata\n*''Seishun gonin otoko: Zempen'' (1937)\n*''Seishun gonin otoko: K\u014dhen'' (1937)\n*''Taki no shiraito'' (1937)\n*''Mitokomon kaikokuki'' (1937)\n*''Jiraiya'' (1937) as Gunday\u016b Yao\n*''Chikemuri Takadanobaba'' (1937) as Takusan\n*''The Skull Coin'' (1938)\n*''Kurama Tengu'' (1938) as Kichinosuke Saig\u014d\n*''Shamisen yakuza'' (1938) as Heisuke\n*''Yami no kageb\u014dshi'' (1938)\n*''Jigoku no mushi'' (1938)\n*''Akagaki Genz\u014d'' (1938) as J\u014dzaemon Sakaya\n*''Yajikita d\u014dch\u016bki'' (1938)\n*''Shusse taikoki'' (1938)\n*''Maz\u014d'' (1938)\n*''Zoku maz\u014d - Ibara Ukon'' (1939)\n*''Edo no akutar\u014d'' (1939)\n*''[[Singing Lovebirds]]'' (1939) as Ky\u014dsai Shimura\n*''Tsubanari ronin'' (1939) as Sherikov\n*''Shunj\u016b itt\u014dry\u016b'' (1939) as J\u016bbei Tamon\n*''Miyamoto Musashi: Dai-san-bu - Kenshin ichiro'' (1940)\n*''Zoku Shimizu minato'' (1940)\n*''Phantom Castle'' (1940)\n*''Oda Nobunaga'' (1940)\n*''Umi wo wataru sairei'' (1941)\n*''Sugata naki fukush\u016b'' (1941)\n*''Edo saigo no hi'' (1941)\n*''Miyamoto Musashi: Ichijoji ketto'' (1942)\n*''Hahakogusa'' (1942)\n*''[[Sanshiro Sugata]]'' (1943, Kurosawa) as Hansuke Murai\n*''Himetaru kakugo'' (1943) as Ry\u014dkichi Ishikawa\n*''Kaigun'' (1943)\n*''Haha no kinembi'' (1943)\n*''Kato hayabusa sento-tai'' (1944)\n*''[[The Most Beautiful]]'' aka ''Most Beautifully'' (1944, Kurosawa) as Chief Goro Ishida\n*''Shibaid\u014d'' (1944)\n*''San-jaku sagohei'' (1944) as Yasukichi Ito\n*''Nichij\u014d no tatakai'' (1944)\n*''Tokkan ekich\u014d'' (1945)\n*''Ai to chikai'' (1945) as Murai's father, principle\n*''Kita no san-nin'' (1945) as Masaki\n*''Koi no fuunjii'' (1945) as Lieutenant Okamoto\n*''[[The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail]]'' (1945, Kurosawa) as Kataoka\n*''[[Minsh\u016b no Teki]]'' (1946)\n*''[[Those Who Make Tomorrow]]'' (1946) as Theatre manager\n*''Juichinin no jogakusei'' (1946)\n*''[[No Regrets for Our Youth]]'' (1946, Kurosawa) as Police Commissioner 'Poison Strawberry' Dokuichigo\n*''[[Aru yo no Tonosama]]'' (1946)\n*''Yottsu no koi no monogatari'' (1947) as Masao's father (episode 1)\n*''Chikagai nijuyojikan'' (1947)\n*''[[Snow Trail]]'' (1947) as Nojiro\n*''Haru no mezame'' (1947) as Kenz\u014d Ogura\n*''Daini no jinsei'' (1948)\n*''[[Drunken Angel]]'' (1948, Kurosawa) as Doctor Sanada\n*''Onna no issho'' (1949)\n*''[[The Quiet Duel]]'' (1949, Kurosawa) as Dr. Konosuke Fujisaki\n*''Jigoku no kifujin'' (1949) as Chief of Police\n*''Mori no Ishimatsu'' (1949)\n*''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'' (1949, Kurosawa) as Detective Sato.
