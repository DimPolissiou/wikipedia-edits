The first projects executed by the partners was a storage area for printing machines constructed in the basement of a building in Cairo, followed by the design of a pharmacological factory. In the 1950s, the partners made their entry into the field of bridge design, for which they later became widely known. By the 1970s, the company witnessed a regional expansion. In 1970, the first phase of the 6th of October Bridge was opened. This bridge, which is considered the main artery of the Egyptian capital, was the first [[prestressed concrete]] bridge to be entirely designed, constructed and the construction supervised by Egyptian firms - ACE Moharram Bakhoum was the designer and construction supervisor. By this time, ACE had been involved in numerous high-profile projects in Egypt and the Middle East region, and the expansion of its activities to include other disciplines was necessary.\n\n== Significant projects ==\nExamples of significant projects designed, managed, or supervised by ACE Moharram Bakhoum:\n\n* [[6th October Bridge]].<ref>{{Citation|title=6th October Bridge|date=2019-09-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=6th_October_Bridge&oldid=918292705|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n* Greater Cairo Metro Lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alkhabbar.com/archives/110109|title=\u0645\u062d\u0641\u0648\u0638\" \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0626\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062d\u0632\u0628 \" \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0648\u0637\u0646 \" \u0648 \"\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a\" \u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 ( \u0633\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627- \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u2013 \u0628\u0627\u062e\u0648\u0645) \u064a\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u062e\u0637 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628/\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631|last=Ibrahim|first=Samia|website=\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631|language=ar|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Cairo Metro|date=2020-02-20|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cairo_Metro&oldid=941763257|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n* $1-billion road and railway tunnel project under the Suez Canal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/projects/2019/10/sponsored-content-canadian-xypex-water-proofing-product-helps-egypt-to-complete-landmark-tunnel-project-under-suez-canal|title=Sponsored Content: Canadian Xypex water-proofing product helps Egypt to complete landmark tunnel project under Suez Canal -

The first projects executed by the partners was a storage area for printing machines constructed in the basement of a building in Cairo, followed by the design of a pharmacological factory. In the 1950s, the partners made their entry into the field of bridge design, for which they later became widely known. By the 1970s, the company witnessed a regional expansion. In 1970, the first phase of the 6th of October Bridge was opened. This bridge, which is considered the main artery of the Egyptian capital, was the first [[prestressed concrete]] bridge to be entirely designed, constructed and the construction supervised by Egyptian firms - ACE Moharram Bakhoum was the designer and construction supervisor. By this time, ACE had been involved in numerous high-profile projects in Egypt and the Middle East region, and the expansion of its activities to include other disciplines was necessary.\n\n== Significant projects ==\nExamples of significant projects designed, managed, or supervised by ACE Moharram Bakhoum:\n\n* [[6th October Bridge]].<ref>{{Citation|title=6th October Bridge|date=2019-09-27|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=6th_October_Bridge&oldid=918292705|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n* Greater Cairo Metro Lines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alkhabbar.com/archives/110109|title=\u0645\u062d\u0641\u0648\u0638\" \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u0627\u0639\u062f \u0644\u0644\u0634\u0626\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0644\u062d\u0632\u0628 \" \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0648\u0637\u0646 \" \u0648 \"\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0634\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0646\u0633\u064a\" \u0634\u0631\u0643\u0629 ( \u0633\u064a\u0633\u062a\u0631\u0627- \u0645\u062d\u0631\u0645 \u2013 \u0628\u0627\u062e\u0648\u0645) \u064a\u0639\u0627\u064a\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062f\u062e\u0637 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0641\u0627\u0642 \u0625\u0644\u064a \u0642\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0628/\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631|last=Ibrahim|first=Samia|website=\u0627\u0644\u062e\u0628\u0631|language=ar|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Cairo Metro|date=2020-02-20|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cairo_Metro&oldid=941763257|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n* $1-billion road and railway tunnel project under the Suez Canal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/projects/2019/10/sponsored-content-canadian-xypex-water-proofing-product-helps-egypt-to-complete-landmark-tunnel-project-under-suez-canal|title=Sponsored Content: Canadian Xypex water-proofing product helps Egypt to complete landmark tunnel project under Suez Canal - constructconnect.com|date=2019-10-18|website=Journal Of Commerce|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n* Rod el Farag Bridge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arabcont.com/project-555|title=\u0645\u062d\u0648\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u062c \"\u0643\u0648\u0628\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u062d\u064a\u0627 \u0645\u0635\u0631\" {{!}} \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628|website=arabcont.com|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> which won the Guinness Book of World Records\u2019 certificate for being the world's widest cable-stayed bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.middleeastarchitect.com/insight/43125-rod-el-farag-axis-bridge-in-egypt-receives-guinness-world-record-title|title=Rod El-Farag Axis Bridge in Egypt receives Guinness World Record title|website=Middle  East Architect|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n*[[File:Panorma Cairo Stadium.jpg|thumb|Cairo International Stadium]][[Luxor International Airport]].\n* [[Cairo International Stadium]].\n* [[Grand Egyptian Museum]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n* Sphinx float glass factory (1.2 Billion EGP project)[https://eklutdvotyzsri.dailynewssegypt.com/2009/12/21/ace-sees-more-opportunities-in-development/ ACE sees more opportunities in development].\n* Egyptian-German Telecommunication Plant.\n* Egyptian Cement Company Plant.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Engineering companies of Egypt]]\n", "name_user": "Ibrahimsabotaleb120", "label": "safe", "comment": "located the logo inside the infobox", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACE_Moharram_Bakhoum"}
