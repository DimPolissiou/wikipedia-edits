Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"WJ1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"WJ2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"WJ3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"WJ4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"WJ4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St&nbsp;Andrew's Church, Donhead St&nbsp;Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}  A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} They had a single daughter together, born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]]. Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A.

Revolutionary Wars]] and the first years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"WJ1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"WJ2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"WJ3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803.

He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port.

Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"WJ4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"WJ4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St&nbsp;Andrew's Church, Donhead St&nbsp;Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}  A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} They had a single daughter together, born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]]. Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]].\n{{refend}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist\n| colwidth = 25em\n| refs = 33em\n  <ref name=\"JH:45\">[[#CITEREFHenderson1994|Henderson]], p. 45.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"WJ1:126\">[[#CITEREFJames2002|James]], Vol. 1, p. 126.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"WJ2:80\">[[#CITEREFJames2002|James]], Vol. 2, p. 80.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"WJ3:136\">[[#CITEREFJames2002|James]], Vol. 3, p. 136.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"WJ4:52\">[[#CITEREFJames2002|James]], Vol. 4, p. 52.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"ODNB\">[[#CITEREFLaughton2004|Laughton]]</ref>\n  <ref name=\"NT:95\">[[#CITEREFTracy2006|Tracy]], p. 95.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"NT:96\">[[#CITEREFTracy2006|Tracy]], p. 96.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"CW:47\">[[#CITEREFWhite2005|White]], p. 47.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"CW:48\">[[#CITEREFWhite2005|White]], p. 48.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"CW:49\">[[#CITEREFWhite2005|White]], p. 49.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"CW:52\">[[#CITEREFWhite2005|White]], p. 52.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"Baptism\">[[#CITEREFBaptism1762|Saint Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms 1762]], p. 85.</ref>\n  <ref name=\"National Archives\">{{UK National Archives ID|id=F45021|name=John Cooke|accessdate=12 April 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{Cite book\n | last = Henderson\n | first = James\n | authorlink = \n | year = 1994\n | origyear = 1970\n | chapter = \n | title = The Frigates: An account of the lighter warships of the Napoleonic wars 1793-1815\n | publisher = [[Leo Cooper]]\n | location = London\n | language = English\n | isbn = 978-0-85052-432-1\n | oclc = 1023686570\n | url-access = registration\n | url = https://archive.org/details/frigatesaccounto0000hend\n | ref = harv\n }}\n* {{Cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002\n | origyear = 1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain: During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, Volumes 1-6, 1793-1827\n | publisher = [[Conway Publishing|Conway Maritime Press]]\n | location = London\n | isbn = 978-0-85177-905-8\n | oclc = 265568758\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last = Tracy\n | first = Nicholas\n | authorlink =\n | year = 2006\n | origyear =\n | chapter =\n | title = Who's Who in Nelson's Navy: 200 Naval Heroes\n | publisher = [[Chatham Publishing]]\n | location = London\n | language=English\n | isbn = 978-1-86176-244-3\n | oclc = 62306661\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n | last = White\n | first = Colin\n | authorlink = Colin White (historian)\n | others = The [[1805 Club]]\n | year = 2005\n | origyear =\n | chapter =\n | title = The Trafalgar Captains: Their Lives and Memorials\n | publisher = [[Chatham Publishing]]\n | location = London\n | language = English\n | isbn = 978-1-86176-247-4\n | oclc = 469507654\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{Cite web\n | title = Cooke, John (1763\u20131805), naval officer\n | last1 = Laughton\n | first1 = John Knox\n | authorlink1 = John Knox Laughton\n | others = Revised by [[Andrew Lambert]]\n | year = 2004\n | website = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]\n | url = https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-6171\n | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/6171\n | language=English\n | accessdate = 12 April 2020\n | url-status = live\n | url-access = subscription\n | ref = harv\n}}\n* {{cite archive\n | item = Register of Baptisms\n | item-url = https://search.lma.gov.uk/scripts/mwimain.dll/144/LMA_OPAC/web_detail?SESSIONSEARCH&exp=refd%20P93/MRY1/010\n | item-id = P93/Mry1/010 (Microfilm Reference X024/088)\n | type = Microfilm\n | date = 5 March 1762\n | series = Church of England Parish Registers, 1538 to 1812, London, England\n | file = February 1758 to October 1774\n | collection = Saint Mary, Whitechapel, Whitechapel High Street, Tower Hamlets\n | repository = [[London Metropolitan Archives]]\n | institution = [[City of London Corporation]]\n | location = 40 Northampton Road, London, England\n | ref = {{sfnref|Baptism|1762}} }}\n\n{{Good article}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cooke, John}}\n[[Category:1762 births]]\n[[Category:1805 deaths]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy officers]]\n[[Category:British military personnel killed in action in the Napoleonic Wars]]\n[[Category:People who died at sea]]\n[[Category:Burials at sea]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy captains at the Battle of Trafalgar]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "name_user": "Gricharduk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCitations:Adding a full stop to the ODNB reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cooke_(Royal_Navy_officer)"}

In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W. Marvin |title=Black Police in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaseH2ICEX4C|year=1996|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21040-2|page=21}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"police\" comes from the Greek {{lang|el|politeia}}, meaning [[government]], which came to mean its civil administration. The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, an average police officer's salary is between $53,561 and $64,581 in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.policeteststudyguide.com/police-officer-salaries-in-the-us/ |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police Test Study Guide |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]]. On August 6, 2019, [[New Jersey Attorney General]] [[Gurbir Grewal]] announced creation of the first U.S. statewide program to support the [[mental health]] of police officers. The goal of the program would be to train officers in emotional resiliency and to help destigmatize mental health issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/37-nj-officers-have-killed-themselves-since-2016-ag-hopes-new-plan-will-prevent-suicides.html|title=37 N.J. officers have killed themselves since 2016.

In most countries, \"police officer\" is a generic term not specifying a particular rank. In some, the use of the rank \"officer\" is legally reserved for military personnel.\n\nPolice officers are generally charged with the apprehension of [[criminal]]s and the prevention and detection of [[crime]], protection and assistance of the general public, and the maintenance of public order. Police officers may be sworn to an [[Police oath|oath]], and have the power to [[arrest]] people and [[police custody|detain them]] for a limited time, along with other duties and powers. Some officers are trained in special duties, such as [[counter-terrorism]], [[surveillance]], [[child protection]], [[Very Important Person|VIP]] [[Protective security units|protection]], [[Civil law (common law)|civil law enforcement]], and investigation techniques into major crime including [[fraud]], [[rape]], [[murder]], and [[drug trafficking]]. Although many police officers wear a corresponding uniform, some police officers are plain-clothed in order to pass themselves off as civilians. In most countries police officers are given exemptions from certain laws to perform their duties. For example an officer may use force if necessary to arrest or detain a person when it would ordinarily be assault. In some countries, officers can also break road rules to perform their duties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dulaney, W. Marvin |title=Black Police in America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaseH2ICEX4C|year=1996|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21040-2|page=21}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word \"police\" comes from the Greek {{lang|el|politeia}}, meaning [[government]], which came to mean its civil administration. The more general term for the function is [[law enforcement officer]] or peace officer. A [[sheriff]] is typically the top police officer of a county, with that word coming from the person enforcing law over a [[shire]]. A person who has been deputized to serve the function of the sheriff is referred to as the deputy.\n\nPolice officers are those empowered by government to enforce the laws it creates. In ''[[The Federalist]]'' collection of articles and essays, [[James Madison]] wrote: \"[[:s:The Federalist (Dawson)/50|If men were angels, no Government would be necessary]]\". These words apply to those who serve government, including police. {{anchor|cop}}A common nickname for a police officer is \"cop\"; derived from the verb sense \"to arrest\", itself derived from \"to grab\". Thus, \"someone who captures\", a \"copper\", was shortened to just \"cop\".<ref>{{cite book|last = Dalzell|first = T.|date = 2007|title = Concise New Partridge Dictionary of Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = New York|publisher = [[Routledge]]|page = 162|isbn = 9780415212595}}</ref> It may also find its origin in the Latin {{lang|la|capere}}, brought to English via the [[Old French]] {{lang|fr|caper}}.<ref>{{cite book|last = Partridge|first = E.|authorlink = Eric Partridge|date = 1972|title = A Dictionary of Historical Slang|titlelink = A Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|location = London|publisher = [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn = 9780140510461|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/lenglish00eric}}</ref>\n\n==Duties and functions==\nResponsibilities of a police officer are varied, and may differ greatly from within one political context to another. Typical duties relate to keeping the peace, law enforcement, protection of people and property and the investigation of crimes. Officers are expected to respond to a variety of situations that may arise while they are on duty. Rules and guidelines dictate how an officer should behave within the community, and in many contexts, restrictions are placed on what the uniformed officer wears. In some countries, [[rule making|rules and procedures]] dictate that a police officer is obliged to intervene in a criminal incident, even if they are off-duty. Police officers in nearly all countries retain their lawful powers while off duty.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://education-portal.com/articles/Police_Officer_Educational_Requirements_for_Police_Officers.html |title=Educational Requirements for Police Officers |work=education-portal.com |year=2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority of [[Western world|Western]] legal systems, the major role of the police is to maintain order, keeping the peace through surveillance of the public, and the subsequent reporting and apprehension of suspected violators of the law. They also function to [[Deterrence (psychology)|discourage]] crimes through high-visibility policing, and most police forces have an investigative capability. Police have the legal authority to arrest and detain, usually granted by magistrates. Police officers also respond to emergency calls, along with routine [[community policing]].\n\nPolice are often used as an [[emergency service]] and may provide a public safety function at large gatherings, as well as in emergencies, [[Emergency preparedness|disasters]], [[search and rescue]] situations, and [[Car accident|road traffic collisions]]. To provide a prompt response in emergencies, the police often coordinate their operations with [[firefighting|fire]] and [[emergency medical service]]s. In some countries, individuals serve jointly as police officers as well as firefighters (creating the role of [[fire police]]). In many countries, there is a common [[emergency service number]] that allows the police, firefighters, or medical services to be summoned to an emergency. Some countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have outlined command procedures, for the use in major emergencies or disorder. The [[Gold Silver Bronze command structure]] is a system set up to improve communications between ground-based officers and the control room, typically, Bronze Commander would be a senior officer on the ground, coordinating the efforts in the center of the emergency, Silver Commanders would be positioned in an 'Incident Control Room' erected to improve better communications at the scene, and a Gold Commander who would be in the Control Room.\n\nPolice are also responsible for reprimanding minor offenders by issuing [[summons|citations]] which typically may result in the imposition of [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], particularly for violations of [[traffic]] law. Traffic enforcement is often and effectively accomplished by police officers on [[motorcycle]]s\u2014called ''motor officers,'' these officers refer to the motorcycles they ride on duty as simply ''motors.'' Police are also trained to assist persons in distress, such as motorists whose car has broken down and people experiencing a medical emergency. Police are typically trained in basic [[first aid]] such as [[CPR]].\n\nSome [[park ranger]]s are commissioned as law enforcement officers and carry out a law-enforcement role within [[national park]]s and other back-country wilderness and recreational areas, whereas [[Military police]] perform law enforcement functions within the military.\n\n==Entry and promotion qualifications==\nIn most countries, candidates for the police force must have completed some formal education.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://study.com/requirements_to_become_a_police_officer.html|title=Requirements to Become a Police Officer|publisher=}}</ref> Increasing numbers of people are joining the police force who possess [[tertiary education]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://learn.org/articles/What_is_Tertiary_Education.html|title=What Is Tertiary Education?|publisher=}}</ref> and in response to this many police forces have developed a \"fast-track\" scheme whereby those with [[university degree]]s spend two to three years as a [[Constable]] before receiving promotion to higher ranks, such as [[Sergeant]]s or [[Inspector]]s. (Officers who work within investigative divisions or plainclothes are not necessarily of a higher rank but merely have different duties.){{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Police officers are also recruited from those with experience in the military or security services. In the United States [[U.S. state|state]] laws may [[Codification (law)|codify]] statewide qualification standards regarding age, education, criminal record, and training but in other places requirements are set by local police agencies. Each local Police agency has different requirements. \n[[File:Pol mun agenti.jpg|thumb|Officers of the [[Municipal police (Italy)|Polizia Municipale]] from [[Piacenza]], [[Italy]]]]\nPromotion is not automatic and usually requires the candidate to pass some kind of examination, interview board or other selection procedure. Although promotion normally includes an increase in [[salary]], it also brings with it an increase in responsibility and for most, an increase in administrative paperwork. There is no stigma attached to this, as experienced line patrol officers are highly regarded.\n\nDependent upon each agency, but generally after completing two years of service, officers may apply for specialist positions, such as [[detective]], [[police dog]] handler, [[mounted police]] officer, [[motorcycle]] officer, [[water police]] officer, or [[firearms officer]] (in countries where police are not routinely armed).\n\nIn some countries, including [[Singapore]], police ranks are supplemented through [[conscription]], similar to [[national service]] in the military. Qualifications may thus be relaxed or enhanced depending on the target mix of conscripts. Conscripts face tougher physical requirements in areas such as eyesight, but minimum academic qualification requirements are less stringent. Some join as volunteers, again via differing qualification requirements.\n\n==Pay==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}\nIn some societies, police officers are paid relatively well compared to other occupations; their pay depends on what rank they are within their police force and how many years they have served.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.police-information.co.uk/policepay.htm |title=Police Pay |publisher=Police-information.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}</ref>\nIn the United States, a police officer's salary averaged $61,230 in 2015. In the United Kingdom for the year 2015\u201316 a police officer's average salary was \u00a330,901.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n== Occupational safety and health ==\n{{main article|Police officer safety and health}}There are numerous issues affecting the [[Occupational safety and health|safety and health]] of police officers, including line of duty deaths and [[occupational stress]]. On August 6, 2019, [[New Jersey Attorney General]] [[Gurbir Grewal]] announced creation of the first U.S. statewide program to support the [[mental health]] of police officers. The goal of the program would be to train officers in emotional resiliency and to help destigmatize mental health issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nj.com/news/2019/08/37-nj-officers-have-killed-themselves-since-2016-ag-hopes-new-plan-will-prevent-suicides.html|title=37 N.J. officers have killed themselves since 2016.

The period is generally considered to span the 1947 [[Truman Doctrine]] to the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The term \"[[Cold war (general term)|cold]]\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two [[superpowers]], but they each supported major regional conflicts known as [[Proxy war|proxy wars]]. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|victory]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The United States, the Soviet Union and the geopolitical implications of the origins of the Cold War|last=Lewkowicz, Nicolas|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78308-799-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1061862862}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Px4uDwAAQBAJ|title=Geopolitics: From the Cold War to the 21st Century|last=Sempa|first=Francis|date=2017-07-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-51768-3|language=en}}</ref> The doctrine of [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) discouraged [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|a pre-emptive attack]] by either side.

The US government [[United States involvement in regime change#Cold War|supported right-wing governments and uprisings]] across the world, while the Soviet government [[Russia involvement in regime change#1941\u20131953|funded communist parties and revolutions]] around the world. As nearly all the colonial states [[Decolonization#The emergence of the Third World (1945\u2013present)|achieved independence in the period 1945\u20131960]], they became [[Third World]] battlefields in the Cold War.\n\n[[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|The first phase]] of the Cold War began immediately after the end of the [[WWII|Second World War]] in 1945. The United States [[North Atlantic Treaty|created]] the [[NATO]] military alliance in 1949 in apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed [[Foreign policy of the United States|their global policy]] against Soviet influence ''[[containment]]''. The Soviet Union formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1955 in response to NATO. Major crises of this phase included the 1948\u201349 [[Berlin Blockade]], the 1927\u201350 [[Chinese Civil War]], the 1950\u201353 [[Korean War]], the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] and the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The USSR and the US competed for influence in [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Decolonisation of Africa#Timeline|decolonizing states of Africa]] and [[Asia]]. \n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis, [[Cold War (1962\u20131979)|a new phase began]] that saw the [[Sino-Soviet split]] between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater autonomy of action. The USSR [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded Czechoslovakia]] to suppress the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], while the US experienced internal turmoil from the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 1960s\u201370s, an international [[peace movement]] took root among citizens around the world. [[Anti-nuclear movement|Movements]] against [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear arms testing]] and for [[nuclear disarmament]] took place, with large [[anti-war protests]]. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of [[d\u00e9tente]] that saw the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] and the US [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|opening relations]] with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a strategic counterweight to the USSR. \n\nD\u00e9tente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in 1979. The [[Cold War (1979\u20131985)|early 1980s]] were another period of elevated tension. The United States increased [[Reagan Doctrine|diplomatic, military, and economic pressures]] on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. [[Cold War (1985\u20131991)|In the mid-1980s]], the new Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\", c. 1985) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"reorganization\", 1987) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer. The result in 1989 was a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of revolutions]] that (with the exception of [[Romanian Revolution|Romania]]) peacefully overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|abortive coup attempt]] in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|its constituent republics]] and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's only superpower.\n\nThe Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to [[Culture during the Cold War|in popular culture]], especially with themes of espionage (and the threat of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, a renewed state of tension between the Soviet Union's successor state, [[Russia]], and the United States in the 21st century (including its [[Western world|Western]] allies) as well as growing tension between an increasingly powerful China and the U.S. and its Western allies have each been referred to as the [[Cold War II|Second Cold War]].{{sfn|Syria crisis|2018}}\n\n==Origins of the term==\n{{Main|Cold war (general term)}}\nAt the end of World War II, English writer [[George Orwell]] used ''[[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]'', as a general term, in his essay \"You and the Atomic Bomb\", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of [[nuclear warfare]], Orwell looked at [[James Burnham]]'s predictions of a polarized world, writing:\n\n{{quote|Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery...

In March 1939 Britain and France\u2014without consulting the USSR\u2014granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the [[Munich Agreement]].

Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its [[Lend-Lease]] Program.{{sfn|Herring|1973}} However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|pp=151\u201353}}\n\n==End of World War II (1945\u20131947)==\n\n===Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe===\n{{Further|Tehran Conference|Yalta Conference|List of Allied World War II conferences}}\nThe Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13\u201323}} Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13\u201323}} Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through [[international organization]]s.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|p=156}} Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world.

With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors.\n\nThe differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the \"[[percentages agreement]]\" to divide the [[Balkans]] into respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]], including giving Stalin predominance [[Romania in World War II|over Romania]] and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche [[White Terror (Greece)|over Greece.]] At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations.{{sfn|Plokhy|2010}} Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement,{{sfn|Carlton|2000}}{{sfn|Todd|2016|pp=105\u2013111}} but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|Post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation zones in Germany]]]]\n\nAt the [[Second Quebec Conference]], a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12\u201316 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]'s original proposal.

He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city. According to [[John Lewis Gaddis]], Khrushchev rejected Stalin's \"belief in the inevitability of war,\" however. The new leader declared his ultimate goal was \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\".{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=70}} In Krushchev's formulation, peace would allow capitalism to collapse on its own,{{sfn|Perlmutter|1997|p=145}} as well as giving the Soviets time to boost their military capabilities,{{sfn|Nj\u00f8lstad|2004|p=136}} which remained for decades until Gorbachev's later \"new thinking\" envisioning peaceful coexistence as an end in itself rather than a form of class struggle.{{sfn| Breslauer|2002|p=72}}\n\nThe events in Hungary produced ideological fractures within the communist parties of the world, particularly in Western Europe, with great decline in membership as many in both western and communist countries felt disillusioned by the brutal Soviet response.{{sfn|Lendvai|2008|p=196}} The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician [[Milovan Djilas|Milovan \u0110ilas]] who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that \"The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed\".{{sfn|Lendvai|2008|p=196}}\n\n===Berlin ultimatum===\n{{Main|Berlin Crisis of 1961#Berlin ultimatum|European integration}}\nDuring November 1958, Khrushchev made an unsuccessful attempt to turn all of Berlin into an independent, demilitarized \"free city\".

Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism. President Eisenhower's [[New Look (policy)|New Look]] policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to [[Deterrence theory|deter]] Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks all of the Soviet Union. Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money. Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as [[flexible response]]. This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals. As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the [[United States special operations forces]], elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts. Kennedy hoped that the flexible response strategy would allow the US to counter Soviet influence without resorting to nuclear war.{{sfn|Herring|2008|pp=704\u201305}}\n\nTo support his new strategy Kennedy ordered a massive increase in defense spending. He sought, and Congress provided, a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union\u2014he claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits. In his inaugural address Kennedy promised \"to bear any burden\" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.

In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the [[Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia]]-[[Permesta]] Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime. They were joined by many civilian politicians from the [[Masyumi Party]], such as [[Sjafruddin Prawiranegara]], who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist [[Communist Party of Indonesia|Partai Komunis Indonesia]] party. Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until [[Allen Lawrence Pope]], an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]] in April 1958. The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds [[Padang]] and [[Manado]].

Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former [[Yugoslavia]]. In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of [[economic growth]] and an increase in the number of [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]], while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by [[failed state|state failure]].{{sfn|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}\n\n===In popular culture===\n{{See also|Culture during the Cold War}}\nDuring the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union invested heavily in propaganda designed to influence people around the world, especially using motion pictures.{{sfn|Shaw|Youngblood|2010|p=ch. 1}}{{page needed|date=September 2015}} The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, ''[[The Americans]]'', set in the early 1980s, was ranked No. 6 on the [[Metacritic]] annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.{{sfn|Dietz|2013}}{{sfn|Lowry|2018}}\n\n==Historiography==\n{{Main|Historiography of the Cold War}}\nAs soon as the term \"Cold War\" was popularized to refer to post-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, interpreting the course and origins of the conflict has been a source of heated controversy among historians, political scientists, and journalists.{{sfn|Nashel|1999}} In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet\u2013US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided.{{sfn|Ambrose|Brinkley|2011|pp=789\u201399}} Historians have also disagreed on what exactly the Cold War was, what the sources of the conflict were, and how to disentangle patterns of action and reaction between the two sides.{{sfn|Halliday|2001|p=2e}}\n\nAlthough explanations of the origins of the conflict in academic discussions are complex and diverse, several general schools of thought on the subject can be identified. Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: \"orthodox\" accounts, \"revisionism\", and \"post-revisionism\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}}\n\n\"Orthodox\" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} \"Revisionist\" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} \"Post-revisionists\" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War.{{sfn|Calhoun|2002}} Much of the historiography on the Cold War weaves together two or even all three of these broad categories.{{sfn|Byrd|2003}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of the Cold War}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[American espionage in the Soviet Union and Russian Federation]]\n* [[American imperialism]]\n* [[Canada in the Cold War]]\n* [[Cold War (TV series)|''Cold War'' (TV series)]]\n* [[Cold War II]]\n* [[List of Americans in the Venona papers]]\n* [[List of Eastern Bloc agents in the United States]]\n* [[McCarthyism]]\n* [[Red Scare]]\n* [[Soviet Empire]]\n* [[Soviet espionage in the United States]]\n* [[Timeline of events in the Cold War]]\n* [[War on Terror]]\n* [[World War III]]\n* [[Venona project]]\n* [[:Category:Cold War by period]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n===Books===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher M.|last2=Gordievsky|first2=Oleg|title=KGB: The Inside Story of Its Foreign Operations from Lenin to Gorbachev|year=1991|publisher=HarperPerennial|isbn=978-0-06-092109-5|ref=harv|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/kgbinsidestoryof00chri}}\n* {{cite book | last=Andrew | first=Christopher | last2=Mitrokhin | first2=Vasili | title=The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB | year=2000 | authorlink=Christopher Andrew (historian) | publisher=[[Basic Books]] | authorlink2=Mitrokhin, Vasili | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last1= Aarons| first1=Mark| chapter=Justice Betrayed: Post-1945 Responses to Genocide| title=The Legacy of Nuremberg: Civilising Influence or Institutionalised Vengeance?

The period is generally considered to span the 1947 [[Truman Doctrine]] to the 1991 [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. The term \"[[Cold war (general term)|cold]]\" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two [[superpowers]], but they each supported major regional conflicts known as [[Proxy war|proxy wars]]. The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary [[Allies of World War II|alliance]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|victory]] against [[Nazi Germany]] in 1945.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The United States, the Soviet Union and the geopolitical implications of the origins of the Cold War|last=Lewkowicz, Nicolas|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=978-1-78308-799-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1061862862}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Px4uDwAAQBAJ|title=Geopolitics: From the Cold War to the 21st Century|last=Sempa|first=Francis|date=2017-07-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-51768-3|language=en}}</ref> The doctrine of [[Mutual assured destruction|mutually assured destruction]] (MAD) discouraged [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|a pre-emptive attack]] by either side.

The US government [[United States involvement in regime change#Cold War|supported right-wing governments and uprisings]] across the world, while the Soviet government [[Russia involvement in regime change#1941\u20131953|funded communist parties and revolutions]] around the world. As nearly all the colonial states [[Decolonization#The emergence of the Third World (1945\u2013present)|achieved independence in the period 1945\u20131960]], they became [[Third World]] battlefields in the Cold War.\n\n[[Cold War (1947\u20131953)|The first phase]] of the Cold War began immediately after the end of the [[WWII|Second World War]] in 1945. The United States [[North Atlantic Treaty|created]] the [[NATO]] military alliance in 1949 in apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed [[Foreign policy of the United States|their global policy]] against Soviet influence ''[[containment]]''. The Soviet Union formed the [[Warsaw Pact]] in 1955 in response to NATO. Major crises of this phase included the 1948\u201349 [[Berlin Blockade]], the 1927\u201350 [[Chinese Civil War]], the 1950\u201353 [[Korean War]], the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]] and the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. The USSR and the US competed for influence in [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Decolonisation of Africa#Timeline|decolonizing states of Africa]] and [[Asia]]. \n\nFollowing the Cuban Missile Crisis, [[Cold War (1962\u20131979)|a new phase began]] that saw the [[Sino-Soviet split]] between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater autonomy of action. The USSR [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invaded Czechoslovakia]] to suppress the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], while the US experienced internal turmoil from the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|opposition]] to the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 1960s\u201370s, an international [[peace movement]] took root among citizens around the world. [[Anti-nuclear movement|Movements]] against [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear arms testing]] and for [[nuclear disarmament]] took place, with large [[anti-war protests]]. By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of [[d\u00e9tente]] that saw the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] and the US [[Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China|opening relations]] with the [[China|People's Republic of China]] as a strategic counterweight to the USSR. \n\nD\u00e9tente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] in 1979. The [[Cold War (1979\u20131985)|early 1980s]] were another period of elevated tension. The United States increased [[Reagan Doctrine|diplomatic, military, and economic pressures]] on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from [[Era of Stagnation|economic stagnation]]. [[Cold War (1985\u20131991)|In the mid-1980s]], the new Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the liberalizing reforms of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\", c. 1985) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"reorganization\", 1987) and ended Soviet involvement in Afghanistan. Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer. The result in 1989 was a [[Revolutions of 1989|wave of revolutions]] that (with the exception of [[Romanian Revolution|Romania]]) peacefully overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|abortive coup attempt]] in August 1991. This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of [[Republics of the Soviet Union|its constituent republics]] and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia. The United States was left as the world's only superpower.\n\nThe Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy. It is often referred to [[Culture during the Cold War|in popular culture]], especially with themes of espionage (and the threat of nuclear warfare. Meanwhile, a renewed state of tension between the Soviet Union's successor state, [[Russia]], and the United States in the 21st century (including its [[Western world|Western]] allies) as well as growing tension between an increasingly powerful China and the U.S. and its Western allies have each been referred to as the [[Cold War II|Second Cold War]].{{sfn|Syria crisis|2018}}\n\n==Origins of the term==\n{{Main|Cold war (general term)}}\nAt the end of World War II, English writer [[George Orwell]] used ''[[Cold war (general term)|cold war]]'', as a general term, in his essay \"You and the Atomic Bomb\", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]''. Contemplating a world living in the shadow of the threat of [[nuclear warfare]], Orwell looked at [[James Burnham]]'s predictions of a polarized world, writing:\n\n{{quote|Looking at the world as a whole, the drift for many decades has been not towards anarchy but towards the reimposition of slavery... James Burnham's theory has been much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications\u2014that is, the kind of world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a state which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of \"cold war\" with its neighbours.{{sfn|Orwell|1945}}}}\n\nIn ''[[The Observer]]'' of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, \"after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire.\"{{sfn|Orwell|1946}}\n\nThe first use of the term to describe the specific [[post-war]] geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by [[Bernard Baruch]], an influential advisor to Democratic presidents,{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=54}} on 16 April 1947. The speech, written by journalist [[Herbert Bayard Swope]],{{sfn|Safire|2006}} proclaimed, \"Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war.\"{{sfn|History.com|2009}} Newspaper columnist [[Walter Lippmann]] gave the term wide currency with his book ''The Cold War''. When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, ''la guerre froide''.{{efn-ua|[[Strobe Talbott]], ''The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient Empires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation'' (2009) p. 441 n. 3; Lippmann's own book is {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ydc3AAAAIAAJ|author=Lippmann, Walter|title=The Cold War|publisher=Harper|year=1947}}}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|Origins of the Cold War}}\n\n===Russian Revolution===\n[[File:Wladiwostok Parade 1918.jpg|thumb|Allied troops in [[Vladivostok]], August 1918, during the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied intervention]] in the [[Russian Civil War]]]]\n\n{{Main|Russian Revolution|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\n\nWhile most historians trace the origins of the Cold War to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began with the [[October Revolution]] in [[Russian Republic|Russia]] in 1917 when the [[Bolsheviks]] took power. In [[Diplomatic history of World War I|World War I]], the British, French and [[Russian Empire]]s had comprised the Allied Powers from the start, and the US joined them in April 1917. The [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November 1917 but German armies advanced rapidly across the borderlands. The Allies responded with an economic [[blockade]] against all of Russia.{{sfn|Tucker|2016|p=608}} In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of [[Opposition to World War I|popular disgust against the war]] and accepted harsh German peace terms with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front{{sfn|Combs|2015|p=97\u2013101}} and by \"relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe.\"{{sfn|Chretien|2017|p=129}}{{sfn|Senior|2016|p=176}} According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, \"The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention,\" and proceeded to step up their \"[[economic warfare]]\" against the Bolsheviks.{{sfn|Tucker|2016|p=608}} [[Left communism|Some Bolsheviks]] saw Russia as only the first step, planning to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need for peace with Germany led Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] away from this position.{{efn-ua|{{cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Left-Communist |title= Left Communist {{!}} Russian political faction |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica |access-date=30 September 2018 |language= en}}}}\n\nIn 1918 Britain sent in money and some troops to support the [[White movement|anti-Bolshevik \"White\" counter-revolutionaries]]. This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War [[Winston Churchill]], a committed [[anti-communist]].<ref>Clifford Kinvig, ''Churchill's crusade: the British invasion of Russia, 1918\u20131920'' (2007) pp=91\u201395.</ref> France, Japan and the United States also sent forces to keep Germany from making gains.

By 1933, old fears of Communist threats had faded, and the American business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] used presidential authority to normalize relations in November 1933.{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=341\u2013343}} However, there was no progress on the Tsarist debts Washington wanted Moscow to repay. Expectations of expanded trade proved unrealistic. Historians Justus D. Doenecke and Mark A. Stoler note that, \"Both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord.\"{{sfn|Doenecke|Stoler|2005|pp=18. 121}}  Roosevelt named [[William Christian Bullitt Jr.|William Bullitt]] as ambassador from 1933 to 1936. Bullitt arrived in Moscow with high hopes for Soviet\u2013American relations, but his view of the Soviet leadership soured on closer inspection. By the end of his tenure, Bullitt was openly hostile to the Soviet government, and he remained an outspoken anti-communist for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Brownell|Billings|1987}}\n\n===Beginnings of World War II===\nIn the late 1930s, Stalin had worked with Foreign Minister [[Maxim Litvinov]] to promote [[popular fronts]] with capitalist parties and governments to oppose [[fascism]]. The Soviets were embittered when Western governments chose to practice [[appeasement]] with Nazi Germany instead. In March 1939 Britain and France\u2014without consulting the USSR\u2014granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the [[Munich Agreement]]. Facing an aggressive Japan at Russia's borders as well, Stalin changed directions and replaced Litvinov with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], who negotiated closer relations with Germany.{{sfn|Leffler|2008|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nAfter signing the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty]], the Soviet Union forced the [[Baltic states|Baltic countries]]\u2014Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania\u2014to allow it [[Background of the occupation of the Baltic states#Soviet ultimatums and occupation|to station Soviet troops in their countries]].{{sfn|Kalnins|2015|pp=126\u201327}} Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939. The resulting [[Winter War]] ended in March 1940 with [[Moscow Peace Treaty|Finnish concessions]].{{sfn|Tucker|2016|pp=612\u201313}} Britain and France, treating the Soviet attack on Finland as tantamount to its entering the war on the side of the Germans, responded to the Soviet invasion by supporting the USSR's expulsion from the [[League of Nations]].{{sfn|De Gruyter|2010|pp=171\u201372}}\n\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union forcibly annexed [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania]].{{sfn|Otfinoski|2014|p=14}} It also seized the disputed Romanian regions of [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Hertza]]. But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]] in June 1941 and declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers worked together to fight Germany. Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement. In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its [[Lend-Lease]] Program.{{sfn|Herring|1973}} However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany. According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement. Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|pp=151\u201353}}\n\n==End of World War II (1945\u20131947)==\n\n===Wartime conferences regarding post-war Europe===\n{{Further|Tehran Conference|Yalta Conference|List of Allied World War II conferences}}\nThe Allies disagreed about how the European map should look, and how borders would be drawn, following the war.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13\u201323}} Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|pp=13\u201323}} Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through [[international organization]]s.{{sfn|Gaddis|1990|p=156}} Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world. Roosevelt's goals\u2014military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the [[British Empire]], and the creation of a world peace organization\u2014were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a [[Buffer state|buffer]] between the Soviets and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Plokhy|2010}}\n\n[[File:Yalta Conference (Churchill, Roosevelt, Stalin) (B&W).jpg|thumb|left|The \"[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]\" at the Yalta Conference: [[Winston Churchill]], [[Franklin D.

With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors.\n\nThe differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets. In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the \"[[percentages agreement]]\" to divide the [[Balkans]] into respective [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]], including giving Stalin predominance [[Romania in World War II|over Romania]] and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche [[White Terror (Greece)|over Greece.]] At the [[Yalta Conference]] of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin in regard of Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations.{{sfn|Plokhy|2010}} Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement,{{sfn|Carlton|2000}}{{sfn|Todd|2016|pp=105\u2013111}} but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe.{{sfn|Gaddis|2005|p=21}}\n\n[[File:Map-Germany-1945.svg|thumb|Post-war [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation zones in Germany]]]]\n\nAt the [[Second Quebec Conference]], a high-level military conference held in Quebec City, 12\u201316 September 1944, Churchill and Roosevelt reached agreement on a number of matters, including a plan for Germany based on [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]]'s original proposal.

This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals.

In his inaugural address Kennedy promised \"to bear any burden\" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems. From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them. The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424. He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles. He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.

{"title_page": "Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth''' (died 1589) was an Irish  politician and [[peerage|peer]]. He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and played a leading part in  the Government  of Ireland in the 1560s; but he  later went into opposition and was imprisoned as a result.  He was nicknamed the '''Blind Lord'''.\n\nHe was a man of considerable  intelligence and  learning,   who  may have  written part of  the historical compilation called ''The Book of Howth''.  On the other hand, he was notorious for his domestic cruelty: he was imprisoned  briefly and fined for ill-treating his wife and for  causing  the death of his teenage daughter through his  brutal  treatment of her.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born  sometime after 1509, the third of the four sons of  [[Christopher St Lawrence, 5th Baron Howth]] and  his wife Anne Bermingham. He was the  brother of Edward St Lawrence, 6th Baron Howth  and [[Richard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Christopher (d.1589)|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|volume=50}}</ref>  Since he was a younger son without much prospect of inheriting the title, not  a great deal  is recorded of his early years. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1544 and was practising at the [[English bar]] ten years later: his legal knowledge later made him an effective leader of the opposition to the Crown's policies. It is not known when he was afflicted with blindness, nor whether he went  totally blind.  By 1556 he had returned to Ireland and was managing one of the family estates.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> He succeeded to the [[baron]]y in 1558 on the death of his brother Richard without issue.\n\n== Politician ==\n\n[[Image:Thomas Radclyffe Earl of Sussex.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and a key ally of Lord Howth]]\n\nThe [[Baron Howth|Baron of Howth]] was always well positioned  to play a major part in Irish politics: Christopher  had the additional advantage of enjoying the trust of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|the Earl of Sussex]]. He was made a member of the Privy Council immediately after the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] and sat in her first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1560. Sussex sent him to negotiate with [[S\u00e9an \u00d3 N\u00e9ill|Shane O'Neill]], the effective ruler of [[Ulster]],   in 1561:   Howth  persuaded O'Neill  to go to London and submit himself  to the Queen's mercy.  Howth himself went to London the following year to discuss Irish affairs with the Queen. By his own  account Elizabeth  at first treated him with great suspicion,  simply because he was an Irishman,<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> but he succeeded in winning her trust. He was confirmed in the title  Baron of Howth and later [[knighted]]. After Sussex's recall from Ireland  he continued to enjoy the confidence of the [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], [[Sir Nicholas Arnold]], who sent him to negotiate  with the O'Reilly clan.\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThe 1570s were a time of  conflict between Sussex's successor as  Lord Deputy, Sir [[Henry Sidney]], and the Anglo-Irish nobility over his taxation policies,  and especially over the ''cess'', the tax for maintaining garrisons. Howth, despite his previous record of loyalty to the Crown, emerged as  one of the leaders  of the opposition, and gave grave offence to the Queen as a result. Summoned before the Council, he argued that according to  his understanding  of the law  (and he was of course a qualified [[barrister]]) Sidney's proposals were [[unconstitutional]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months in [[Dublin Castle]], and then made a full submission to the Crown, arguing that he had never intended to question the [[Royal Prerogative]] or the Queen's power to tax her Irish subjects. After a sharp rebuke he was  allowed to go free,   but it is unlikely that he was ever fully trusted again, and it may be that his later prosecution for domestic cruelty had political motives behind it.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n== Charges of domestic cruelty ==\n\nIn 1579 Nicholas Terrell, a servant of Lord Howth, was convicted of [[perjury]]. In the course of the trial  there was a good deal of evidence  about Howth's cruelty to his wife, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], ordered a further investigation into these allegations,  which resulted in a full hearing before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]]. It is not  entirely clear why  Castle Chamber, which in theory  dealt  only with cases of  riot and  other offences against public order, intervened in a private  family law case (although in  practice Castle  Chamber did hear many  private lawsuits).\n\nThe evidence showed that Howth had assaulted his wife so often and  so severely that she had fled in fear of her life and taken refuge with  her brother. On  one occasion he had beaten her so badly that she had been unable to leave her bed for two weeks, and he had given her another  severe beating before she had  fully recovered from the first.<ref>''Dublin Penny Journal''  August 24, 1833</ref> Even more serious was the evidence that he had beaten his 13-year-old daughter Jane so badly  that she died as a result- \"some said he gave her  forty strokes, some said sixty, on her bare back\". Howth  in his defence  pleaded that Jane had died of a fever, unrelated to the beatings, which he admitted  to having administered.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\">''Dublin Penny Journal'' 1833</ref>\n\nHowth was found guilty of both charges. He was  sentenced to a brief term of imprisonment and  fined heavily; he was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife, who was allowed to live apart from him and was  given [[child custody|custody]]  of the children. While the Government in imposing these penalties may have intended  to rebuke Howth for his opposition to its taxation policy, the verdict also suggests that the Court felt  genuine sympathy for Lady Howth.<ref>Crawford , Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641''  Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\n\nIn the 1580s Howth briefly resumed his role as leader of the opposition,  and succeeded in temporarily  blocking further proposals for tax reform by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir John Perrot]]. On this occasion he was quickly brought to admit his faults : he was reconciled with Perrot, and sent him a present of a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], a bird which has always been a great  rarity in Ireland.\n\nHe died on 24 October 1589 and was buried in Howth Abbey; his [[tomb]] has  an effigy to himself and his first wife. His last [[will (law)|will]] made generous [[bequests]] to servants but none of his children, except his eldest son, received anything. The reference in the will to his ''many and grave sins'' has led some to suggest that he felt  genuine remorse for his ill-treatment of his wife and daughter.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n== The Book of Howth ==\n\nHe owned a manuscript, the ''Book of Howth'', which is  a historical source of considerable  value. It is partly a celebration of the achievements of the St. Lawrence family and partly a description of historical events such as the [[Battle of Knockdoe]]. The last part deals in detail with Howth's own career and may well have been written by him.\n\n== Legend of Granuaile ==\n\nA famous legend, which may have some basis in fact, records that about 1575 [[Grace O'Malley]], or [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway, called at [[Howth Castle]] only to find the gates barred. Outraged by the discourtesy, she kidnapped Lord Howth's heir, then a young child (this would probably have been the 8th Baron's grandson, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]) and held him [[hostage]]  until the St. Lawrence family apologised for their lack of hospitality.  To make amends Lord Howth promised that in future his gates would always be open at dinner time and a place  would be set at table  for unexpected guests, a tradition which later generations maintained.\n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\n== Character ==\n\nElrington Ball<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> calls  the eighth Lord Howth the most striking member of his family and the most forceful Irish statesman of the Elizabethan era. He does not defend his ill- treatment of his wife and daughter, but argues,  rather unconvincingly, that the early years of his marriage were  probably happy enough.  Crawford<ref>''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland''</ref> takes a much more severe view of Howth's  faults, arguing that  his killing of his daughter Jane  was certainly at least [[manslaughter]], and possibly  [[murder]], and  notes that her mother  was forced to flee from home in order to avoid a similar fate.\n\n== Family ==\n\nHe married firstly, probably about 1540, Elizabeth Plunket, daughter of Sir John Plunket of Beaulieu, [[County Meath]]. From her testimony at his trial on the charge of  his cruelty to her,   we know that they had 14 children, but presumably several of them died in infancy  and only 7  children can be  identified with certainty:\n\n* [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth]] (c.1550\u20131607)\n* Thomas (died 1600), who was killed at the [[Battle of Moyry Pass]]\n* Leonard (died 1608), who married Anne Eustace\n* Richard, who married a daughter of Francis Corby\n* Margaret, who married firstly William Fitzwilliam and secondly Michael Berford\n* Mary, who married Sir [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] of Turvey (the marriage was  annulled in 1579; she evidently did not remarry)\n* Jane,  who died  in 1577,  aged only 13, a  victim of her father's ill-treatment.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\"/>\n\nHe married secondly, after 1579, Cecily Cusack, daughter of Henry Cusack, [[alderman]] of Dublin. She outlived him by many years, and remarried twice. By her second husband John Barnewall (died 1599), younger son of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]],  she had a son Patrick.<ref>Lodge, John   ''Peerage of Ireland''   London  184 Vol.3 p.49</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Howth, Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron}}\n[[Category:16th-century Irish politicians]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Dublin (city)\u200e]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:1589 deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Barons Howth]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth''' (died 1589) was an Irish  politician and [[peerage|peer]].

He was the  brother of Edward St Lawrence, 6th Baron Howth  and [[Richard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Christopher (d.1589)|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|volume=50}}</ref>  Since he was a younger son without much prospect of inheriting the title, not  a great deal  is recorded of his early years. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1544 and was practising at the [[English bar]] ten years later: his legal knowledge later made him an effective leader of the opposition to the Crown's policies. It is not known when he was afflicted with blindness, nor whether he went  totally blind.  By 1556 he had returned to Ireland and was managing one of the family estates.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> He succeeded to the [[baron]]y in 1558 on the death of his brother Richard without issue.\n\n== Politician ==\n\n[[Image:Thomas Radclyffe Earl of Sussex.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and a key ally of Lord Howth]]\n\nThe [[Baron Howth|Baron of Howth]] was always well positioned  to play a major part in Irish politics: Christopher  had the additional advantage of enjoying the trust of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|the Earl of Sussex]]. He was made a member of the Privy Council immediately after the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] and sat in her first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1560. Sussex sent him to negotiate with [[S\u00e9an \u00d3 N\u00e9ill|Shane O'Neill]], the effective ruler of [[Ulster]],   in 1561:   Howth  persuaded O'Neill  to go to London and submit himself  to the Queen's mercy.  Howth himself went to London the following year to discuss Irish affairs with the Queen. By his own  account Elizabeth  at first treated him with great suspicion,  simply because he was an Irishman,<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> but he succeeded in winning her trust. He was confirmed in the title  Baron of Howth and later [[knighted]]. After Sussex's recall from Ireland  he continued to enjoy the confidence of the [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], [[Sir Nicholas Arnold]], who sent him to negotiate  with the O'Reilly clan.\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThe 1570s were a time of  conflict between Sussex's successor as  Lord Deputy, Sir [[Henry Sidney]], and the Anglo-Irish nobility over his taxation policies,  and especially over the ''cess'', the tax for maintaining garrisons. Howth, despite his previous record of loyalty to the Crown, emerged as  one of the leaders  of the opposition, and gave grave offence to the Queen as a result. Summoned before the Council, he argued that according to  his understanding  of the law  (and he was of course a qualified [[barrister]]) Sidney's proposals were [[unconstitutional]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months in [[Dublin Castle]], and then made a full submission to the Crown, arguing that he had never intended to question the [[Royal Prerogative]] or the Queen's power to tax her Irish subjects. After a sharp rebuke he was  allowed to go free,   but it is unlikely that he was ever fully trusted again, and it may be that his later prosecution for domestic cruelty had political motives behind it.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n== Charges of domestic cruelty ==\n\nIn 1579 Nicholas Terrell, a servant of Lord Howth, was convicted of [[perjury]]. In the course of the trial much was said about Howth's cruelty to his wife, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], ordered a further investigation into these allegations,  which resulted in a full hearing before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]]. It is not  entirely clear why  Castle Chamber, which in theory  dealt  only with cases of  riot and  other offences against public order, intervened in a private  family law case (although in  practice Castle  Chamber did hear many  private lawsuits).\n\nThe evidence showed that Howth had assaulted his wife so often and  so severely that she had fled in fear of her life and taken refuge with  her brother. On  one occasion he had beaten her so badly that she had been unable to leave her bed for two weeks, and he had given her another  severe beating before she had  fully recovered from the first.<ref>''Dublin Penny Journal''  August 24, 1833</ref> Even more serious was the evidence that he had beaten his 13-year-old daughter Jane so badly  that she died as a result- \"some said he gave her  forty strokes, some said sixty, on her bare back\". Howth  in his defence  pleaded that Jane had died of a fever, unrelated to the beatings, which he admitted  to having administered.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\">''Dublin Penny Journal'' 1833</ref>\n\nHowth was found guilty of both charges. He was  sentenced to a brief term of imprisonment and  fined heavily; he was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife, who was allowed to live apart from him and was  given [[child custody|custody]]  of the children. While the Government in imposing these penalties may have intended  to rebuke Howth for his opposition to its taxation policy, the verdict also suggests that the Court felt  genuine sympathy for Lady Howth.<ref>Crawford , Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641''  Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\n\nIn the 1580s Howth briefly resumed his role as leader of the opposition,  and succeeded in temporarily  blocking further proposals for tax reform by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir John Perrot]]. On this occasion he was quickly brought to admit his faults : he was reconciled with Perrot, and sent him a present of a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], a bird which has always been a great  rarity in Ireland.\n\nHe died on 24 October 1589 and was buried in Howth Abbey; his [[tomb]] has  an effigy to himself and his first wife. His last [[will (law)|will]] made generous [[bequests]] to servants but none of his children, except his eldest son, received anything. The reference in the will to his ''many and grave sins'' has led some to suggest that he felt  genuine remorse for his ill-treatment of his wife and daughter.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n== The Book of Howth ==\n\nHe owned a manuscript, the ''Book of Howth'', which is  a historical source of considerable  value. It is partly a celebration of the achievements of the St. Lawrence family and partly a description of historical events such as the [[Battle of Knockdoe]]. The last part deals in detail with Howth's own career and may well have been written by him.\n\n== Legend of Granuaile ==\n\nA famous legend, which may have some basis in fact, records that about 1575 [[Grace O'Malley]], or [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway, called at [[Howth Castle]] only to find the gates barred. Outraged by the discourtesy, she kidnapped Lord Howth's heir, then a young child (this would probably have been the 8th Baron's grandson, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]) and held him [[hostage]]  until the St. Lawrence family apologised for their lack of hospitality.  To make amends Lord Howth promised that in future his gates would always be open at dinner time and a place  would be set at table  for unexpected guests, a tradition which later generations maintained.\n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\n== Character ==\n\nElrington Ball<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> calls  the eighth Lord Howth the most striking member of his family and the most forceful Irish statesman of the Elizabethan era. He does not defend his ill- treatment of his wife and daughter, but argues,  rather unconvincingly, that the early years of his marriage were  probably happy enough.  Crawford<ref>''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland''</ref> takes a much more severe view of Howth's  faults, arguing that  his killing of his daughter Jane  was certainly at least [[manslaughter]], and possibly  [[murder]], and  notes that her mother  was forced to flee from home in order to avoid a similar fate.\n\n== Family ==\n\nHe married firstly, probably about 1540, Elizabeth Plunket, daughter of Sir John Plunket of Beaulieu, [[County Meath]]. From her testimony at his trial on the charge of  his cruelty to her,   we know that they had 14 children, but presumably several of them died in infancy  and only 7  children can be  identified with certainty:\n\n* [[Nicholas St Lawrence, 9th Baron Howth]] (c.1550\u20131607)\n* Thomas (died 1600), who was killed at the [[Battle of Moyry Pass]]\n* Leonard (died 1608), who married Anne Eustace\n* Richard, who married a daughter of Francis Corby\n* Margaret, who married firstly William Fitzwilliam and secondly Michael Berford\n* Mary, who married Sir [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] of Turvey (the marriage was  annulled in 1579; she evidently did not remarry)\n* Jane,  who died  in 1577,  aged only 13, a  victim of her father's ill-treatment.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\"/>\n\nHe married secondly, after 1579, Cecily Cusack, daughter of Henry Cusack, [[alderman]] of Dublin. She outlived him by many years, and remarried twice. By her second husband John Barnewall (died 1599), younger son of Sir [[Christopher Barnewall]],  she had a son Patrick.<ref>Lodge, John   ''Peerage of Ireland''   London  184 Vol.3 p.49</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Howth, Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron}}\n[[Category:16th-century Irish politicians]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Dublin (city)\u200e]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:1589 deaths]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Barons Howth]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharges of domestic cruelty", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_St_Lawrence,_8th_Baron_Howth"}
