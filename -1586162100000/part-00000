The World Class Wrestling Association started out under the name \"Southwest Sports\" from 1940 to 1966, then known as \"Big Time Wrestling\", a member of the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), from 1966 until 1982. In 1982 the promotion was renamed World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and grew beyond the limits of the Texas territory, with syndicated television shows available across the United States and internationally.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

The use of the term \"social distancing\" had led to implications that people should engage in complete [[social isolation]], rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.<ref name=\"9tsr9\" /><ref name=\"B2DkM\" /><ref name=\"KTIr0\" />\n\nThe government in Ireland released sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in [[Asia]] during the northern hemisphere summer and [[Australia]] during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed {{sclass-|Grand|cruise ship|0}} ship, which is also known as a Gem-class ship. ''Diamond Princess'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship||Sapphire Princess}}, are the widest subclass of ''Grand''-class ships, as they have a {{convert|37.5|m|ftin|adj=on}} [[beam (nautical)|beam]], while all other ''Grand''-class ships have a beam of {{convert|36|m|ftin}}. ''Diamond Princess'' and ''Sapphire Princess'' were both built in [[Nagasaki, Japan]], by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Industries]].\n\nThere have been two notable outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship&nbsp;\u2013 an outbreak of [[gastroenteritis]] caused by [[norovirus]] in 2016 and an [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships#Diamond Princess|outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus]] in 2020. In the latter incident, the ship was quarantined for nearly a month with her passengers on board, and her passengers and crew were subject to further quarantine after disembarking. At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and twelve have died.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe diesel-electric plant of ''Diamond Princess'' has four diesel generators and a gas turbine generator. The diesel generators are [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] 46 series common rail engines, two [[straight-nine engine|straight 9-cylinder configuration]] (9L46), and two [[straight-eight engine|straight 8-cylinder configuration]] (8L46). The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately {{convert|8500|kW|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9500|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines are fueled with [[heavy fuel oil]] (HFO or bunker c) and [[Gas oil|marine gas oil]] (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions, but is much more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe gas turbine generator is a [[General Electric]] [[General Electric LM2500|LM2500]], producing a peak of {{convert|25000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as [[Alaska]], where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when high speed is required to make it to a port in a shorter time period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThere are two propulsion electric motors, driving fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering&nbsp;\u2013 three at the bow and three at the stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by [[Alstom]] Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20&nbsp;MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm. (Rated speed of 0-145 rpm.){{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2017 ''Diamond Princess'' was retrofitted with a [[Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System|hull air lubrication system]] to reduce fuel consumption and related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air lubrication system |url=http://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/diamond-princess-retrofitted-with-silverstream-air-lubrication-system.html |website=Seatrade-cruise |access-date=17 December 2018|date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\nThe ship was originally intended to be christened ''Sapphire Princess''. However, construction of another ship&nbsp;\u2013\u2009the one intended to be ''Diamond Princess'' (currently sailing as {{ship||Sapphire Princess}})&nbsp;\u2013\u2009was delayed when fire swept through her decks during construction. Because completion of the damaged ship would be delayed for some time, her [[sister ship]], which was also under construction, was renamed ''Diamond Princess''. The name swap helped keep the delivery of ''Diamond Princess'' on time.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Cruise Ship ''Sapphire Princess'' To Be Delivered to Princess Cruises |url=http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 | publisher=Hideo Ikuno, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. |date=26 May 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318104519/http://www.japancorp.net/Article.Asp?Art_ID=7393 |archivedate=18 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nShe was the first [[Princess Cruises]] ship to be built in a Japanese shipyard, and the first to forego the controversial \"wing\" or \"shopping cart handle\" structure overhanging the stern, which houses the Skywalkers Nightclub on {{ship||Caribbean Princess}}, {{ship||Golden Princess}} and {{ship||Star Princess|2001|2}}, and which was originally also a feature of {{ship||Grand Princess}} prior to her 2011 refit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nPrior to 2014, ''Diamond Princess'' alternated sailing north and southbound voyages of the glacier cruises during the northern summer months and in the southern summer, she sailed from Australia and New Zealand.

She began operation in March 2004 and primarily cruises in [[Asia]] during the northern hemisphere summer and [[Australia]] during the southern hemisphere summer. She is a subclassed {{sclass-|Grand|cruise ship|0}} ship, which is also known as a Gem-class ship. ''Diamond Princess'' and her [[sister ship]], {{ship||Sapphire Princess}}, are the widest subclass of ''Grand''-class ships, as they have a {{convert|37.5|m|ftin|adj=on}} [[beam (nautical)|beam]], while all other ''Grand''-class ships have a beam of {{convert|36|m|ftin}}. ''Diamond Princess'' and ''Sapphire Princess'' were both built in [[Nagasaki, Japan]], by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries|Mitsubishi Industries]].\n\nThere have been two notable outbreaks of infectious disease on the ship&nbsp;\u2013 an outbreak of [[gastroenteritis]] caused by [[norovirus]] in 2016 and an [[2020 coronavirus pandemic on cruise ships#Diamond Princess|outbreak of the COVID-2019 coronavirus]] in 2020. In the latter incident, the ship was quarantined for nearly a month with her passengers on board, and her passengers and crew were subject to further quarantine after disembarking. At least 712 out of the 3,711 passengers and crew were infected, and twelve have died.\n\n==Design and description==\nThe diesel-electric plant of ''Diamond Princess'' has four diesel generators and a gas turbine generator. The diesel generators are [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4]] 46 series common rail engines, two [[straight-nine engine|straight 9-cylinder configuration]] (9L46), and two [[straight-eight engine|straight 8-cylinder configuration]] (8L46). The 8- and 9-cylinder engines can produce approximately {{convert|8500|kW|hp|lk=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|9500|kW|hp|abbr=on}}, respectively. These engines are fueled with [[heavy fuel oil]] (HFO or bunker c) and [[Gas oil|marine gas oil]] (MGO) depending on the local regulations regarding emissions, as MGO produces much lower emissions, but is much more expensive.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThe gas turbine generator is a [[General Electric]] [[General Electric LM2500|LM2500]], producing a peak of {{convert|25000|kW|hp|abbr=on}} fueled by MGO. This generator is much more expensive to run than the diesel generators, and is used mostly in areas, such as [[Alaska]], where the emissions regulations are strict. It is also used when high speed is required to make it to a port in a shorter time period.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} \n\nThere are two propulsion electric motors, driving fixed-pitch propellers and six thrusters used during maneuvering&nbsp;\u2013 three at the bow and three at the stern. The propulsion electric motors (PEMs), are conventional synchronous motors made by [[Alstom]] Motors. The two motors are each rated to 20&nbsp;MW and have a maximum speed of 154 rpm. (Rated speed of 0-145 rpm.){{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn June 2017 ''Diamond Princess'' was retrofitted with a [[Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System|hull air lubrication system]] to reduce fuel consumption and related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air lubrication system |url=http://www.seatrade-cruise.com/news/news-headlines/diamond-princess-retrofitted-with-silverstream-air-lubrication-system.html |website=Seatrade-cruise |access-date=17 December 2018|date=14 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Construction and career==\nThe ship was originally intended to be christened ''Sapphire Princess''. However, construction of another ship&nbsp;\u2013\u2009the one intended to be ''Diamond Princess'' (currently sailing as {{ship||Sapphire Princess}})&nbsp;\u2013\u2009was delayed when fire swept through her decks during construction.

This was the school location which JRR Tolkien thoroughly disliked, after the idyllic country life in Sarehole Mill (now a Birmingham suburb). It opened at its intended site at [[Camp Hill, West Midlands|Camp Hill]] in Birmingham, near the city centre in September 1883, and moved to its current location, adjacent to Kings Heath Park, in 1956. Camp Hill Boys celebrated its 50-year jubilee in 2007 with a concert at Symphony Hall and the burial of a time capsule to be opened in another 50 years' time. It celebrated its House Centenary in 2007-8, with special events throughout the year that are not normally part of the house competition e.g. [[Five-a-side football|5-a-side football]].\n\n==Admission==\n\nAdmission to Camp Hill is based upon success in the 11+ exam along with consideration of proximity to the school.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoolsofkingedwardvi.co.uk/admissions-policy-2020/|title=New Admissions Policy 2020|website=The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham}}</ref> It is also guaranteed that at least 25% of students admitted will be 'Pupil Premium Pupils', which are pupils whose families will have received free school meals at some point in the six years prior to application.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Those living outside the catchment are able to attend Camp Hill, but only if they achieve a very high score in the 11+, and the quota for catchment pupils is not filled.<ref name=\"auto\"/> This admissions policy replaced the previous one for admissions starting in 2020. Previously, no weight was attached to proximity to the school, and the quote for Pupil Premium Pupils was 20%.\n\n===Admissions controversy 2020===\nFor the academic year starting in 2020, changes were made to admissions criteria by The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham, the body which oversees the running of Camp Hill and the other King Edward schools in Birmingham.<ref name=\"auto\"/> These changes were praised by some but were largely controversial, with only 27% of those consulted supporting the plans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/savebirminghamgrammars|title=Help raise \u00a33000 to fight a new admissions system which is arbitrary and illogical.

In public consultation, many concerns were raised about the catchment areas, including that they may be designed to increase applications to the private schools of KES, overseen by the same body.

A two-week timetable synchronises the two schools, allowing for shares lessons for A-level subjects of Music, German and Computer Science. The fields, tennis courts, schoolyards and the main school buildings are not shared. There is a shared swimming pool used separately by boys and girls. The [[sixth form]] block is a shared facility in  which  the top  floor is occupied by girls, and the ground floor is used by the boys' school. A joint sports hall is used by both boys and girls with a separation barrier. The dining room has a folding dividing partition. A new food technology room is located between the Girls and Boys schools and is also shared.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nThe school has a computer room (which students often call 'the dungeon' due to its positioning below ground level), a library, many science labs, and art and design rooms; it also features a lecture theatre, a large assembly hall, a sports hall, as well as specialised classrooms for subjects such as Mathematics, English, Modern Foreign Languages and the Humanities. The old gym has been redeveloped to create the school library, the wing where the English department is placed, and a Sixth Form study area.\n\n===Sports hall===\nIn October 2006, a new sports hall was officially opened and is shared by students attending both schools. The hall includes two gyms, a dance/drama studio, a mini-cafeteria, two classrooms, and a fitness room. The building includes a lift for the disabled, as does the library.\n\n===New extension===\nIn the new 2016/2017 term, a new extension was opened, providing new classrooms and science laboratories. The extra classrooms were necessitated by the change from 3 forms per year to 4, resulting in approximately 30 extra students per year.\n\n===Sixth form block===\nThe start of the 2018/19 term saw a new renovation of the sixth form block featuring a shared common room area with the girls school and a dining area which serves hot/cold food and drinks.\n\n==Specialist status==\n\nThe school has been granted Specialist College status{{clarify|date=October 2019}} in three specialisms: [[Science College|Science]] (including [[Maths]]), [[Humanities College|Humanities]] and Applied Learning.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Sports==\n\nThe sports played at Camp Hill are seasonal: rugby and hockey in the Winter term and Spring term; in the Summer term: cricket and athletics are the main sports. Other sports include basketball, fitness, gymnastics, and tennis. [[Sixth form]] students may play [[Association football|football]] during games periods, and seniors (Years 11\u201313) especially the [[sixth form]] have the opportunity to play a wide variety of sports, including football, hockey, rugby, cricket, athletics, basketball, badminton, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, squash and tennis.  All  students are required  to take part in certain house events (known as Standards) - cross-country, swimming and athletics.

This was the school location which JRR Tolkien thoroughly disliked, after the idyllic country life in Sarehole Mill (now a Birmingham suburb). It opened at its intended site at [[Camp Hill, West Midlands|Camp Hill]] in Birmingham, near the city centre in September 1883, and moved to its current location, adjacent to Kings Heath Park, in 1956. Camp Hill Boys celebrated its 50-year jubilee in 2007 with a concert at Symphony Hall and the burial of a time capsule to be opened in another 50 years' time. It celebrated its House Centenary in 2007-8, with special events throughout the year that are not normally part of the house competition e.g. [[Five-a-side football|5-a-side football]].\n\n==Admission==\n\nAdmission to Camp Hill is based upon success in the 11+ exam along with consideration of proximity to the school.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoolsofkingedwardvi.co.uk/admissions-policy-2020/|title=New Admissions Policy 2020|website=The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham}}</ref> It is also guaranteed that at least 25% of students admitted will be 'Pupil Premium Pupils', which are pupils whose families will have received free school meals at some point in the six years prior to application.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Those living outside the catchment are able to attend Camp Hill, but only if they achieve a very high score in the 11+, and the quota for catchment pupils is not filled.<ref name=\"auto\"/> This admissions policy replaced the previous one for admissions starting in 2020. Previously, no weight was attached to proximity to the school, and the quote for Pupil Premium Pupils was 20%.\n\n===Admissions controversy 2020===\nFor the academic year starting in 2020, changes were made to admissions criteria by The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham, the body which oversees the running of Camp Hill and the other King Edward schools in Birmingham.<ref name=\"auto\"/> These changes were praised by some but were largely controversial, with only 27% of those consulted supporting the plans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/savebirminghamgrammars|title=Help raise \u00a33000 to fight a new admissions system which is arbitrary and illogical.

In public consultation, many concerns were raised about the catchment areas, including that they may be designed to increase applications to the private schools of KES, overseen by the same body. These concerns were brushed aside by the Schools of King Edward VI, which explained them as affluent parents outside Birmingham being disappointed at their loss of entitlement to a grammar school place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schoolsofkingedwardvi.co.uk/2018/12/18/admissions-policy-2020/|title=Admissions Policy 2020|date=18 December 2018|website=The Schools of King Edward VI in Birmingham}}</ref> The BBC and others published articles on the changes,<ref name=\"auto2\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2019/04/09/grammar-school-parents-revolt-plans-drop-entry-marks-disadvantaged/|title=Grammar school parents in revolt over plans to drop entry marks for disadvantaged pupils|first=Camilla|last=Turner|date=9 April 2019|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> but all largely ignored the concerns about the catchment area, focussing instead on the issue of increased admission of deprived pupils, and the perceived class struggle.

A two-week timetable synchronises the two schools, allowing for shares lessons for A-level subjects of Music, German and Computer Science. The fields, tennis courts, schoolyards and the main school buildings are not shared. There is a shared swimming pool used separately by boys and girls. The [[sixth form]] block is a shared facility in  which  the top  floor is occupied by girls, and the ground floor is used by the boys' school. A joint sports hall is used by both boys and girls with a separation barrier. The dining room has a folding dividing partition. A new food technology room is located between the Girls and Boys schools and is also shared.\n\n==Facilities==\n\nThe school has a computer room (which students often call 'the dungeon' due to its positioning below ground level), a library, many science labs, and art and design rooms; it also features a lecture theatre, a large assembly hall, a sports hall, as well as specialised classrooms for subjects such as Mathematics, English, Modern Foreign Languages and the Humanities. The old gym has been redeveloped to create the school library, the wing where the English department is placed, and a Sixth Form study area.\n\n===Sports hall===\nIn October 2006, a new sports hall was officially opened and is shared by students attending both schools. The hall includes two gyms, a dance/drama studio, a mini-cafeteria, two classrooms, and a fitness room. The building includes a lift for the disabled, as does the library.\n\n===New extension===\nIn the new 2016/2017 term, a new extension was opened, providing new classrooms and science laboratories. The extra classrooms were necessitated by the change from 3 forms per year to 4, resulting in approximately 30 extra students per year.\n\n===Sixth form block===\nThe start of the 2018/19 term saw a new renovation of the sixth form block featuring a shared common room area with the girls school and a dining area which serves hot/cold food and drinks.\n\n==Specialist status==\n\nThe school has been granted Specialist College status{{clarify|date=October 2019}} in three specialisms: [[Science College|Science]] (including [[Maths]]), [[Humanities College|Humanities]] and Applied Learning.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Sports==\n\nThe sports played at Camp Hill are seasonal: rugby and hockey in the Winter term and Spring term; in the Summer term: cricket and athletics are the main sports. Other sports include basketball, fitness, gymnastics, and tennis. [[Sixth form]] students may play [[Association football|football]] during games periods, and seniors (Years 11\u201313) especially the [[sixth form]] have the opportunity to play a wide variety of sports, including football, hockey, rugby, cricket, athletics, basketball, badminton, volleyball, table tennis, swimming, squash and tennis.  All  students are required  to take part in certain house events (known as Standards) - cross-country, swimming and athletics. Other off-curriculum sports  include fencing,  swimming,  and rugby and cricket training after school.\n\n==Student volunteering==\nStudents have many opportunities to help the school through many positions, and these require students to give up some of their in-school free time.\n\n===Prefects===\nEvery year, 40-55 new Year 12 prefects are voted in by teachers and the Year 12 students.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering to an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) entrance and in nWo gear. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\n\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt and John Cena was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Wyatt and Cena suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to an episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering in an [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo]] shirt. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (with [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar then came back with three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. McIntyre then countered an F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks to win the match and the championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.
