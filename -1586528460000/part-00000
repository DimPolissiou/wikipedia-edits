{"title_page": "Hypothetico-deductive model", "text_new": "The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of the [[scientific method]].   ,According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.

The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition|contrapositive]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.

Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification.

A a company of soldiers called [[Kouretes]] danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry.\n\n===King of the gods===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at [[Pytho]] under the glens of [[Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, the [[Omphalos]]) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[emetic]] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's [[stomach]] open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and the [[Cyclopes]], from their dungeon in [[Tartarus]], killing their guard, [[Campe]].\n\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him [[thunder]] and the thunderbolt, or [[lightning]], which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the [[Titanomachy]]. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.[[File:Zeus Getty Villa.jpg|thumb|First century statue of Zeus]]\n\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also [[Penthus]]).\n\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the [[monster]]s [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under [[Mount Etna]], but left Echidna and her children alive.\n\n===Conflicts with humans===\n<!-- Since Greek mythology, as far as I understand, is essentially a loose collection of stories told by several groups in Ancient Greece where none can be considered the \"official canon\", this should really be prefaced with \"In the writings of (Greek author)...\" or \"In (work)...\", and several of the sentences describe details that probably vary by telling. -->\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by [[human sacrifice]] and other signs of human decadence. He decided to wipe out mankind and flooded the world with the help of his brother [[Poseidon]]. After the flood, only [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]] remained.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allabouthistory.org/greek-gods.htm|title=Greek Gods|website=AllAboutHistory.org|accessdate=2015-12-02}}</ref> This [[Flood myth|flood narrative]] is a common motif in mythology.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flood {{pipe}} The Oxford Companion to World Mythology |first= David |last=Leeming |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004  |accessdate=14 February 2019 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&pg=PA138 |isbn= 9780195156690 }}</ref>[[File:The Chariot of Zeus - Project Gutenberg eText 14994.png|thumb|The Chariot of Zeus, from an 1879 ''Stories from the Greek Tragedians'' by Alfred Church.]]\n\nThroughout history Zeus has been depicted as using violence to get his way and terrorize humans.

By Hera, Zeus sired [[Ares]], [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] and [[Hephaestus]], though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone. Some also include [[Eileithyia]], [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], [[Enyo]] and [[Angelos (Greek mythology)|Angelos]] as their daughters. In the section of the Iliad known to scholars as the [[Deception of Zeus]], the two of them are described as having begun their sexual relationship without their parents knowing about it.<ref>Iliad, Book 14, line 294</ref> The conquests of Zeus among [[nymph]]s and the mythic mortal progenitors of [[Greeks|Hellenic]] dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with [[Leto]], [[Demeter]], [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]], [[Themis]], [[Eurynome (Oceanid)|Eurynome]] and [[Mnemosyne]].<ref>''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886&ndash;900].</ref><ref>''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+901 901&ndash;911].</ref> Other relationships with immortals included [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]] and [[Maia (mythology)|Maia]].

For a time, a [[nymph]] named [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by talking incessantly, and when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.\n\n=== Transformation of Zeus ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Love interest\n!Disguises\n|-\n|[[Aegina (mythology)|Aegina]]\n|an eagle or a flame of fire\n|-\n|[[Alcmene]]\n|[[Amphitryon]]\n|-\n|[[Antiope of Thebes|Antiope]]\n|a [[satyr]]\n|-\n|[[Asopis]]\n|a flame of fire\n|-\n|[[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]]\n|Artemis\n|-\n|[[Cassiopeia (wife of Phoenix)|Cassiopeia]]\n|[[Phoenix of Phoenicia|Phoenix]]\n|-\n|[[Dana\u00eb|Danae]]\n|shower of gold\n|-\n|[[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]]\n|a bull\n|-\n|[[Eurymedousa|Eurymedusa]]\n|ant\n|-\n|[[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]\n|an eagle\n|-\n|Imandra\n|a shower\n|-\n|[[Lamia]]\n|a lapwing\n|-\n|[[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]\n|a swan and a star\n|-\n|[[Manthea]]\n|a bear\n|-\n|Mnemosyne\n|a shepherd\n|-\n|[[Nemesis]]\n|a goose\n|-\n|[[Persephone]]\n|a serpent\n|-\n|[[Semele]]\n|a fire\n|-\n|[[Thalia (nymph)|Thalia]]\n|a vulture\n|}\n\n===Consorts and offspring===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<big>Comparative table of Zeus' family</big>\n!Divine Lovers\n!Offspring\n!Divine Lovers\n!Offspring\n!Mortal Consort\n!Offspring\n|-\n|[[Aega (goddess)|Aega]] or\n| rowspan=\"3\" |\u2022 [[Aegipan]]<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 155</ref>\n| rowspan=\"21\" |[[Themis]]\n|\u2022 [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]]\n|Alcmene\n|\u2022 [[Heracles]]\n|-\n|Aix or\n|\u2022 [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]]\n|Anaxithea\n|\u2022 [[Olenus]]<ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\n====Zeus Velchanos====\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed,<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:23.</ref> and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\",<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', \"The Minoan belief-system\" (Routledge) 1990:125</ref> whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.\n\nIn [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.<ref>Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.</ref> On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.<ref>A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.</ref> Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.<ref>Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.</ref>\n\nThe stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].<ref>\"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period \u2014 [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] \u2014 so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos\" (Castleden 1990:125</ref> With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],<ref>Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).</ref> together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.<ref>\"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth\" (Dietrich 1973:15).</ref>\nThe Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian [[patristic]] writers took up the suggestion.\n\n====Zeus Lykaios====\n{{details|Lykaia}}\n\n[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360\u2013340 BC ([[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]]).]]\nThe epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection<ref>In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]]. Zeus overturned the table and struck the house of Lyceus with a thunderbolt; his patronage at the Lykaia can have been little more than a formula.</ref> with the rituals and myths of this primitive [[rite of passage]] with an ancient threat of [[cannibalism]] and the possibility of a [[werewolf]] transformation for the [[ephebos|ephebes]] who were the participants.<ref>A morphological connection to ''lyke'' \"brightness\" may be merely fortuitous.</ref> Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place<ref>Modern archaeologists have found no trace of human remains among the sacrificial detritus, [[Walter Burkert]], \"Lykaia and Lykaion\", ''Homo Necans'', tr. by Peter Bing ([[University of California]]) 1983, p. 90.</ref> was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 8.38.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Plato]],<ref>''Republic'' 565d-e</ref>  a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal's. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"twilight\", {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).<ref>A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press</ref>[[File:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|A statue of Zeus in a drawing.]]\n\n====Additional cults of Zeus====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' (\"earthy\"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' (\"under-the-earth\") and '''Zeus Plousios''' (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]'''. [[Strabo]] mention that at [[Tralles]] there was the '''Zeus Larisaeus'''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D42 Strabo, Geography,  book 14, chapter 1.42]</ref>\n\n===Non-panhellenic cults===\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', 1st century AD ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome).]]\n\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men.  With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.<ref>Schol. ''ad Pind. Ol.'' vi. 162</ref> Other examples are listed below. As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''', he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].<ref>Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297</ref>\n\n===Oracles of Zeus===\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Ba\u02bfal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.\n\n====The Oracle at Dodona====\n\nThe cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.<ref>''Odyssey'' 14.326-7</ref> By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus' consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\n==== The Oracle at Siwa ====\nThe [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.18.</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].\n\n==Gnostic literature==\n[[Pistis Sophia]], a piece belonging to [[Gnosticism]] shown to date back at least to the 4th century AD,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Birger A.

He, along with [[Dionysus]], absorbed the role of the chief [[Phrygia]]n god [[Sabazios]] in the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] deity known in Rome as [[Sabazius]]. The Seleucid ruler [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem.<ref>2 Maccabees 6:2</ref> Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as [[Baal]] Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).<ref>David Syme Russel. ''Daniel''. (Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox Press, 1981) 191.</ref>\n\n==Zeus and the sun==\n\nZeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic [[sun god]], [[Helios]], who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus' eye,<ref>Sick, David H. (2004), \"Mit(h)ra(s) and the Myths of the Sun\", Numen, 51 (4): 432\u2013467, {{JSTOR|3270454}}</ref> or clearly implied as such. [[Hesiod]], for instance, describes Zeus' eye as effectively the sun.<ref>Ljuba Merlina Bortolani, Magical Hymns from Roman Egypt: A Study of Greek and Egyptian Traditions of Divinity, Cambridge University Press, 13/10/2016</ref> This perception is possibly derived from earlier [[Proto-Indo-European religion]], in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of [[Dyeus|*''Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25<sub>a</sub>t\u1e17r'']] (see [[Hvare-khshaeta]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin Litchfield|authorlink=Martin Litchfield West|title=Indo-European Poetry and Myth|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|isbn=978-0-19-928075-9|url=http://library.globalchalet.net/Authors/Poetry%20Books%20Collection/Indo-European%20Poetry%20and%20Myth.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2017|pages=194\u2013196|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Crete|Cretan]] Zeus [[Talos|Tallaios]] had solar elements to his cult. \"Talos\" was the local equivalent of Helios.<ref>Karl Kerenyi, The Gods of the Greeks 1951:110.</ref>\n\n==Zeus in philosophy==\n\nIn [[Neoplatonism]], Zeus' relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the [[Demiurge]] or Divine [[nous|Mind]]. Specifically within [[Plotinus]]'s work the ''[[Enneads]]''<ref>In Fourth Tractate 'Problems of the Soul' The Demiurge is identified as Zeus.10. \"When under the name of Zeus we are considering the Demiurge we must leave out all notions of stage and progress, and recognize one unchanging and timeless life.\"</ref> and the ''Platonic Theology'' of [[Proclus]].\n\n==Zeus in the Bible==\n\nZeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice, first in Acts 14:8\u201313: When the people living in [[Lystra]] saw the [[Apostle Paul]] heal a lame man, they considered Paul and his partner [[Barnabas]] to be gods, identifying Paul with [[Hermes]] and Barnabas with Zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. Two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city.<ref>[http://www.searchgodsword.org/enc/isb/view.cgi?number=T5958 The translation of Hermes]</ref> One of the inscriptions refers to the \"priests of Zeus\", and the other mentions \"Hermes Most Great\"\" and \"Zeus the sun-god\".<ref>The International Standard Bible Encyclopaedia, edited by J.

Since Saturn (Cronus) ruled over the [[Earth]], the [[heaven]]s and the [[sea]], she hid him by dangling him on a [[rope]] from a [[tree]] so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.\n# According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html#1 1.1.5-7])) Zeus was raised by a [[goat]] named [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]] in a cave called Dictaeon Antron ([[Psychro Cave]]). A a company of soldiers called [[Kouretes]] danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry.\n\n===King of the gods===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at [[Pytho]] under the glens of [[Parnassus]] to be a sign to mortal men, the [[Omphalos]]) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] gave Cronus an [[emetic]] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus's [[stomach]] open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the [[Hekatonkheires|Hecatonchires]] and the [[Cyclopes]], from their dungeon in [[Tartarus]], killing their guard, [[Campe]].\n\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him [[thunder]] and the thunderbolt, or [[lightning]], which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the [[Titanomachy]]. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.[[File:Zeus Getty Villa.jpg|thumb|First century statue of Zeus]]\n\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Hades]], by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also [[Penthus]]).\n\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia's other children, the [[monster]]s [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna (mythology)|Echidna]]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under [[Mount Etna]], but left Echidna and her children alive.\n\n===Conflicts with humans===\n<!-- Since Greek mythology, as far as I understand, is essentially a loose collection of stories told by several groups in Ancient Greece where none can be considered the \"official canon\", this should really be prefaced with \"In the writings of (Greek author)...\" or \"In (work)...\", and several of the sentences describe details that probably vary by telling. -->\nWhen Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by [[human sacrifice]] and other signs of human decadence.

Their quadrennial [[festival]] featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries' worth of animals sacrificed there.\n\nOutside of the major inter-[[polis]] sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of [[Greek temple]]s from [[Asia Minor]] to [[Sicily]]. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\n\n====Zeus Velchanos====\n\nWith one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed,<ref>Durant, ''The Life of Greece'' (''The Story of Civilization'' Part II, New York: Simon & Schuster) 1939:23.</ref> and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\",<ref>Rodney Castleden, ''Minoans: Life in Bronze-Age Crete'', \"The Minoan belief-system\" (Routledge) 1990:125</ref> whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an [[epithet]] by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as '''Zeus Velchanos''' (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the ''[[Kouros]]''.\n\nIn [[Crete]], Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at [[Knossos]], [[Mount Ida, Crete|Ida]] and [[Palaikastro]]. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the [[Hagia Triada]] site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from [[Phaistos]] show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees.<ref>Pointed out by Bernard Clive Dietrich, ''The Origins of Greek Religion'' (de Gruyter) 1973:15.</ref> On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage.<ref>A.B. Cook, ''Zeus'' Cambridge University Press, 1914, I, figs 397, 398.</ref> Inscriptions at [[Gortyn]] and Lyttos record a ''Velchania'' festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.<ref>Dietrich 1973, noting [[Martin P. Nilsson]], ''Minoan-Mycenaean Religion, and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' 1950:551 and notes.</ref>\n\nThe stories of [[Minos]] and [[Epimenides]] suggest that these caves were once used for [[Incubation (ritual)|incubatory]] divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of [[Plato]]'s ''Laws'' is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as ''ho megas kouros'', \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the [[Labyrinth]] at [[Knossos]] by [[Sir Arthur Evans]].<ref>\"Professor [[Stylianos Alexiou]] reminds us that there were other divine boys who survived from the religion of the pre-Hellenic period \u2014 [[Linos]], [[Ploutos]] and [[Dionysos]] \u2014 so not all the young male deities we see depicted in Minoan works of art are necessarily Velchanos\" (Castleden 1990:125</ref> With the [[Kouretes]], a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan ''[[paideia]]''.\n\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, [[Callimachus]],<ref>Richard Wyatt Hutchinson, ''Prehistoric Crete'', (Harmondsworth: Penguin) 1968:204, mentions that there is no classical reference to the death of Zeus (noted by Dietrich 1973:16 note 78).</ref> together with the assertion of [[Antoninus Liberalis]] that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a [[Bees (mythology)|mythic swarm of bees]], suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.<ref>\"This annually reborn god of vegetation also experienced the other parts of the vegetation cycle: holy marriage and annual death when he was thought to disappear from the earth\" (Dietrich 1973:15).</ref>\nThe Hellenistic writer [[Euhemerus]] apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of [[Crete]] and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian [[patristic]] writers took up the suggestion.\n\n====Zeus Lykaios====\n{{details|Lykaia}}\n\n[[File:Stater Zeus Lampsacus CdM.jpg|thumb|[[Laurel wreath|Laurel-wreathed]] head of Zeus on a gold [[stater]], [[Lampsacus]], c 360\u2013340 BC ([[Cabinet des M\u00e9dailles]]).]]\nThe epithet '''Zeus Lykaios''' (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the [[Lykaia]] on the slopes of [[Lycaeus|Mount Lykaion]] (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic [[Arcadia]]; Zeus had only a formal connection<ref>In the founding myth of [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]]'s banquet for the gods that included the flesh of a human sacrifice, perhaps one of his sons, [[Nyctimus]] or [[Arcas]].

Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]]; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\n\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that ''Lykaios'' or ''Lykeios'' (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] *{{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cd\u03ba\u03b7}}, \"twilight\", {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2}}, \"year\" (lit. \"light's course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new 'light' to the matter as [[Achaeus of Eretria|Achaeus]], the contemporary tragedian of [[Sophocles]], spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by [[Cicero]]. Again under this new signification may be seen [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' descriptions of Lykosoura being 'the first city that ever the sun beheld', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and 'facing the sun-rise'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as 'god of light' (Lykaios).<ref>A. B. Cook ('''1914'''), ''Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion'', Vol. I, p.63, Cambridge University Press</ref>[[File:Statue of Zeus.jpg|thumb|A statue of Zeus in a drawing.]]\n\n====Additional cults of Zeus====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\nAlthough etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored '''Zeus Meilichios''' (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had '''Zeus Chthonios''' (\"earthy\"), '''Zeus Katachthonios''' (\"under-the-earth\") and '''Zeus Plousios''' (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did [[chthonic]] deities like [[Persephone]] and [[Demeter]], and also the [[hero]]es at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\n\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the ''daimon'' to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in [[Boeotia]] might belong to the hero [[Trophonius]] or to '''Zeus Trephonius''' (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], or [[Strabo]]. The hero [[Amphiaraus]] was honored as '''Zeus Amphiaraus''' at Oropus outside of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], and the Spartans even had a shrine to '''Zeus Agamemnon'''. Ancient [[Molossians|Molossian]] kings sacrificed to '''[[Zeus Areius]]'''. [[Strabo]] mention that at [[Tralles]] there was the '''Zeus Larisaeus'''.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0239%3Abook%3D14%3Achapter%3D1%3Asection%3D42 Strabo, Geography,  book 14, chapter 1.42]</ref>\n\n===Non-panhellenic cults===\n[[File:Museo Barracco - Giove Ammone 1010637.JPG|thumb|Roman cast [[terracotta]] of ram-horned ''Jupiter Ammon'', 1st century AD ([[Museo Barracco]], Rome).]]\n\nIn addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men.  With the epithet '''Zeus [[Aetnaeus]]''' he was worshiped on [[Mount Etna|Mount Aetna]], where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor.<ref>Schol. ''ad Pind. Ol.'' vi. 162</ref> Other examples are listed below. As '''Zeus Aeneius''' or '''Zeus Aenesius''', he was worshiped in the island of [[Cephalonia]], where he had a temple on [[Mount Ainos|Mount Aenos]].<ref>Hesiod, according to a scholium on Apollonius of Rhodes. ''Argonautika'', ii. 297</ref>\n\n===Oracles of Zeus===\nAlthough most oracle sites were usually dedicated to [[Apollo]], the heroes, or various goddesses like [[Themis]], a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as [[Ba\u02bfal]]'s at [[Heliopolis (Syria)|Heliopolis]], were [[interpretatio graeca|associated]] with Zeus in Greek or [[Jupiter]] in Latin.\n\n====The Oracle at Dodona====\n\nThe cult of Zeus at [[Dodona]] in [[Epirus]], where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called ''Selloi'', who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches.<ref>''Odyssey'' 14.326-7</ref> By the time [[Herodotus]] wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called [[peleiades]] (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\n\nZeus' consort at Dodona was not [[Hera]], but the goddess [[Dione (Titaness/Oceanid)|Dione]] \u2014 whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a [[Titan (mythology)|titaness]] suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\n\n==== The Oracle at Siwa ====\nThe [[oracle of Ammon]] at the [[Siwa Oasis]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: [[Herodotus]] mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]]. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at [[Sparta]], where a temple to him existed by the time of the [[Peloponnesian War]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] 3.18.</ref>\n\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a [[Libyan Sibyl]].\n\n==Gnostic literature==\n[[Pistis Sophia]], a piece belonging to [[Gnosticism]] shown to date back at least to the 4th century AD,<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Birger A.
