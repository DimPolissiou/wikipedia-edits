San Diego officially became part of the U.S. in 1848, and the town was named the county seat of [[San Diego County]] when California was granted statehood in 1850. It remained a very small town for several decades, but grew rapidly after 1880 due to development and the establishment of multiple military facilities. Growth was especially rapid during and immediately after World War II. Entrepreneurs and boosters laid the basis for an economy based today on the military, defense industries, tourism, international trade, and manufacturing. San Diego is now the eighth largest city in the country and forms the heart of the larger [[San Diego metropolitan area]].\n[[File:Parque Balboa - San Diego, California.jpg|thumb|right|250|[[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], site of the California Pacific International Exposition, in 1935-36]]\n\n==Pre-colonial and colonial period (Prehistory&ndash;1821)==\n[[File:2006.03.07.us.ca.SDcabrilho.jpg|left|thumb|240px|Cabrillo National Monument, San Diego]]\nThe area has long been inhabited by the [[Kumeyaay]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people.

The resident \"[[Californio]]s\" became American citizens with full voting rights. California was admitted to the Union as a state in 1850. San Diego, still little more than a village, was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on March 27 as a city and was named the [[county seat]] of the newly established [[San Diego County]].<ref name=\"Cornerstone77\">{{cite book|title=San Diego: California's Cornerstone|author=Engstrand, Iris|page=77|publisher=[[Sunbelt Publications]]|date=2005|isbn=978-0-932653-72-7}}</ref> The [[United States Census]] reported the population of the town as 650 in 1850 and 731 in 1860.<ref>[https://www.sandiegohistory.org/links/sandiegopopulation.htm San Diego Historical Society population table]</ref>\n\nSan Diego promptly got into financial trouble due to overspending on a poorly designed jail. In 1852 the state repealed the city charter, in effect declaring the city bankrupt, and installed a state-controlled three-member board of trustees to manage San Diego. The trustees stayed in control until 1887, when a mayor-council form of government was installed under a new city charter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2010/dec/01/city-light-bankruptcy-san-diego/|title=Bankruptcy \u2014 Good for San Diego|last=Bauder|first=Don|date=December 1, 2010|work=San Diego Reader|accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAlthough some 10,000 men stopped briefly in San Diego on their way to the San Francisco gold fields, few stayed, and San Diego remained sparsely settled during much of the 1850s. Despite its small population, this decade brought investors who saw the potential of San Diego. They bought lots, and built rough houses and shops. One, [[William Heath Davis]], spent $60,000 constructing a wharf near the property he had purchased near the foot of today's Market Street. Remembered as \"Davis' Folly\", it was completed by August 1851, but was seldom used. In 1853, the steamer ''Los Angeles'' collided with the wharf. The damage was never repaired. Unused and poorly built, the damage was not worth fixing. Davis tried unsuccessfully to sell it. Finally, in 1862, the Army destroyed it, using timbers for firewood.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Gayle ''San Diego, Another HarborTown History''</ref>\n\nThe failure of the wharf was only one indication of depressed times. Houses were dismantled and shipped to more promising settlements. By 1860, many of the enterprises that had been established during the early 1850s had closed. The few businesses that survived suffered from water shortages, high costs of shipping, and a declining population.<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''San Diego, Another HarborTown History''</ref> Davis, however, kept trying. He laid out the grid system the streets, speculated in land in the business district, and constructed hotels and stores. When he ran out of money, leadership in boosterism passed to [[Alonzo Horton]].<ref>Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985)</ref> The town seemed rundown in 1867 when Horton arrived, but he could only see glittering opportunity: \"I have been nearly all over the world and it seemed to me to be the best spot for building a city I ever saw.\" He was convinced that the town needed a location nearer the water to improve trade. Within a month of his arrival, he had purchased more than 900 acres of today's downtown for a total of $265, an average of 27.5 cents an acre. He began promoting San Diego by enticing entrepreneurs and residents.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> He built a wharf and began to promote development there. The area was referred to as New Town or the Horton Addition. Despite opposition from the residents of the original settlement, which became known as \"Old Town\", businesses and residents flocked to New Town, and San Diego experienced the first of its many real estate booms. In 1871, government records were moved to a new county courthouse in New Town, and by the 1880s New Town (or [[Downtown San Diego|downtown]]) had totally eclipsed Old Town as the heart of the growing city.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RhCQUf1XQ84C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=san+diego+%22new+town%22+horton&source=bl&ots=GKkR85eStS&sig=vemB-wSUJKMgseQu6P_1wXMdanU&hl=en&ei=ZdOrSv3FEY_oM-PK2fIN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=san%20diego%20%22new%20town%22%20horton&f=false Engstrand, Iris Wilson, California\u2019s Cornerstone, Sunbelt Publications, Inc., 2005, p. 80]</ref>\n\nIn 1878, San Diego was predicted to become a rival of San Francisco's trading ports. To prevent that, the manager of [[Central Pacific Railroad]] [[Charles Crocker]], decided not to build an extension to San Diego, fearing that it would take too much trade from San Francisco. In 1885, a transcontinental railroad route came to San Diego, and the population boomed, reaching 16,159 by 1890. In 1906 the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] of [[John D. Spreckels]] was built to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinental rail link to the east by connecting with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] lines in [[El Centro, California]]. It became the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]]. In 1933 the Spreckels heirs sold it to the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]].\n\nIn 1912 Council restrictions on soapbox oratories led to the [[San Diego free speech fight]], a confrontation between the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] on the one side and law enforcement and vigilantes on the other.\n\n{{US Census population\n|1850=500\n|1860=731|\n|1870=2300|\n|1880=2637|\n|1890=16159|\n|1900=17700|\n|1910=39578|\n|1920=74361|\n|1930=147995|\n|1940=203341|\n|1950=333865|\n|1960=573224|\n|1970=696769|\n|1980=875538|\n|1990=1110549|\n|2000=1223400|\n|2010=1307402\n|estyear=\n|estimate=\n|estref=\n|}}\n\n==Emergence of a regional city (1900&ndash;1941)==\nThe city grew in bursts, especially in the 1880s and again from 1900 to 1930, when it reached 148,000.<ref>Riley Moffatt, ''Population History of Western U.S. Cities & Towns, 1850\u20131990'' (1996) p. 54</ref>\n\n===The Gibraltar of the Pacific===\nIn the 1890\u20131914 period the nation became greatly interested in Pacific naval affairs, as seen in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898; the U.S. acquisition of [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Hawaii]]; and the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.

But it was overshadowed by both San Francisco and Los Angeles. Businessman John D. Spreckels expressed the enthusiasm of San Diego's boosters in 1923, as well as the disappointment that it had not fully developed.: \n:\"Why did I come to San Diego? Why did any of you come? We came because we thought we saw an unusual opportunity here. We believed that everything pointed to this as the logical site for a great city and seaport. In short, we had faith in San Diego's future. We gave of our time and our strength and our means...to help develop our city, and naturally, our own fortunes. ... What is the matter with San Diego?

For example, wealthy heiress [[Ellen Browning Scripps]] underwrote many public facilities in [[La Jolla]], was a key supporter of the fledgling [[San Diego Zoo]], and together with her brother [[E. W. Scripps]] established the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].<ref>Molly McClain, \"The Scripps Family's San Diego Experiment,\" ''Journal of San Diego History'' (2010) 56#1 pp 1-30</ref> Another notable philanthropist of this era was [[George Marston]], businessman and owner of Marston's Department Store. Wanting to see [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] become a grand city park like those in other cities, he hired architect [[John Nolen]] on two occasions, 1908 and 1926, to develop a master plan for the park. In 1907 he bought Presidio Hill, site of the original [[Presidio of San Diego]], which had fallen into ruins. Recognizing its importance as the site of the first European settlement in California, he developed it into a park (planned by Nolen) with his own funds, and built the Serra Museum (designed by architect [[William Templeton Johnson]]). In 1929 he donated the park to the city, which still owns and operates it; it is now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/bio/marston/marston.htm|title=George White Marston (1850-1946)|work=San Diego History Center|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Great Depression===\nSan Diego met the challenge of the Great Depression better than most parts of the country. The population of San Diego County grew 38%, from 210,000 to 290,000, from 1930 to 1940, while the city itself went from 148,000 to 203,000 \u2013 a much better rate than the state as a whole. There was money enough to build a new municipal golf course and tennis courts, to improve the water system, and open a new Spanish-style campus for San Diego State College (now [[San Diego State University]]). The New Deal used PWA relief money to expand the fleet, bringing more money into the city.  In 1935 the entire Pacific Fleet assembled with 48 warships, 400 naval aircraft, 55,000 sailors and 3000 officers to demonstrate the importance of sea power to the city, and to exhibit to Japan and the rest of the world America's interest in the Pacific.  The expansion of naval and army aviation led Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of Buffalo New York to bring all its 800 employees to San Diego, opening a major assembly plant, [[Convair]], which built Navy flying boats. [[Ryan Aeronautical Company]], which built the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'' for the famous 1927 flight of [[Charles Lindbergh]], also flourished. The 7.2 million visitors to the California-Pacific International Exposition in 1935\u201336 were impressed with the city's prosperity, as well as the 400 exhibits from 23 nations.<ref>Kevin Starr, \"Gibraltar of the Pacific: San Diego Joins the Navy,\" in Starr, ''The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s'' (1997) pp 90\u201392, 114\u201315</ref>\n\n==War and postwar period (1941&ndash;present)==\nSince [[World War I]], the military has played a leading role in the local economy. [[World War II]] brought prosperity and gave millions of soldiers, sailors and airmen en route to the Pacific a view of the opportunities in California.  The aircraft factories grew from small handcraft shops to gigantic factories.<ref>Shragge, \"'A new federal city': San Diego during World War II\"</ref>  The city's population soared from 200,000 to 340,000, as the Navy and Marines opened training facilities and the aircraft factories doubled their employment rosters every few months.  With 40,000 to 50,000 sailors off duty every weekend, the downtown entertainment districts soon became saturated.  The [[red-light district]] was officially shut down, but opportunities were easily available a few miles south in Tijuana, Mexico.  Workers poured in from the towns and from across the country, creating a severe housing shortage.  Public transportation (trolleys and buses) could barely keep up with the demand, and automobiles were rationed to only 3 gallons a week.  Many wives who relocated while their husbands were training stayed in the city when their men shipped out and took high-paying  jobs in the defense industries.<ref>Lotchin, The Bad City in the Good War p194-96, 207</ref>  The dramatic increase in the need for fresh water led the Navy in 1944 to build the [[San Diego Aqueduct]] to import water from the Colorado River; the city financed the second pipeline in 1952 <ref>Starr, ''Golden Dreams'' p 61</ref> By 1990, San Diego was the sixth [[List of most populous cities in the United States by decade|largest city in the United States]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Roderick |first=Kevin |first2=Anne C. |last2=Roark |date=26 January 1991 |title=Largest Cities Reflect Shift to West, 1990 Census Finds : Population: Los Angeles beats out Chicago as No. 2 in U.S. California lists 18 of 29 places reaching 100,000. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-26/news/mn-704_1_los-angeles |work= Los Angeles Times |access-date=4 May 2018 }}<br/>{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=Lucinda |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Richard W. |date=Summer 1995 |title=Vision of Paradise |url=http://sandiegohistory.org/journal/1995/july/visions-3/ |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |publisher=San Diego Historical Society |volume=41 |issue=3 |chapter=Big City Vision (1970-1990) |chapter-url=http://sandiegohistory.org/journal/1995/july/chapter21/ |access-date=4 May 2018 }}<br/>{{cite book|author=Kevin Starr|title=Coast of Dreams: California on the Edge, 1990-2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGOKDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA374|date=February 2006|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-679-74072-8|page=374}}<br/>{{cite book|author1=Rub\u00e9n G.

In 1954 it was bought out and became the Convair Division of [[General Dynamics]], a large aerospace conglomerate based in Texas.  Convair had been highly successful in the 1950s with the [[B-36]], a very long-range bomber that became the workhorse of the [[Strategic Air Command]].  General Dynamics refocused Convair on commercial aviation as the [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 240]], a two- engine passenger plane, proved highly successful in the world market.  Convair decided to move up to the very rapidly growing world market for medium-range jet passenger planes with the [[Convair 880]].  It was designed to rival Boeing's proposed 707, and Douglas's proposed DC-8. Financial and technical delays left Convair lagging far behind.  After heavy losses, General Dynamics moved all the airplane elements to Texas, and left the San Diego factory with small-scale space and missile projects.  Convair's employment fell to 3300 in San Diego.<ref>Starr, ''Golden Dreams'' p 82</ref>\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the military shrunk and so did defense spending. San Diego has since become a center of the emerging biotech industry and is home to telecommunications giant [[Qualcomm]].

For years UC operated an extension program in San Diego. In 1960, following wartime and postwar increases in population and economic growth in San Diego, UC broke ground for a new campus there, and classes at UCSD began in 1964.  Under [[Richard C. Atkinson]], chancellor from 1980 to 1995, UCSD strengthened its ties with the city of San Diego by encouraging [[technology transfer]] with developing companies, transforming San Diego into a world leader in technology-based industries. Private giving rose from $15 million to nearly $50 million annually, faculty expanded by nearly 50%, and enrollment doubled to about 18,000 students during his chancellorship.<ref>Abraham J.

It was founded in 1897 as San Diego Normal School, a state school for the preparation of teachers, located on Park Avenue in [[University Heights, San Diego|University Heights]]. In 1931 it moved to a larger location on Aztec Mesa, overlooking Mission Valley, at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935 it expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College. In 1970 it became San Diego State University, part of the [[California State University]] system. SDSU has grown to a student body of more than 30,000 and an alumni base of more than 260,000.\n\nThe [[University of San Diego]], a private Catholic school, began as the [[San Diego College for Women]] in 1952, sponsored by the [[Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus]]. In 1957 the campus on a hilltop site called Alcala Park also became home to the Immaculate Heart Major Seminary and St. Francis Minor Seminary. The landmark Immaculata Chapel also opened that year.

It was widely believed that San Diego was selected because it was the preferred choice of President [[Richard Nixon]]. The city and the party were making preparations for the convention when in March 1972 a $400,000 donation to the event by [[ITT Corporation]] was publicized and became a national scandal. In addition, there were ongoing problems with the proposed venue (the [[San Diego Sports Arena]]) and concerns about adequate hotel space. In May 1972 the Republican National Committee voted to move the convention to [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. In response, Mayor [[Pete Wilson]] proclaimed the week of the convention as \"America's Finest City Week\", giving rise to the city's current unofficial slogan \"America's Finest City\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ancona|first=Vincnent S.|date=Fall 1992|title=When the elephants marched out of San Diego|journal=Journal of San Diego History|publisher=San Diego Historical Society|volume=38|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/92fall/elephants.htm}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1996 Republican National Convention]] was held in San Diego in August 1996, headquartered at the [[San Diego Convention Center]].\n\nThe largest annual convention held in San Diego is [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], founded as the Golden State Comic Book Convention in 1970.

The cause was bad loans to Smith-controlled companies, which exceeded the bank's legal lending limit. Smith had used the bank's money for his private business and bribed bank inspectors to cover it up.

It remained a very small town for several decades, but grew rapidly after 1880 due to development and the establishment of multiple military facilities. Growth was especially rapid during and immediately after World War II.

Finally, in 1862, the Army destroyed it, using timbers for firewood.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Gayle ''San Diego, Another HarborTown History''</ref>\n\nThe failure of the wharf was only one indication of depressed times. Houses were dismantled and shipped to more promising settlements. By 1860, many of the enterprises that had been established during the early 1850s had closed. The few businesses that survived suffered from water shortages, high costs of shipping, and a declining population.<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''San Diego, Another HarborTown History''</ref> Davis, however, kept trying. He laid out the grid system the streets, speculated in land in the business district, and constructed hotels and stores. When he ran out of money, leadership in boosterism passed to [[Alonzo Horton]].<ref>Raymond A Mohl, ''The New City: Urban America in the Industrial Age, 1860-1920'' (1985)</ref> The town seemed rundown in 1867 when Horton arrived, but he could only see glittering opportunity: \"I have been nearly all over the world and it seemed to me to be the best spot for building a city I ever saw.\" He was convinced that the town needed a location nearer the water to improve trade. Within a month of his arrival, he had purchased more than 900 acres of today's downtown for a total of $265, an average of 27.5 cents an acre. He began promoting San Diego by enticing entrepreneurs and residents.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> He built a wharf and began to promote development there. The area was referred to as New Town or the Horton Addition. Despite opposition from the residents of the original settlement, which became known as \"Old Town\", businesses and residents flocked to New Town, and San Diego experienced the first of its many real estate booms. In 1871, government records were moved to a new county courthouse in New Town, and by the 1880s New Town (or [[Downtown San Diego|downtown]]) had totally eclipsed Old Town as the heart of the growing city.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RhCQUf1XQ84C&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=san+diego+%22new+town%22+horton&source=bl&ots=GKkR85eStS&sig=vemB-wSUJKMgseQu6P_1wXMdanU&hl=en&ei=ZdOrSv3FEY_oM-PK2fIN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=san%20diego%20%22new%20town%22%20horton&f=false Engstrand, Iris Wilson, California\u2019s Cornerstone, Sunbelt Publications, Inc., 2005, p. 80]</ref>\n\nIn 1878, San Diego was predicted to become a rival of San Francisco's trading ports. To prevent that, the manager of [[Central Pacific Railroad]] [[Charles Crocker]], decided not to build an extension to San Diego, fearing that it would take too much trade from San Francisco. In 1885, a transcontinental railroad route came to San Diego, and the population boomed, reaching 16,159 by 1890. In 1906 the [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] of [[John D. Spreckels]] was built to provide San Diego with a direct transcontinental rail link to the east by connecting with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] lines in [[El Centro, California]]. It became the [[San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway]]. In 1933 the Spreckels heirs sold it to the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]].\n\nIn 1912 Council restrictions on soapbox oratories led to the [[San Diego free speech fight]], a confrontation between the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] on the one side and law enforcement and vigilantes on the other.\n\n{{US Census population\n|1850=500\n|1860=731|\n|1870=2300|\n|1880=2637|\n|1890=16159|\n|1900=17700|\n|1910=39578|\n|1920=74361|\n|1930=147995|\n|1940=203341|\n|1950=333865|\n|1960=573224|\n|1970=696769|\n|1980=875538|\n|1990=1110549|\n|2000=1223400|\n|2010=1307402\n|estyear=\n|estimate=\n|estref=\n|}}\n\n==Emergence of a regional city (1900&ndash;1941)==\nThe city grew in bursts, especially in the 1880s and again from 1900 to 1930, when it reached 148,000.<ref>Riley Moffatt, ''Population History of Western U.S. Cities & Towns, 1850\u20131990'' (1996) p. 54</ref>\n\n===The Gibraltar of the Pacific===\nIn the 1890\u20131914 period the nation became greatly interested in Pacific naval affairs, as seen in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898; the U.S. acquisition of [[Guam]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Hawaii]]; and the opening of the [[Panama Canal]] in 1914.

But it was overshadowed by both San Francisco and Los Angeles. Businessman John D. Spreckels expressed the enthusiasm of San Diego's boosters in 1923, as well as the disappointment that it had not fully developed.: \n:\"Why did I come to San Diego? Why did any of you come? We came because we thought we saw an unusual opportunity here. We believed that everything pointed to this as the logical site for a great city and seaport. In short, we had faith in San Diego's future. We gave of our time and our strength and our means...to help develop our city, and naturally, our own fortunes. ... What is the matter with San Diego? Why is it not the metropolis and seaport that its geographical and other unique advantages entitle it to be?

Progressive Republicans resented the political power of the Southern Pacific Railroad and the role of \"Boss\" Charles Hardy. Reformers organized and fought back beginning with the 1905 municipal election. In 1906, they formed the Roosevelt Republican Club, and in 1907 reformers backed a Nonpartisan League. Led by Edgar Luce, [[George Marston]] and [[Ed Fletcher]], the Roosevelt Republican Club became the [[Lincoln-Roosevelt League|Lincoln-Roosevelt Republican League]]. The mayoralty election of 1909 marked a sweeping victory for the League, as did the 1910 election of [[Hiram Johnson]] as governor.<ref>Grace L.

O'Neall]]) and again in 1917 (against [[Louis J. Wilde]]).  The 1917 race in particular was a classic growth-vs.-beautification debate. Marston argued for better city planning with more open space and grand boulevards; Wilde argued for more business development.

For example, wealthy heiress [[Ellen Browning Scripps]] underwrote many public facilities in [[La Jolla]], was a key supporter of the fledgling [[San Diego Zoo]], and together with her brother [[E. W. Scripps]] established the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]].<ref>Molly McClain, \"The Scripps Family's San Diego Experiment,\" ''Journal of San Diego History'' (2010) 56#1 pp 1-30</ref> Another notable philanthropist of this era was [[George Marston]], businessman and owner of Marston's Department Store. Wanting to see [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]] become a grand city park like those in other cities, he hired architect [[John Nolen]] on two occasions, 1908 and 1926, to develop a master plan for the park. In 1907 he bought Presidio Hill, site of the original [[Presidio of San Diego]], which had fallen into ruins. Recognizing its importance as the site of the first European settlement in California, he developed it into a park (planned by Nolen) with his own funds, and built the Serra Museum (designed by architect [[William Templeton Johnson]]). In 1929 he donated the park to the city, which still owns and operates it; it is now listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/bio/marston/marston.htm|title=George White Marston (1850-1946)|work=San Diego History Center|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Great Depression===\nSan Diego met the challenge of the Great Depression better than most parts of the country. The population of San Diego County grew 38%, from 210,000 to 290,000, from 1930 to 1940, while the city itself went from 148,000 to 203,000 \u2013 a much better rate than the state as a whole. There was money enough to build a new municipal golf course and tennis courts, to improve the water system, and open a new Spanish-style campus for San Diego State College (now [[San Diego State University]]). The New Deal used PWA relief money to expand the fleet, bringing more money into the city.  In 1935 the entire Pacific Fleet assembled with 48 warships, 400 naval aircraft, 55,000 sailors and 3000 officers to demonstrate the importance of sea power to the city, and to exhibit to Japan and the rest of the world America's interest in the Pacific.  The expansion of naval and army aviation led Consolidated Aircraft Corporation of Buffalo New York to bring all its 800 employees to San Diego, opening a major assembly plant, [[Convair]], which built Navy flying boats. [[Ryan Aeronautical Company]], which built the ''[[Spirit of St. Louis]]'' for the famous 1927 flight of [[Charles Lindbergh]], also flourished. The 7.2 million visitors to the California-Pacific International Exposition in 1935\u201336 were impressed with the city's prosperity, as well as the 400 exhibits from 23 nations.<ref>Kevin Starr, \"Gibraltar of the Pacific: San Diego Joins the Navy,\" in Starr, ''The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s'' (1997) pp 90\u201392, 114\u201315</ref>\n\n==War and postwar period (1941&ndash;present)==\nSince [[World War I]], the military has played a leading role in the local economy. [[World War II]] brought prosperity and gave millions of soldiers, sailors and airmen en route to the Pacific a view of the opportunities in California.  The aircraft factories grew from small handcraft shops to gigantic factories.<ref>Shragge, \"'A new federal city': San Diego during World War II\"</ref>  The city's population soared from 200,000 to 340,000, as the Navy and Marines opened training facilities and the aircraft factories doubled their employment rosters every few months.  With 40,000 to 50,000 sailors off duty every weekend, the downtown entertainment districts soon became saturated.  The [[red-light district]] was officially shut down, but opportunities were easily available a few miles south in Tijuana, Mexico.  Workers poured in from the towns and from across the country, creating a severe housing shortage.  Public transportation (trolleys and buses) could barely keep up with the demand, and automobiles were rationed to only 3 gallons a week.  Many wives who relocated while their husbands were training stayed in the city when their men shipped out and took high-paying  jobs in the defense industries.<ref>Lotchin, The Bad City in the Good War p194-96, 207</ref>  The dramatic increase in the need for fresh water led the Navy in 1944 to build the [[San Diego Aqueduct]] to import water from the Colorado River; the city financed the second pipeline in 1952 <ref>Starr, ''Golden Dreams'' p 61</ref> By 1990, San Diego was the sixth [[List of most populous cities in the United States by decade|largest city in the United States]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Roderick |first=Kevin |first2=Anne C. |last2=Roark |date=26 January 1991 |title=Largest Cities Reflect Shift to West, 1990 Census Finds : Population: Los Angeles beats out Chicago as No. 2 in U.S. California lists 18 of 29 places reaching 100,000. |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-26/news/mn-704_1_los-angeles |work= Los Angeles Times |access-date=4 May 2018 }}<br/>{{cite journal |last1=Eddy |first1=Lucinda |editor1-last=Crawford |editor1-first=Richard W. |date=Summer 1995 |title=Vision of Paradise |url=http://sandiegohistory.org/journal/1995/july/visions-3/ |journal=The Journal of San Diego History |publisher=San Diego Historical Society |volume=41 |issue=3 |chapter=Big City Vision (1970-1990) |chapter-url=http://sandiegohistory.org/journal/1995/july/chapter21/ |access-date=4 May 2018 }}<br/>{{cite book|author=Kevin Starr|title=Coast of Dreams: California on the Edge, 1990-2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGOKDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA374|date=February 2006|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-679-74072-8|page=374}}<br/>{{cite book|author1=Rub\u00e9n G.

In 1954 it was bought out and became the Convair Division of [[General Dynamics]], a large aerospace conglomerate based in Texas.  Convair had been highly successful in the 1950s with the [[B-36]], a very long-range bomber that became the workhorse of the [[Strategic Air Command]].  General Dynamics refocused Convair on commercial aviation as the [[Convair CV-240 family|Convair 240]], a two- engine passenger plane, proved highly successful in the world market.  Convair decided to move up to the very rapidly growing world market for medium-range jet passenger planes with the [[Convair 880]].  It was designed to rival Boeing's proposed 707, and Douglas's proposed DC-8. Financial and technical delays left Convair lagging far behind.  After heavy losses, General Dynamics moved all the airplane elements to Texas, and left the San Diego factory with small-scale space and missile projects.  Convair's employment fell to 3300 in San Diego.<ref>Starr, ''Golden Dreams'' p 82</ref>\n\nAs the Cold War ended, the military shrunk and so did defense spending.

For years UC operated an extension program in San Diego. In 1960, following wartime and postwar increases in population and economic growth in San Diego, UC broke ground for a new campus there, and classes at UCSD began in 1964.  Under [[Richard C.

In 1931 it moved to a larger location on Aztec Mesa, overlooking Mission Valley, at what was then the eastern edge of San Diego. In 1935 it expanded its offerings beyond teacher education and became San Diego State College. In 1970 it became San Diego State University, part of the [[California State University]] system.

Indeed, they were pioneers in the industry in the 1860s; their peak came in the 1880s. They specialized in abalone for export to Chinese communities up and down the Pacific coast. One journalist reported, \"Even the fins of the shark are eaten by Chinamen, and are by them esteemed to be a great delicacy\u2014as much of a delicacy as a Chinaman would be to a shark.\"  By the 1890s the fishermen had gone; some returned to China, others took jobs on land.<ref>Arthur F.

It remained virtually uninhabited until 1776, when [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was established by Father [[Junipero Serra]], which led both Native Americans and Spanish settlers to establish villages nearby. After the founding of Mission San Juan Capistrano, local natives were conscripted to work for the mission.\n\n=== Becoming a city===\nProperty rights to the land exchanged hands several times, but few ventured to build on it until 1925, when former Mayor of [[Seattle]], [[Ole Hanson]], an out-of-town major land developer, purchased and designed a {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} community with the financial help of a syndicate headed by Hamilton Cotton. Hanson believed the area's pleasant climate, beautiful beaches, and fertile soil would serve as a haven to Californians tired of \"the big city.\" He named the city after [[San Clemente Island]], which in turn was named by the explorer [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno|Sebasti\u00e1n Vizcaino]] in 1602 after [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]]. Hanson envisioned it as a Mediterranean-style coastal resort town, his \"San Clemente by the Sea.\" He had a clause added to the deeds requiring all building plans to be submitted to an architectural review board in an effort to ensure future development would retain red tile roofs and white exteriors. This proved to be short-lived; an eclectic mix of building styles is found in the oldest parts of town.\n\nHanson succeeded in promoting the new area and selling property. He built public structures such as the Beach Club, the community center, the pier and San Clemente Plaza, now known as Max Berg Plaza Park. The area was officially incorporated as a City on February 27, 1928 with a [[council-manager government]].\n\nReferring to the way he would develop the city, Hanson proclaimed, \"I have a clean canvas and I am determined to paint a clean picture. Think of it - a canvas five miles long and one and one-half miles wide!... My San Clemente by the Sea.\"\n\nSoon after San Clemente was incorporated, the need for a [[fire station]] was realized. The headlines in San Clemente's first newspaper, ''El Heraldo de San Clemente'' June 1928 read: \"Building to house local fire department will be constructed by popular subscription and turned over to the city when completed!\" Individual subscriptions were received in the amounts from $6.00 to $1500.00 from the citizenry.\n\n=== Casa Romantica ===\n[[File:San Clemente CA Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|San Clemente Pier]]\n[[File:CASA ROMANTICA MORNING.jpg|thumb|Casa Romantica]]\nCasa Romantica is one of the most historical places in San Clemente and is well known by all of its residents. When Ole Hanson came to San Clemente and decided to develop the city he moved into his epitome of the perfect house which was called, Casa Romantica. Hansen owned Casa Romantica up until the great depression hit and the Bank of America foreclosed on the property. Today the home is owned by the city and is used as a cultural center. It is also open to rent for private events like weddings. Casa Romantica is located above the San Clemente Pier station and overlooks the San Clemente coastline.\n\n===Nixon's \"Western White House\"===\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] bought part of the H. H. Cotton estate, one of the original homes built by one of Hanson's partners. Nixon called it \"[[La Casa Pacifica]]\" and was nicknamed the \"Western White House,\" a term for a President's vacation home. It sits above one of the West Coast's premier surfing spots, [[Trestles]], and just north of historic surfing beach [[San Onofre State Park|San Onofre]]. Many world leaders visited the home during Nixon's tenure, including [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Mexican President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]], Prime Minister of Japan [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and businessman [[Charles Rebozo|Bebe Rebozo]]. After his resignation, Nixon retired to San Clemente to write his memoirs. He sold the home in 1980 and moved to New York City. The property also has historical ties to the Democratic side of the aisle; prior to Nixon's tenure at the estate, H. H. Cotton was known to host [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who would visit to play cards in a small outbuilding overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\n=== San Clemente Pier ===\nOne of the most iconic landmarks in San Clemente is the San Clemente Pier. The first constructed pier was built in 1928 and was 1,200 feet long. This pier was built at no cost to the residents and it's intention was for fishing and pleasure. In 1939 and 1983 the pier was damaged due to storms but has since been reconstructed into the pier it is today. The pier hosts the restaurant Fishermans restaurant & bar where you can eat seafood while watching the waves crash below you. The pier is perpendicular to the San Clemente Beach trail which starts at North Beach and goes as far as Califia taking you 2.6 miles out along the beautiful beaches of San Clemente. \n\n===Architectural style===\nKnown as the \u201cSpanish Village by the Sea\u201d, San Clemente has long been known for its Spanish style architecture. Downtown San Clemente restaurants and shops are adorned with red tile roofs, cream stucco walls, and dark wood doors and windows. The historic \"North Beach\" area is home to San Clemente's Casino Building and Ole Hanson Beach Club, which were renovated in 2010 and 2016. The homes in the area range in style, but stick to the Spanish theme for the most part. The area's oldest homes are in Southwest San Clemente, directly south of downtown and \"North Beach\" area, directly north of downtown. The homes in the Southwest Riviera neighborhood include several new constructions in the Cape Cod style, as well as new modern residences. The more traditional, older homes sit in the Lasuen \"boot\" district. The neighborhood surrounding Lasuens or \"Lost Winds\" beach is characterized by a variety of styles in both single and double story fashion, with the traditional Spanish style sprinkled throughout, crafting an eclectic atmosphere. The renovations to historic buildings in North Beach have sparked a revival in the area, attracting new residents and business owners.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sanclementesunsetoverlook.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] from San Clemente.

The [[Foothill Transportation Corridor]] had proposed to connect [[Mission Viejo]] to the Orange/San Diego county line, running along the east side of San Clemente and through [[San Onofre State Beach]] on its way to I-5. The California Coastal Commission<ref>[http://www.coastal.ca.gov/ California Coastal Commission]</ref> rejected this proposal 8\u20132. Reasons cited for rejection included: the road's alignment through a state park, endangered species habitat, and a Native American archaeological site, and the runoff from the road damaging the state park and [[surf break]]. The Federal Government rejected the proposal to place the toll road in accordance with the TCA proposal. This decision was viewed as a major defeat for the TCA and great victory for [[The Surfrider Foundation]] (which is based in San Clemente), and for assorted environmental groups. TCA has no current extension for the SR 241 corridor through San Clemente.\n\nAdditionally, the city is served by trains by of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Pacific Surfliner]] and [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]'s [[Orange County Line]] and [[Inland Empire-Orange County Line]] between Los Angeles and San Diego, and which provide beachside service in San Clemente. Despite its small size, the city has two stations: [[San Clemente station]] and [[San Clemente Pier station]].\n\nIn 2016, San Clemente began offering residents free trolley service. The San Clemente Trolley service provides three open-air (windowless) trolleys that cruise throughout the coastal areas of town and pick people up at designated stops every 15 minutes. The trolley is available Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. The funding for the San Clemente Trolley came from a $1.2 million grant from the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) which the city applied for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.san-clemente.org/i-am-a-/visitor/san-clemente-trolley|title=San Clemente Trolley {{!}} City of San Clemente, CA|website=www.san-clemente.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> The grant will cover most of the costs for the service for seven years. The grant requires the city to fund a portion of the trolley service at $146,000 over the seven-year grant period. The Friends of the San Clemente Beaches, Parks & Recreation Foundation provided a donation of $10,000 towards the funding of the capital costs of the trolley.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 667\n|1940= 479\n|1950= 2008\n|1960= 8527\n|1970= 17063\n|1980= 27325\n|1990= 41100\n|2000= 49936\n|2010= 63522\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=64857\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:San Clemente.jpg|thumb|left|San Clemente Civic Center]]\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0665084|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - San Clemente city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported San Clemente had a population of 63,522.

[[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The population was 63,522 in at the 2010 census.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/sanclementecitycalifornia|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: San Clemente city, California|website=www.census.gov|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> Located on the California Coast, midway between [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], the southernmost city of Orange County is known for its ocean, hill, and mountain views, a pleasant climate and its Spanish colonial-style architecture. San Clemente's city slogan is \"Spanish Village by the Sea\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parks.ca.gov/|title=San Clemente SB|website=CA State Parks|language=en|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> The official city flower is the [[bougainvillea]], and the official city tree is the [[Erythrina|coral]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.san-clemente.org/i-am-a-/visitor/demographics-may-2013|title=Demographics and Statistical Information {{!}} City of San Clemente, CA|website=www.san-clemente.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> San Clemente is also the southernmost city in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:sanclemente2.jpg|thumb|right|The pier in San Clemente at the end of Avenida Del Mar, part of the original village created by [[Ole Hanson]]]]\n\n[[File:Pier of San Clemente, CA.jpg|thumb|Another view of the San Clemente pier]]\n\n[[File:Beach scene, San Clemente, CA DSCN0032.JPG|right|thumb|San Clemente beach view, December 17, 2013]]\n\n[[File:Amtrak route along San Clemente, CA, beach DSCN0040.JPG|right|thumb|[[Amtrak]] and [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] pass along the beach at San Clemente]]\n\n=== Early colonization===\nPrior to colonization by Spaniards, the area was inhabited by the [[Juane\u00f1o]] people. It remained virtually uninhabited until 1776, when [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was established by Father [[Junipero Serra]], which led both Native Americans and Spanish settlers to establish villages nearby. After the founding of Mission San Juan Capistrano, local natives were conscripted to work for the mission.\n\n=== Becoming a city===\nProperty rights to the land exchanged hands several times, but few ventured to build on it until 1925, when former Mayor of [[Seattle]], [[Ole Hanson]], an out-of-town major land developer, purchased and designed a {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} community with the financial help of a syndicate headed by Hamilton Cotton. Hanson believed the area's pleasant climate, beautiful beaches, and fertile soil would serve as a haven to Californians tired of \"the big city.\" He named the city after [[San Clemente Island]], which in turn was named by the explorer [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno|Sebasti\u00e1n Vizcaino]] in 1602 after [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]]. Hanson envisioned it as a Mediterranean-style coastal resort town, his \"San Clemente by the Sea.\" He had a clause added to the deeds requiring all building plans to be submitted to an architectural review board in an effort to ensure future development would retain red tile roofs and white exteriors. This proved to be short-lived; an eclectic mix of building styles is found in the oldest parts of town.\n\nHanson succeeded in promoting the new area and selling property. He built public structures such as the Beach Club, the community center, the pier and San Clemente Plaza, now known as Max Berg Plaza Park. The area was officially incorporated as a City on February 27, 1928 with a [[council-manager government]].\n\nReferring to the way he would develop the city, Hanson proclaimed, \"I have a clean canvas and I am determined to paint a clean picture. Think of it - a canvas five miles long and one and one-half miles wide!... My San Clemente by the Sea.\"\n\nSoon after San Clemente was incorporated, the need for a [[fire station]] was realized. The headlines in San Clemente\u2019s first newspaper, ''El Heraldo de San Clemente'' June 1928 read: \"Building to house local fire department will be constructed by popular subscription and turned over to the city when completed!\" Individual subscriptions were received in the amounts from $6.00 to $1500.00 from the citizenry.\n\n=== Casa Romantica ===\n[[File:San Clemente CA Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|San Clemente Pier]]\n[[File:CASA ROMANTICA MORNING.jpg|thumb|Casa Romantica]]\nCasa Romantica is one of the most historical places in San Clemente and is well known by all of its residents. When Ole Hanson came to San Clemente and decided to develop the city he moved into his epitome of the perfect house which was called, Casa Romantica. Hansen owned Casa Romantica up until the great depression hit and the Bank of America foreclosed on the property. Today the home is owned by the city and is used as a cultural center. It is also open to rent for private events like weddings. Casa Romantica is located above the San Clemente Pier station and overlooks the San Clemente coastline.\n\n===Nixon's \"Western White House\"===\nIn 1969, President [[Richard Nixon]] bought part of the H. H. Cotton estate, one of the original homes built by one of Hanson's partners. Nixon called it \"[[La Casa Pacifica]]\" and was nicknamed the \"Western White House,\" a term for a President's vacation home. It sits above one of the West Coast's premier surfing spots, [[Trestles]], and just north of historic surfing beach [[San Onofre State Park|San Onofre]]. Many world leaders visited the home during Nixon's tenure, including [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]], Mexican President [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]], Prime Minister of Japan [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]], [[Henry Kissinger]], and businessman [[Charles Rebozo|Bebe Rebozo]]. After his resignation, Nixon retired to San Clemente to write his memoirs. He sold the home in 1980 and moved to New York City. The property also has historical ties to the Democratic side of the aisle; prior to Nixon's tenure at the estate, H. H. Cotton was known to host [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], who would visit to play cards in a small outbuilding overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\n\n=== San Clemente Pier ===\nOne of the most iconic landmarks in San Clemente is the San Clemente Pier. The first constructed pier was built in 1928 and was 1,200 feet long. This pier was built at no cost to the residents and it's intention was for fishing and pleasure. In 1939 and 1983 the pier was damaged due to storms but has since been reconstructed into the pier it is today. The pier hosts the restaurant Fishermans restaurant & bar where you can eat seafood while watching the waves crash below you. The pier is perpendicular to the San Clemente Beach trail which starts at North Beach and goes as far as Califia taking you 2.6 miles out along the beautiful beaches of San Clemente. \n\n===Architectural style===\nKnown as the \u201cSpanish Village by the Sea\u201d, San Clemente has long been known for its Spanish style architecture. Downtown San Clemente restaurants and shops are adorned with red tile roofs, cream stucco walls, and dark wood doors and windows. The historic \"North Beach\" area is home to San Clemente's Casino Building and Ole Hanson Beach Club, which were renovated in 2010 and 2016. The homes in the area range in style, but stick to the Spanish theme for the most part. The area's oldest homes are in Southwest San Clemente, directly south of downtown and \"North Beach\" area, directly north of downtown. The homes in the Southwest Riviera neighborhood include several new constructions in the Cape Cod style, as well as new modern residences. The more traditional, older homes sit in the Lasuen \"boot\" district. The neighborhood surrounding Lasuens or \"Lost Winds\" beach is characterized by a variety of styles in both single and double story fashion, with the traditional Spanish style sprinkled throughout, crafting an eclectic atmosphere. The renovations to historic buildings in North Beach have sparked a revival in the area, attracting new residents and business owners.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Sanclementesunsetoverlook.jpg|thumb|right|A view of [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] from San Clemente. The city is known for its mild weather and [[mediterranean climate]]]]\n\nSan Clemente is located at {{Coord|33|26|16|N|117|37|13|W|type:city}} (33.437828, \u2212117.620397).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> To the south of town are [[Camp Pendleton]] and [[Trestles]] surf beach.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|19.5|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|18.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.8|sqmi|km2}} of it (3.89%) is water.\n\n===Climate===\n\nSan Clemente has a Mediterranean climate where temperatures tend to average in the 70s \u00b0F. The warmest month of the year is August, with an average temperature of {{convert|79|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. The coldest month is December with an average temperature of {{convert|64|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}. The annual rainfall in 2010 was {{convert|10.5|in|mm}} and the annual days of sunshine 310.\n\n===Transportation===\n\n[[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] runs through San Clemente. The [[Foothill Transportation Corridor]] had proposed to connect [[Mission Viejo]] to the Orange/San Diego county line, running along the east side of San Clemente and through [[San Onofre State Beach]] on its way to I-5. The California Coastal Commission<ref>[http://www.coastal.ca.gov/ California Coastal Commission]</ref> rejected this proposal 8\u20132. Reasons cited for rejection included: the road's alignment through a state park, endangered species habitat, and a Native American archaeological site, and the runoff from the road damaging the state park and [[surf break]]. The Federal Government rejected the proposal to place the toll road in accordance with the TCA proposal. This decision was viewed as a major defeat for the TCA and great victory for [[The Surfrider Foundation]] (which is based in San Clemente), and for assorted environmental groups. TCA has no current extension for the SR 241 corridor through San Clemente.\n\nAdditionally, the city is served by trains by of [[Amtrak]]'s [[Pacific Surfliner]] and [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]'s [[Orange County Line]] and [[Inland Empire-Orange County Line]] between Los Angeles and San Diego, and which provide beachside service in San Clemente. Despite its small size, the city has two stations: [[San Clemente station]] and [[San Clemente Pier station]].\n\nIn 2016, San Clemente began offering residents free trolley service. The San Clemente Trolley service provides three open-air (windowless) trolleys that cruise throughout the coastal areas of town and pick people up at designated stops every 15 minutes. The trolley is available Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend. The funding for the San Clemente Trolley came from a $1.2 million grant from the Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) which the city applied for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.san-clemente.org/i-am-a-/visitor/san-clemente-trolley|title=San Clemente Trolley {{!}} City of San Clemente, CA|website=www.san-clemente.org|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref> The grant will cover most of the costs for the service for seven years. The grant requires the city to fund a portion of the trolley service at $146,000 over the seven-year grant period. The Friends of the San Clemente Beaches, Parks & Recreation Foundation provided a donation of $10,000 towards the funding of the capital costs of the trolley.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1930= 667\n|1940= 479\n|1950= 2008\n|1960= 8527\n|1970= 17063\n|1980= 27325\n|1990= 41100\n|2000= 49936\n|2010= 63522\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=64857\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:San Clemente.jpg|thumb|left|San Clemente Civic Center]]\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0665084|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - San Clemente city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported San Clemente had a population of 63,522.

The town was chosen because it was particularly close to the director [[Rian Johnson]] who lived there and went to [[San Clemente High School (San Clemente, California)|San Clemente High School]], which was the school depicted in the film. Many of the locations in the film are still identical to the real ones, with the exception of the Pin's house, which was flattened a week after exterior [[shooting]]; the interior was constructed in a local warehouse. The football field has also since been replaced with artificial turf and track. The phone booths used all through the film are mostly props that were placed on location. The movie ''One of Her Own'' is based on incidents in and around San Clemente.\n\nSan Clemente is served by two newspapers, ''The Sun Post News'' (owned by the Orange County Register) and ''The San Clemente Times''.

It is a follow-up to the game ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'', itself based on the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|2002 film]], and incorporates various references to the events of that game, even if they did not occur in the film. Published by [[Activision]], the console versions were developed by [[Treyarch]], but the other versions had different developers.{{efn|The Treyarch games will be the ones most often referred to in this article.}}\n\nThe game was released on June 28, 2004 for the [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], followed by  [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, both released later in the same year. A [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version, which uses the same engine and graphics as the first game, was also released almost one year later, on March 23, 2005. The Game Boy Advance version, developed by [[Digital Eclipse]], came on Twin Pack cartridge and bundled with ''[[Spider-Man: The Movie]]'' in 2005. The console versions of the game received critical acclaim, with critics praising the realistic like [[Manhattan]] and web swinging mechanics. The other versions received mixed reviews.\n\nThe game was followed by ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' in 2007, itself based on [[Spider-Man 3|the film of the same name]], the final film in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''Spider-Man'' trilogy.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Spider-Man 2'' is in most versions, an open-world action-adventure video game, with a few role-playing elements and takes place from a third-person perspective. The Treyarch version of the game allow the player to freely roam around Manhattan, Roosevelt, Ellis, and Liberty Islands. The home console versions were also innovative in that physics-based algorithms simulated Spider-Man's web swinging in three dimensions, creating a new game mechanic unlike the traditional jumping or flying of previous Spider-Man games. The PSP version of ''Spider-Man 2'' was compared to playing the original ''Spider-Man'' movie game.<ref name=ign>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/664/664391.html|title=IGN: Spider-Man 2 for PC}}</ref>\n\nWhile street thugs only have [[handguns]], [[machine guns]], crowbars and their fists to protect them, the super-villains and their minions have their various unique powers and weapons that they use to either steal, cause terror or defeat [[Spider-Man]]. At the end of the game, it becomes possible to unlock a warehouse in which the player can again fight thugs and villains such as Shocker, Rhino, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and an additional boss, [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], who is not found elsewhere in the game.\n\nThe player has the ability to choose either to go on with the storyline or swing around the city. The player can explore [[Manhattan]], [[Roosevelt Island]], [[Ellis Island]], [[Liberty Island]], and a mysterious label on the map over the water claiming \"[[Governors Island]]\" (which was omitted from the final version of the game due to time constraints) with many sidequests for the player to complete. The player can do random tasks to earn \"hero points,\" which must be accumulated to continue with the story.\n\n==Plot==\n===Treyarch version===\nTwo years after the events of the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|first game]], [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]] is shown to be still having trouble balancing his superhero and civilian lives, frequently being late or absent for school (much to the disappointment of his science teacher, [[The Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]) and leisure time with his friends, [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he is attracted to, and [[Harry Osborn]], who hates Spider-Man, believing he murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. One night, after dinner with his friends, Spider-Man stops a museum robbery, during which he meets professional thief [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], with the two eventually becoming allies and working together on several occasions to fight crime.\n\nBesides his jobs as a pizza delivery boy and photographer for the [[Daily Bugle|''Daily Bugle'']], Spider-Man contends with suprevillains like [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], whom he defeats one day on the streets. Spider-Man also beats special effects artists [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]] in a series of \"games\" meant to prove he is a fault. Emberassed, Beck later assumes the identity of \"Mysterio\" and leads attacks on both an opera and the [[Statue of Liberty]], which Spider-Man foils. He soon tracks down Mysterio to his apartment and overcomes a series of challenges, learning that Mysterio is a fraud, despite his escape. \n\nPeter later meets [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] through Harry, a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan, with the experiment being funded by [[Oscorp]], now led by Harry. Peter forms a bond with Octavius, but on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. Although Spider-Man manages to shut down the reactor in time, the fusion has grafted Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. After speaking with his old friend Curt Connors, during which the arms make Octavius very paranoid and aggressive and he injures Connors, Octavius adopts the name \"Doctor Octopus\" and seeks to finish the fusion at all costs. To earn enough money to rebuild the reactor, he robs a bank, where he kidnaps Peter's [[Aunt May]] to prevent Spider-Man from pursuing him, although Spider-Man chases after him nontheless and saves May.\n\nLater, Spider-Man learns that Mary Jane is getting married and, saddened, reunites with Black Cat, who tries to convince him to give up on his civilian life to be Spider-Man full-time. The pair then work together to fight [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], who escaped from prison during Beck's initial competition with Spider-Man and flees. Shortly after, Spider-Man faces Mysterio in person when he attempts to rob a store and easily beats him, unmasking him as Beck and taking photos of him for the ''Daily Bugle'', only for his boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], to make it look like he and Spider-Man were partners. Enraged, Spider-Man decides to confront him, but is stopped by Black Cat, and the pair once again track down Shocker and defeat him for good. Spider-Man later meets with Black Cat one final time, telling her he can't give up on either his civilian or superhero life, which she understands.\n\nMeanwhile, Doctor Octopus makes a deal to Harry to give him [[tritium]] for his reactor in exchange for Spider-Man. When Peter meets with Mary Jane to confess his feelings for her, Doctor Octopus kidnaps the latter and demands Peter to tell Spider-Man to face him. Spider-Man fights Doctor Octopus on top of a moving train, but falls unconscious after saving everyone aboard and is delivered to Harry, who prepares to kill him, only to discover he's Peter. Although shocked at this, Harry tells Peter where to find Doctor Octopus after learning he kidnapped Mary Jane. At the warehouse where Doctor Octopus is planning to recreate the fusion, Spider-Man attempts to stop him, unmasking himself in front of him and Mary Jane in the process, but to no avail. He then decides to fight Doctor Octopus, allowing him to regain his sanity. Realizing his mistakes, Octavius make a heroic sacrifice to destroy the reactor permanently by demolishing the warehouse, while Peter rescues Mary Jane.\n\nThe next day, Peter receives a surprise visit from Mary Jane, who ran away from her wedding to confess her feelings for him and states that she will be fully embracing his double life. With his confidence renewed, Spider-Man prepares to save the city once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/566218/|title=Spider-Man 2 Wiki Guide - IGN|author=|date=|website=IGN|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===PC version===\nTwo years after the events of the first game, Peter Parker/Spider-Man befriends [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]], a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan. However, on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. The fusion also grafts Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. Adopting the name \"Doctor Octopus\", he seeks to finish the fusion at all costs.\n\nAfter a short tutorial, narrated by [[Bruce Campbell]], the game's storyline begins with Spider-Man following a mysterious van to prison, where a large group of thugs are causing a riot. He defeats some of them, before [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] busts out of the prison and tries to charge away, but is caught in a laser cage set up by the police. Spider-Man fights Rhino, who escapes from the cage, only to ram into a gas station that blows him away and knocks him unconscious, whereupon he is picked up by Doctor Octopus. Later, Peter is at the bank with his [[Aunt May]], when Doctor Octopus and his goons rob it, looking to earn enough money to rebuild the fusion reactor. Suiting up as Spider-Man, Peter beats the goons and saves the hostages, before fighting Doctor Octopus inside the vault, but he manages to escape with the money, whilist his remaining goons attempt to make off with May, although Spider-Man stops them. \n\nThe next day, Peter is walking through the city with his friend, [[Mary Jane Watson]], when they both spot the latter's car being stolen. After telling Mary Jane to wait while he calls the police, Peter suits up as Spider-Man and follows the car to a warehouse, where he is confronted by the villain [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and his goons. After fighting his way through all the crooks, Spider-Man engages Puma in a battle across the city, culminating at a construction site, where the villain reveals he was merely a distraction while Doctor Octoups kidnapped Mary Jane, before being subdued by Spider-Man. Later, Doctor Octopus and his goons attack [[Oscorp]] to steal a piece of high tech equipment necessary for the reactor. Spider-Man defeats all the crooks and rescues numerous civilians and scientists, while also defusing eight bombs that Doctor Octopus has placed through the building. Spider-Man eventually confronts Doctor Octopus, but he escapes with the piece of equipment and summons Rhino to fight him. After subduing Rhino by freezing him using [[liquid nitrogen]], Spider-Man gives chase, only to witness a New York literally torn out of the ground and into the sky.\n\nSpider-Man makes his way through the floating city and eventually defeats [[Mysterio]], the villain responsible for all of this, who reveals that he was yet another distraction for Spider-Man, allowing Doctor Octopus to escape. Mysterio then tells Spider-Man that Doctor Octopus is hiding at the subway station, before disappearing, while New York returns to normal, indicating that it was all an illusion. Spider-Man arrives at the subway station and fights through Doctor Octopus' goons, who escapes aboard a fleeing train, but Spider-Man manages to board it as well and fights the villain on top of it. However, Doctor Octopus then sabotages the train, allowing him to escape while Spider-Man stops it and saves everyone aboard.\n\nSpider-Man is able to track down Doctor Octopus to an abandoned warehouse at the docks, where he finds both him and Mary Jane by the fusion reactor he's attempting to rebuild. After a final battle with Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man is able to knock enough sense into him to help Octavius regain control of his mind. Realizing the error of his ways, Octavius makes a heroic sacrifice to permanently destroy the fusion reactor by demolishing the warehouse, while Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane (without revealing his secret identity to her).\n\n=== PlayStation Portable version ===\nSet two years after the events of the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|first game]], the story opens up with Peter Parker/Spider-Man narrating his origins as a superhero and explaining his current struggle to balance his superhero and civilian lives, frequently being late for school, job, and leisure time with his friends, [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he is attracted to, and [[Harry Osborn]], who hates Spider-Man, believing he murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. Spider-Man is then seen web-swinging through the city, when he spots some thugs landing a helicopter on the bank, planning to rob it, and defeats them. Later that night, after dinner with Mary Jane and Harry, Peter follows a van chased by the police to the [[Queensboro Bridge]], saving some civilians and cops, before following the crooks to a warehouse, where the explosives they were carrying cause a massive fire, which Spider-Man puts out, along with defeating all the crooks.\n\nPeter later meets [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] through Harry, a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan, with the experiment being funded by [[Oscorp]], now led by Harry. Peter forms a bond with Octavius, but on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. Although Spider-Man manages to shut down the reactor in time, the fusion has grafted Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. Adopting the name \"Doctor Octopus\" , he seeks to finish the fusion at all costs.\n\nAfter bringing [[J. Jonah Jameson]], his boss at the [[Daily Bugle|''Daily Bugle'']], photos of the incident, Peter learns that Octavius has escaped from the hospital after killing the staff, as well as that several supervillains have been broken out of prison. Jameson tasks Peter with taking some photos of the gala at the Wax Museum, only for him to discover a hostage situation orchestrated by the villain [[Mysterio]]. Spider-Man defeats Mysterio, saving all the hostages in the process. The following day, Peter goes to the bank with his [[Aunt May]], when Doctor Octopus and his goons rob it, looking to earn enough money to rebuild the fusion reactor. Spider-Man fights his way through the crooks, saving the hostages, before fighting Doctor Octopus in the vault, but he manages to escape with the money. After escaping from the bank, Spider-Man gives chase, but soon loses Doctor Octopus.\n\nLater, Spider-Man foils a bomb threat by the villain [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (whom he already fought [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|two years ago]] and who escaped from prison), and defeats him, learning that [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] has escaped as well and is planning a job at a warehouse. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus makes a deal with Harry to give him [[tritium]] for his reactor in exchange for Spider-Man. At the warehouse, Spider-Man defeats both Shocker and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], learning that they were hired by Doctor Octopus to steal a piece of equipment for his reactor, as well as that Rhino was the one who broke all the villains out of prison (although it wasn't intentional, as he was supposed to break only Shocker out).\n\nThe next day, when Peter meets with Mary Jane, who is soon to marry, to confess his feelings for her. Doctor Octopus kidnaps the latter and demands Peter tell Spider-Man to face him. Spider-Man arrives at the subway station, defeating all of Doctor Octopus's goons, before facing the villain on top of a moving train. However, he falls unconscious after saving everyone aboard and is delivered to Harry, who prepares to kill him, only to discover he's Peter. Although shocked at this, Harry tells Peter where to find Doctor Octopus after learning he kidnapped Mary Jane. At the warehouse where Doctor Octopus is planning to recreate the fusion, Spider-Man attempts to stop him, unmasking himself in front of him and Mary Jane in the process, but to no avail. He then decides to fight Doctor Octopus, allowing him to regain his sanity. Realizing his mistakes, Octavius make a heroic sacrifice to destroy the reactor permanently by demolishing the warehouse, while Peter rescues Mary Jane.\n\nThe following day, Peter receives a surprise visit from Mary Jane, who ran away from her wedding to confess her feelings for him and states that she will be fully embracing his double life. With his confidence renewed, Spider-Man prepares to protect the city once again.\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment on ''Spider-Man 2'' began at Treyarch shortly after the financial success of the first ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' game. The physics-based web swinging system was conceived by designer Jamie Fristrom, who was dissatisfied with the web swinging system of the first game, which he was on the development team for, and desired a \"more realistic\" swinging system in the follow-up. He cited the game ''[[Rocket Jockey]]'' as an inspiration.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\">{{Cite web

involved in manually adding points into the game that web lines could be attached to, Fristrom and programmer Andrei Pokrovsky implemented [[ray casting]] into the game as a solution to automatically map infinite points where players could attach webs to swing from.<ref>[https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1ep0ed/i_invented_the_swinging_in_spiderman_2_now_im/ca2lbbk/ Jamie Fristrom Reddit

months before the game's release, which was set to coincide with the release of the film, the developers at Treyarch were forced to cut a large amount of content in order to complete and ship the game

acclaim. Critics noted that the realistic and life-sized Manhattan, the large variety of crimes and emergencies to stop, and the game's vivid use of Spider-Man's abilities all combined to make the player really feel like Spider-Man. The most popular aspect of the game was the web-swinging mechanic, where Spider-Man had to shoot webbing at an actual building, unlike previous games where he shot webbing up into the sky. However, small parts of the game were criticized, such as the repetition of some of the side missions. The game has been ranked by critics and fans as one of, if not, the best ''Spider-Man'' games ever made.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Matt|title=Ranking the Best Spider-Man Video Games Of All Time|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/14913-ranking-the-10-best-spider-man-video-games-of-all-time|website=Inverse|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wojnar|first1=Zak|title=15 Best Spider-Man Video Games|url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-video-games-best/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 9 Best Spider-Man Games Ever, Ranked|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1207-best-spider-man-games.html#s10|website=Tom's Guide|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Marie|first1=Tara|title=Spider-Man: 15 Games RANKED From WORST To BEST|url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-15-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Alvarez|first1=Daniel|title=The 8 Best And 7 Worst Spider-Man Games|url=https://www.thegamer.com/the-8-best-and-7-worst-spider-man-games/|website=The Gamer|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 25 best Spider-Man games of all time|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-spiderman-games/3/|website=GamesRadar+|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hodges|first1=Chris|title=Every Spider-Man Video Game, Ranked From Worst To Best|url=https://screenrant.com/every-spider-man-video-game-ranked-worst-best/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]] gave the game a score of 8.8 out of 10 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] versions,<ref name=IGN/> 9 / 10 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version,<ref name=IGNXB/> 7.1 / 10 for the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] version,<ref name=IGNNG/> 7 / 10 for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version,<ref name=IGNPSP/> 7.5 / 10 for the [[Nintendo DS]] version,<ref name=IGNDS/> 6.5 / 10 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] version,<ref name=IGNGBA/> and 4.5 / 10 for the PC version.<ref name=IGNPC/> IGN stated on the PS2, GameCube, and Xbox version to \"call it Grand Theft Spider-Man.

They only negatively stated that the music loops a lot because of the enormously long levels, \"not the tightest combat developed for a Spider-Man game\", and stated that the levels are \"a big pain in the butt to accomplish\".\n\nThe PSP version also received generally positive reviews.

game|action-adventure video game]], [[open-world]] in various iterations, based on the [[Spider-Man 2|film of the same name]], while also incorporating additional material from the comic books, namely villains not present in the film like [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mysterio]], [[Puma (comics)|Puma]], [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], or [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (both returning from the previous game), depending on the platform. It is a follow-up to the game ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man: The Movie]]'', itself based on the [[Spider-Man (2002 film)|2002 film]], and incorporates various references to the events of that game, even if they did not occur in the film. Published by [[Activision]], the console versions were developed by [[Treyarch]], but the other versions had different developers.{{efn|The Treyarch games will be the ones most often referred to in this article.}}\n\nThe game was released on June 28, 2004 for the [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], followed by  [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] and [[Nintendo DS]] versions, both released later in the same year. A [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version, which uses the same engine and graphics as the first game, was also released almost one year later, on March 23, 2005. The Game Boy Advance version, developed by [[Digital Eclipse]], came on Twin Pack cartridge and bundled with ''[[Spider-Man: The Movie]]'' in 2005. The console versions of the game received critical acclaim, with critics praising the realistic like [[Manhattan]] and web swinging mechanics. The other versions received mixed reviews.\n\nThe game was followed by ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' in 2007, itself based on [[Spider-Man 3|the film of the same name]], the final film in [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''Spider-Man'' trilogy.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Spider-Man 2'' is in most versions, an open-world action-adventure video game, with a few role-playing elements and takes place from a third-person perspective. The Treyarch version of the game allow the player to freely roam around Manhattan, Roosevelt, Ellis, and Liberty Islands. The home console versions were also innovative in that physics-based algorithms simulated Spider-Man's web swinging in three dimensions, creating a new game mechanic unlike the traditional jumping or flying of previous Spider-Man games. The PSP version of ''Spider-Man 2'' was compared to playing the original ''Spider-Man'' movie game.<ref name=ign>{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/664/664391.html|title=IGN: Spider-Man 2 for PC}}</ref>\n\nWhile street thugs only have [[handguns]], [[machine guns]], crowbars and their fists to protect them, the super-villains and their minions have their various unique powers and weapons that they use to either steal, cause terror or defeat [[Spider-Man]]. At the end of the game, it becomes possible to unlock a warehouse in which the player can again fight thugs and villains such as Shocker, Rhino, Mysterio, Doctor Octopus, and an additional boss, [[Calypso (comics)|Calypso]], who is not found elsewhere in the game.\n\nThe player has the ability to choose either to go on with the storyline or swing around the city. The player can explore [[Manhattan]], [[Roosevelt Island]], [[Ellis Island]], [[Liberty Island]], and a mysterious label on the map over the water claiming \"[[Governors Island]]\" (which was omitted from the final version of the game due to time constraints) with many sidequests for the player to complete. The player can do random tasks to earn \"hero points,\" which must be accumulated to continue with the story.\n\n==Plot==\n===Treyarch version===\nTwo years after the events of the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|first game]], [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker/Spider-Man]] is shown to be still having trouble balancing his superhero and civilian lives, frequently being late or absent for school (much to the disappointment of his science teacher, [[The Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]]) and leisure time with his friends, [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he is attracted to, and [[Harry Osborn]], who hates Spider-Man, believing he murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. One night, after dinner with his friends, Spider-Man stops a museum robbery, during which he meets professional thief [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], with the two eventually becoming allies and working together on several occasions to fight crime.\n\nBesides his jobs as a pizza delivery boy and photographer for the [[Daily Bugle|''Daily Bugle'']], Spider-Man contends with suprevillains like [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], whom he defeats one day on the streets. Spider-Man also beats special effects artists [[Mysterio|Quentin Beck]] in a series of \"games\" meant to prove he is a fault. Emberassed, Beck later assumes the identity of \"Mysterio\" and leads attacks on both an opera and the [[Statue of Liberty]], which Spider-Man foils. He soon tracks down Mysterio to his apartment and overcomes a series of challenges, learning that Mysterio is a fraud, despite him getting away. \n\nPeter later meets [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] through Harry, a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan, with the experiment being funded by [[Oscorp]], now led by Harry. Peter forms a bond with Octavius, but on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. Although Spider-Man manages to shut down the reactor in time, the fusion has grafted Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. After speaking with his old friend Curt Connors, during which the arms make Octavius very paranoid and aggressive and he injures Connors, Octavius adopts the name \"Doctor Octopus\" and seeks to finish the fusion at all costs. To earn enough money to rebuild the reactor, he robs a bank, where he kidnaps Peter's [[Aunt May]] to prevent Spider-Man from pursuing him, although Spider-Man chases after him nontheless and saves May.\n\nLater, Spider-Man learns that Mary Jane is getting married and, saddened, reunites with Black Cat, who tries to convince him to give up on his civilian life to be Spider-Man full-time. The pair then work together to fight [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], who escaped from prison during Beck's initial competition with Spider-Man and flees. Shortly after, Spider-Man faces Mysterio in person when he attempts to rob a store and easily beats him, unmasking him as Beck and taking photos of him for the ''Daily Bugle'', only for his boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], to make it look like he and Spider-Man were partners. Enraged, Spider-Man decides to confront him, but is stopped by Black Cat, and the pair once again track down Shocker and defeat him for good. Spider-Man later meets with Black Cat one final time, telling her he can't give up on either his civilian or superhero life, which she understands.\n\nMeanwhile, Doctor Octopus makes a deal to Harry to give him [[tritium]] for his reactor in exchange for Spider-Man. When Peter meets with Mary Jane to confess his feelings for her, Doctor Octopus kidnaps the latter and demands Peter to tell Spider-Man to face him. Spider-Man fights Doctor Octopus on top of a moving train, but falls unconscious after saving everyone aboard and is delivered to Harry, who prepares to kill him, only to discover he's Peter. Although shocked at this, Harry tells Peter where to find Doctor Octopus after learning he kidnapped Mary Jane. At the warehouse where Doctor Octopus is planning to recreate the fusion, Spider-Man attempts to stop him, unmasking himself in front of him and Mary Jane in the process, but to no avail. He then decides to fight Doctor Octopus, allowing him to regain his sanity. Realizing his mistakes, Octavius make a heroic sacrifice to destroy the reactor permanently by demolishing the warehouse, while Peter rescues Mary Jane.\n\nThe next day, Peter receives a surprise visit from Mary Jane, who ran away from her wedding to confess her feelings for him and states that she will be fully embracing his double life. With his confidence renewed, Spider-Man prepares to save the city once again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/566218/|title=Spider-Man 2 Wiki Guide - IGN|author=|date=|website=IGN|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===PC version===\nTwo years after the events of the first game, Peter Parker/Spider-Man befriends [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]], a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan. However, on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. The fusion also grafts Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. Adopting the name \"Doctor Octopus\", he seeks to finish the fusion at all costs.\n\nAfter a short tutorial, narrated by [[Bruce Campbell]], the game's storyline begins with Spider-Man following a mysterious van to prison, where a large group of thugs are causing a riot. He defeats some of them, before [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] busts out of the prison and tries to charge away, but is caught in a laser cage set up by the police. Spider-Man fights Rhino, who escapes from the cage, only to ram into a gas station that blows him away and knocks him unconscious, whereupon he is picked up by Doctor Octopus. Later, Peter is at the bank with his [[Aunt May]], when Doctor Octopus and his goons rob it, looking to earn enough money to rebuild the fusion reactor. Suiting up as Spider-Man, Peter beats the goons and saves the hostages, before fighting Doctor Octopus inside the vault, but he manages to escape with the money, whilist his remaining goons attempt to make off with May, although Spider-Man stops them. \n\nThe next day, Peter is walking through the city with his friend, [[Mary Jane Watson]], when they both spot the latter's car being stolen. After telling Mary Jane to wait while he calls the police, Peter suits up as Spider-Man and follows the car to a warehouse, where he is confronted by the villain [[Puma (comics)|Puma]] and his goons. After fighting his way through all the crooks, Spider-Man engages Puma in a battle across the city, culminating at a construction site, where the villain reveals he was merely a distraction while Doctor Octoups kidnapped Mary Jane, before being subdued by Spider-Man. Later, Doctor Octopus and his goons attack [[Oscorp]] to steal a piece of high tech equipment necessary for the reactor. Spider-Man defeats all the crooks and rescues numerous civilians and scientists, while also defusing eight bombs that Doctor Octopus has placed through the building. Spider-Man eventually confronts Doctor Octopus, but he escapes with the piece of equipment and summons Rhino to fight him. After subduing Rhino by freezing him using [[liquid nitrogen]], Spider-Man gives chase, only to witness a New York literally torn out of the ground and into the sky.\n\nSpider-Man makes his way through the floating city and eventually defeats [[Mysterio]], the villain responsible for all of this, who reveals that he was yet another distraction for Spider-Man, allowing Doctor Octopus to escape. Mysterio then tells Spider-Man that Doctor Octopus is hiding at the subway station, before disappearing, while New York returns to normal, indicating that it was all an illusion. Spider-Man arrives at the subway station and fights through Doctor Octopus' goons, who escapes aboard a fleeing train, but Spider-Man manages to board it as well and fights the villain on top of it. However, Doctor Octopus then sabotages the train, allowing him to escape while Spider-Man stops it and saves everyone aboard.\n\nSpider-Man is able to track down Doctor Octopus to an abandoned warehouse at the docks, where he finds both him and Mary Jane by the fusion reactor he's attempting to rebuild. After a final battle with Doctor Octopus, Spider-Man is able to knock enough sense into him to help Octavius regain control of his mind. Realizing the error of his ways, Octavius makes a heroic sacrifice to permanently destroy the fusion reactor by demolishing the warehouse, while Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane (without revealing his secret identity to her).\n\n=== PlayStation Portable version ===\nSet two years after the events of the [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|first game]], the story opens up with Peter Parker/Spider-Man narrating his origins as a superhero and explaining his current struggle to balance his superhero and civilian lives, frequently being late for school, job, and leisure time with his friends, [[Mary Jane Watson]], whom he is attracted to, and [[Harry Osborn]], who hates Spider-Man, believing he murdered his [[Norman Osborn|father]]. Spider-Man is then seen web-swinging through the city, when he spots some thugs landing a helicopter on the bank, planning to rob it, and defeats them. Later that night, after dinner with Mary Jane and Harry, Peter follows a van chased by the police to the [[Queensboro Bridge]], saving some civilians and cops, before following the crooks to a warehouse, where the explosives they were carrying cause a massive fire, which Spider-Man puts out, along with defeating all the crooks.\n\nPeter later meets [[Doctor Octopus|Dr. Otto Octavius]] through Harry, a respected scientist who is trying to recreate a [[nuclear fusion]] that would allow him to provide an unlimited amount of energy for Manhattan, with the experiment being funded by [[Oscorp]], now led by Harry. Peter forms a bond with Octavius, but on the day of the experiment, the fusion creates a strong magnetic field, which destroys the lab and kills Octavius' wife Rosie. Although Spider-Man manages to shut down the reactor in time, the fusion has grafted Octavius' metal arms, created to help him control it, to his spine and destroyed the chip allowing him to control their [[artificial intelligence]], causing the arms to influence Octavius' mentality and slowly turn him into a villain. Adopting the name \"Doctor Octopus\" , he seeks to finish the fusion at all costs.\n\nAfter bringing [[J. Jonah Jameson]], his boss at the [[Daily Bugle|''Daily Bugle'']], photos of the incident, Peter learns that Octavius has escaped from the hospital after killing the staff, as well as that several supervillains have been broken out of prison. Jameson tasks Peter with taking some photos of the gala at the Wax Museum, only for him to discover a hostage situation orchestrated by the villain [[Mysterio]]. Spider-Man defeats Mysterio, saving all the hostages in the process. The following day, Peter goes to the bank with his [[Aunt May]], when Doctor Octopus and his goons rob it, looking to earn enough money to rebuild the fusion reactor. Spider-Man fights his way through the crooks, saving the hostages, before fighting Doctor Octopus in the vault, but he manages to escape with the money. After escaping from the bank, Spider-Man gives chase, but soon loses Doctor Octopus.\n\nLater, Spider-Man foils a bomb threat by the villain [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] (whom he already fought [[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|two years ago]] and who escaped from prison), and defeats him, learning that [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]] has escaped as well and is planning a job at a warehouse. Meanwhile, Doctor Octopus makes a deal with Harry to give him [[tritium]] for his reactor in exchange for Spider-Man. At the warehouse, Spider-Man defeats both Shocker and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], learning that they were hired by Doctor Octopus to steal a piece of equipment for his reactor, as well as that Rhino was the one who broke all the villains out of prison (although it wasn't intentional, as he was supposed to break only Shocker out).\n\nThe next day, when Peter meets with Mary Jane, who is getting married, to confess his feelings for her, Doctor Octopus kidnaps the latter and demands Peter to tell Spider-Man to face him. Spider-Man arrives at the subway station, defeating all of Doctor Octopus's goons, before facing the villain on top of a moving train. However, he falls unconscious after saving everyone aboard and is delivered to Harry, who prepares to kill him, only to discover he's Peter. Although shocked at this, Harry tells Peter where to find Doctor Octopus after learning he kidnapped Mary Jane. At the warehouse where Doctor Octopus is planning to recreate the fusion, Spider-Man attempts to stop him, unmasking himself in front of him and Mary Jane in the process, but to no avail. He then decides to fight Doctor Octopus, allowing him to regain his sanity. Realizing his mistakes, Octavius make a heroic sacrifice to destroy the reactor permanently by demolishing the warehouse, while Peter rescues Mary Jane.\n\nThe following day, Peter receives a surprise visit from Mary Jane, who ran away from her wedding to confess her feelings for him and states that she will be fully embracing his double life. With his confidence renewed, Spider-Man prepares to protect the city once again.\n\n==Development==\nDevelopment on ''Spider-Man 2'' began at Treyarch shortly after the financial success of the first ''[[Spider-Man (2002 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' game. The physics-based web swinging system was conceived by designer Jamie Fristrom, who was dissatisfied with the web swinging system of the first game, which he was on the development team for, and desired a \"more realistic\" swinging system in the follow-up. He cited the game ''[[Rocket Jockey]]'' as an inspiration.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\">{{Cite web

acclaim. Critics noted that the realistic and life-sized Manhattan, the large variety of crimes and emergencies to stop, and the game's vivid use of Spider-Man's abilities all combined to make the player really feel like Spider-Man. The most popular aspect of the game was the web-swinging mechanic, where Spider-Man had to shoot webbing at an actual building, unlike previous games where he shot webbing up into the sky. However, small parts of the game were criticized, such as the repetition of some of the side missions. The game has been ranked by critics and fans as one of, if not, the best ''Spider-Man'' games ever made.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kim|first1=Matt|title=Ranking the Best Spider-Man Video Games Of All Time|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/14913-ranking-the-10-best-spider-man-video-games-of-all-time|website=Inverse|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Wojnar|first1=Zak|title=15 Best Spider-Man Video Games|url=https://screenrant.com/spider-man-video-games-best/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 9 Best Spider-Man Games Ever, Ranked|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/pictures-story/1207-best-spider-man-games.html#s10|website=Tom's Guide|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Marie|first1=Tara|title=Spider-Man: 15 Games RANKED From WORST To BEST|url=https://www.cbr.com/spider-man-15-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Alvarez|first1=Daniel|title=The 8 Best And 7 Worst Spider-Man Games|url=https://www.thegamer.com/the-8-best-and-7-worst-spider-man-games/|website=The Gamer|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 25 best Spider-Man games of all time|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-spiderman-games/3/|website=GamesRadar+|accessdate=30 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Hodges|first1=Chris|title=Every Spider-Man Video Game, Ranked From Worst To Best|url=https://screenrant.com/every-spider-man-video-game-ranked-worst-best/|website=Screen Rant|accessdate=30 April 2018|date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n\n[[IGN]] gave the game a score of 8.8 out of 10 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Nintendo GameCube]] versions,<ref name=IGN/> 9 / 10 for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] version,<ref name=IGNXB/> 7.1 / 10 for the [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] version,<ref name=IGNNG/> 7 / 10 for the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] version,<ref name=IGNPSP/> 7.5 / 10 for the [[Nintendo DS]] version,<ref name=IGNDS/> 6.5 / 10 for the [[Game Boy Advance]] version,<ref name=IGNGBA/> and 4.5 / 10 for the PC version.<ref name=IGNPC/> IGN stated on the PS2, GameCube, and Xbox version to \"call it Grand Theft Spider-Man. And call it damn fine.\" The version even got the IGN Editor's Choice Award for the year. IGN, reviewing the GBA version, credited positively the presentation, graphics, sound, web-zipping and wall-crawling.

It was formerly part of a town called \"Binalatongan\". Binalatongan was the capital of Luyag na Caboloan, an ancient kingdom, which includes the present-day provinces of Tarlac, Zambales, Nueva Ecija, La Union, Pangasinan, and Benguet) ruled by King Ari Kasikis. The name of Binalatongan was derived from the abundance of mongo (mung bean) plants along the San Juan riverbanks. During that time, Pangasinan traded with Japan, China and other Southeast Asian empires and national entities and enjoyed full independence and prosperity.\n\nCaboloan is the name of the primitive Pangasinan dialect, of which its purest form was spoken by the natives of Binalatongan.\n\nIn 1718, Binalatongan was renamed (the Municipality [town] of) San Carlos. \n\nDuring the 1960s, the Municipality of San Carlos divided into two precincts. In 1965, the smaller precinct became legally incorporated as the Municipality of [[Basista, Pangasinan|Basista]] by virtue of RA 4866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4866 - An Act Declaring Basista, Province of Pangasinan, Created by Executive Order Numbered Four Hundred Forty-Six Dated September Five, Nineteen Hundred Sixty-One, as a Duly Constituted Municipality |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/49_republicacts.php?id=4870 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=21 November 2019 |date=8 May 1967}}</ref> In 1966, the larger precinct became legally incorporated as San Carlos City by virtue of Republic Act No. 4487.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4487 - An Act Creating the City of San Carlos in Pangasinan |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/45_republicacts.php?id=4491 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=21 November 2019 |date=19 June 1965}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2007, San Carlos City's former mayor, Julian V.

It was formerly part of a town called \"Binalatongan\". Binalatongan was the capital of Luyag na Caboloan, an ancient kingdom , which includes the present-day provinces of Tarlac, Zambales, Nueva Ecija, La Union, Pangasinan, and Benguet) ruled by King Ari Kasikis. The name of Binalatongan was derived from the abundance of mongo (mung bean) plants along the San Juan riverbanks. During that time, Pangasinan traded with Japan, China and other Southeast Asian empires and national entities and enjoyed full independence and prosperity.\n\nCaboloan is the name of the primitive Pangasinan dialect, of which its purest form was spoken by the natives of Binalatongan.\n\nIn 1718, Binalatongan was renamed (the Municipality [town] of) San Carlos. \n\nDuring the 1960s, the Municipality of San Carlos divided into two precincts. In 1965, the smaller precinct became legally incorporated as the Municipality of [[Basista, Pangasinan|Basista]] by virtue of RA 4866.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4866 - An Act Declaring Basista, Province of Pangasinan, Created by Executive Order Numbered Four Hundred Forty-Six Dated September Five, Nineteen Hundred Sixty-One, as a Duly Constituted Municipality |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/49_republicacts.php?id=4870 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=21 November 2019 |date=8 May 1967}}</ref> In 1966, the larger precinct became legally incorporated as San Carlos City by virtue of Republic Act No. 4487.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 4487 - An Act Creating the City of San Carlos in Pangasinan |url=http://laws.chanrobles.com/republicacts/45_republicacts.php?id=4491 |website=laws.chanrobles.com |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |accessdate=21 November 2019 |date=19 June 1965}}</ref>\n\nOn April 28, 2007, San Carlos City's former mayor, Julian V.

The photograph shows a DES Cracker circuit board fitted on both sides with 64 Deep Crack chips.]]\n\nIn [[cryptography]], a '''brute-force attack''' consists of an attacker submitting many [[Password cracking|passwords]] or [[passphrase]]s with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found. Alternatively, the attacker can attempt to guess the [[Key (cryptography)|key]] which is typically created from the password using a [[key derivation function]]. This is known as an '''exhaustive key search'''.\n\nA brute-force attack is a [[cryptanalytic attack]] that can, in theory, be used to attempt to decrypt any encrypted data{{sfn|Paar|2010|p=7|ref=harv}} (except for data encrypted in an [[information-theoretically secure]] manner). Such an attack might be used when it is not possible to take advantage of other weaknesses in an encryption system (if any exist) that would make the task easier.\n\nWhen password-guessing, this method is very fast when used to check all short passwords, but for longer passwords other methods such as the [[dictionary attack]] are used because a brute-force search takes too long. Longer passwords, passphrases and keys have more possible values, making them exponentially more difficult to crack than shorter ones.\n\nBrute-force attacks can be made less effective by [[Obfuscation (software)|obfuscating]] the data to be encoded making it more difficult for an attacker to recognize when the code has been cracked or by making the attacker do more work to test each guess. One of the measures of the strength of an encryption system is how long it would theoretically take an attacker to mount a successful brute-force attack against it.\n\nBrute-force attacks are an application of [[brute-force search]], the general problem-solving technique of enumerating all candidates and checking each one.\n\n==Basic concept==\n\nBrute-force attacks work by calculating every possible combination that could make up a password and testing it to see if it is the correct password. As the password's length increases, the amount of time, on average, to find the correct password increases exponentially.\n\n==Theoretical limits==\nThe resources required for a brute-force attack grow [[exponential growth|exponentially]] with increasing [[key size]], not linearly. Although U.S. export regulations [[History of cryptography|historically restricted key lengths]] to 56-bit [[symmetric key]]s (e.g. [[Data Encryption Standard]]), these restrictions are no longer in place, so modern symmetric algorithms typically use computationally stronger 128- to 256-bit keys.\n\nThere is a physical argument that a 128-bit symmetric key is computationally secure against brute-force attack. The so-called [[Landauer's principle|Landauer limit]] implied by the laws of physics sets a lower limit on the energy required to perform a computation of {{math|''kT'' {{middot}} ln 2}} per bit erased in a computation, where ''T'' is the temperature of the computing device in [[kelvin]]s, ''k'' is the [[Boltzmann constant]], and the [[natural logarithm]] of 2 is about 0.693. No irreversible computing device can use less energy than this, even in principle.{{sfn|Landauer|1961|p=183-191}}  Thus, in order to simply flip through the possible values for a 128-bit symmetric key (ignoring doing the actual computing to check it) would, theoretically, require ''2<sup>128</sup> \u2212 1'' bit flips on a conventional processor.  If it is assumed that the calculation occurs near room temperature (~300 K), the Von Neumann-Landauer Limit can be applied to estimate the energy required as ~10<sup>18</sup> [[joule]]s, which is equivalent to consuming 30 [[Orders of magnitude (power)#gigawatt (109 watts)|gigawatts]] of power for one year. This is equal to 30&times;10<sup>9</sup> W\u00d7365\u00d724\u00d73600 s = 9.46\u00d710<sup>17</sup> J or 262.7 TWh ([[List of countries by electricity production|more than 1% of the world energy production]]). The full actual computation \u2013 checking each key to see if a solution has been found \u2013 would consume many times this amount. Furthermore, this is simply the energy requirement for cycling through the key space; the actual time it takes to flip each bit is not considered, which is certainly [[Bremermann's limit|greater than 0]].\n\nHowever, this argument assumes that the register values are changed using conventional set and clear operations which inevitably generate [[Entropy (computing)|entropy]]. It has been shown that computational hardware can be designed not to encounter this theoretical obstruction (see [[reversible computing]]), though no such computers are known to have been constructed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[File:ATI Radeon HD 5770 Graphics Card-oblique view.jpg|thumb|left|Modern [[Graphics processing unit|GPUs]] are well-suited to the repetitive tasks associated with hardware-based password cracking]] \nAs commercial successors of governmental [[ASIC]] solutions have become available, also known as [[custom hardware attack]]s,  two emerging technologies have proven their capability in the brute-force attack of certain ciphers. One is modern [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU) technology,{{sfn|Graham|2011|p=}}{{page needed|date=March 2012}} the other is the [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) technology.  GPUs benefit from their wide availability and price-performance benefit, FPGAs from their energy efficiency per cryptographic operation. Both technologies try to transport the benefits of parallel processing to brute-force attacks. In case of GPUs some hundreds, in the case of FPGA some thousand processing units making them much better suited to cracking passwords than conventional processors.\nVarious publications in the fields of cryptographic analysis have proved the energy efficiency of today's FPGA technology, for example, the [http://www.sciengines.com/copacobana COPACOBANA] FPGA Cluster computer consumes the same energy as a single PC (600&nbsp;W), but performs like 2,500 PCs for certain algorithms. A number of firms provide hardware-based FPGA cryptographic analysis solutions from a single FPGA [[PCI Express]] card up to dedicated FPGA computers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] and [[WPA2]] encryption have successfully been brute-force attacked by reducing the workload by a factor of 50 in comparison to conventional CPUs{{sfn|Kingsley-Hughes|2008}}{{sfn|Kamerling|2007}} and some hundred in case of FPGAs.\n[[File:COPACOBANA FPGA BOARD.jpg|thumb|240px|A single COPACOBANA board boasting 6 Xilinx Spartans \u2013 a cluster is made up of 20 of these]]\n\n[[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2<sup>128</sup> times more computational power than a 128-bit key. Fifty supercomputers that could check a billion billion (10<sup>18</sup>) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3\u00d710<sup>51</sup> years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.\n\nAn underlying assumption of a brute-force attack is that the complete keyspace was used to generate keys, something that relies on an effective [[random number generation|random number generator]], and that there are no defects in the algorithm or its implementation.  For example, a number of systems that were originally thought to be impossible to crack by brute force have nevertheless been [[Random number generator attack|cracked]] because the [[key space (cryptography)|key space]] to search through was found to be much smaller than originally thought, because of a lack of entropy in their [[pseudorandom number generator]]s. These include [[Netscape]]'s implementation of [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (famously cracked by [[Ian Goldberg]] and [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]] in 1995{{sfn|Viega|2002|p=18|ref=harv}}) and a [[Debian]]/[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] edition of [[OpenSSL]] discovered in 2008 to be flawed.{{sfn|CERT-2008}}  A similar lack of implemented entropy led to the breaking of [[Enigma machine|Enigma's]] code.{{sfn|Ellis}}{{sfn|NSA-2009}}\n\n==Credential recycling==\nCredential recycling refers to the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] practice of re-using username and password combinations gathered in previous brute-force attacks. A special form of credential recycling is [[pass the hash]], where [[Salt (cryptography)|unsalted]] hashed credentials are stolen and re-used without first being brute forced.\n\n==Unbreakable codes==\nCertain types of encryption, by their mathematical properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An example of this is [[one-time pad]] cryptography, where every [[cleartext]] bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer \u2013 but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the [[Venona project]], generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation: the key pads not being truly random, intercepted keypads, operators making mistakes \u2013 or other errors.{{sfn|Reynard|1997|p=86}}\n\n==Countermeasures==\nIn case of an offline attack where the attacker has access to the encrypted material, one can try key combinations without the risk of discovery or interference.  However database and directory administrators can take countermeasures against online attacks, for example by limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, by introducing time delays between successive attempts, increasing the answer's complexity (e.g. requiring a [[CAPTCHA]] answer or verification code sent via cellphone), and/or locking accounts out after unsuccessful logon attempts.{{sfn|Burnett|2004|p=|ref=harv}}{{page needed|date=March 2012}}  Website administrators may prevent a particular IP address from trying more than a predetermined number of password attempts against any account on the site.{{sfn|Ristic|2010|p=136}}\n\n==Reverse brute-force attack==\nIn a '''reverse brute-force attack''', a single (usually common) password is tested against multiple usernames or encrypted files.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosecpro.com/applicationsecurity/a11.htm|title=InfoSecPro.com - Computer, network, application and physical security consultants.|website=www.infosecpro.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153951/http://www.infosecpro.com/applicationsecurity/a11.htm|archivedate=4 April 2017}}</ref> The process may be repeated for a select few passwords.

A number of firms provide hardware-based FPGA cryptographic analysis solutions from a single FPGA [[PCI Express]] card up to dedicated FPGA computers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}  [[Wi-Fi Protected Access|WPA]] and [[WPA2]] encryption have successfully been brute-force attacked by reducing the workload by a factor of 50 in comparison to conventional CPUs{{sfn|Kingsley-Hughes|2008}}{{sfn|Kamerling|2007}} and some hundred in case of FPGAs.\n[[File:COPACOBANA FPGA BOARD.jpg|thumb|240px|A single COPACOBANA board boasting 6 Xilinx Spartans \u2013 a cluster is made up of 20 of these]]\n\n[[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] permits the use of 256-bit keys. Breaking a symmetric 256-bit key by brute force requires 2<sup>128</sup> times more computational power than a 128-bit key. Fifty supercomputers that could check a billion billion (10<sup>18</sup>) AES keys per second (if such a device could ever be made) would, in theory, require about 3\u00d710<sup>51</sup> years to exhaust the 256-bit key space.\n\nAn underlying assumption of a brute-force attack is that the complete keyspace was used to generate keys, something that relies on an effective [[random number generation|random number generator]], and that there are no defects in the algorithm or its implementation.  For example, a number of systems that were originally thought to be impossible to crack by brute force have nevertheless been [[Random number generator attack|cracked]] because the [[key space (cryptography)|key space]] to search through was found to be much smaller than originally thought, because of a lack of entropy in their [[pseudorandom number generator]]s. These include [[Netscape]]'s implementation of [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] (famously cracked by [[Ian Goldberg]] and [[David A. Wagner|David Wagner]] in 1995{{sfn|Viega|2002|p=18|ref=harv}}) and a [[Debian]]/[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] edition of [[OpenSSL]] discovered in 2008 to be flawed.{{sfn|CERT-2008}}  A similar lack of implemented entropy led to the breaking of [[Enigma machine|Enigma's]] code.{{sfn|Ellis}}{{sfn|NSA-2009}}\n\n==Credential recycling==\nCredential recycling refers to the [[Hacker (computer security)|hacking]] practice of re-using username and password combinations gathered in previous brute-force attacks. A special form of credential recycling is [[pass the hash]], where [[Salt (cryptography)|unsalted]] hashed credentials are stolen and re-used without first being brute forced.\n\n==Unbreakable codes==\nCertain types of encryption, by their mathematical properties, cannot be defeated by brute force. An example of this is [[one-time pad]] cryptography, where every [[cleartext]] bit has a corresponding key from a truly random sequence of key bits. A 140 character one-time-pad-encoded string subjected to a brute-force attack would eventually reveal every 140 character string possible, including the correct answer \u2013 but of all the answers given, there would be no way of knowing which was the correct one. Defeating such a system, as was done by the [[Venona project]], generally relies not on pure cryptography, but upon mistakes in its implementation: the key pads not being truly random, intercepted keypads, operators making mistakes \u2013 or other errors.{{sfn|Reynard|1997|p=86}}\n\n==Countermeasures==\nIn case of an offline attack where the attacker has access to the encrypted material, one can try key combinations without the risk of discovery or interference.  However database and directory administrators can take countermeasures against online attacks, for example by limiting the number of attempts that a password can be tried, by introducing time delays between successive attempts, increasing the answer's complexity (e.g. requiring a [[CAPTCHA]] answer or verification code sent via cellphone), and/or locking accounts out after unsuccessful logon attempts.{{sfn|Burnett|2004|p=|ref=harv}}{{page needed|date=March 2012}}  Website administrators may prevent a particular IP address from trying more than a predetermined number of password attempts against any account on the site.{{sfn|Ristic|2010|p=136}}\n\n==Reverse brute-force attack==\nIn a '''reverse brute-force attack''', a single (usually common) password is tested against multiple usernames or encrypted files.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infosecpro.com/applicationsecurity/a11.htm|title=InfoSecPro.com - Computer, network, application and physical security consultants.|website=www.infosecpro.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170404153951/http://www.infosecpro.com/applicationsecurity/a11.htm|archivedate=4 April 2017}}</ref> The process may be repeated for a select few passwords.

The city is also used as a departure point to [[Cebu City]] as well. It has a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two [[RORO|RO-RO vessels]] and the extension of the length of the port to {{convert|242.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Carlos City has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry. The rainy season is from May to January with heavy rains occurring during the months of August and September. Dry season lasts from February to April. December and January are the coldest months while April is the hottest.\n\n===Barangays===\nSan Carlos City is politically subdivided into 18 [[barangays]].\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*Bagonbon\n*Buluangan\n*Codcod\n*Ermita (Sipaway)\n*Guadalupe\n*Nataban\n*Palampas\n*Barangay I ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay II ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay III ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay IV ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay V ([[Poblacion]])\n*Barangay VI ([[Poblacion]])\n*Prosperidad\n*Punao\n*Quezon\n*Rizal\n*San Juan (Sipaway)\n}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-Spanish and Spanish colonization===\nSan Carlos City was formerly named \"Nabingkalan\", deriving its name from ''Nabingka'', a beautiful daughter of a chieftain of the [[Aeta|Negrito]] settlement in the area, who ruled the [[barrio]] during the early part in the 17th century. She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio Nabingkalan. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from [[Badian, Cebu|Badian]], [[Cebu]], who, with the help of fellow pioneers, developed the settlement into a thriving [[Christians|Christian]] village. Fragments of written history show that in 1856, the Island of Buglas ([[Negros Island|Negros]]), as a politico-military province under [[Spain]], was divided into two provinces, West Negros under [[Iloilo]] and East Negros under [[Cebu]]. The barrio of Nabingkalan under Calatrava, was under the jurisdiction of Iloilo. Se\u00f1or Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the place and established it as a ''pueblo''.\n\nWhen this mission was created in 1895, it belonged to the municipality of Calatraba, although it is true, that since 1891 a Religious was destined for it.The state of those years gives us the very small number of inhabitants that comprised it, which is that of 1,100 souls, who rather inhabited the mountainous p art than that of the p lay a, where the current village is. Fr. Pedro Chivite was assigned to the service of that mission. Vacant this mission during the Revolution, for the year 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took care of it. This with the help of the PP. \u00c1ngel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo and Vicente V\u00e1zquez attended to all the towns of that coast, from Guinjulngan to Escalante. Since that date, it is still administered by our Fathers. But in what was a bad, poor and depopulated village in 97, today it is one of the most important towns in the rich Province of Negros Occidental. of San Carlos today amounts, according to approximate calculation, to 30,000 souls. That extensive plot of land previously uncultivated today is painstakingly worked. A Spaniard who observed the fertility of that land began by raising a small sugarcane farm; and seeing the good results obtained, others were added, those fields were cultivated, modern machines were installed and, thus, what was once a wasteland, today is one of the most productive villages in Negros. In 1889 there were only four estates, in 1897 they amounted to 16 and today they are some more, property in their majority of Spanish art.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sinopsis Historica dela Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino delas Islas Filipinas dela Orden De Agustinos Descalzos por el Padre Licinio Ruiz de Sta.

In 1903, the political arena was a hot place, it being the first taste of the Filipinos to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. The political activities, however, was closely woven with that of Calatrava, until 1925, when Calatrava was organized into a municipality.\n\nSan Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos, Negros, have erected the first and only modern sugar mills in the Philippines, and they have gone into cane cultivation and sugar manufacture in a scientific way. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which means about 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Something about sugar, its history, growth, manufacture and distribution |last=George|first=Rolph|date=1917|ol = 7141860M}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Municipality of San Carlos comprised barrios Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, Varconia.<ref name=\"University of Michigan\">{{cite web |last1=Villamor |first1=Ignacio |last2=Buencamino |first2=Felipe |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/ajb5835.appe.001.umich.edu/page/410 |website=archive.org/ |publisher=Manila, : Bureau of Printing |accessdate=8 March 2019 |ref=University of Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe municipality of San Carlos shall consist of its present territory and that of the municipality of Calatrava, with the seat of the municipal government at the present municipality of San Carlos (Act No. 716, Enacted, April 2, 1903<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsphilippinec01unkngoog#page/n524|title=Acts of the Philippine Commission.

After the [[armistice]] in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During [[World War I]], many sons of San Carlos volunteered to fight for the [[United States]], but a few months later, were sent back home because of the armistice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n===World War II===\nSan Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during The Second World War (World War II).  A month after the surrender of Negros to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]], the Guerrilla Movement began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, Guerilla Units under the leadership of Capt. Eugenio Antonio,Jr., Lt. Leonardo Marane and Lt. Alfredo Valdivia assisted by the Philippine Commonwealth Military Troops began operations against the enemy. Pitched battles were fought within the environs of the \"poblacion\". Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Maj. Edward McClenahan, separate Guerrilla Units were scattered in the area under different Commanders as they were not able to establish a formal chain-of-command among the different Guerilla Factions effectively.\n\nUpon the return of some local [[USAFFE]] officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Capts. Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin, together with Lts. Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of roving guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens (just barely enough to carry rifles) joined the ranks and fought bravely face-to-face against the Japanese.\n\nIn March 1945, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Col. [[Ernesto S. Mata]], attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Alfredo Valdivia.\n\nIn October 10, 1945 President Sergio Osmena appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195/mode/2up |title=Messages of the President Sergio Osmena 1944-1946 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195 |archive-date=1944\u20131946 |url-status=}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war period===\nThe first post-war election found the town with a Liberal government.

In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the [[Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival]] and the [[Dances of Flowers]] as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the present-day \"Pintaflores Festival\".\n\n''Pintaflores'' is coined from the words ''pintados'' (\"painted ones\"), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and ''flores'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"flowers\" that dominated the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The ''Pintaflores'' street dancing and ritual competition highlights the annual Pintaflores Festival every November 3\u20135.\n\nIt features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the ''Pintados'' tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.\n\nThe [[street dancing]] is culminated by a dance ritual performed at the City auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another impressive part of the dance ritual which are products of the ingenuity and skill of the choreographers and dancers.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111212816/http://www.geocities.com/cstrecoletos/ Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos] high school students, bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily competed Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in Panaad Sa Negros '93, to province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.\n\nRepresented by Barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent emerged first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of Barangay Ermita secured again the championship in Panaad Sa Negros 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival '98.\n\nIn [[Panaad sa Negros]] '98, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from Barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital graced the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In Panaad '99 the Pintaflores represented this time by elementary school children, once again proved its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the [[Hall of Fame]] award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.\n\nHaving established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as [[Iloilo City]] (1996) and [[Roxas City]] (1997) as among the best of the best in the region, and in [[Canlaon City]] and [[Victorias]] in 1999 as the best in the province.\n\nPintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the launching of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata in 1996. A street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children. Pinta Bata thrills one with the children's pleasing gracefulness and versatility that promises a crop of excellent dancers in the years to come.\n\nAfter five years and many awards, including the Hall of Fame awards in street dancing in the Panaad sa Negros, the word Pintaflores, like \"Daan Sa Kaunlaran\" and Homelot program, now has become another byword of the creativity of San Carlose\u00f1os.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Cycle rickshaw#Philippines|Pedicabs]] and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|Motorized tricycle]]s are common mode of transport. [[Bus]]es and [[jeepney]]s provide service for inter-town travel.

The city is also used as a departure point to [[Cebu City]] as well. It has a {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, of which some parts are covered with mangroves. The city has a deep natural harbor protected from inclement weather by the island of Refugio, also known as Sipaway. Due to these aspects, the [[Philippine Ports Authority]] has chosen the San Carlos City port from among other ports in the province for its expansion program in 1998 which include the reclamation of four hectares of sea to accommodate various port buildings, facilities and container vans, an extension on the east side for two [[RORO|RO-RO vessels]] and the extension of the length of the port to {{convert|242.50|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Climate===\nSan Carlos City has two pronounced seasons, wet and dry. The rainy season is from May to January with heavy rains occurring during the months of August and September. Dry season lasts from February to April.

She was famous for her loveliness and mental and physical prowess. After her death, the people mourned for two years, and to perpetuate her memory, named the barrio Nabingkalan. The settlement was later bought by Carlos Apurado from [[Badian, Cebu|Badian]], [[Cebu]], who, with the help of fellow pioneers, developed the settlement into a thriving [[Christians|Christian]] village. Fragments of written history show that in 1856, the Island of Buglas ([[Negros Island|Negros]]), as a politico-military province under [[Spain]], was divided into two provinces, West Negros under [[Iloilo]] and East Negros under [[Cebu]]. The barrio of Nabingkalan under Calatrava, was under the jurisdiction of Iloilo. Se\u00f1or Don Emilio Saravia, the first political-military governor in the island during the Spanish era, renamed the place and established it as a ''pueblo''.\n\nWhen this mission was created in 1895, it belonged to the municipality of Calatraba, although it is true, that since 1891 a Religious was destined for it.The state of those years gives us the very small number of inhabitants that comprised it , which is that of 1,100 souls, who rather inhabited the mountainous p art than that of the p lay a, where the current village is. Fr. Pedro Chivite was assigned to the service of that mission. Vacant this mission during the Revolution, for the year 1904 Father Eusebio Valderrama took care of it. This with the help of the PP. \u00c1ngel Quintana, Juan Lorenzo and Vicente V\u00e1zquez attended to all the towns of that coast, from Guinjulngan to Escalante. Since that date, it is still administered by our Fathers. But in what was a bad, poor and depopulated village in 97, today it is one of the most important towns in the rich Province of Negros Occidental. of San Carlos today amounts, according to approximate calculation, to 30,000 souls. That extensive plot of land previously uncultivated today is painstakingly worked. A Spaniard who observed the fertility of that land began by raising a small sugarcane farm; and seeing the good results obtained, others were added, those fields were cultivated, modern machines were installed and, thus, what was once a wasteland, today is one of the most productive villages in Negros. In 1889 there were only four estates, in 1897 they amounted to 16 and today they are some more, property in their majority of Spanish art.<ref>{{cite book |title=Sinopsis Historica dela Provincia de San Nicolas de Tolentino delas Islas Filipinas dela Orden De Agustinos Descalzos por el Padre Licinio Ruiz de Sta.

In 1903, the political arena was a hot place, it being the first taste of the Filipinos to elect their own leaders. In 1912, when a sugar central was constructed, the economic life of the people was greatly enhanced. The political activities, however, was closely woven with that of Calatrava, until 1925, when Calatrava was organized into a municipality.\n\nSan Carlos Milling Company of San Carlos, Negros, have erected the first and only modern sugar mills in the Philippines, and they have gone into cane cultivation and sugar manufacture in a scientific way. The capacity of the mill is 1000 tons of cane per day, which means about 125 tons of centrifugal sugar. It was completed at the end of 1913 at a cost of about one million dollars, and the first cane ground was from the 1914 crop.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Something about sugar, its history, growth, manufacture and distribution |last=George|first=Rolph|date=1917|ol = 7141860M}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, Municipality of San Carlos comprised barrios Antabayan, Cubay, Euzcasa, Looc, Malalamban, San Juan, Santa Filomena, Sitio Banatic, Tigbon, Varconia.<ref name=\"University of Michigan\">{{cite web |last1=Villamor |first1=Ignacio |last2=Buencamino |first2=Felipe |title=Census of the Philippine Islands taken under the direction of the Philippine Legislature in the year 1918 |url=https://archive.org/details/ajb5835.appe.001.umich.edu/page/410 |website=archive.org/ |publisher=Manila, : Bureau of Printing |accessdate=8 March 2019 |ref=University of Michigan}}</ref>\n\nThe municipality of San Carlos shall consist of its present territory and that of the municipality of Calatrava, with the seat of the municipal government at the present municipality of San Carlos (Act No. 716, Enacted, April 2, 1903<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/actsphilippinec01unkngoog#page/n524|title=Acts of the Philippine Commission.

After the [[armistice]] in 1917, the planters who produced more sugar had their wealth greatly increased because of the new price of sugar never before enjoyed by the planters. During [[World War I]], many sons of San Carlos volunteered to fight for the [[United States]], but a few months later, were sent back home because of the armistice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\n===World War II===\nSan Carlos was actively involved on the war efforts against Imperial Japan during The Second World War (World War II).  A month after the surrender of Negros to the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Imperial Forces]], the Guerrilla Movement began in San Carlos and Calatrava. As early as June 15, 1942, Guerilla Units under the leadership of Capt. Eugenio Antonio,Jr., Lt. Leonardo Marane and Lt. Alfredo Valdivia assisted by the Philippine Commonwealth Military Troops began operations against the enemy. Pitched battles were fought within the environs of the \"poblacion\". Despite the presence of the U.S. forces under Maj. Edward McClenahan, separate Guerrilla Units were scattered in the area under different Commanders as they were not able to establish a formal chain-of-command among the different Guerilla Factions effectively.\n\nUpon the return of some local [[USAFFE]] officers to San Carlos, the guerrilla movement was formally organized into fighting units under USAFFE Capts. Catalino D. Rivera, Eugenio Antonio, Jr. and Loreto Y. Apuhin, together with Lts. Florencio C. Yap and Andres L. Arrogante, the bands of roving guerrillas in San Carlos were consolidated under one command. Young men in their early teens (just barely enough to carry rifles) joined the ranks and fought bravely face-to-face against the Japanese.\n\nIn March 1945, the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] forces under the 7th, 71st and 72nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army, 7th Infantry Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and local guerrilla units under the command of Col. [[Ernesto S. Mata]], attacked the Japanese garrison in the compound of San Carlos Milling Company and succeeded in driving away the Japanese Army, at the cost of the life of Lt. Alfredo Valdivia.\n\nIn October 10, 1945 President Sergio Osmena appointed Eugenio Antonio as Acting Mayor of San Carlos and Anacleto Facturan as Acting Vice Mayor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195/mode/2up |title=Messages of the President Sergio Osmena 1944-1946 |website=archive.org |archive-url=https://archive.org/stream/MOPVol1and2SergioOsmena/VOL1-2_001-282_OSMENA#page/n195 |archive-date=1944\u20131946 |url-status=}}</ref>\n\n===Post-war period===\nThe first post-war election found the town with a Liberal government.

In 1992 after successfully holding two activities with the [[Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival]] and the [[Dances of Flowers]] as highlights of the city fiesta, the idea of blending the two concepts to come up with a presentation that could be considered the city's very own started what today is one of the most popular street dancing festivals in the region, the present-day \"Pintaflores Festival\".\n\n''Pintaflores'' is coined from the words ''pintados'' (\"painted ones\"), the concept behind the Nabingkalan Tattoo Festival, and ''flores'', the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for \"flowers\" that dominated the theme of the Dances of Flowers. The ''Pintaflores'' street dancing and ritual competition highlights the annual Pintaflores Festival every November 3\u20135.\n\nIt features rhythmic dances and dance dramas of life and death and the triumph of good against evil that depict the people's thanksgiving and merriment, abundant blessings and success. As part of the ''Pintados'' tradition, the faces, arms, bodies and legs of the dancers are painted with flowers to express gratitude to man and his environment.\n\nThe [[street dancing]] is culminated by a dance ritual performed at the City auditorium. Different dance steps and musical accompaniment add to the thrill of the competition. The human flower formation is another impressive part of the dance ritual which are products of the ingenuity and skill of the choreographers and dancers.\n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111212816/http://www.geocities.com/cstrecoletos/ Colegio de Santo Tomas - Recoletos] high school students, bested seasoned contestants to land third place in the free interpretation category in the heavily competed Sinulog festival in Cebu City in January 1993. In April of the same year, the group won the championship in Panaad Sa Negros '93, to province-wide cultural festival in Negros Occidental.\n\nRepresented by Barangays II and Quezon, the Pintaflores street dancing contingent emerged first prize in Panaad Sa Negros in 1996. The same group with the participation of Barangay Ermita secured again the championship in Panaad Sa Negros 1997 and the fifth prize in Sinulog festival '98.\n\nIn [[Panaad sa Negros]] '98, the Pintaflores group composed of dancers from Barangays Punao and Palampas and the City Hospital graced the fiesta presentation as guest performers. In Panaad '99 the Pintaflores represented this time by elementary school children, once again proved its unbeatable streak by emerging champions, consequently reaping the [[Hall of Fame]] award for topping the fiesta presentation event in four consecutive years.\n\nHaving established a name in street dancing, Pintaflores danced performers in such places as [[Iloilo City]] (1996) and [[Roxas City]] (1997) as among the best of the best in the region, and in [[Canlaon City]] and [[Victorias]] in 1999 as the best in the province.\n\nPintaflores has evolved as a new breed of dancers emerged with the launching of Pintaflores Bata or Pinta Bata in 1996. A street dancing and ritual competition among elementary school children. Pinta Bata thrills one with the children's pleasing gracefulness and versatility that promises a crop of excellent dancers in the years to come.\n\nAfter five years and many awards, including the Hall of Fame awards in street dancing in the Panaad sa Negros, the word Pintaflores, like \"Daan Sa Kaunlaran\" and Homelot program, now has become another byword of the creativity of San Carlose\u00f1os.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n[[Cycle rickshaw#Philippines|Pedicabs]] and [[Motorized tricycle (Philippines)|Motorized tricycle]]s are common mode of transport.
