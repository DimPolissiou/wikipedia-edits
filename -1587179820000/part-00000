My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day. He will be working long hours, in a thankless, difficult job, for entry level money \u2013 the way it should be. There has also been talk of my daughter joining WWE as a backstage interviewer.

My son was hired two months ago by WWE creative, and will begin working with the company in January. He would have started earlier, but he and I both felt it was important for him to fulfill the commitment he made to the college that employed him as the director of a residence hall. He could have merely explained that this was his dream job, and possibly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, but he chose to stay because it was the right thing \u2013 and because I told him that deep down, Mr. McMahon would respect him as a man of his word. My son was not given this job because of his last name. He earned it. He earned it by working for hundreds of hours in solitude, with no compensation, to prove his writing skills and mind for the business. There are no piece-of-cake jobs in WWE. As ESPN's Jonathan Coachman said of his time with WWE, \"you are expected to bring it every day.\" My son will do his best to \"bring it\" every day.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests.

Black citizens in [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. The legislature also changed the boundaries of [[Tuskegee, Alabama|Tuskegee]] to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits.

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v.

At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions.

In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]].

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|right| ]]\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

For example, in 2003, Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.\n\n===County and local governments===\n\n{{see also|List of counties in Alabama}}\n{{Alabama County Labelled Map|align=right|width=300}}\n\nAlabama has 67 [[county (United States)|counties]]. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices.

Their line-up solidified when Gavan Whelan joined on drums. They played a string of gigs under the names Venereal and the Diseases and later, Volume Distortion, before settling on the name of Model Team International, then shortened to Model Team. They performed mostly improvised material derived from [[jam session]]s, supporting [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] at an early gig at Manchester Polytechnic. Vocalists and other musicians drifted rapidly in and out of their line-up, until the band encountered [[Tim Booth]] at a student disco. Gilbertson invited him to the band's scout hut in [[Withington]] to join the band as a dancer; he was soon promoted to lead singer. After a brief period under the name Tribal Outlook, the band renamed themselves James in August 1982. A gig at [[the Ha\u00e7ienda]] caught the attention of [[Tony Wilson]] of [[Factory Records]]. He offered James an album deal with Factory, but the band, by now a settled live act, were worried about tarnishing their material in the studio and settled instead for a three-track EP. Their debut release, the ''[[Jimone]] EP'', was recorded at [[Strawberry Studios]], [[Stockport]], in August 1983 and released on Factory Records in September.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It led to the band providing the support for [[The Smiths]] between February and April 1985 on the [[Meat is Murder]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneofthethree.co.uk/jameshistory.htm |title=James History |publisher=Oneofthethree.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> The Smiths covered James' 'What's The World' track during this tour.\n\nAlthough they were now being touted as the 'next big thing', several complex issues slowed their progress. Gilbertson's drug problems presented the band with no choice but to ask him to leave. Booth and Glennie had joined a sect named Lifewave that imposed many restrictions on their lifestyle and threatened the band's stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicarcades.com/2006/04/james_stutter.html |title=James: Stutter |publisher=Music Arcades |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> The band's second EP, ''[[James II (EP)|James II]]'', was released over a year after the first and accompanied by a feature on the cover of the ''[[NME]]'', Gilbertson having been replaced by the band's guitar tutor [[Larry Gott]]. The first two EPs would later be collected as ''[[Village Fire]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Reviews were once again positive, and Factory were eager for James to record an album with it, but the band believed Factory were purely image-based and left the label, striking a deal with [[Sire Records]].\n\nTheir third release, the ''[[Chain Mail (James song)|Sit Down EP]]'' (no relation to the song of that name) came out in February 1986, and was followed by their debut album, ''[[Stutter (album)|Stutter]]'' in July of that year.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album reached number 68 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Low on money and lacking coverage and promotion, the band recorded their second album, ''[[Strip-mine (album)|Strip-mine]]'', attempting a more conventional song structure in an attempt to please Sire. The album almost went unreleased, but after undergoing a slight remix to sound more radio-friendly, Sire released the album in September 1988, over a year after it had been initially completed. However the album only reached number 90.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After finding a clause for ending their contract, the band left Sire.\n\nJames had by this point earned themselves a reputation as a live act and had built a solid fanbase. Sales of James T-shirts were particularly successful in Manchester even before they reached the [[Top 40]]. James financed the production of a [[live album]] ''[[One Man Clapping]]'' with a bank loan and the help of [[Rough Trade Records]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album went to number 1 in the indie charts, reinvigorating media interest in the band.\n\n===Line-up changes and success: 1988\u20131992===\nIn November 1988, drummer Whelan became involved in an on-stage fight with Booth<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/gavan-whelan-9202a8c04000641f8000000000ae00b9# |title=Gavan Whelan Music Videos |publisher=Ovguide.com |accessdate=2012-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606142019/http://www.ovguide.com/gavan-whelan-9202a8c04000641f8000000000ae00b9 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by [[David Baynton-Power]] a few months later. During the following year James greatly expanded their lineup and sound palette by hiring three new members&nbsp;\u2014 guitarist-violinist-percussionist [[Saul Davies]] (who Gott recruited from an amateur blues night), keyboard player Mark Hunter and onetime Diagram Brothers/ Dislocation Dance / The Cotton Singers [[The Pale Fountains|Pale Fountains]] trumpeter/percussionist [[Andy Diagram]] (the latter a noted avant-garde musician).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> This new seven-piece line-up went into the studio to record the third James album.\n\nNew singles \"[[Sit Down (James song)|Sit Down]]\" and \"[[Come Home (James song)|Come Home]]\" became strong hits in the independent charts, and the latter featured on the [[compilation album]] ''[[Happy Daze (Madchester album)|Happy Daze]]''. The album ''Gold Mother'' was intended to be released on Rough Trade but the owner of the label, [[Geoff Travis]], believed James could only reach an audience of 20,000 to 30,000. The band believed they had more potential than this and bought the rights to the album from Rough Trade. A successful winter tour in 1989 attracted a deal with [[Fontana Records]],<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and the band ended a difficult decade on an optimistic note.\n\n''[[Gold Mother]]'' was released in June 1990, just as the '[[Madchester]]' movement, with its wave of popular Manchester-based indie bands, focused public attention on James and won them mainstream recognition.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Singles \"How Was It for You\", the remixed \"[[Come Home (James song)|Come Home]]\" and \"Lose Control\" all made the Top 40, and the band's newfound success was re-affirmed when they played two sell-out dates at the Manchester [[G-Mex]] at the end of the year. In March 1991, when the popularity of \"[[Sit Down (James song)|Sit Down]]\" led to a re-recorded version being released as a single, reaching number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Gold Mother'' was re-released to include \"Sit Down\" and previous single \"Lose Control\", and the album sold ten times more copies than Travis originally predicted. The song became one of the biggest-selling singles of the year.\n\nThe band members spent the rest of the year recording their next album, ''[[Seven (James album)|Seven]]'', which was released in February 1992.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart (its lead single, \"[[Sound (James song)|Sound]]\", had followed \"Sit Down\" into the top 10 a few months earlier) and earned the band some recognition in the [[United States|US]] as they embarked on their first Stateside tour. The band's activities culminated in a sell-out show to 30,000 people at the [[Alton Towers]] theme park in July, broadcast live on [[BBC Radio 1]], following which Andy Diagram left the group.\n\n===Subsequent releases: 1993\u20132001===\nIn 1993 James were invited on an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] tour of the [[US]] supporting [[Neil Young]] at a series of natural outdoor venues in the autumn. They returned to [[England]] refreshed and ready to record their new album with [[Brian Eno]], whom they had originally approached to produce ''Stutter'' but who had been unavailable at the time. Eno set about bringing out the [[Ambient music|ambience]] in James' music, and took them through a recording process that the band later described as a \"journey of self-discovery\". The process resulted in not one but two albums: the 'song' album, ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'', and the experimental ''[[Wah Wah (James album)|Wah Wah]]'', which showcased the band's improvised jams recorded on the spot, then [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by Eno.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Booth's vocals were then added to the results.\n\n''Laid'' was released in September 1993 to positive reviews. As well as being a success in the UK, the album also broke the band in the US, shipping over 600,000 copies and charting at number 72 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> propelled by the popularity of [[Laid (song)|its risqu\u00e9 title track]] on US [[Campus radio|college radio]]. The band spent most of 1994 touring the States. ''Wah Wah'' was eventually released in September 1994 to a lukewarm reception.\n\nThe recording of the follow-up album faced difficulties from the start. Two key members of the James organisation resigned&nbsp;\u2014 guitarist and key composer Larry Gott (who left the group in order to spend more time with his family) and manager Martine McDonagh (who had had a sometimes fraught romantic relationship with Booth, resulting in a son called Ben). Booth announced that he also wished to take a break in order to record an album with [[Angelo Badalamenti]]. At around the same time, there was the discovery of a \u00a3250,000 tax bill owed by the band.\n\nDetermined to continue despite the setbacks, the band set up studio in Baynton-Power's house. Former [[Sharkboy]] guitarist [[Adrian Oxaal]] was drafted in to replace Gott on guitar,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> while Booth returned periodically from the States to add his vocals. 1996 saw the release of Booth's album with Badalamenti (''[[Booth and the Bad Angel]]''). The new James album, ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]'', followed in February 1997. The album proved a successful comeback, reaching the UK top 10 as did the single \"[[She's a Star]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe band toured to promote the album, recruiting new member [[Michael Kulas]] while in the States, on rhythm guitar. Booth suffered a neck injury while dancing on stage in the US, resulting in a series of tour dates being cancelled as he underwent emergency surgery, and the band being offered a place instead on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. In March 1998, a greatest hits album, ''[[The Best Of (James album)|The Best Of]]'', was released, compiling all the band's hits since their signing to Fontana. The album reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and sell-out tours throughout the year followed.\n\nThe band then returned to the studio to begin work on their next album, ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'', which was released in October 1999. The album did not reach the phenomenal sales level predicted, but still entered the UK Album charts at number 2,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and sold over 150,000 copies.\n\nAfter the disappointing performance of ''Millionaires'' the band chose to start anew in their approach to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour in the autumn of that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased To Meet You]]'', was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.\n\n=== Break-up and other projects: 2002\u20132006 ===\nShortly after their last album release, James reached the end of their contract, and Tim Booth announced he was leaving the band to concentrate on other projects of his own. They played a farewell tour of the UK at the end of the year. Their final hometown gig, at the Manchester Evening News arena on 7 December, was recorded for a live CD and DVD, ''[[Getting Away With It... Live]]''. Past members Larry Gott and Andy Diagram rejoined them for the tour, and [[Brian Eno]] also joined them onstage at London's Wembley Arena during the tour. The albums ''Gold Mother'', ''Laid'', and ''Whiplash'' (each containing bonus tracks) were re-released by Mercury Records the following year, as well as a B-sides compilation entitled ''[[B-Sides Ultra]]''.\n\nA planned compilation of material from the band's Factory and Sire years was announced in 2001, but the album, ''Strange Dancing'', was never released. The first two James albums, ''[[Stutter (album)|Stutter]]'' and ''[[Strip-mine (album)|Strip-mine]]'', were re-pressed in June 2007, but without any additional rarities.\n\nBooth continued as a solo artist in 2004 with the release of his solo album ''Bone'', co-written and produced by [[Lee Muddy Baker]].\n\nA new [[compilation album]], ''[[The Collection (James album)|The Collection]]'' was released in late 2004, and ''Seven&nbsp;\u2013 The Live Concert'' (a DVD version of a previously released video) in 2005.\n\n===Reunion: 2007\u2013present===\nIn January 2007 singer Tim Booth's personal website announced that \"Tim will be rejoining James in early 2007 for a series of live shows to be announced very soon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timbooth.co.uk/ |title=Tim Booth personal webpage - archived |accessdate=2017-03-01 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113174156/http://www.timbooth.co.uk/ |archivedate=13 January 2008 }}</ref> At the same time, James' old website was replaced by a new domain holder at wearejames.com. The site confirmed the line-up as that which recorded the album ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'': Booth, Gott, Glennie, Davies, Hunter and Baynton-Power. Booth confirmed in interviews that he became convinced to rejoin the band after meeting up with Glennie and Gott the previous November for a jamming session, out of which new songs were born.\n\nThe initial five dates of the tour were expanded to seven on the day tickets went on sale (26 January) due to high demand; the whole tour had sold out by close of business. The tour took place during late April 2007, and was followed later in the year by more live shows, including festival appearances at [[T in the Park]] and [[V Festival]]. The band also appeared at [[Summercase]], Barcelona's top music concert in Spain during July 2007. [[Andy Diagram]] also rejoined the band as trumpet player during the festival tour. April saw the release of a new compilation album, ''Fresh as a Daisy&nbsp;\u2014 The Singles'', accompanied by a DVD compilation of all the band's promo videos.\n\nThe new album ''[[Hey Ma (James album)|Hey Ma]]'' was released on 7 April 2008, peaking at number 10 on the UK album charts, and a three-week tour to promote the album commenced on 10 April 2008. An arena tour of the UK called \"We Are Sound\" followed in December, on which two new songs (\"Porcupine\" and \"Look Away\") were previewed as tasters for a new studio album. A live album with a selection of songs recorded during the 2008 spring tour was exclusively sold at the merchandise stalls of the \"We Are Sound\" tour. ''[[Live in 2008]]'' was limited to 5000 copies.\n\nThe band announced plans to release two mini-albums by April 2010. ''[[The Night Before (James album)|The Night Before]]'' was released on 19 April, although its follow-up, ''[[The Morning After (James album)|The Morning After]]'', was released later than expected, on 2 August 2010. Following the release of ''The Night Before'', the band embarked on a UK tour, the Mirrorball Tour, premi\u00e8ring songs from the album. Another UK tour took place in December. Both this tour and the US release of both mini-albums together as a 2-CD set called ''The Morning After The Night Before''. A 19-date North American tour began in September to promote the combined album as well as showcase the songs before the UK tour.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, Tim Booth announced that he was working on some new solo material, although James remained active, participating in the [[Lollapalooza]] festival in [[Chile]]. The band appeared at The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on 13 and 20 April in [[Indio, California]] and [[Hard Rock Calling|Hard Rock Calling 2011]] on 24 June in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, where they were joined by [[Kaiser Chiefs]] and headline act [[The Killers]]. Towards the end of 2011, James signalled a departure from their previous touring style, with the announcement of a series of dates in October and November of that year including an orchestra and a choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/james/57671 |title=James announce UK tour with choir and orchestra \u2013 ticket details &#124; News |publisher=Nme.com |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref>  This short, ten date tour saw James performing their back catalogue accompanied by the Orchestra of the Swan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orchestraoftheswan.org |title=Orchestra of the Swan |publisher=Orchestra of the Swan |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> and the Manchester Consort Choir.\n\nThey played at [[Kendal Calling]] Festival 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kendalcalling.co.uk/media/?youtubeid=DMnxHtCjoFQ&youtubeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDMnxHtCjoFQ%26feature%3Dyoutube_gdata|title=James: Sit Down live|website=Kendalcalling.co.uk}}</ref> and toured again in 2013.\n\nJames' first new album in six years ''[[La Petite Mort (James album)|La Petite Mort]]'' was released on 2 June 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://james.tmstor.es/ |title=James Official Online Store : Merch, Music, Downloads & Clothing |publisher=James.tmstor.es |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> along with a promo single \"Moving On\". In July 2014, the band headlined on the Castle Stage for Camp Bestival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset and announced a ten date UK tour starting on 10 November, preceded by an 11 October headlining of the entertainment at the [[Rugby league]] [[Super League]] grand final at [[Old Trafford]], performing a set before the game and in the half time show.\n\nThey toured again in 2015, playing some shows without [[Larry Gott]], who was taking a break from touring: [[Adrian Oxaal]] re-joined the band for the duration of the tour, subsequently replacing Gott in the active lineup. Keyboard technician Ron Yeadon, formerly of [[Unkle Bob]], also appeared on stage, singing backing vocals; he later joined the band as a backing vocalist. In 2016, the album ''[[Girl at the End of the World]]'' was released, with an accompanying tour \u2013 building up to the band's planned appearance opening 2016's [[Glastonbury Festival]] (the Other Stage) and later taking a top spot at the On Blackheath festival in September.\n\nIn May 2018, James released a 4-song EP entitled ''Better Than That'' that reached number 1 of the Vinyl Singles Chart<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/vinyl-singles-chart/20180525/897/|title=Official Vinyl Singles Chart Top 40 {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> and embarked on a sold-out UK tour to promote it. During this tour, they also previewed a few songs from their following album, ''Living in Extraordinary Times'', released on 3 August 2018. Percussionist and backing vocalist Deborah Knox-Hewson joined the band during the tour, replacing Ron Yeadon. She left the band shortly after the album's release.\n\n== Members ==\n;Current members\n*[[Jim Glennie]] - bass guitar, backing vocals <small>(1982\u20132001, 2007\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Tim Booth]] -

Their line-up solidified when Gavan Whelan joined on drums. They played a string of gigs under the names Venereal and the Diseases and later, Volume Distortion, before settling on the name of Model Team International, then shortened to Model Team. They performed mostly improvised material derived from [[jam session]]s, supporting [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]] at an early gig at Manchester Polytechnic. Vocalists and other musicians drifted rapidly in and out of their line-up, until the band encountered [[Tim Booth]] at a student disco. Gilbertson invited him to the band's scout hut in [[Withington]] to join the band as a dancer; he was soon promoted to lead singer. After a brief period under the name Tribal Outlook, the band renamed themselves James in August 1982. A gig at [[the Ha\u00e7ienda]] caught the attention of [[Tony Wilson]] of [[Factory Records]]. He offered James an album deal with Factory, but the band, by now a settled live act, were worried about tarnishing their material in the studio and settled instead for a three-track EP. Their debut release, the ''[[Jimone]] EP'', was recorded at [[Strawberry Studios]], [[Stockport]], in August 1983 and released on Factory Records in September.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It led to the band providing the support for [[The Smiths]] between February and April 1985 on the [[Meat is Murder]] tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneofthethree.co.uk/jameshistory.htm |title=James History |publisher=Oneofthethree.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> The Smiths covered James' 'What's The World' track during this tour.\n\nAlthough they were now being touted as the 'next big thing', several complex issues slowed their progress. Gilbertson's drug problems presented the band with no choice but to ask him to leave. Booth and Glennie had joined a sect named Lifewave that imposed many restrictions on their lifestyle and threatened the band's stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicarcades.com/2006/04/james_stutter.html |title=James: Stutter |publisher=Music Arcades |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> The band's second EP, ''[[James II (EP)|James II]]'', was released over a year after the first and accompanied by a feature on the cover of the ''[[NME]]'', Gilbertson having been replaced by the band's guitar tutor [[Larry Gott]]. The first two EPs would later be collected as ''[[Village Fire]]''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Reviews were once again positive, and Factory were eager for James to record an album with it, but the band believed Factory were purely image-based and left the label, striking a deal with [[Sire Records]].\n\nTheir third release, the ''[[Chain Mail (James song)|Sit Down EP]]'' (no relation to the song of that name) came out in February 1986, and was followed by their debut album, ''[[Stutter (album)|Stutter]]'' in July of that year.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album reached number 68 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Low on money and lacking coverage and promotion, the band recorded their second album, ''[[Strip-mine (album)|Strip-mine]]'', attempting a more conventional song structure in an attempt to please Sire. The album almost went unreleased, but after undergoing a slight remix to sound more radio-friendly, Sire released the album in September 1988, over a year after it had been initially completed. However the album only reached number 90.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> After finding a clause for ending their contract, the band left Sire.\n\nJames had by this point earned themselves a reputation as a live act and had built a solid fanbase. Sales of James T-shirts were particularly successful in Manchester even before they reached the [[Top 40]]. James financed the production of a [[live album]] ''[[One Man Clapping]]'' with a bank loan and the help of [[Rough Trade Records]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The album went to number 1 in the indie charts, reinvigorating media interest in the band.\n\n===Line-up changes and success: 1988\u20131992===\nIn November 1988, drummer Whelan became involved in an on-stage fight with Booth<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ovguide.com/gavan-whelan-9202a8c04000641f8000000000ae00b9# |title=Gavan Whelan Music Videos |publisher=Ovguide.com |accessdate=2012-12-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606142019/http://www.ovguide.com/gavan-whelan-9202a8c04000641f8000000000ae00b9 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was asked to leave the band. He was replaced by [[David Baynton-Power]] a few months later. During the following year James greatly expanded their lineup and sound palette by hiring three new members&nbsp;\u2014 guitarist-violinist-percussionist [[Saul Davies]] (who Gott recruited from an amateur blues night), keyboard player Mark Hunter and onetime Diagram Brothers/ Dislocation Dance / The Cotton Singers [[The Pale Fountains|Pale Fountains]] trumpeter/percussionist [[Andy Diagram]] (the latter a noted avant-garde musician).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> This new seven-piece line-up went into the studio to record the third James album.\n\nNew singles \"[[Sit Down (James song)|Sit Down]]\" and \"[[Come Home (James song)|Come Home]]\" became strong hits in the independent charts, and the latter featured on the [[compilation album]] ''[[Happy Daze (Madchester album)|Happy Daze]]''. The album ''Gold Mother'' was intended to be released on Rough Trade but the owner of the label, [[Geoff Travis]], believed James could only reach an audience of 20,000 to 30,000. The band believed they had more potential than this and bought the rights to the album from Rough Trade. A successful winter tour in 1989 attracted a deal with [[Fontana Records]],<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and the band ended a difficult decade on an optimistic note.\n\n''[[Gold Mother]]'' was released in June 1990, just as the '[[Madchester]]' movement, with its wave of popular Manchester-based indie bands, focused public attention on James and won them mainstream recognition.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Singles \"How Was It for You\", the remixed \"[[Come Home (James song)|Come Home]]\" and \"Lose Control\" all made the Top 40, and the band's newfound success was re-affirmed when they played two sell-out dates at the Manchester [[G-Mex]] at the end of the year. In March 1991, when the popularity of \"[[Sit Down (James song)|Sit Down]]\" led to a re-recorded version being released as a single, reaching number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> ''Gold Mother'' was re-released to include \"Sit Down\" and previous single \"Lose Control\", and the album sold ten times more copies than Travis originally predicted. The song became one of the biggest-selling singles of the year.\n\nThe band members spent the rest of the year recording their next album, ''[[Seven (James album)|Seven]]'', which was released in February 1992.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It reached number 2 in the UK Albums Chart (its lead single, \"[[Sound (James song)|Sound]]\", had followed \"Sit Down\" into the top 10 a few months earlier) and earned the band some recognition in the [[United States|US]] as they embarked on their first Stateside tour. The band's activities culminated in a sell-out show to 30,000 people at the [[Alton Towers]] theme park in July, broadcast live on [[BBC Radio 1]], following which Andy Diagram left the group.\n\n===Subsequent releases: 1993\u20132001===\nIn 1993 James were invited on an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] tour of the [[US]] supporting [[Neil Young]] at a series of natural outdoor venues in the autumn. They returned to [[England]] refreshed and ready to record their new album with [[Brian Eno]], whom they had originally approached to produce ''Stutter'' but who had been unavailable at the time. Eno set about bringing out the [[Ambient music|ambience]] in James' music, and took them through a recording process that the band later described as a \"journey of self-discovery\". The process resulted in not one but two albums: the 'song' album, ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'', and the experimental ''[[Wah Wah (James album)|Wah Wah]]'', which showcased the band's improvised jams recorded on the spot, then [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by Eno.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Booth's vocals were then added to the results.\n\n''Laid'' was released in September 1993 to positive reviews. As well as being a success in the UK, the album also broke the band in the US, shipping over 600,000 copies and charting at number 72 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> propelled by the popularity of [[Laid (song)|its risqu\u00e9 title track]] on US [[Campus radio|college radio]]. The band spent most of 1994 touring the States. ''Wah Wah'' was eventually released in September 1994 to a lukewarm reception.\n\nThe recording of the follow-up album faced difficulties from the start. Two key members of the James organisation resigned&nbsp;\u2014 guitarist and key composer Larry Gott (who left the group in order to spend more time with his family) and manager Martine McDonagh (who had had a sometimes fraught romantic relationship with Booth, resulting in a son called Ben). Booth announced that he also wished to take a break in order to record an album with [[Angelo Badalamenti]]. At around the same time, there was the discovery of a \u00a3250,000 tax bill owed by the band.\n\nDetermined to continue despite the setbacks, the band set up studio in Baynton-Power's house. Former [[Sharkboy]] guitarist [[Adrian Oxaal]] was drafted in to replace Gott on guitar,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> while Booth returned periodically from the States to add his vocals. 1996 saw the release of Booth's album with Badalamenti (''[[Booth and the Bad Angel]]''). The new James album, ''[[Whiplash (album)|Whiplash]]'', followed in February 1997. The album proved a successful comeback, reaching the UK top 10 as did the single \"[[She's a Star]]\".<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe band toured to promote the album, recruiting new member [[Michael Kulas]] while in the States, on rhythm guitar. Booth suffered a neck injury while dancing on stage in the US, resulting in a series of tour dates being cancelled as he underwent emergency surgery, and the band being offered a place instead on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour. In March 1998, a greatest hits album, ''[[The Best Of (James album)|The Best Of]]'', was released, compiling all the band's hits since their signing to Fontana. The album reached number 1 in the UK Albums Chart,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and sell-out tours throughout the year followed.\n\nThe band then returned to the studio to begin work on their next album, ''[[Millionaires (album)|Millionaires]]'', which was released in October 1999. The album did not reach the phenomenal sales level predicted, but still entered the UK Album charts at number 2,<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> and sold over 150,000 copies.\n\nAfter the disappointing performance of ''Millionaires'' the band chose to start anew in their approach to their next album, working with Eno once again. They spent most of 2000 recording the album; writing the songs, then performing them live before actually recording them. They embarked on a small-scale tour in the autumn of that year on which their set lists consisted almost entirely of new material. The album, ''[[Pleased to Meet You (James album)|Pleased To Meet You]]'', was released in July 2001. The album's artwork featured a composite image of the faces of all the band members to create a new person. The album reached only number 11, the lowest position for a James studio album since their signing to Fontana.\n\n=== Break-up and other projects: 2002\u20132006 ===\nShortly after their last album release, James reached the end of their contract, and Tim Booth announced he was leaving the band to concentrate on other projects of his own. They played a farewell tour of the UK at the end of the year. Their final hometown gig, at the Manchester Evening News arena on 7 December, was recorded for a live CD and DVD, ''[[Getting Away With It... Live]]''. Past members Larry Gott and Andy Diagram rejoined them for the tour, and [[Brian Eno]] also joined them onstage at London's Wembley Arena during the tour. The albums ''Gold Mother'', ''Laid'', and ''Whiplash'' (each containing bonus tracks) were re-released by Mercury Records the following year, as well as a B-sides compilation entitled ''[[B-Sides Ultra]]''.\n\nA planned compilation of material from the band's Factory and Sire years was announced in 2001, but the album, ''Strange Dancing'', was never released. The first two James albums, ''[[Stutter (album)|Stutter]]'' and ''[[Strip-mine (album)|Strip-mine]]'', were re-pressed in June 2007, but without any additional rarities.\n\nBooth continued as a solo artist in 2004 with the release of his solo album ''Bone'', co-written and produced by [[Lee Muddy Baker]].\n\nA new [[compilation album]], ''[[The Collection (James album)|The Collection]]'' was released in late 2004, and ''Seven&nbsp;\u2013 The Live Concert'' (a DVD version of a previously released video) in 2005.\n\n===Reunion: 2007\u2013present===\nIn January 2007 singer Tim Booth's personal website announced that \"Tim will be rejoining James in early 2007 for a series of live shows to be announced very soon\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timbooth.co.uk/ |title=Tim Booth personal webpage - archived |accessdate=2017-03-01 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113174156/http://www.timbooth.co.uk/ |archivedate=13 January 2008 }}</ref> At the same time, James' old website was replaced by a new domain holder at wearejames.com. The site confirmed the line-up as that which recorded the album ''[[Laid (album)|Laid]]'': Booth, Gott, Glennie, Davies, Hunter and Baynton-Power. Booth confirmed in interviews that he became convinced to rejoin the band after meeting up with Glennie and Gott the previous November for a jamming session, out of which new songs were born.\n\nThe initial five dates of the tour were expanded to seven on the day tickets went on sale (26 January) due to high demand; the whole tour had sold out by close of business. The tour took place during late April 2007, and was followed later in the year by more live shows, including festival appearances at [[T in the Park]] and [[V Festival]]. The band also appeared at [[Summercase]], Barcelona's top music concert in Spain during July 2007. [[Andy Diagram]] also rejoined the band as trumpet player during the festival tour. April saw the release of a new compilation album, ''Fresh as a Daisy&nbsp;\u2014 The Singles'', accompanied by a DVD compilation of all the band's promo videos.\n\nThe new album ''[[Hey Ma (James album)|Hey Ma]]'' was released on 7 April 2008, peaking at number 10 on the UK album charts, and a three-week tour to promote the album commenced on 10 April 2008. An arena tour of the UK called \"We Are Sound\" followed in December, on which two new songs (\"Porcupine\" and \"Look Away\") were previewed as tasters for a new studio album. A live album with a selection of songs recorded during the 2008 spring tour was exclusively sold at the merchandise stalls of the \"We Are Sound\" tour. ''[[Live in 2008]]'' was limited to 5000 copies.\n\nThe band announced plans to release two mini-albums by April 2010. ''[[The Night Before (James album)|The Night Before]]'' was released on 19 April, although its follow-up, ''[[The Morning After (James album)|The Morning After]]'', was released later than expected, on 2 August 2010. Following the release of ''The Night Before'', the band embarked on a UK tour, the Mirrorball Tour, premi\u00e8ring songs from the album. Another UK tour took place in December. Both this tour and the US release of both mini-albums together as a 2-CD set called ''The Morning After The Night Before''. A 19-date North American tour began in September to promote the combined album as well as showcase the songs before the UK tour.\n\nAt the beginning of 2011, Tim Booth announced that he was working on some new solo material, although James remained active, participating in the [[Lollapalooza]] festival in [[Chile]]. The band appeared at The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] on 13 and 20 April in [[Indio, California]] and [[Hard Rock Calling|Hard Rock Calling 2011]] on 24 June in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, where they were joined by [[Kaiser Chiefs]] and headline act [[The Killers]]. Towards the end of 2011, James signalled a departure from their previous touring style, with the announcement of a series of dates in October and November of that year including an orchestra and a choir.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/james/57671 |title=James announce UK tour with choir and orchestra \u2013 ticket details &#124; News |publisher=Nme.com |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref>  This short, ten date tour saw James performing their back catalogue accompanied by the Orchestra of the Swan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orchestraoftheswan.org |title=Orchestra of the Swan |publisher=Orchestra of the Swan |date= |accessdate=2012-12-13}}</ref> and the Manchester Consort Choir.\n\nThey played at [[Kendal Calling]] Festival 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kendalcalling.co.uk/media/?youtubeid=DMnxHtCjoFQ&youtubeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DDMnxHtCjoFQ%26feature%3Dyoutube_gdata|title=James: Sit Down live|website=Kendalcalling.co.uk}}</ref> and toured again in 2013.\n\nJames' first new album in six years ''[[La Petite Mort (James album)|La Petite Mort]]'' was released on 2 June 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://james.tmstor.es/ |title=James Official Online Store : Merch, Music, Downloads & Clothing |publisher=James.tmstor.es |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}</ref> along with a promo single \"Moving On\". In July 2014, the band headlined on the Castle Stage for Camp Bestival at Lulworth Castle in Dorset and announced a ten date UK tour starting on 10 November, preceded by an 11 October headlining of the entertainment at the [[Rugby league]] [[Super League]] grand final at [[Old Trafford]], performing a set before the game and in the half time show.\n\nThey toured again in 2015, playing some shows without [[Larry Gott]], who was taking a break from touring: [[Adrian Oxaal]] re-joined the band for the duration of the tour, subsequently replacing Gott in the active lineup. Keyboard technician Ron Yeadon, formerly of [[Unkle Bob]], also appeared on stage, singing backing vocals; he later joined the band as a backing vocalist. In 2016, the album ''[[Girl at the End of the World]]'' was released, with an accompanying tour \u2013 building up to the band's planned appearance opening 2016's [[Glastonbury Festival]] (the Other Stage) and later taking a top spot at the On Blackheath festival in September.\n\nIn May 2018, James released a 4-song EP entitled ''Better Than That'' that reached number 1 of the Vinyl Singles Chart<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/vinyl-singles-chart/20180525/897/|title=Official Vinyl Singles Chart Top 40 {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref> and embarked on a sold-out UK tour to promote it. During this tour, they also previewed a few songs from their following album, ''Living in Extraordinary Times'', released on 3 August 2018. Percussionist and backing vocalist Deborah Knox-Hewson joined the band during the tour, replacing Ron Yeadon. She left the band shortly after the album's release.\n\n== Members ==\n;Current members\n*[[Jim Glennie]] - bass guitar, backing vocals <small>(1982\u20132001, 2007\u2013present)</small>\n*[[Tim Booth]] -
