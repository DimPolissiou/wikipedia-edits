Other weapons of Vishnu include the [[Sudarshana Chakra]], the [[Narayanastra]], the [[Vaishnavastra]], the [[Kaumodaki]] [[gada (mace)|mace]], [[Nandaka]] sword. In South India, ([[Karnataka]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]]) Sharanga is also called as [[Kodanda]].

Once, [[Brahma]] wanted to know who was a better archer, Vishnu or Shiva. Brahma created a quarrel between the two, which led to a terrible duel. The impact of their fight was such that the balance of the entire universe was disturbed.

During [[Sita]]'s Swayamvar, Lord Rama lifts the Pinaka - the divine bow of Lord [[Shiva]] as per the contest conditions. Lord Rama tried to tie the string of Pinaka and use it but in the process broke it. Sage Parashurama comes to the place once he notices the same. Parashurama challenges Lord Rama to hold Sharanga if he could. Lord Rama lifts it easily. In some versions, it is also said that Parashurama loses his power, obtained as incarnation of Lord [[Vishnu]], to Lord Rama as he hands over Sharanga to Lord Rama. It is also said that Lord Rama appeared as Lord [[Vishnu]] for Parashurama after holding Sharanga. Parashurama immediately blessed Lord Rama and suggested him to use Sharanga as his bow throughout his life. Lord Rama politely obeyed Parashurama's words. Lord Rama fought many battles with this celestial and divine bow only. The fierce Rama-Ravana battle was also fought with Lord Rama having Sharanga. Lord Rama killed many mighty warriors like [[Ravana]], [[Kumbhakarna]] using this Sharanga.

Lord [[Agni]] (God of fire) suffered from a digestive problem because of intake of lot of ghee from the yagnas performed by many people. He approached Lord [[Brahma]] for help. Lord [[Brahma]] told him to burn entire forest of Khandava to clear the problem and satisfy hunger. Soon Lord [[Agni]] came to know that Takshaka, the serpent-king lived in the same forest and was a friend of Indra's. Indra also promised that he would be on Takshaka side to save the forest. Once when roaming in the Khandava Vana, Arjuna and Krishna met Agni. Agni explained the situation and Lord [[Krishna]] promised Agni that he and [[Arjuna]] would be on Agni's side. [[Arjuna]] told Agni that he and Lord [[Krishna]] need some celestial bows and weapons to fight with divine warriors like Lord [[Indra]]. Agni told them that he could present weapons with help of [[Varuna]]. Then [[Arjuna]] obtained celestial bow [[Gandiva]] and Akshaya tunira. And Lord [[Krishna]] got [[Sudarshana Chakra]] and Sharanga during the ''Khandava-dahana''. In this war Lord [[Krishna]] fought with rest of the gods and [[Arjuna]] fought with Lord [[Indra]]. Lord [[Krishna]] and [[Arjuna]] won the war. From that moment Lord [[Krishna]] used this Sharanga as his bow. In Krishna-Arjuna war also Lord [[Krishna]] used Sharanga. That's the reason why neither Lord [[Krishna]] nor [[Arjuna]] gained the upper hand in the war. Just before his ascension, Lord [[Krishna]] returned it to [[Varuna]] by throwing it back into the ocean, [[Varuna]]'s domain.<ref>https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/3658/how-did-krishna-get-vishnus-sharanga-bow.</ref> \nSharanga also appears during a duel between Lord Krishna, the eighth incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and [[Shalva demon|Shalva]], the demon of mystical powers.

[[Vietnam]] is a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].\n\nSince the mid-1980s, through the [[Doi Moi]] reform period Vietnam has made a shift from a [[Centralization|highly centralized]] [[command economy]] to a [[mixed economy]] that uses both directive and [[indicative planning]] through [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam|five-year plans]] with support from an open [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy.

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study].

In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nRegarding the above, please note, \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeated oCambodia'snruling g Khmer Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] Subsequently, in a petty display, after having lost twice to Vietnam:\n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

de Vietnam, Ciudad Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, 2013-08-14, DD 01.JPG|thumb|National Bank of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City]]\n\n===Agriculture, fishery and forestry===\nIn 2003, Vietnam produced an estimated 30.7 million cubic meters of wood. Production of sawn wood was a more modest 2,950 cubic meters. In 1992, in response to [[deforestation in Vietnam|dwindling forests]], Vietnam imposed a ban on the export of logs and raw timber. In 1997, the ban was extended to all timber products except wooden artifacts. During the 1990s, Vietnam began to reclaim land for forests with a tree-planting program.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam's [[fishing]] industry, which has abundant resources given the country's long coastline and [[rivers in Vietnam|extensive network of rivers and lakes]], has generally experienced moderate growth. In 2003, the total catch was about 2.6 million tons. However, seafood exports increased fourfold between 1990 and 2002 to more than US$2 billion, driven in part by [[shrimp]] farms in the South and \"catfish\", which are a different species from their American counterparts, but are marketed in the United States under the same name. By selling vast quantities of shrimp and catfish to the U.S., Vietnam triggered [[antidumping]] complaints by the U.S., which imposed tariffs in the case of catfish and was considering doing the same for shrimp. In 2005, the seafood industry began to focus on domestic demand to compensate for declining exports.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam is one of the top rice exporting countries in the world, but the limited sophistication of small-scale Vietnamese farmers causes quality to suffer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/why-cant-vietnam-grow-better-rice/ |title=Why Can't Vietnam Grow Better Rice? |last1=Rosen |first1=Elisabeth |date=24 April 2014 |website=thediplomat.com |publisher=The Diplomat |accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref> Vietnam is also the world's second largest exporter of coffee, trailing behind Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstopexports.com/coffee-exports-country/|title=World's Top Exports - Coffee Exports by Country|work=World's Top Exports|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Energy, mining and minerals===\n{{Main|Energy in Vietnam}}\n\n[[Petroleum]] is the main source of energy, followed by [[coal]], which contributes about 25% of the country's energy (excluding [[biomass]]). Vietnam's oil reserves are in the range of 270\u2013500 million tons. Oil production rose rapidly to {{convert|403300|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} in 2004, but output is believed to have peaked and is expected to decline gradually.\n\nIn 2003, mining and quarrying accounted for 9.4% of GDP, and the sector employed 0.7% of the workforce. Petroleum and coal are the main mineral exports. Also mined are [[antimony]], [[bauxite]], [[chromium]], [[gold]], [[iron]], natural [[phosphates]], [[tin]], and [[zinc]].<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nCrude oil was Vietnam's leading export until the late 2000s, when high-tech electrical manufactures emerged to become the biggest export market (by 2014, crude oil comprised only 5% of Vietnamese exports, compared to 20% of all exports in 1996). This is in part because Vietnam crude oil peaked in 2004, when crude oil represented 22% of all export earnings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore/tree_map/export/vnm/all/show/1996/?prod_class=hs4&details_treemap=2&disable_widgets=false&disable_search=false&node_size=none&queryActivated=true&highlight=&yaxis=complexity|title=What did Viet Nam export in 1996? - The Atlas Of Economic Complexity|accessdate=23 July 2016}}</ref> Petroleum exports are in the form of crude petroleum because Vietnam has a very limited refining capacity.

Coal production was almost 19 million tons in 2003, compared with 9.6 million tons in 1999. Vietnam's potential [[natural gas]] reserves are 1.3 trillion cubic meters. In 2002, Vietnam brought ashore 2.26 billion cubic meters of natural gas. [[Hydroelectric]] power is another source of energy. In 2004, Vietnam confirmed plans to build a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 1 Nuclear Power Plant|nuclear power plant]]  with [[Rosatom|Russian assistance]],<ref name=\"cp\"/> and a [[Ninh Thu\u1eadn 2 Nuclear Power Plant|second]] by a Japanese group.\n\n===Industry and manufacturing===\n{{Main|Manufacturing in Vietnam}}\n\nAlthough the industrial sector contributed 40.1% of GDP in 2004, it employed only 12.9% of the workforce. In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms.

Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam.

Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs.

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year.

The economy saw continuous real GDP growth of at least 5% since 2000.\n\nThe signing of the [[Bilateral Trade Agreement]] (BTA) between the United States and Vietnam on July 13, 2000, was a significant milestone. The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

However, the WTO accession also brought serious challenges, requiring the economy to open up to increasing foreign competition.\n\nVietnam's economy continues to expand at an annual rate in excess of 7%, one of the fastest-growing in the world, but it grew from an extremely low base, as it suffered the crippling effect of the [[Vietnam War]] from the 1950s to the 1970s, as well as the austerity measures introduced in its aftermath.<ref name=\"cp\"/> In 2012, the communist party was forced to apologise about the mismanagement of the economy after large numbers of SOEs went bankrupt and inflation rose.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs.

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced, [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], \"Mama\" [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]],<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture]] in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars. Carr also first hired comedian [[Bruce Vilanch]] as head comedy writer of the show, a job Vilanch still held as of 2015 (Vilanch was redeemed the following year since his old friend Billy Crystal hosted for his first of many times: with Vilanch as his head writer).\n\n==Later work==\nThat same year Carr helmed the project ''Goya...A Life in Song'' with Freddie Gershon and CBS Records, a concept album and, later, an off-Broadway musical theater production written by [[Maury Yeston]] (''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]'') and featuring [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]] as artist [[Francisco Goya]].

He attended [[Lake Forest College]] and [[Northwestern University]], but his interest was always in show business. While at Northwestern, he invested $750 in the Broadway musical ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' starring [[Tallulah Bankhead]]. Though the show was not a hit, he had also invested $1,250 in 1967's ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]],'' which gave him the success he needed to leave school and embark upon a career in entertainment.\n\nIn Chicago in the 1960s, he opened the Civic Theater and financed ''[[The World of Carl Sandburg]]'' starring [[Bette Davis]] and [[Gary Merrill]], as well as [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]],'' directed by Sir [[Tyrone Guthrie]], and [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''Garden District'', featuring [[Cathleen Nesbitt]] and [[Diana Barrymore]]. Carr worked behind the scenes at ''[[Playboy]]'' with [[Hugh Hefner]] and was a co-creator of the ''Playboy Penthouse'' television series, which in turn launched the [[Playboy Club]]s.\n\nThrough the years, he became known as a great planner of promotional events and parties. One such event, a black-tie affair for [[Truman Capote]], took place in an abandoned Los Angeles jail.<ref name=Y>{{cite web|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/allan-carr-rise-fall-hollywood-hedonist-014130665.html|title=Allan Carr: The rise and fall of a Hollywood hedonist|author=Taggart, Frankie|date=May 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Management career==\nIn 1966, Carr founded the talent agency Allan Carr Enterprises, managing the actors [[Tony Curtis]], [[Peter Sellers]],<ref name=Y/> [[Rosalind Russell]], [[Dyan Cannon]], [[Melina Mercouri]], and [[Marlo Thomas]].  Some of the other entertainment figures whose careers he managed were [[Ann-Margret]], a string of whose television specials he also produced, [[Nancy Walker]], [[Marvin Hamlisch]], [[Joan Rivers]], [[Peggy Lee]], \"Mama\" [[Cass Elliot]],<ref name=Y/> [[Paul Anka]], [[Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons]], [[George Maharis]], and [[Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass]].\n\nCarr is also credited for having discovered numerous celebrities, including some such, who also became his clients, as [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Mark Hamill]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/96824/Allan-Carr Allan Carr \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Steve Guttenberg]],<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/01/arts/allan-carr-62-the-producer-of-grease-and-la-cage.html|work=The New York Times|title=Allan Carr, 62, the Producer Of 'Grease' and 'La Cage'|date=July 1, 1999|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and [[Lisa Hartman]].<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==''Grease'' and Broadway success==\nProducer [[Robert Stigwood]] hired him in 1975 as marketing and promotion consultant, with his first project being for the [[Tommy (1975 film)|film version]] of the [[rock opera]] ''[[The Who's Tommy|Tommy]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The film was a hit and he expanded his involvement for his next film, re-editing and overdubbing a low-budget foreign film about a real-life disaster. The result was ''Survive!'' (The disaster in question was also described in Piers Paul Read's book ''Alive.'') The surprise box office success of ''Survive!'' in 1976 made Carr a wealthy man and gave him clout at [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\nIn 1977, Stigwood asked him to produce the ad campaign for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]],'' and he turned the film's premiere into a star-studded television special. It worked so well that Stigwood gave him ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' (1978). Carr not only helmed the ad campaign and produced the premiere party and television special for ''Grease,'' but also wrote the screenplay and co-produced the film for six million dollars, casting his then client [[Olivia Newton-John]].<ref name=Y/> It became the highest-grossing film of the year, and one of the highest-grossing films up until that time, at just under $100 million. The film was nominated for five [[Golden Globe Awards]] and won two [[People's Choice Awards]], for Best Picture and Best Musical Picture. That year he even appeared in a role on the final season of the [[Angie Dickinson]] television series ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]''. Stigwood and Carr would work on several other films, including 1978 [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winner ''[[The Deer Hunter]]''.\n\nThe following year, 1979, he produced the [[Village People]] film musical ''[[Can't Stop the Music|Can't Stop The Music]],''<ref name=Y/> a production which, while campy, steered clear of addressing the band members' presumed homosexuality in the script. Again he orchestrated a lavish series of premieres and a television special that co-starred his friends Hefner and [[Cher]]. But the film was released in 1980, after the crash of the disco craze, and as a result, it was a major flop.<ref name=Y/> Because of this, Carr \"won\" the first annual [[Golden Raspberry Award]] for Worst Film, in 1981. Undaunted, he went on to produce ''[[Grease 2]]'' (1982) which, while nowhere near the hit of its predecessor, was not the financial loss that ''Can't Stop The Music'' had been.\n\nWhen Carr was in Paris for the premiere of ''Grease,'' a friend took him to see a play about a gay couple, ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]].'' By this time in his career, Carr was ready to face the gay theme head on. Returning to Broadway he produced a musical version of the 1973 play,<ref name=Y/> which had since been made into a French film, and would later be remade as an American film called ''[[The Birdcage]].'' With a book by [[Harvey Fierstein]] and music and lyrics by [[Jerry Herman]], the show opened in 1983 and was a huge success, running for five years and 1,761 performances.  Nominated in 1984 for eight [[Drama Desk Award]]s and eight [[Tony Award]]s, the show won three Drama Desks and an impressive six Tonys, including a \"Best Musical\" win for Carr.\n\n==Snow White and the Academy Awards==\nCarr's reputation for hosting expensive and lavish parties and creating spectacular production numbers led [[AMPAS]]  to hire him to produce the [[61st Academy Awards]] and create the show based on his promise that he would turn it around from the dry, dull show it had been in previous years. It was inspired by ''[[Beach Blanket Babylon]]'', the musical revue show featuring [[Snow White]] at Hollywood after the dwarves during the [[Golden Age of Hollywood]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AyU_EbgFlc Bruce Vilanch on \"The 1989 Oscars\" with Rob Lowe and Snow White - FoundationINTERVIEWS on YouTube]</ref> Promising \"the antithesis of tacky,\" and despite the best Nielson ratings in five years, it proved to be a career disaster for Allan, culminating in the infamous pairing of Snow White (played by Eileen Bowman) and [[Rob Lowe]] singing a parody of \"[[Proud Mary]].\"<ref name=Y/> Before that, when Snow White first entered the theater from the rear, she seemed to surprise and even put-off the movie stars she was singing to, using a high-pitched imitation (bordering on parody) of the Disney cartoon. During the main number, before Rob Lowe's entrance, a crooning Merv Griffin introduced a procession of once famous Hollywood stars ranging from Alice Faye to Roy Rogers and Dale Evans to Vincent Price, which seemed more forced than natural as the elders were practically guided across the stage by male dancers (some dressed as chairs and tables). Also, there was no host that year. Instead, actors and actresses traded off, ranging from Tom Selleck (who opened) to Bob Hope and Lucille Ball (the latter died three weeks later). His no host theme was centered on \"compadres, costars, couples and companions,\" and his no host theme wouldn't be repeated until the Oscars of 2019.\n\nThe telecast also included a production number featuring what was introduced as \"The Stars of Tomorrow\" doing a number entitled \"I Wanna Be An Oscar Winner\" with all the participants being actors and actresses ranging from the age group of late teens to mid-20s (including Corey Feldman doing a Michael Jackson impression; Christian Slater sword fighting with Tyrone Power Jr.; Chad Lowe shouting \"I am a Thespian\"; Tracy Nelson ballet dancing; Patrick Dempsey tap dancing along the central set stairwell).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAQ9Taunh7w The Stars of Tomorrow: 1989 Oscars]</ref> Due largely to the show's opening number, and despite the shows stellar Nielson ratings, the show became a laughing-stock and went down in history as one of the worst moments in awards show and television history.  [[The Walt Disney Company]] sued for allegedly illegal use of Snow White's image.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/looking-back-oscars-biggest-goof-21211 Looking back at Oscar's biggest goof|Hollywood Reporter]</ref> Meanwhile, Gregory Peck (a personal friend of Carr's) and a number of actors wrote and signed a letter of protest, demanding there never be a show like that again; Peck, in fact, threatened to return his past Oscar if it was ever repeated, which it wasn't. \n\nCarr's reputation in Hollywood never fully recovered from this setback, although his decision to change the award announcement from \"And the winner is...\" to \"And the Oscar goes to...\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT7g5pWzOyw Why the 1989 Oscars Are the Worst Ever - Metaflix on YouTube]</ref> became the norm for awards shows in general, not just for the Oscars.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella. Hugo became a Cardinal.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 58.</ref> In 1109 he was Archdeacon of Compostella, but at the time of his election to the diocese of Porto and not yet ordained. He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D. [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]] jurisdiction over the City of Porto with all the rents and dues thereof.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 64, 299.</ref> Bishop Hugo was present at the Council of Compostella in 1114, the Council of Sagunto in 1121 (under the presidency of Cardinal Boso, the papal Legate), and the Synod of Compostella in 1122.<ref>Thomas (da Cunha) ''Historia ecclesiae Lusitaniae'' III, p. 30.</ref>\n\nJohn Peculiar was promoted to [[Braga]] (1138), his nephew, Pedro Rabaldis, succeeding at Porto. Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter and was promoted to Braga in 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarreled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; and Vasco. Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda|Francis Borgia]] and the [[Jesuits]] established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671; and Fernando Correia de Lacerda in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints, and founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto. A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests; a reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel, got himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple and provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death (1911) Bishop Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Oporto|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

He had been a Canon of the Cathedral of Compostella, and under the patronage of Bishop [[Diego Gelmirez]], a Cluniac, he was said to have been a co-author of the ''[[Historia Compostellana]]''.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 57, 68.</ref> In 1103-1104 he was sent to Rome on an embassy for the Church of Compostella, and obtained a bull granting numerous privileges, one of which was the right of the Bishop of Compostella to name Cardinals of Compostella.

He was ordained a priest on the day before Passion Sunday, and was consecrated a bishop on 23 March 1113 by Archbishop [[Antipope Gregory VIII|Mauricio Burdino]] of Braga, another Cluniac.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, p. 59.</ref> As Bishop of Porto he secured from [[Pope Paschal II]], by a bull granted on 15 August 1115, exemption of his diocese from the supervisory control of the Archbishop of Braga.<ref>Flor\u00e9z, pp. 297-299. Burdinus became an antipope of the Emperor V in Rome on 8 March 1118.</ref> He greatly enlarged his diocese and the cathedral patrimony increased by the donations he secured; thus, in 1120, he received from D.

Next came D. [[Pedro Pit\u00f5es]] (1145 to 1152 or 1155), D. Pedro S\u00e9nior (d. 1172), and D. Fern\u00e3o Martins (d. 1185). Martinho Pires instituted a chapter and was promoted to Braga in 1189 or 1190. Martinho Rodrigues ruled from 1191 to 1235. He quarreled with the chapter over their share of the rents of the see. Later on, fresh disagreements arose in which King [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] intervened against the bishop, who was deprived of his goods and had to flee, but was restored by the king when Innocent III espoused the bishop's cause. Another quarrel soon arouse between prelate and king, and the bishop was imprisoned; but he escaped and fled to Rome, and in 1209 the king, feeling the approach of death, made peace with him. His successor, Pedro Salvadores, figured prominently in the questions between the clergy and King [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]], who refused to ecclesiastics the right of purchasing or inheriting land. Portugal fell into anarchy, in which the clergy's rights were violated and their persons outraged, though they themselves were not guiltless. Finally, Pope Innocent IV committed the reform of abuses to [[Afonso III of Portugal|Afonso III]], brother of [[Sancho II of Portugal|Sancho II]] who lost his crown.\n\nUnder Bishop Julian (1247\u201360) the jurisdiction difficulty became aggravated. A settlement was effected at the Cortes of [[Leiria]] (1254), which the bishop refused to ratify, but he had to give way. When King Afonso III determined (1265) that all rights and properties usurped during the disorders of Sancho's reign should revert to the Crown, nearly all the bishops, including the Bishop of Porto, then D. Vicente, protested; and seven went to Rome for relief, leaving Portugal under an interdict. When the king was dying, in 1278, he promised restitution. Vicente (d. 1296) was one of the negotiators of the [[Concordat of Forty Articles|Concordat of 1289]] and the supplementary Accord of Eleven Articles. He was succeeded by Sancho Pires, who ruled until 1300. Geraldo Domingues resigned in 1308 to act as counsellor of the King's daughter Constan\u00e7a, future Queen of Castile. Tredulo was bishop for two and a half years. The Minorite Frei Est\u00eav\u00e3o was succeeded in 1313 by his nephew Fernando Ramires. Both uncle and nephew quarrelled with King Denis and left the realm.\n\nOwing to the hostility of the citizens, Bishop Gomes lived mostly outside his diocese. When Pedro Afonso became bishop in 1343, he had a quarrel over jurisdiction and, like his predecessor, departed, leaving the diocese under interdict. Six years later he returned, but again the monarch began to encroach, and it was not until 1354 that the bishop secured recognition of his rights. His successor was Afonso Pires. Eg\u00eddio is probably the bishop represented in the old Chronicles as being threatened with scourging by King Pedro for having lived in sin with a citizen's wife The accusation was probably groundless, but Eg\u00eddio left the city, which for twelve years had no bishop.\n\nOther bishops were: John de Zambuja, or Est\u00eav\u00e3o; and Gil, who in 1406 sold the episcopal rights over Oporto to the Crown for an annual money payment, reduced in the reign of D. Manuel to 120 silver marks; Fernando Guerra, who in 1425 was created Archbishop of Braga; and Vasco. Ant\u00e3o Martins de Chaves, who succeeded Vasco in 1430, was sent by the pope to Constantinople to induce the Greek emperor to attend the Council of Basle. He succeeded, and as a reward was made cardinal. He died in 1447. Succeeding incumbents were: Durando; Gon\u00e7alves de \u00d3bidos; Luis Pires (1454\u201364), a negotiator of the Concordat of 1455 and a reforming prelate; Jo\u00e3o de Azevedo (1465\u20131494), a benefactor of the cathedral and chapter, as was his successor Diego de Sousa, afterwards Archbishop of Braga and executor of King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]]. The see was then held by two brothers in succession, Diogo da Costa (1505-7) and D. Pedro da Costa (1511\u201339), who restored the bishop's palace and enriched the capitular revenues from his own purse; Belchior Beliago; and the Carmelite Frei Baltazar Limpo (1538\u201352), the fiftieth bishop. He held a diocesan synod in 1540.\n\nIn the time of Rodrigo Pinheiro, a learned humanist, Porto was visited by St. [[Francis Borgia, 4th Duke of Gand\u00eda|Francis Borgia]] and the [[Jesuits]] established themselves in the city. Aires da Silva, ex-rector of Coimbra University, after ruling four years, fell in the [[battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir]] in 1578 with King [[Sebastian of Portugal|Sebasti\u00e3o]]. Sim\u00e3o Pereira was followed by the Franciscan Frei Marcos de Lisboa, chronicler of his order. He added to the cathedral and convoked a diocesan synod in 1585. In 1591 another ex-rector of Coimbra, Jer\u00f3nimo de Menezes, became bishop; he was succeeded by the Benedictine Frei Gon\u00e7alo de Morais, a zealous defender of the rights of the Church. He built a new sacristy and chancel in the cathedral. In 1618 Bishop Rodrigo da Cunha, author of the history of the Bishops of Oporto, was appointed. His \"Catalogo\" describes the state of the cathedral and enumerates the parishes of the diocese with their population and income in 1623 and is the earliest account we possess. His successor was Frei Jo\u00e3o de Valadares, transferred from the See of Miranda. Gaspar do Rego da Fonseca held the see four years (1635\u201339). King [[Philip III of Portugal|Philip III]] named Francisco Pereira Pinto, but the revolution in 1640 prevented his taking possession; moreover he never received his bulls of consecration and installation from [[Pope Urban VIII]], and therefore he could not be consecrated or installed as bishop.<ref>Gauchat, IV, p. 286, note 7.</ref> The diocese was considered vacant until 1670, being ruled by administrators appointed by the Chapter of the Cathedral (Vicars capitular). In 1641 King [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] chose D. Sebasti\u00e3o C\u00e9sar de Menezes as bishop, but the pope, influenced by Spain, would neither recognize the new King of Portugal nor confirm his nominations. Next came Frei Pedro de Menezes; Nicolau Monteiro took possession in 1671; and Fernando Correia de Lacerda in 1673, who was succeeded by Jo\u00e3o de Sousa. Frei Jos\u00e9 Saldanha (1697\u20131708), famed for his austerity, never relinquished his Franciscan habit, a contrast to his successor Tom\u00e1s de Almeida, who in 1716 became the first Patriarch of Lisbon. The see remained vacant until 1739, and, though Frei John Maria was then elected, he never obtained confirmation. In the same year Frei Jos\u00e9 Maria da Fonseca, formerly Commissary General of the Franciscans, became bishop. Several European States selected him as arbiter of their differences. He contributed to the canonization of a number of saints, and founded and restored many convents and hospitals.\n\nNext in order were: Frei Ant\u00f3nio de T\u00e1vora (d. 1766), Frei Aleixo de Miranda Henriques, Frei Jo\u00e3o Rafael de Mendon\u00e7a (1771-3), and Louren\u00e7o Correia de S\u00e1 Benevides (1796-8). Frei Antonio de Castro became Patriarch of Lisbon in 1814, being followed at Porto by Jo\u00e3o Avelar. Frei Manuel de Santa In\u00eas, though elected, never obtained confirmation, but some years after his death, relations between Portugal and the Holy See were re-established by a concordat and Jer\u00f3nimo da Costa Rebelo became bishop in 1843. From 1854 to 1859 the see was held by Ant\u00f3nio da Fonseca Moniz; on his death it remained vacant until 1862, when Jo\u00e3o de Castro e Moura, who had been a missionary in China, was appointed (d.1868). The see was again vacant until the confirmation of Am\u00e9rico Ferreira dos Santos Silva in 1871. This prelate was obliged to combat the growing Liberalism of his flock and the Protestant propaganda in Porto. A popular lawyer named Mesquita started a campaign against him, because the bishop refused to dismiss some priests; a reputed reactionary, who served the Aguardente Chapel, got himself elected judge of the Brotherhood of the Temple and provoked a great platform agitation with the result that the chapel was secularized and became a school under the patronage of the Marquis of Pombal Association. In 1879 Am\u00e9rico was created cardinal and on his death (1911) Bishop Ant\u00f3nio Barroso, an ex-missionary, was transferred from the [[see of Mylapore]] to that of Porto.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11260a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' article]</ref>\n\n===Cathedral===\nThe [[Cathedral of Porto|Porto Cathedral]] was dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into Heaven.

She was a female high school student who died by suicide, leaving behind recorded tapes that implicated twelve people, one of them appearing twice, as the thirteen reasons why.\n*'''[[Clay Jensen]]''' is the narrator of the novel. He is a shy high school student through whom Hannah's tapes are revealed in the novel. He is the subject of the ninth tape, on which Hannah clarifies that he was always kind to her and that he does not deserve to be on her list. Clay is the only person on the tapes who is not directly blamed as a reason for Hannah's death.\n*'''Justin Foley''' is the subject of the first and tenth tapes. A year older than Hannah, he was her first crush and first kiss. Hannah blames Justin on the first tape for starting rumors that she is a slut, and she blames him on the tenth tape for allowing Bryce to rape Jessica.\n*'''Alex Standall''' is the subject of the second tape. After breaking up with Jessica, he published a \"hot or not\" list, giving Hannah the title \"Best Ass in the Freshman Class.\" Hannah believes this further reinforced her [[Slut-shaming|reputation of a slut]] started after her kiss with Justin.\n*'''Jessica Davis''' is the subject of the third tape and a friend of Hannah's before Alex's \"hot or not\" list ended their friendship. Hannah blames Jessica for believing the rumors about her and telling people that Hannah stole Alex from Jessica. Jessica is later involved with Justin and raped by Bryce at a party.\n*'''Tyler Down''' is the subject of the fourth tape. A classmate of Hannah's who worked as a photographer for the yearbook, Tyler allegedly stalked Hannah and took pictures of her through her bedroom window. Feeling unsafe, Hannah enlisted Courtney's help in catching the perpetrator, whom Hannah determined was Tyler based on his nervous reaction at school.\n*'''Courtney Crimsen''' is the subject of the fifth tape and an acquaintance of Hannah's. Hannah describes Courtney as fake, despite being known at school as friendly. After helping Hannah catch Tyler, Courtney spreads rumors about finding sexual \"toys\" in Hannah's bedroom, further smearing Hannah's reputation and making her feel more alone. Courtney later accompanies Hannah to a party but leaves her after arriving.\n*'''Marcus Cooley''', the subject of the sixth tape, once went on a date with Hannah after matching with her through a Valentine's fundraiser. At a diner, Marcus tries to take advantage of her and calls her a \"tease\" when she rejects him. Following Hannah's death, Marcus takes part in throwing rocks at Tyler's window for stalking Hannah, but refuses to take responsibility for Hannah's accusations about himself.\n*'''Zach Dempsey''' is the subject of the seventh tape. After trying to comfort Hannah following her confrontation with Marcus, he turns on Hannah when she rejects him. In a shared class, Zach takes Hannah's \"notes of encouragement\" so that she no longer receives the anonymous support the class previously gave her.\n*'''Ryan Shaver''' is the subject of the eighth tape; he was briefly friends with Hannah when the two attended an out-of-school poetry class. After gaining her trust, Ryan steals and anonymously publishes one of Hannah's poems in the school newspaper. Despite the anonymous submission, Hannah is humiliated when her poem receives criticism.\n*'''Jenny Kurtz''' is the subject of the eleventh tape and a cheerleader who offers to take Hannah home from her first party. She comforts Hannah, but after she hits a stop sign and fails to tell the police, Hannah blames her for causing a later car accident that kills another classmate.\n*'''Bryce Walker''' is the subject of the twelfth tape and a frequent bully throughout the novel. At the first party Hannah attends, Bryce rapes an unconscious Jessica. Later, he invites Hannah into a hot tub at another party and rapes her. Hannah resists but it was futile, so she lets herself go in despair.\n*'''Mr. Porter''' is the subject of the thirteenth tape and the final person slotted to receive Hannah's reasons. He is the school counselor who fails to help Hannah when she admits to him that she is suicidal.\n*'''Tony''' is a good-natured high school student who, though he is not on any of the tapes, receives copies of them just before Hannah's death. Though he tries to warn Hannah's parents, she kills herself, leaving Tony to watch over the people who are named as reasons for her death. He particularly looks out for Clay as he struggles through the tapes.\n*'''Skye Miller''' is a female high school student and former friend of Clay's who is not named on any of the tapes. Clay suspects she is suicidal and reaches out to her at the end of the novel.\n\n== Plot ==\nHigh school student Clay Jensen receives a mysterious package in the mail with seven cassette tapes recorded by Hannah Baker, a classmate who recently died by suicide. The tapes had also been sent to several other of her classmates, instructing each of them to visit each person mentioned.<ref name=\"Goodreads\">{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29844228-thirteen-reasons-why|title=Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher|author=<!--Staff Writer-->|year=2007|work=Goodreads|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820073354/https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29844228-thirteen-reasons-why|archive-date=20 August 2017|access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref> As he listens to the tapes, he learns that there is a side for each person to whom Hannah attributes her reasons for killing herself.\n\n*Justin Foley started a rumor at school that Hannah was a \"slut\" after they kissed once in the park\n*Alex Standall reinforced the rumor by awarding Hannah \"Best Ass\" on a \"hot or not\" list\n*Alex's ex-girlfriend Jessica Davis, who had once been Hannah's friend, spread rumors that Hannah was the reason she and Alex broke up\n*Marcus Cooley tried to take advantage of Hannah during a date\n*Tyler Down [[stalking|stalked]] her and took photographs of her while spying in her window\n*Courtney Crimson spread stories about sexual \"toys\" she \"found\" in Hannah's room and later ditched her at a party. \n*Zach Dempsey made unwanted advances toward her.

Hannah hid in a closet and witnessed someone raping her. Hannah says on the tape that Justin knew about this and let it happen. She also says that it's 'our fault' implying that she also blames herself for letting it happen. The next person listed is Bryce Walker, who is revealed to be Jessica's rapist. Hannah was walking past a party at Courtney's. Courtney, Bryce and some of the others were in the hot tub in just their underwear. Everyone left Hannah in the hot tub by herself and then Bryce got in and started to touch Hannah. Hannah tried to resist him but he forced himself on her and raped her. The last tape is for Mr. Porter, a temporary school counselor who told Hannah that if she was unwilling to press charges against \"the boy\" who raped her, she should \"try to move on\", even after Hannah expressed a desire to kill herself.\n\nAfter sending the tapes to the next person on the list, Clay returns to school and runs into his classmate Skye Miller, whom he suspects is also suicidal. The novel ends with Clay reaching out to her.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/summary.html |title=Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher |author=<!--Staff Writers--> |website=Shmoop |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727023547/https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/summary.html |archive-date=27 July 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thirteen-reasons-why/study-guide/summary |title=Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher |author=<!--Staff Writers--> |work=GradeSaver |publisher=Grade Saver LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210162043/http://www.gradesaver.com/thirteen-reasons-why/study-guide/summary |archive-date=10 December 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Differences with the TV series===\n\n* In the book, Clay listens to all of Hannah's tapes in one night; in the TV series, he listens to them over the course of several days.<ref name=\"vulture.com\">{{cite web|first=Madeleine|last=Buckley|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/thirteen-reasons-why-book-vs-the-show.html|title=All the Ways Netflix's 13 Reasons Why Is Different From the Book|website=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* The character in the book who was Marcus Cooley<ref name=bookchar>{{cite web |url=https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/characters.html |title=Thirteen Reasons Why Characters |website=[[Shmoop]] |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206154349/https://ww.com/thirteen-reasons-why/characters.html |archive-date=6 December 2016 |access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref> became Marcus Cole in the TV series.\n\n* The character in the book who was named Jenny Kurtz<ref name=bookchar /> became Sheri Holland in the TV series.\n\n* Mr. Porter's first name is not listed in the book,<ref name=bookchar /> but he is named as Kevin in the TV series.\n\n* The second character to be named on the tapes in the book was Alex Standall;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Jessica Davis.\n\n* The ninth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Clay Jensen;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Justin Foley.\n\n* The tenth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Justin Foley;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Sheri Holland.\n\n* The eleventh character to be named on the tapes in the book was Jenny Kurtz;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Clay Jensen.\n\n* Neither Tony or Ryan are identified as [[gay]] in the book, and their sexualities are not explored as part of the plot.<ref name=\"vulture.com\"/>\n\n* In the book, it is revealed that Hannah kills herself via swallowing a handful of pills.

She was a female high school student who died by suicide, leaving behind recorded tapes that implicated twelve people, one of them appearing twice, as the thirteen reasons why.\n*'''[[Clay Jensen]]''' is the narrator of the novel. He is a shy high school student through whom Hannah's tapes are revealed in the novel. He is the subject of the ninth tape, on which Hannah clarifies that he was always kind to her and that he does not deserve to be on her list. Clay is the only person on the tapes who is not directly blamed as a reason for Hannah's death.\n*'''Justin Foley''' is the subject of the first and tenth tapes. A year older than Hannah, he was her first crush and first kiss. Hannah blames Justin on the first tape for starting rumors that she is a slut, and she blames him on the tenth tape for allowing Bryce to rape Jessica.\n*'''Alex Standall''' is the subject of the second tape. After breaking up with Jessica, he published a \"hot or not\" list, giving Hannah the title \"Best Ass in the Freshman Class.\" Hannah believes this further reinforced her [[Slut-shaming|reputation of a slut]] started after her kiss with Justin.\n*'''Jessica Davis''' is the subject of the third tape and a friend of Hannah's before Alex's \"hot or not\" list ended their friendship. Hannah blames Jessica for believing the rumors about her and telling people that Hannah stole Alex from Jessica. Jessica is later involved with Justin and raped by Bryce at a party.\n*'''Tyler Down''' is the subject of the fourth tape. A classmate of Hannah's who worked as a photographer for the yearbook, Tyler allegedly stalked Hannah and took pictures of her through her bedroom window. Feeling unsafe, Hannah enlisted Courtney's help in catching the perpetrator, whom Hannah determined was Tyler based on his nervous reaction at school.\n*'''Courtney Crimsen''' is the subject of the fifth tape and an acquaintance of Hannah's. Hannah describes Courtney as fake, despite being known at school as friendly. After helping Hannah catch Tyler, Courtney spreads rumors about finding sexual \"toys\" in Hannah's bedroom, further smearing Hannah's reputation and making her feel more alone. Courtney later accompanies Hannah to a party but leaves her after arriving.\n*'''Marcus Cooley''', the subject of the sixth tape, once went on a date with Hannah after matching with her through a Valentine's fundraiser. At a diner, Marcus tries to take advantage of her and calls her a \"tease\" when she rejects him. Following Hannah's death, Marcus takes part in throwing rocks at Tyler's window for stalking Hannah, but refuses to take responsibility for Hannah's accusations about himself.\n*'''Zach Dempsey''' is the subject of the seventh tape. After trying to comfort Hannah following her confrontation with Marcus, he turns on Hannah when she rejects him. In a shared class, Zach takes Hannah's \"notes of encouragement\" so that she no longer receives the anonymous support the class previously gave her.\n*'''Ryan Shaver''' is the subject of the eighth tape; he was briefly friends with Hannah when the two attended an out-of-school poetry class. After gaining her trust, Ryan steals and anonymously publishes one of Hannah's poems in the school newspaper. Despite the anonymous submission, Hannah is humiliated when her poem receives criticism.\n*'''Jenny Kurtz''' is the subject of the eleventh tape and a cheerleader who offers to take Hannah home from her first party. She comforts Hannah, but after she hits a stop sign and fails to tell the police, Hannah blames her for causing a later car accident that kills another classmate.\n*'''Bryce Walker''' is the subject of the twelfth tape and a frequent bully throughout the novel. At the first party Hannah attends, Bryce rapes an unconscious Jessica. Later, he invites Hannah into a hot tub at another party and rapes her. Hannah resists but it was futile, so she lets herself go in despair.\n*'''Mr. Porter''' is the subject of the thirteenth tape and the final person slotted to receive Hannah's reasons. He is the school counselor who fails to help Hannah when she admits to him that she is suicidal.\n*'''Tony''' is a good-natured high school student who, though he is not on any of the tapes, receives copies of them just before Hannah's death. Though he tries to warn Hannah's parents, she kills herself, leaving Tony to watch over the people who are named as reasons for her death.

Hannah hid in a closet and witnessed someone raping her. Hannah says on the tape that Justin knew about this and let it happen. She also says that it's 'our fault' implying that she also blames herself for letting it happen. The next person listed is Bryce Walker, who is revealed to be Jessica's rapist. Hannah was walking past a party at Courtney's. Courtney, Bryce and some of the others were in the hot tub in just their underwear. Everyone left Hannah in the hot tub by herself and then Bryce got in and started to touch Hannah. Hannah tried to resist him but he forced himself on her and raped her. The last tape is for Mr. Porter, a temporary school counselor who told Hannah that if she was unwilling to press charges against \"the boy\" who raped her, she should \"try to move on\", even after Hannah expressed a desire to kill herself.\n\nAfter sending the tapes to the next person on the list, Clay returns to school and runs into his classmate Skye Miller, whom he suspects is also suicidal. The novel ends with Clay reaching out to her.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/summary.html |title=Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher |author=<!--Staff Writers--> |website=Shmoop |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727023547/https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/summary.html |archive-date=27 July 2012 |url-status=live |access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gradesaver.com/thirteen-reasons-why/study-guide/summary |title=Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher |author=<!--Staff Writers--> |work=GradeSaver |publisher=Grade Saver LLC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161210162043/http://www.gradesaver.com/thirteen-reasons-why/study-guide/summary |archive-date=10 December 2016 |url-status=live |access-date=22 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Differences with the TV series===\n\n* In the book, Clay listens to all of Hannah's tapes in one night; in the TV series, he listens to them over the course of several days.<ref name=\"vulture.com\">{{cite web|first=Madeleine|last=Buckley|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/03/thirteen-reasons-why-book-vs-the-show.html|title=All the Ways Netflix's 13 Reasons Why Is Different From the Book|website=[[Vulture.com]]|publisher=[[New York Media]]|location=New York City|date=March 31, 2017|accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n* The character in the book who was Marcus Cooley<ref name=bookchar>{{cite web |url=https://www.shmoop.com/thirteen-reasons-why/characters.html |title=Thirteen Reasons Why Characters |website=[[Shmoop]] |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206154349/https://ww.com/thirteen-reasons-why/characters.html |archive-date=6 December 2016 |access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref> became Marcus Cole in the TV series.\n\n* The character in the book who was named Jenny Kurtz<ref name=bookchar /> became Sheri Holland in the TV series.\n\n* Mr. Porter's first name is not listed in the book,<ref name=bookchar /> but he is named as Kevin in the TV series.\n\n* The second character to be named on the tapes in the book was Alex Standall;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Jessica Davis.\n\n* The ninth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Clay Jensen;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Justin Foley.\n\n* The tenth character to be named on the tapes in the book was Justin Foley;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Sheri Holland.\n\n* The eleventh character to be named on the tapes in the book was Jenny Kurtz;<ref name=bookchar /> in the TV series it was Clay Jensen.\n\n* Neither Tony or Ryan are identified as [[gay]] in the book, and their sexualities are not explored as part of the plot.<ref name=\"vulture.com\"/>\n\n* In the book, it is revealed that Hannah kills herself via swallowing a handful of pills.
