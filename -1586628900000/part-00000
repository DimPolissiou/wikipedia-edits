Typically made of [[stone]], they are also known as '''stone{{nbsp}}lions''' or '''shishi'''. They are known in colloquial English as '''lion{{nbsp}}dogs''' or '''foo{{nbsp}}dogs'''. The concept, which originated and became popular in [[Chinese Buddhism]], features a pair of highly stylized [[lion]]s\u2014often one male with a ball and one female with a [[lion cub|cub]]\u2014which were thought to protect the building from harmful spiritual influences and harmful people that might be a threat. Used in [[imperial China|imperial Chinese]] palaces and [[Chinese tomb|tombs]], the lions subsequently spread to other parts of Asia including Japan (see [[komainu]]), Korea, Tibet, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan, and Singapore.<ref>{{cite web|author=K Gorman |url=http://kgorman.ca/monster-monday-guardian-lions/ |title=Monster Monday: Guardian Lions \u2013 K.

They are also used in other artistic contexts, for example on door-knockers, and in pottery. Pairs of guardian lion statues are still common decorative and symbolic elements at the entrances to restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and other structures, with one sitting on each side of the entrance, in China and in other places around the world where the Chinese people have immigrated and settled, especially in local [[Chinatown]]s.\n\nThe lions are usually depicted in pairs. When used as statuary the pair would consist of a male leaning his paw upon an embroidered ball (in imperial contexts, representing supremacy over the world) and a female restraining a playful cub that is on its back (representing nurture).<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342714/Lion-of-Fo|title=Lion of Fo \u2013 Chinese art|encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nGuardian lions are referred to in various ways depending on language and context.

However, Chinese reference to the guardian lions are seldom prefixed with {{zh|c=\u4f5b|labels=no}} or {{zh|c=\u798f|labels=no}}, and more importantly never referred to as \"dogs\".{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nReference to guardian lions as dogs in Western cultures may be due to the Japanese reference to them as \"Korean dogs\" ({{lang|ja|\u72db\u72ac\u30fb\u9ad8\u9e97\u72ac}}) due to their transmission from China through Korea into Japan. It may also be due to the misidentification of the guardian lion figures as representing certain Chinese dog breeds such as the [[Chow Chow]] ({{zh|c=\u9b06\u7345\u72ac|labels=no|p=s\u014dngsh\u012b qu\u01cen|l=puffy-lion dog}}) or [[Pekingese]] ({{zh|c=\u7345\u5b50\u72d7|labels=no|p=Sh\u012bzi G\u01d2u|l=lion dog}}).\n\n== Appearance ==\n[[File:National Palace Museum RightSide Lion.JPG|thumb|right|Guardian lion at the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]]]]\n\nThe lions are traditionally carved from decorative stone, such as marble and granite or cast in bronze or iron. Because of the high cost of these materials and the labor required to produce them, private use of guardian lions was traditionally reserved for wealthy or elite families. Indeed, a traditional symbol of a family's wealth or social status was the placement of guardian lions in front of the family home. However, in modern times less expensive lions, mass-produced in concrete and resin, have become available and their use is therefore no longer restricted to the elite.{{Citation needed|reason=No sources cited in entire paragraph|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe lions are always presented in pairs, a manifestation of [[yin and yang]], the female representing yin and the male yang.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The male lion has its right front paw on a type of cloth ball{{Citation needed|reason=All stone lions have their paws on cloth balls?

Sometimes the female has her mouth closed, and the male open{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. This symbolizes the enunciation of the sacred word \"om\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. However, Japanese adaptations state that the male is inhaling, representing life, while the female exhales, representing death{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Other styles have both lions with a single large [[pearl]] in each of their partially opened mouths{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. The pearl is carved so that it can roll about in the lion's mouth but sized just large enough so that it can never be removed.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAccording to [[feng shui]], correct placement of the lions is important to ensure their beneficial effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} When looking at the entrance from outside the building, facing the lions, the male lion with the ball is on the right, and the female with the cub is on the left.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nChinese lions are intended to reflect the emotion of the animal as opposed to the reality of the lion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}  This is in distinct opposition to the traditional English lion which is a lifelike depiction of the animal.{{Citation needed|reason=What is an \"English\"lion?

Gradually they were incorporated as guardians of the Chinese Imperial dharm. Lions seemed appropriately regal beasts to guard the emperor's gates and have been used as such since.

They are also used in other artistic contexts, for example on door-knockers, and in pottery. Pairs of guardian lion statues are still common decorative and symbolic elements at the entrances to restaurants, hotels, supermarkets and other structures, with one sitting on each side of the entrance, in China and in other places around the world where the Chinese people have immigrated and settled, especially in local [[Chinatown]]s.\n\nThe lions are usually depicted in pairs. When used as statuary the pair would consist of a male leaning his paw upon an embroidered ball (in imperial contexts, representing supremacy over the world) and a female restraining a playful cub that is on its back (representing nurture).<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/342714/Lion-of-Fo|title=Lion of Fo \u2013 Chinese art|encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nGuardian lions are referred to in various ways depending on language and context.

It may also be due to the misidentification of the guardian lion figures as representing certain Chinese dog breeds such as the [[Chow Chow]] ({{zh|c=\u9b06\u7345\u72ac|labels=no|p=s\u014dngsh\u012b qu\u01cen|l=puffy-lion dog}}) or [[Pekingese]] ({{zh|c=\u7345\u5b50\u72d7|labels=no|p=Sh\u012bzi G\u01d2u|l=lion dog}}).\n\n== Appearance ==\n[[File:National Palace Museum RightSide Lion.JPG|thumb|right|Guardian lion at the [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]]]]\n\nThe lions are traditionally carved from decorative stone, such as marble and granite or cast in bronze or iron. Because of the high cost of these materials and the labor required to produce them, private use of guardian lions was traditionally reserved for wealthy or elite families. Indeed, a traditional symbol of a family's wealth or social status was the placement of guardian lions in front of the family home. However, in modern times less expensive lions, mass-produced in concrete and resin, have become available and their use is therefore no longer restricted to the elite.{{Citation needed|reason=No sources cited in entire paragraph|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe lions are always presented in pairs, a manifestation of [[yin and yang]], the female representing yin and the male yang.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The male lion has its right front paw on a type of cloth ball{{Citation needed|reason=All stone lions have their paws on cloth balls?

Sometimes the female has her mouth closed, and the male open{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. This symbolizes the enunciation of the sacred word \"om\"{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. However, Japanese adaptations state that the male is inhaling, representing life, while the female exhales, representing death{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}. Other styles have both lions with a single large [[pearl]] in each of their partially opened mouths{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.

It was their first album since 1993's ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'', and their first album of original studio material since the simultaneous releases of 1991's ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]''. In the mid-1990s, amid creative and personal differences, guitarists [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Gilby Clarke]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Matt Sorum]] all either quit or were fired. Only singer [[Axl Rose]] and keyboardist [[Dizzy Reed]] remained. In 1997, they began work on the album with guitarists [[Robin Finck]] and [[Paul Tobias]], bassist [[Tommy Stinson]], drummer [[Josh Freese]], and keyboardist [[Chris Pitman]].\n\nThe album underwent a protracted recording process, delayed by personal and legal problems and Rose's perfectionism. The lineup shifted several times, incorporating guitarists [[Buckethead]], [[Richard Fortus]] and [[Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal]] and drummers [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]] and [[Frank Ferrer]]. Guitarists [[Brian May]] and [[Dave Navarro]] and vocalist [[Sebastian Bach]] also took part in the recording sessions. Producers including [[Mike Clink]], [[Youth (musician)|Youth]], [[Sean Beavan]], [[Eric Caudieux]], [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and Caram Costanzo worked on the album across 15 studios. Though Geffen planned to release ''Chinese Democracy'' in 1999, it was delayed and completely re-recorded in 2000. With costs reportedly exceeding $13 million, it became the most expensive rock album ever produced, and Geffen pulled their funding in 2005.

Zutaut was the [[A&R man]] who had discovered the band and guided them through the recording of their previous albums.<ref name=\":2\" /> After they had resolved some personal differences, Rose told Zutaut of his frustrations in finding the sounds he wanted; for example, he had instructed the production team to recreate the drum sound of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', but was not satisfied with the results. With Zutaut's intervention, the team recreated the sound to Rose's satisfaction.<ref name=\":2\" /> After having Zutaut approved by Rose's personal psychic, whom Rose believed could assess positive and negative \"[[Aura (paranormal)|energies]]\" from photographs, Rose arranged for Geffen to pay Zutaut \"whatever it takes\". Zutaut's only concession was to defer some of his payment until the album was delivered, but the album missed the deadline.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Buckethead the granada theatre.jpg|thumb|[[Buckethead]] in 2016, with his signature white mask and [[KFC]] bucket]]\nBy the time Zutaut joined, Buckethead had left, following disagreements with Baker and frustrations over the band's lack of progress. Zutaut persuaded him to rejoin by installing a giant [[chicken coop]] in the studio for Buckethead to work in, with furniture, straw, chicken wire, and rubber chicken parts. Zutaut described it as \"part chicken coop, part horror movie ... you could almost smell the chickens\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Only assistant engineers were allowed to enter, to adjust microphones.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rose's assistant Beta Lebeis downplayed the coop as inexpensive and fun, saying \"it didn\u2019t cost money or anything \u2013 think about it, it\u2019s just wire ... It\u2019s something you do in three or four hours. Just for fun, to play a joke on somebody.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the coop caused friction when Buckethead began using it to watch hardcore pornography, disturbing Rose. After one of Rose's dogs defecated in the coop, Buckethead insisted it not be cleaned up as he liked the smell. After three days, the smell had become overwhelming and the studio staff removed it, upsetting Buckethead.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt Interscope's request, Zutaut investigated the project's budget. He found that the band were spending thousands of dollars a month on rented gear that went unused, and estimated he made changes that saved around $75,000 a month.<ref name=\":2\" /> Additionally, Rose kept erratic hours, which meant that the salaried musicians, engineers, and assistants were often unable to work. Zutaut said: \"These fucking people are getting paid shitloads of money and they're sitting on their arse doing nothing because Axl's not coming to the studio and they can't get him on the phone.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nZutaut estimated that Guns N' Roses had 50 or 60 songs in development. He went through each with Rose, trying to decide which were worth finishing.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Zutaut, during his time with the band they completed versions of \"The Blues\", \"Madagascar\", \"Chinese Democracy\", and \"Atlas Shrugged\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Zutaut tried to convince Rose to release the album as a solo album instead of a Guns N' Roses album, feeling it would sell better.<ref name=\"CD2018\"/> However, Rose said in 2008: \"I didn\u2019t make a solo record.

It was their first album since 1993's ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'', and their first album of original studio material since the simultaneous releases of 1991's ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]''. In the mid-1990s, amid creative and personal differences, guitarists [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Gilby Clarke]], bassist [[Duff McKagan]], and drummer [[Matt Sorum]] all either quit or were fired. Only singer [[Axl Rose]] and keyboardist [[Dizzy Reed]] remained. In 1997, they began work on the album with guitarists [[Robin Finck]] and [[Paul Tobias]], bassist [[Tommy Stinson]], drummer [[Josh Freese]], and keyboardist [[Chris Pitman]].\n\nThe album underwent a protracted recording process, delayed by personal and legal problems and Rose's perfectionism. The lineup shifted several times, incorporating guitarists [[Buckethead]], [[Richard Fortus]] and [[Ron \"Bumblefoot\" Thal]] and drummers [[Bryan Mantia|Bryan \"Brain\" Mantia]] and [[Frank Ferrer]]. Guitarists [[Brian May]] and [[Dave Navarro]] and vocalist [[Sebastian Bach]] also took part in the recording sessions. Producers including [[Mike Clink]], [[Youth (musician)|Youth]], [[Sean Beavan]], [[Eric Caudieux]], [[Roy Thomas Baker]] and Caram Costanzo worked on the album across 15 studios. Though Geffen planned to release ''Chinese Democracy'' in 1999, it was delayed and completely re-recorded in 2000. With costs reportedly exceeding $13 million, it became the most expensive rock album ever produced, and Geffen pulled their funding in 2005. After missing a release date for March 2007, it was finally released in November 2008, dogged by leaks and legal disputes.\n\nPreceded by the [[Chinese Democracy (song)|title track]] as a lead single, ''Chinese Democracy'' debuted at number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]; however, it did not meet sales expectations in the United States. It received generally favorable reviews, achieved international chart success, and has sold over one million copies in Europe.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:AxlRose.jpg|thumb|Vocalist [[Axl Rose]] was the main creative force behind the album.]]\nIn September 1991, Guns N' Roses released the albums ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', which went on to sell a combined eleven million copies in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958919/ask-billboard-battle-of-the-rock-bands-part-2 |title=Ask Billboard: Battle Of The Rock Bands, Part 2 |last=Trust |first=Gary |date=March 19, 2010 |website=[[Billboard.com]] |access-date=August 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613090842/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/958919/ask-billboard-battle-of-the-rock-bands-part-2 |archive-date=June 13, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In November 1991, during the [[Use Your Illusion Tour]],<ref name=\"UYI\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heretodaygonetohell.com/history/history93.php|title=The History of Guns N' Roses: The Shocking Truth: 1993|first=Jarmo|last=Luukkonen|work=heretodaygonetohell.com|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> rhythm guitarist and founding member [[Izzy Stradlin]] abruptly left the band, citing exhaustion with touring and conflicts with his bandmates,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Izzy Stradlin interview with ''Musician Magazine''|year=1992|journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]|publisher=Billboard Publications Inc.}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Gilby Clarke]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.easyreadernews.com/gilby-clarke-rides-again/|title=Gilby Clarke rides again|first=Mark|last=McDermott|date=May 26, 2010|work=Easy Reader News|accessdate=April 25, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730115948/https://www.easyreadernews.com/gilby-clarke-rides-again/|archive-date=July 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In November 1993, Guns N' Roses released ''[[\"The Spaghetti Incident?\"]]'', an album of covers of [[glam rock]] and [[punk rock]] songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-spaghetti-incident-19931209|title=Rolling Stone The Spaghetti Incident?

Zutaut was the [[A&R man]] who had discovered the band and guided them through the recording of their previous albums.<ref name=\":2\" /> After they had resolved some personal differences, Rose told Zutaut of his frustrations in finding the sounds he wanted; for example, he had instructed the production team to recreate the drum sound of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', but was not satisfied with the results. With Zutaut's intervention, the team recreated the sound to Rose's satisfaction.<ref name=\":2\" /> After having Zutaut approved by Rose's personal psychic, whom Rose believed could assess positive and negative \"[[Aura (paranormal)|energies]]\" from photographs, Rose arranged for Geffen to pay Zutaut \"whatever it takes\". Zutaut's only concession was to defer some of his payment until the album was delivered, but the album missed the deadline.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Buckethead the granada theatre.jpg|thumb|[[Buckethead]] in 2016, with his signature white mask and [[KFC]] bucket]]\nBy the time Zutaut joined, Buckethead had left, following disagreements with Baker and frustrations over the band's lack of progress. Zutaut persuaded him to rejoin by installing a giant [[chicken coop]] in the studio for Buckethead to work in, with furniture, straw, chicken wire, and rubber chicken parts. Zutaut described it as \"part chicken coop, part horror movie ... you could almost smell the chickens\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Only assistant engineers were allowed to enter, to adjust microphones.<ref name=\":2\" /> Rose's assistant Beta Lebeis downplayed the coop as inexpensive and fun, saying \"it didn\u2019t cost money or anything \u2013 think about it, it\u2019s just wire ... It\u2019s something you do in three or four hours. Just for fun, to play a joke on somebody.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the coop caused friction when Buckethead began using it to watch hardcore pornography, disturbing Rose. After one of Rose's dogs defecated in the coop, Buckethead insisted it not be cleaned up as he liked the smell. After three days, the smell had become overwhelming and the studio staff removed it, upsetting Buckethead.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt Interscope's request, Zutaut investigated the project's budget. He found that the band were spending thousands of dollars a month on rented gear that went unused, and estimated he made changes that saved around $75,000 a month.<ref name=\":2\" /> Additionally, Rose kept erratic hours, which meant that the salaried musicians, engineers, and assistants were often unable to work. Zutaut said: \"These fucking people are getting paid shitloads of money and they're sitting on their arse doing nothing because Axl's not coming to the studio and they can't get him on the phone.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nZutaut estimated that Guns N' Roses had 50 or 60 songs in development. He went through each with Rose, trying to decide which were worth finishing.<ref name=\":2\" /> According to Zutaut, during his time with the band they completed versions of \"The Blues\", \"Madagascar\", \"Chinese Democracy\", and \"Atlas Shrugged\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Zutaut tried to convince Rose to release the album as a solo album instead of a Guns N' Roses album, feeling it would sell better.<ref name=\"CD2018\"/> However, Rose said in 2008: \"I didn\u2019t make a solo record. A solo record would be completely different than this and probably much more instrumental. The songs were chosen by everyone involved.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.spin.com/2008/12/axl-chinese-democracy-its-not-solo-album/ |title=Axl on \u2018Chinese Democracy\u2019: \"It\u2019s Not a Solo Album\"  |last=Fitzmaurice |first=Larry |date=December 16, 2008 |magazine=Spin |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181223110634/https://www.spin.com/2008/12/axl-chinese-democracy-its-not-solo-album/ |archive-date=December 23, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=December 23, 2018}}</ref> Lebeis said in March 2001 that 48 songs had been completed, and that Geffen had begun selecting them for the album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ladydairhean.0catch.com/Axl/Interviews/article0155.htm |title= Beta Lebeis Interview |date=March 2001 |website=Brazilian Journal}}</ref>\n\nFor his 2001 film ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]],'' filmmaker [[Ridley Scott]] asked to use the 1987 Guns N' Roses song \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", from their debut album ''Appetite for Destruction.''

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player.

As a player, Mancini operated as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|deep-lying forward]], and was best known for his time at [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], where he played more than 550 matches, and helped the team win the [[Serie A]] league title, four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]]. He was capped 36 times for [[Italy national football team|Italy]], taking part at [[UEFA Euro 1988]] and the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], achieving semi-final finishes in both tournaments. In 1997, after 15 years at Sampdoria, Mancini left the club to join [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]], where he won a further ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'', as well as the Cup Winners' Cup, the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and two more Coppa Italia titles.\n\nAs a player, Mancini would often give team talks at [[half-time]]. Towards the end of his playing career he became an assistant to [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] at Lazio.<ref>{{cite web |title=FA Cup special: The Roberto Mancini story |last=Whalley |first=Mike |quote=He was the club captain, he often gave the team talks and he even helped to design the kit. |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/sport/football/manchester_city/s/1420688_fa-cup-special-the-roberto-mancini-story |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}</ref> His first manager role was at a cash-stricken [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] at only 35 years old. He won a Coppa Italia there, but left with the team facing bankruptcy. Months later he took over as manager at Lazio, where again he inherited financial constraints and was forced to lose a number of key players. With limited resources during his two-season tenure, he guided the club to another Coppa Italia.\n\nIn 2004, Mancini was given the chance to manage a major club with more resources when he was offered the manager's job at Inter. During his first tenure at Inter, the club won three consecutive Serie A titles, an Inter club record, and an [[Football records in Italy#Most consecutive wins|Italian record 17 consecutive league game victories]] stretching nearly half a season; Mancini became Inter's most successful manager in 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/03/01/1860120.htm |title=Inter's winning run ends in draw with Udinese |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=1 March 2007 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Football managers who never get the job \u2013 Mancini was Inter Milan's most successful manager in 30 years | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/shortlisted-football-managers-who-never-get-the-job-1821650.html?action=Popup&ino=8 | publisher=Independent Online | location=London | first=Simon | last=Rice | date=16 November 2009}}</ref> Despite his domestic success, many pundits saw the repeated failure to win the coveted [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] as the main reason for his dismissal in 2008.\n\nAfter being out of football for over a year, Mancini was appointed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager in December 2009.<ref name=\"tactics\">{{cite news |title=Younger the better for Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/younger-the-better-for-manchester-city-manager-roberto-mancini-1.1045178 |publisher=heraldscotland.com |date=1 August 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref> Under his stewardship, he instilled a winning culture at the club, taking Manchester City from a mid-table club to the top level of English football, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.

He also appeared in the [[1992 European Cup Final|final]] of the [[1991\u201392 European Cup]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. At 27, Mancini sat on the interview panel that selected [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] as manager. Mancini often delivered the team-talk for Sampdoria. He attended board meetings and had a say in transfer business. In [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]]'s 1995 autobiography, ''Achieving the Goal'', he described the day he met Sampdoria in Genoa while playing for [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and, lining up in the tunnel, became aware that Mancini was looking his way. Platt wrote: \"I thought nothing of it until he asked me, very matter-of-factly, if I was staying at Bari. Outright he asked if I wanted to join Sampdoria. Mancini had been at the club years and was almost a son to the president, Paolo Mantovani.\" Mancini kept in touch when Platt moved to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and eventually helped bring him to Sampdoria. At that stage, Mancini had established himself as the most powerful voice in the ''Blucerchiati'' dressing room.\n\nAs a teenager at Sampdoria, Mancini was not someone who liked his authority being questioned. After [[Trevor Francis]] signed from [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in 1982, aggrieved that his place was under threat, the 18-year-old Mancini ended up picking a fight with 28-year-old Francis on the training ground. A similar incident occurred with [[Liam Brady]], who was eight years older. Additionally, [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n]] tells the story of swearing in Mancini's direction during an argument about a badly-taken corner. After the match, Mancini had stripped off to the waist and was waiting to fight him. \"He is not an easy person, you know,\" Ver\u00f3n says. \"He has this complicated personality.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/06/roberto-mancini-sir-alex-ferguson?INTCMP=SRCH | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Daniel | last=Taylor | title=Roberto Mancini is Manchester City's very own Sir Alex Ferguson | date=6 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lazio===\nWith [[S.S.

In the [[1999\u20132000 Serie A|1999\u201300 season]], Lazio won the ''Scudetto'' and [[1999\u20132000 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], but Mancini failed to score in 20 matches and later announced his playing retirement. He joined Lazio's coaching staff as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson's number two. In 2011, when asked about Mancini, Eriksson said, \"I took him to Lazio with me and he wanted to be a manager even while he was a player. He was the coach, he was the kit man, he was the bus driver, everything. At Sampdoria he wanted to check that everything was in place before training. Sometimes I would have to tell him: 'Mancio, you have a game to play on Sunday, you will be exhausted if you have to control everything.'

Inter became the dominant team in Italy. In Mancini's first season, Inter won the [[2004\u201305 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] with a 3\u20130 victory over [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] at the [[San Siro]]. Inter finished third in [[2003\u201304 Serie A]] and reached the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League#Quarter-finals|quarter-finals]] only to be knocked out by city rivals [[A.C.

Following the ''[[Calciopoli]]'' scandal, [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were stripped of the ''[[List of Italian football champions|Scudetto]]'' title, which was handed to Inter instead.

The run lasted for almost five months and is among the best in [[UEFA|European league football history]]. Inter won a [[2006\u201307 Serie A|second successive league title]] with five games to spare and only losing one league game all season. Inter finished with a record-breaking 97 points.\n\nMancini became the third coach in [[History of Inter Milan|Inter history]] to win back-to-back league titles after [[Alfredo Foni]]; [[1952\u201353 Serie A|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 Serie A|1953\u201354]] and [[Helenio Herrera]]; [[1964\u201365 Serie A|1964\u201365]] and [[1965\u201366 Serie A|1965\u201366]]).

In Mancini's first full season in charge at City, they conceded 33 goals in the Premier League, the fewest along with Chelsea and 18 clean sheets, the highest in the [[2010\u201311 Premier League|2010\u201311 Premier League season]].\n\nMancini's training methods have been criticised by some City players<ref>{{cite news |title=Carlos Tevez criticizes Roberto Mancini's training methods |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/13/carlos-tevez-criticises-roberto-mancini |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> and especially by ex-Manchester City fitness coach [[Raymond Verheijen]], who is a personal fitness coach for [[Craig Bellamy]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ex-coach attacks Roberto Mancini's 'crazy' training at Manchester City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/23/roberto-mancini-training-methods-manchester-city |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref> During his time at City, Mancini tried to stamp his authority with rebellious players who were not performing well and has stated, \"If a top player is not happy then it's better to go.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Roberto Mancini tells Carlos Tevez to shape up or ship out of City |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/apr/29/roberto-mancini-carlos-tevez-city-manchester |publisher=guardian.co.uk |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2010 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Taylor}}</ref>\n\nMancini is known to use the media to alleviate the pressure from his players.

{"title_page": "Dali's Llama", "text_new": "'''Dali's Llama''' is an [[United States of America|American]] band formed in 1993 by Zach Huskey and his wife, Erica. The band is primarily a [[Palm Desert Scene|desert rock]] / [[stoner rock]] band but over the years, it has ventured into doom, [[punk rock]], [[Experimental rock|experimental]], and [[garage rock]]. The Huskeys also started their own record label called Dali's Llama Records and have released fourteen Dali's Llama albums, in addition to numerous side projects and solo albums.\n\n== Before Dali's Llama ==\nZach Huskey's early bands were The Sciotics (with Sean Wheeler), Blue Sunday, Cloudy Daze and The Next. All featured Tony Brown from Unsound on drums.\n\nIn 1986, Huskey graduated from high school then moved to [[Los Angeles]]. There, he formed the band Long, Dead and Gone. The band performed for the most part in Los Angeles and collaborated with some [[punk rock|punk]] and [[metal band]]s. Occasionally, the band travelled back to the desert to play at a club or a [[generator party]]. When Long, Dead and Gone disbanded, Huskey formed a very heavy de-tuned rock band called My Pain. My Pain played with Wool, White Zombie, Rage Against The Machine and The Obsessed. When My Pain disbanded, the Huskeys returned to the desert.\n\n== History of Dali's Llama ==\nIn 1993, Zach and Erica Huskey formed Dalai's llama after they returned from Los Angeles. In the same year, after creating Dali's Llama Records they self-released the band's first [[CD]], ''Pre Post Now''. [[Bruce Fessier]] of ''[[The Desert Sun]]'' said, \"Zach Huskey has been an integral player on the desert rock scene since the days of the generator parties in the late 1980s and early '90s. His tuned-down guitar sounds epitomize desert rock as surely as the music of Kyuss, Fatso Jetson and House of Broken Promises. You can hear Huskey's hard rock sound on the many Dali's Llama albums he's produced on his own independent label.\"<ref>Fessier B. [http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2014/06/30/zach-huskey-hick-ups-dunebilly/11817963/ Zach Huskey hicks up Dunebilly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402224524/http://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/music/2014/06/30/zach-huskey-hick-ups-dunebilly/11817963/ |date=2015-04-02 }} The Desert Sun June 30, 2014.</ref>\n\nThe following year, Dali's Llama released their second CD entitled ''Creative Space'' which took an artistically more aggressive turn. The song ''Listen'' was later featured in the 2010 movie ''I\u2019m not like that no more'' featuring [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] and [[Felipe Esparanza]]. The band's lineup for both of these early CDs was Zach Huskey (songwriter/vocals/guitar), Erica Huskey (bass) and Johnnie Moreno (drums).\n\nThe band performed at entertainment venues in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the desert area, including the Rhythm and Brews club owned by Mario and Larry Lalli. Dali's Llama performed with many bands, including Unsound, Well Strung to Hang, Solarfeast, Super Fun Happy Slide, Polyphemus and Sort of Quartet and opened for artists, such as [[Robin Trower]]. In 1994, the drummer, Ian Dye replaced Johnnie Moreno.\n\nIn 1995, Dali's Llama released a third CD, ''Being''. Both \u201cCreative Space\u201d and \u201cBeing\u201d were produced by Steve Kravac and recorded at West Beach Recorders, Los Angeles, a studio owned by Brett Gurewitz, guitarist for [[Bad Religion]]. Sophia Possidon of [[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]] said, \"\"Be This Moment\" impressed from the first ten seconds, as being a serious yet catchy rock tune.\"\n\nAfter ''Being'', Zach Huskey took the band artistically in a different direction. He wrote songs using elements of his [[avant-garde]] compositions. The band had a new drummer, George Rubacava and a second guitar player, Eric Overton. The new experimental improvisational songs were recorded live at a rehearsal in 1995 but were not released until 2001 on ''The Color Of Apples'' CD.\n\nPhil Lieberts, a musician and composer said, \"Most jam sessions are far more fun to play than to hear. This is an exception. This collective improvisation really works. What sets it apart is a sense of swing and dynamics. Something special was created out of a void that day in  \u030195. There is substance here. Pay close attention. This difficult music is quite rewarding. How much you hear in it depends on your attention span. Happy accidents abound. There is a refreshing lack of nihilistic overkill. (Still, mello it ain \u0301t.) Hey, call it No Wave blues (with a smile). Give it the good hard listen it deserves - it will never happen again.\"\n\nIn 2005, after pursuing other projects (including ''Primordial Blues'') and solo projects, Dali's Llama released a fifth CD, ''Chordata''. Huskey incorporated influences from [[The Stooges]], [[X]], [[The Cult]], [[MC5]] and early 70s [[The Who|Who]]. He also incorporated elements of the heavy rock sound of [[Wolfmother]] and the lyricism of [[Bad Religion]].\n\n[[Alfredo Hernandez]] said, \"Way before Kyuss or Queens of the Stone Age, Dali\u2019s Llama frontman Zach Huskey was a musician to be reckoned with. Today\u2019s Dali\u2019s Llama are punchy, powerful and to the point. Dali\u2019s Llama is one of the best desert rock bands today and the best live desert rock band around!\"\n\nIn 2006, Eric Overton left the band. Zach Huskey wrote some slower tempo songs, tuned down, heavy, slow, and sludgy. The Dali Llama's sixth CD, ''Sweet Sludge'' was recorded at The Sanctuary and produced by Scott Reeder.\n\n[[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]] said, \"They were out here a few weeks ago - tracked and mixed it in only four days! It was good to hang out again with my old pal Zach Huskey, who\u2019s been a stalwart of the desert music scene since our high school days together. Along with his wife/bassist Erica and drummer Robin, Dali\u2019s Llama have been working hard - hardcore DIY, and in it for all the right reasons - for the pure joy of making music. Zach\u2019s always-thought-inspiring lyrics, coupled with epic song structures, are tossed off as if it\u2019s no big deal. After a few listens, a deep appreciation develops for the love that goes into what they do together.\"\n\nAround this time Dali's Llama performed with Fatso Jetson, Dixie Witch, Sasquatch, House of Broken Promises, SuperGiant, Floating Goat, Putanesca (Joe Baiza's band). They appeared at festivals such as the Stoner Hands of Doom Festival (SHoD VIII) in [[Mesa, Arizona]].\n\nThe Dali Llama's seventh CD, ''Full on Dunes''  presented heavier, thicker, and faster songs. It blended the band's desert punk and heavy rock roots. Jeff Howe, drummer, joined the band. Some of the Huskey's high school friends performed as guests on the CD. They included Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Yawning Man and Desert Sessions), Sean Wheeler (Throw Rag, Sun Trash and Charley Horse), Joe Dillon (from Hot Beat Pussy Fiend) and Scott Reeder.<ref>[http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showthread.%20php?t=19586 Dali\u2019s Llama - Full On Dunes Earthdog]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Hellride.com March 15, 2009</ref> Mike Frame said, \"Here is another album full of top-notch stoner/desert rock from this great band.

Joe Dillon performed as a second guitarist. Again, the CD was recorded at The Sanctuary with Scott Reeder. This CD had a darker, heavier and angrier sound. The Obelisk website commented, \"Raw is Real definitely lives up to its name, more ideologically than sonically. It sounds clean but there is a cynical bite to the lyrics of songs like ''Theocracy'' and the punkish ''Grump'' that, political or not, adds thematic heft.\"<ref>[http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2009/11/24/dalisllamare-%20view-2/#more-4651 Dali\u2019s Llama Keep it Raw, Also Real]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Obelisk November 24, 2009</ref>\n\nThe band's 2010 CD, ''Howl do you Do?'' was a lighthearted detour for the band with a live unpolished sixties psychedelia sound. It incorporated a garage element and raw blues with hints of The Sonics, Music Machine, Nuggets, The Yardbirds, Fuzztones and The Damned. A new drummer, Craig Brown joined the band and Mikael Jacobson, also the producer, played the organ. It was recorded at Audio Grande studios. Jay Snider said, \"Nothing wrong with a little trip to the chemistry lab! \"Howl do you do?\" is an experiment that works. Not as much of a departure from the band's sound as I expected (riffs are still the trail boss on this wagon train), but the quicker, catchier song structures, heavy organ interplay, and the more jammed-out feel of the material sure do show another side to Dali's Llama.\"<ref>[http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showthread.%20php?p=384365#post384365 Dali\u2019s Llama \u2013 Howl do you do?]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Hell Rider Music website August 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nAfter releasing a CD each year for five years, Dali\u2019s Llama released Zach Huskey's side project, a heavy sounding CD called ''Warts and All'' with a band formed with the name, Ogressa. The line up of the band was Zach Huskey, Trent Ramseyer (vocals), Ian Dye (drums), Mike Jacobson (bass), Scott Reeder (bass) and Joe Dillon (second guitar on some tracks).\n\nIn 2012, Dali\u2019s Llama released the album ''Autumn Woods'' with influences from [[doom metal]]. Joe Wangler, a new second guitarist joined the band. This album was recorded in two and a half days at The Sanctuary. Scott Reeder again engineered and produced the album. Ed and Sally on Doommantia website commented, \"After so many years together and with so much music recorded already, it is remarkable that Dali's Llama have still yet to make a wrong turn in their recording career.\"<ref>[http://www.doommantia.com/search?q=Dali%27s+Llama Dali's Llama - Autumn Woods] Doomantia website December 19, 2012</ref>\n\nCelebrating 20 years together, Dali's Llama released an anthology of some of their better known songs up to that point. \"...it is a lovingly curated eight song LP that represents the last five years of the band... Although this isn't the lavish, career-spanning box set the band deserves, Twenty Years Underground gives you a tantalizing taste of power and majesty that is Dali's Llama. It will leave you wanting more.\" - Eleni P. Austin, Coachella Valley Weekly<ref>[http://coachellavalleyweekly.com/dalis-llama-twenty-years-underground-dalis-llama-records]Coachella Valley Weekly</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Dali's Llama released their twelfth release \"Dying In The Sun\". \"...they continue to crank out fantastic heavy music.

Austin wrote in the ''[[Coachella Valley Weekly]]', \"If someone were to erect a shrine to the founders of the Desert Rock scene, an imposing Mount Rushmore-style monument, the four faces would have to be Mario Lalli, Herb Lineau, Sean Wheeler and Zach Huskey.

The band is primarily a [[Palm Desert Scene|desert rock]] / [[stoner rock]] band but over the years, it has ventured into doom, [[punk rock]], [[Experimental rock|experimental]], and [[garage rock]]. The Huskeys also started their own record label called Dali's Llama Records and have released fourteen Dali's Llama albums, in addition to numerous side projects and solo albums.\n\n== Before Dali's Llama ==\nZach Huskey's early bands were The Sciotics (with Sean Wheeler), Blue Sunday, Cloudy Daze and The Next. All featured Tony Brown from Unsound on drums.\n\nIn 1986, Huskey graduated from high school then moved to [[Los Angeles]]. There, he formed the band Long, Dead and Gone. The band performed for the most part in Los Angeles and collaborated with some [[punk rock|punk]] and [[metal band]]s. Occasionally, the band travelled back to the desert to play at a club or a [[generator party]]. When Long, Dead and Gone disbanded, Huskey formed a very heavy de-tuned rock band called My Pain. My Pain played with Wool, White Zombie, Rage Against The Machine and The Obsessed. When My Pain disbanded, the Huskeys returned to the desert.\n\n== History of Dali's Llama ==\nIn 1993, Zach and Erica Huskey formed Dalai's llama after they returned from Los Angeles. In the same year, after creating Dali's Llama Records they self-released the band's first [[CD]], ''Pre Post Now''. [[Bruce Fessier]] of ''[[The Desert Sun]]'' said, \"Zach Huskey has been an integral player on the desert rock scene since the days of the generator parties in the late 1980s and early '90s. His tuned-down guitar sounds epitomize desert rock as surely as the music of Kyuss, Fatso Jetson and House of Broken Promises. You can hear Huskey's hard rock sound on the many Dali's Llama albums he's produced on his own independent label.\"<ref>Fessier B.

The song ''Listen'' was later featured in the 2010 movie ''I\u2019m not like that no more'' featuring [[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]] and [[Felipe Esparanza]]. The band's lineup for both of these early CDs was Zach Huskey (songwriter/vocals/guitar), Erica Huskey (bass) and Johnnie Moreno (drums).\n\nThe band performed at entertainment venues in Los Angeles, San Diego, and the desert area, including the Rhythm and Brews club owned by Mario and Larry Lalli. Dali's Llama performed with many bands, including Unsound, Well Strung to Hang, Solarfeast, Super Fun Happy Slide, Polyphemus and Sort of Quartet and opened for artists, such as [[Robin Trower]]. In 1994, the drummer, Ian Dye replaced Johnnie Moreno.\n\nIn 1995, Dali's Llama released a third CD, ''Being''. Both \u201cCreative Space\u201d and \u201cBeing\u201d were produced by Steve Kravac and recorded at West Beach Recorders, Los Angeles, a studio owned by Brett Gurewitz, guitarist for [[Bad Religion]]. Sophia Possidon of [[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]] said, \"\"Be This Moment\" impressed from the first ten seconds, as being a serious yet catchy rock tune.\"\n\nAfter ''Being'', Zach Huskey took the band artistically in a different direction. He wrote songs using elements of his [[avant-garde]] compositions. The band had a new drummer, George Rubacava and a second guitar player, Eric Overton. The new experimental improvisational songs were recorded live at a rehearsal in 1995 but were not released until 2001 on ''The Color Of Apples'' CD.\n\nPhil Lieberts, a musician and composer said, \"Most jam sessions are far more fun to play than to hear. This is an exception. This collective improvisation really works. What sets it apart is a sense of swing and dynamics. Something special was created out of a void that day in  \u030195. There is substance here. Pay close attention. This difficult music is quite rewarding. How much you hear in it depends on your attention span. Happy accidents abound. There is a refreshing lack of nihilistic overkill. (Still, mello it ain \u0301t.) Hey, call it No Wave blues (with a smile). Give it the good hard listen it deserves - it will never happen again.\"\n\nIn 2005, after pursuing other projects (including ''Primordial Blues'') and solo projects, Dali's Llama released a fifth CD, ''Chordata''. Huskey incorporated influences from [[The Stooges]], [[X]], [[The Cult]], [[MC5]] and early 70s [[The Who|Who]]. He also incorporated elements of the heavy rock sound of [[Wolfmother]] and the lyricism of [[Bad Religion]].\n\n[[Alfredo Hernandez]] said, \"Way before Kyuss or Queens of the Stone Age, Dali\u2019s Llama frontman Zach Huskey was a musician to be reckoned with. Today\u2019s Dali\u2019s Llama are punchy, powerful and to the point. Dali\u2019s Llama is one of the best desert rock bands today and the best live desert rock band around!\"\n\nIn 2006, Eric Overton left the band. Zach Huskey wrote some slower tempo songs, tuned down, heavy, slow, and sludgy. The Dali Llama's sixth CD, ''Sweet Sludge'' was recorded at The Sanctuary and produced by Scott Reeder.\n\n[[Scott Reeder (bassist)|Scott Reeder]] said, \"They were out here a few weeks ago - tracked and mixed it in only four days! It was good to hang out again with my old pal Zach Huskey, who\u2019s been a stalwart of the desert music scene since our high school days together. Along with his wife/bassist Erica and drummer Robin, Dali\u2019s Llama have been working hard - hardcore DIY, and in it for all the right reasons - for the pure joy of making music. Zach\u2019s always-thought-inspiring lyrics, coupled with epic song structures, are tossed off as if it\u2019s no big deal. After a few listens, a deep appreciation develops for the love that goes into what they do together.\"\n\nAround this time Dali's Llama performed with Fatso Jetson, Dixie Witch, Sasquatch, House of Broken Promises, SuperGiant, Floating Goat, Putanesca (Joe Baiza's band). They appeared at festivals such as the Stoner Hands of Doom Festival (SHoD VIII) in [[Mesa, Arizona]].\n\nThe Dali Llama's seventh CD, ''Full on Dunes''  presented heavier, thicker, and faster songs. It blended the band's desert punk and heavy rock roots. Jeff Howe, drummer, joined the band. Some of the Huskey's high school friends performed as guests on the CD. They included Mario Lalli (Fatso Jetson, Yawning Man and Desert Sessions), Sean Wheeler (Throw Rag, Sun Trash and Charley Horse), Joe Dillon (from Hot Beat Pussy Fiend) and Scott Reeder.<ref>[http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showthread.%20php?t=19586 Dali\u2019s Llama - Full On Dunes Earthdog]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Hellride.com March 15, 2009</ref> Mike Frame said, \"Here is another album full of top-notch stoner/desert rock from this great band.

Joe Dillon performed as a second guitarist. Again, the CD was recorded at The Sanctuary with Scott Reeder. This CD had a darker, heavier and angrier sound. The Obelisk website commented, \"Raw is Real definitely lives up to its name, more ideologically than sonically. It sounds clean but there is a cynical bite to the lyrics of songs like ''Theocracy'' and the punkish ''Grump'' that, political or not, adds thematic heft.\"<ref>[http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2009/11/24/dalisllamare-%20view-2/#more-4651 Dali\u2019s Llama Keep it Raw, Also Real]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Obelisk November 24, 2009</ref>\n\nThe band's 2010 CD, ''Howl do you Do?'' was a lighthearted detour for the band with a live unpolished sixties psychedelia sound. It incorporated a garage element and raw blues with hints of The Sonics, Music Machine, Nuggets, The Yardbirds, Fuzztones and The Damned. A new drummer, Craig Brown joined the band and Mikael Jacobson, also the producer, played the organ. It was recorded at Audio Grande studios. Jay Snider said, \"Nothing wrong with a little trip to the chemistry lab! \"Howl do you do?\" is an experiment that works. Not as much of a departure from the band's sound as I expected (riffs are still the trail boss on this wagon train), but the quicker, catchier song structures, heavy organ interplay, and the more jammed-out feel of the material sure do show another side to Dali's Llama.\"<ref>[http://www.hellridemusicforums.com/forum/showthread.%20php?p=384365#post384365 Dali\u2019s Llama \u2013 Howl do you do?]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Hell Rider Music website August 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nAfter releasing a CD each year for five years, Dali\u2019s Llama released Zach Huskey's side project, a heavy sounding CD called ''Warts and All'' with a band formed with the name, Ogressa. The line up of the band was Zach Huskey, Trent Ramseyer (vocals), Ian Dye (drums), Mike Jacobson (bass), Scott Reeder (bass) and Joe Dillon (second guitar on some tracks).\n\nIn 2012, Dali\u2019s Llama released the album ''Autumn Woods'' with influences from [[doom metal]]. Joe Wangler, a new second guitarist joined the band. This album was recorded in two and a half days at The Sanctuary. Scott Reeder again engineered and produced the album. Ed and Sally on Doommantia website commented, \"After so many years together and with so much music recorded already, it is remarkable that Dali's Llama have still yet to make a wrong turn in their recording career.\"<ref>[http://www.doommantia.com/search?q=Dali%27s+Llama Dali's Llama - Autumn Woods] Doomantia website December 19, 2012</ref>\n\nCelebrating 20 years together, Dali's Llama released an anthology of some of their better known songs up to that point. \"...it is a lovingly curated eight song LP that represents the last five years of the band... Although this isn't the lavish, career-spanning box set the band deserves, Twenty Years Underground gives you a tantalizing taste of power and majesty that is Dali's Llama. It will leave you wanting more.\" - Eleni P. Austin, Coachella Valley Weekly<ref>[http://coachellavalleyweekly.com/dalis-llama-twenty-years-underground-dalis-llama-records]Coachella Valley Weekly</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Dali's Llama released their twelfth release \"Dying In The Sun\". \"...they continue to crank out fantastic heavy music.
