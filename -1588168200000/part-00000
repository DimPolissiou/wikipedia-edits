Due to scarcity of religious missionaries, the Franciscans again took over the administration of the settlement in 1703.\n\nOn 27 December 1735, a great storm came and a huge wave called ''tromba marina'' devastated the old town settlement, then located in Barrio Sabang.

The general headquarters and camp base of the Philippine Commonwealth Army from 3 January 1942 to 30 June 1946 and the Philippine Constabulary from 28 October 1944 to 30 June 1946 were stationed in Baler.

As a player, he represented [[England national football team|the England national team]] and captained the side, but he is best known for his time as [[England national football team manager|England manager]] from 1963 to 1974, which included guiding them to victory in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. Knighted in 1967 in recognition of the World Cup win, Ramsey also managed his country to third place in the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] and the quarter-finals of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championship]] respectively. As a player, Ramsey was a [[defender (association football)|defender]] and a member of England's [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] squad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Ernest-Ramsey|title=Sir Alfred Ernest Ramsey: British soccer player and manager |website=Britannica|date=24 April 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey was born and raised in a quiet [[Essex]] village. He showed sporting promise from an early age and, after serving in the British Army during the [[World War II|Second World War]], embarked on a football career, primarily as a [[right-back]]. He was considered a rather slow but accomplished player with a tremendous grasp of the tactical side of the game. Nicknamed \"The General\", he played for England 32 times between 1948 and 1953, captaining the side three times, scoring three times and appearing in the 1950 World Cup. He played his club football for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was part of the Tottenham side that won the [[List of English football champions|English League championship]] in the [[1950\u201351 Football League|1950\u201351 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Asif |last=Burhan|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/modest-beginnings-sir-alf-ramsey|title=The improbable success of Alf Ramsey|website=morningstaronline|date=22 January 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey retired from playing aged 35 to become the manager of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], then in the [[English football league system|third tier of English football]]. Ipswich rose through the divisions over the next six years, winning the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] in [[1956\u201357 Football League|1956\u201357]] and the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]]. In the [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362 season]], Ipswich's first ever campaign in the top division, Ramsey's team defied expectations to become champions of England. Ramsey took charge of the England team a year later. In a distinct break with common practice of the day, he used a narrow formation that led to his England side being dubbed \"The Wingless Wonders\". England's World Cup victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1966 made Ramsey a national hero, though he had his critics, both at the time and since. He lost the England job acrimoniously, following the team's failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]].\n\nAfter managing England, Ramsey briefly held football-related roles at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], before retiring in 1979\u201380. He led a somewhat reclusive life in [[Ipswich]] over the next two decades and died in 1999, aged 79. A statue of Ramsey was dedicated at the reconstructed [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2009, and various honours have been afforded to him in Ipswich. He is the first person to have been inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] twice: an inaugural inductee in 2002, in recognition of his achievements as a manager and admitted again in 2010 for his achievements as a player. He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Dagenham===\n[[File:Dagenham village.jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Dagenham]], Ramsey's birthplace and childhood home (2007)]]\nAlfred Ernest Ramsey was born on 22 January 1920 at 6 Parrish Cottages, Halbutt Street in [[Dagenham]], which was then an [[agriculture|agrarian]] village in Essex, about {{convert|10|mi}} east of central London.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} He was the third of five children, four boys and a girl, born to Herbert Ramsey, a manual labourer who worked a [[smallholding]], kept pigs and drove a horse-drawn [[dustcart]], and his wife Florence (''n\u00e9e'' Bixby). Parrish Cottages lacked hot running water and electricity, and the only toilet was outside. Such conditions were typical of Dagenham during this period, although Ramsey's street gradually became something of an anachronism as he grew up. From 1921, [[London County Council]] transformed the area into the [[Becontree]] estate, a vast urban community that by 1934 was home to 120,000 people and the [[Ford Dagenham]] automobile factory. Parrish Cottages remained largely untouched: electricity was not installed until the 1950s, and even then only with the reluctant approval of Ramsey's mother, who, according to a neighbour, was frightened of it.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In the recollection of a childhood contemporary, Phil Cairns, the Ramsey house was \"little more than a wooden hut\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\nThe young Alf Ramsey was described by his friend Fred Tibble as \"a very quiet boy who really loved sport\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In his 1952 autobiography ''Talking Football'', Ramsey described \"liv[ing] for the open air from the moment I could toddle\",{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=12}} spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a [[tennis ball]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to fourteen. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between each other on the way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played [[cricket]] to a high standard and represented the school in the [[high jump]], the [[long jump]], and both the [[100-yard dash|100-yard]] and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed [[boxing]] until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent\u2014\"as wide as I was tall\" in Ramsey's recollection\u2014gave him a severe beating in a school tournament.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, for the rest of his life.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n\"He was very withdrawn, almost surly\", Cairns recalled, \"but he became animated on the football field\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School when he was only seven years old, playing at [[Inside forward|inside-left]] alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of football boots. Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]]\u2014the key position of the [[WM formation|\"WM\" formation]] then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first [[English Football League|Football League]] match, watching their favourite team, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], play against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=26\u201328}} He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}}\n\nOn leaving school in 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey tried to get a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he intended to become a [[greengrocer]]. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the [[Co-op Food|Co-op]], delivering groceries on a bicycle.

As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing full-backs, who would naturally expect to see a winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As [[Bobby Charlton]] remarked, \"The Spanish full-backs were just looking at each other while we were going in droves through the middle\". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.<ref name=\"Orejan2011\">{{cite book|author=Jaime Orejan|title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0l2T7tLSiEC&pg=PA112|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8566-6|page=112| accessdate = 21 March 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nA firm but fair manager, Ramsey was often regarded as difficult by the press. He ran a strict regime with his players and made sure that no-one felt that they enjoyed special status, star player or not. In May 1964, after a number of players failed to show up for a meeting in a hotel about a forthcoming tour, amongst them Bobby Moore, [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Bobby Charlton]], they eventually returned to their rooms to discover their passports left on their beds. His strict regime didn't suit everyone but the players with real talent and respect for the game responded well to them and had great respect for Ramsey. Very few of those who played for Ramsey spoke ill of him. In the preparations for the 1966 World Cup, Ramsey made sure that no player was confident of a place in the final 22, which resulted in players performing at their highest level. His decision to appoint a young Bobby Moore as captain also showed Ramsey's ability to see great potential in young players. Another one of his abilities was as a master tactician: a quality that he had first shown with his reading of the game as a player. When it came to tactics, Ramsey had revolutionary ideas.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}-->\n\nRamsey earned the respect of his players. He strongly supported [[Nobby Stiles]] when the FA leaned on Ramsey to drop Stiles from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final following a tackle on Frenchman [[Jacques Simon (footballer)|Jacques Simon]] in the previous game.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|pp=168\u2013170}}  After the final, at the banquet, with the players in one room and their wives forced to sit in an adjoining room, he excused his players early from the banquet to allow the players to join their wives after nearly four weeks apart.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|p=208}} In his manner with the players, he was \"usually equable\", but when his 1978 Birmingham City team produced a poor defensive display, \"he blew his top\"; the next game was a \"historic victory\".<ref name=\"BrumMail\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nRamsey was very sensitive about his personal background. He strove to mask his [[working-class]] Essex origins and to present himself as erudite and worldly, going so far as to adopt an accent that the journalist [[Brian Glanville]] called \"sergeant-major posh\".{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} A widely held perception that Ramsey's accent had become more upper-class during his time as England manager fuelled speculation that he had received [[elocution]] lessons, and prompted constant joking from members of the England team who came from similar Essex or East London backgrounds, such as Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} [[Rodney Marsh]], a forward from the East End who played in Ramsey's England team from 1971 to 1973, later said:\n<blockquote>\nAlf tended to speak in a very poncey plum-in-the-mouth way.

[[George Cohen]], one of the team's defenders, received Ramsey's medal on behalf of the former manager's family.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8093891.stm | title = World Cup 1966 winners honoured | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 10 June 2009 | accessdate = 22 August 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120327051226/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8093891.stm | archive-date = 27 March 2012 | url-status = live  }}</ref>|group=\"n\"|name=\"medal\"}}\n* [[UEFA European Championship]] third place: [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968]]\n* [[British Home Championship]]: [[1964\u201365 British Home Championship|1964\u201365]], [[1965\u201366 British Home Championship|1965\u201366]], [[1966\u201367 British Home Championship|1966\u201367]], [[1967\u201368 British Home Championship|1967\u201368]], [[1970\u201371 British Home Championship|1970\u201371]], [[1972-73 British Home Championship|1972\u201373]]\n\n=== Individual ===\n* [[English Football Hall of Fame]] Inductee: 2002<ref name=halloffame/>\n* [[Ipswich Town F.C.

was an English [[association football|football]] player and [[Manager (association football)|manager]]. As a player, he represented [[England national football team|the England national team]] and captained the side, but he is best known for his time as [[England national football team manager|England manager]] from 1963 to 1974, which included guiding them to victory in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]]. Knighted in 1967 in recognition of the World Cup win, Ramsey also managed his country to third place in the [[UEFA Euro 1968|1968 European Championship]] and the quarter-finals of the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1972|1972 European Championship]] respectively. As a player, Ramsey was a [[defender (association football)|defender]] and a member of England's [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] squad.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-Ernest-Ramsey|title=Sir Alfred Ernest Ramsey: British soccer player and manager |website=Britannica|date=24 April 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey was born and raised in a quiet [[Essex]] village. He showed sporting promise from an early age and, after serving in the British Army during the [[World War II|Second World War]], embarked on a football career, primarily as a [[right-back]]. He was considered a rather slow but accomplished player with a tremendous grasp of the tactical side of the game. Nicknamed \"The General\", he played for England 32 times between 1948 and 1953, captaining the side three times, scoring three times and appearing in the 1950 World Cup. He played his club football for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and was part of the Tottenham side that won the [[List of English football champions|English League championship]] in the [[1950\u201351 Football League|1950\u201351 season]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Asif |last=Burhan|url=https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/s/modest-beginnings-sir-alf-ramsey|title=The improbable success of Alf Ramsey|website=morningstaronline|date=22 January 2020|access-date=28 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nRamsey retired from playing aged 35 to become the manager of [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], then in the [[English football league system|third tier of English football]]. Ipswich rose through the divisions over the next six years, winning the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] in [[1956\u201357 Football League|1956\u201357]] and the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361]]. In the [[1961\u201362 Football League|1961\u201362 season]], Ipswich's first ever campaign in the top division, Ramsey's team defied expectations to become champions of England. Ramsey took charge of the England team a year later. In a distinct break with common practice of the day, he used a narrow formation that led to his England side being dubbed \"The Wingless Wonders\". England's World Cup victory at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1966 made Ramsey a national hero, though he had his critics, both at the time and since. He lost the England job acrimoniously, following the team's failure to qualify for the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 World Cup]].\n\nAfter managing England, Ramsey briefly held football-related roles at [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]], before retiring in 1979\u201380. He led a somewhat reclusive life in [[Ipswich]] over the next two decades and died in 1999, aged 79. A statue of Ramsey was dedicated at the reconstructed [[Wembley Stadium]] in 2009, and various honours have been afforded to him in Ipswich. He is the first person to have been inducted into the [[English Football Hall of Fame]] twice: an inaugural inductee in 2002, in recognition of his achievements as a manager and admitted again in 2010 for his achievements as a player. He remains widely regarded as one of British football's all-time great managers.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Dagenham===\n[[File:Dagenham village.jpg|thumb|The village green in [[Dagenham]], Ramsey's birthplace and childhood home (2007)]]\nAlfred Ernest Ramsey was born on 22 January 1920 at 6 Parrish Cottages, Halbutt Street in [[Dagenham]], which was then an [[agriculture|agrarian]] village in Essex, about {{convert|10|mi}} east of central London.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} He was the third of five children, four boys and a girl, born to Herbert Ramsey, a manual labourer who worked a [[smallholding]], kept pigs and drove a horse-drawn [[dustcart]], and his wife Florence (''n\u00e9e'' Bixby). Parrish Cottages lacked hot running water and electricity, and the only toilet was outside. Such conditions were typical of Dagenham during this period, although Ramsey's street gradually became something of an anachronism as he grew up. From 1921, [[London County Council]] transformed the area into the [[Becontree]] estate, a vast urban community that by 1934 was home to 120,000 people and the [[Ford Dagenham]] automobile factory. Parrish Cottages remained largely untouched: electricity was not installed until the 1950s, and even then only with the reluctant approval of Ramsey's mother, who, according to a neighbour, was frightened of it.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In the recollection of a childhood contemporary, Phil Cairns, the Ramsey house was \"little more than a wooden hut\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\nThe young Alf Ramsey was described by his friend Fred Tibble as \"a very quiet boy who really loved sport\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} In his 1952 autobiography ''Talking Football'', Ramsey described \"liv[ing] for the open air from the moment I could toddle\",{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=12}} spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a [[tennis ball]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to fourteen. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between each other on the way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played [[cricket]] to a high standard and represented the school in the [[high jump]], the [[long jump]], and both the [[100-yard dash|100-yard]] and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed [[boxing]] until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent\u2014\"as wide as I was tall\" in Ramsey's recollection\u2014gave him a severe beating in a school tournament.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, for the rest of his life.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}}\n\n\"He was very withdrawn, almost surly\", Cairns recalled, \"but he became animated on the football field\".{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} Ramsey was selected to play for Becontree Heath School when he was only seven years old, playing at [[Inside forward|inside-left]] alongside boys as old as fourteen; his nine-year-old brother Len was at inside-right. Alf's selection for the school team prompted the purchase of his first pair of football boots. Two years later, aged nine, he became captain of the school team. By this point he had switched to playing at [[Defender (association football)|centre-half]]\u2014the key position of the [[WM formation|\"WM\" formation]] then favoured in British football, between the full-backs and the forwards.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=1\u20138}} His main strength was generally perceived to be his extremely accurate passing; his chief shortcoming was a lack of pace, for which Ramsey compensated by learning to read the game and position himself well.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} Ramsey played for teams representing the schools of Dagenham and Essex County respectively, and trialled unsuccessfully for the London schools team while at Becontree.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=21\u201325}} While he was at school, his brother Albert took him to see his first [[English Football League|Football League]] match, watching their favourite team, [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]], play against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} This was the only senior match Alf would attend before playing in them himself.{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=26\u201328}} He later wrote that his main recollection of it was the performance of one of the Arsenal forwards, the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] international [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]].{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}}\n\nOn leaving school in 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey tried to get a job at the Ford plant, then told his family he intended to become a [[greengrocer]]. To that end he became an apprentice at a local branch of the [[Co-op Food|Co-op]], delivering groceries on a bicycle. The manual work helped to bulk up Ramsey's physique,{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=25\u201326}} but he found himself unable to play organised football because he had to work on Saturday afternoons. After a two-year hiatus, he returned to the game when he joined Five Elms, a newly formed amateur club whose matches on Thursdays fitted with his work schedule.{{sfn|Ramsey|1952|p=14}} About a year later, during the 1937\u201338 season, Ramsey was spotted by [[Ned Liddell]], a [[Scout (association football)|scout]] from [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]],{{sfn|Bowler|1999|pp=28\u201330}} then a well-established top-flight club.<ref name=\"rssf\">{{cite web|title=English Clubs Divisional Movements 1888\u20132005|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|publisher=[[RSSSF]]|accessdate=2 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805092856/http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engall.html|archive-date=5 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Liddell offered a contract as an amateur.

After three years in various seaside postings, Ramsey was, in 1943, moved to [[Barton Stacey]] in [[Hampshire]], where he came under the command of a Colonel Fletcher, himself an accomplished footballer. Ramsey's battalion team by this time featured players from a number of Football League clubs, including the [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] forward [[Len Townsend]] and Arsenal's [[Cyril Hodges]].{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=30\u201331}} Ramsey played at centre-half for his battalion team as [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] defeated them 10\u20133 at [[The Dell, Southampton|the Dell]] in a pre-season [[Exhibition game|friendly]] on 21 August 1943, and a week later played again as the battalion took on Southampton's [[reserve team]].

After his unit returned to the south coast at the start of the 1944\u201345 season, Ramsey played in a trial match at Southampton, and performed well enough that the club offered a professional contract on wages of \u00a32 per match.

The slump was partly because the players who had formed the spine of the championship-winning side were losing their fitness\u2014push-and-run required players of exceptional physical condition, and Ramsey, [[Ron Burgess (footballer)|Ron Burgess]], Nicholson, and others were all past 30.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=128\u2013129}} Ramsey was furthermore affected by a recurring abdominal injury.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=128\u2013129}} His preference for ball play rather than simply clearing it became unpopular among sections of Tottenham's support.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=128\u2013129}} A particularly low ebb came in the [[1952\u201353 FA Cup]] semi-final, against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] at [[Villa Park]] on 21 March 1953. Ramsey had played well, keeping the Blackpool left-winger [[Bill Perry (footballer)|Bill Perry]] quiet, and with only a minute to spare the game was finely balanced at 1\u20131.{{sfn|McKinstry|2010|pp=130\u2013132}} Ramsey then made a fatal error. Having easily beaten Perry to a cross-field pass from a free-kick, he set himself to slide the ball back to the goalkeeper Ditchburn in a situation when most defenders would have cleared it. The ball bounced off Ramsey's knee and ran away from him, allowing Blackpool forward [[Jackie Mudie]] to score.

As natural wingers were not always known for their defensive qualities, Ramsey started dropping them in favour of attacking midfielders who could also drop back into defensive roles. This system proved revolutionary as it often baffled opposing full-backs, who would naturally expect to see a winger coming down the flank at them once the ball was kicked off: instead, the attacking midfielders and strikers were taking the ball through the middle of the defence and scoring. This style of play proved successful at Ipswich, but really showed its worth when England travelled to Spain to play a friendly with them before the World Cup. As [[Bobby Charlton]] remarked, \"The Spanish full-backs were just looking at each other while we were going in droves through the middle\". To win in Spain, who were the reigning European Champions, was rare for an English team and was evidence that Ramsey's techniques were working.<ref name=\"Orejan2011\">{{cite book|author=Jaime Orejan|title=Football/Soccer: History and Tactics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0l2T7tLSiEC&pg=PA112|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8566-6|page=112| accessdate = 21 March 2019}}</ref>\n<!--\nA firm but fair manager, Ramsey was often regarded as difficult by the press. He ran a strict regime with his players and made sure that no-one felt that they enjoyed special status, star player or not. In May 1964, after a number of players failed to show up for a meeting in a hotel about a forthcoming tour, amongst them Bobby Moore, [[Jimmy Greaves]] and [[Bobby Charlton]], they eventually returned to their rooms to discover their passports left on their beds. His strict regime didn't suit everyone but the players with real talent and respect for the game responded well to them and had great respect for Ramsey. Very few of those who played for Ramsey spoke ill of him. In the preparations for the 1966 World Cup, Ramsey made sure that no player was confident of a place in the final 22, which resulted in players performing at their highest level. His decision to appoint a young Bobby Moore as captain also showed Ramsey's ability to see great potential in young players. Another one of his abilities was as a master tactician: a quality that he had first shown with his reading of the game as a player. When it came to tactics, Ramsey had revolutionary ideas.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}-->\n\nRamsey earned the respect of his players. He strongly supported [[Nobby Stiles]] when the FA leaned on Ramsey to drop Stiles from the 1966 World Cup quarter-final following a tackle on Frenchman [[Jacques Simon (footballer)|Jacques Simon]] in the previous game.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|pp=168\u2013170}}  After the final, at the banquet, with the players in one room and their wives forced to sit in an adjoining room, he excused his players early from the banquet to allow the players to join their wives after nearly four weeks apart.{{sfn|Lawton|2003|p=208}} In his manner with the players, he was \"usually equable\", but when his 1978 Birmingham City team produced a poor defensive display, \"he blew his top\"; the next game was a \"historic victory\".<ref name=\"BrumMail\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nRamsey was very sensitive about his personal background. He strove to mask his [[working-class]] Essex origins and to present himself as erudite and worldly, going so far as to adopt an accent that the journalist [[Brian Glanville]] called \"sergeant-major posh\".{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} A widely held perception that Ramsey's accent had become more upper-class during his time as England manager fuelled speculation that he had received [[elocution]] lessons, and prompted constant joking from members of the England team who came from similar Essex or East London backgrounds, such as Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves.{{sfn|Dickinson|2014|p=71}} [[Rodney Marsh]], a forward from the East End who played in Ramsey's England team from 1971 to 1973, later said:\n<blockquote>\nAlf tended to speak in a very poncey plum-in-the-mouth way.

Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

A series of disagreements between the Chief Justiciary of Arbroath, Alexander Lindsay, third Earl of Crawford and Bishop [[James Kennedy (bishop)|James Kennedy]] of St Andrews resulted in Lindsay sacking the bishop's lands and burning his properties. Lindsay was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] for his troubles and it was felt that this was incompatible with his role as Chief Justiciary. The monks of Arbroath Abbey selected Alexander Ogilvy of Inverquharity as his replacement and the insult led to pitched battle in the town, leaving 500 dead, including Lindsay and Ogilvy.

After the original harbours, dating from the 14th and 18th centuries, were replaced in 1839 with a larger harbour, the local council tried to find fishermen who would be interested in migrating to Arbroath in order to take advantage of the new facilities offered. The town council contacted fishermen in nearby [[Auchmithie]] and further afield, including [[Shetland]]. The fishing industry grew and at its peak years between 1900 and 1980, around 40 [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]] and [[pelagic]] vessels worked from Arbroath, with hundreds of men employed directly as [[fishermen]], hundreds more employed ashore to service the fishing vessels and to process the fish. Quota cuts and decommissioning took its toll on the fishing industry throughout Scotland from the 1980s to present. Today, Arbroath remains a designated whitefish landing port, and although no fish auction takes place, the fishmarket remains open and is used for landing shellfish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040606160402/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/output/2004/03/04/newsstory5681647t0.asp |url-status = dead|archive-date=6 June 2004 |title=Second boost as Arbroath harbour back on the map |accessdate=30 January 2007 |date=4 March 2004 |work=The Courier and Advertiser |publisher=D.C Thompson |df= }}</ref> There is now only one large fishing vessel operating regularly from Arbroath, and a further three Arbroath owned vessels operating from [[Aberdeen]] and ports further north.

Smokies are made from [[haddock]] using traditional methods dating back to the late 19th century where the fish are first salted overnight to preserve them, before being left tied in pairs to dry. Next, the dried fish are hung in a special barrel containing a hardwood fire and covered with a lid. After around an hour of smoking, the fish are golden brown and ready to eat.<ref name='defra1'>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |title=Arbroath Smokie PGI \n |accessdate=8 February 2009 \n |date=31 March 2004 \n |work=Protected Food Names \n |publisher=HM Government \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130959/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodrin/foodname/pfn/products/registered/arbsm.htm \n |archivedate=25 December 2008 \n |url-status = dead\n |df=dmy \n}} \n</ref> The preparation of smokies remains a [[cottage industry]] in Arbroath, centred almost exclusively at the harbour area.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel.

And it has 7 Sub-Parishes.\n\n= History =\nHistory states that in 1979 there were 14 Catholic families in [[Pragasapuram]]. Initially Pragasapuram was the Sub-Parish of the Sathankulam Parish. In 15-08-1880, Our Lady of Assumption Chapel was opened by Fr.Denish Kushan. The first Car Procession of Our Lady of Assumption was held on 15-08-1895. At that time there was 3 Chapparam. Devotees carry it on their shoulders. In 1907, [[Arthur Margoschis]] (Father of Nazareth) presented the Holy Cross of Jesus Christ that he kept in his Prayer hall,\u00a0 to the Our Lady of Assumption Church, Pragasapuram. \n\nIn 1909, Pragasapuram became an independent Parish. Sub-Parishes separated from the [[Sathankulam]] and [[Punnaikayal]] Parishes were merged with the Pragasapuram Parish. The foundation stone for New Church was laid in 1913 by Fr.T.Michael. After the completion of the New Church foundation work, the Church building work was stopped. Thus the Holy Mass was conducted in the Old Our Lady of Assumption Chapel. Many years later the New Church was built and the New Church was opened by Bishop.Rev.Fr.Thomas on 21-11-1967.As the days went by, In 1975 during Fr.Cruz Mariyan period, Chapparam was replaced by Chariot.

He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]].

Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?

Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|2000|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office. When he declared to the House of Commons in November 1993 that \"to sit down and talk with [[Gerry Adams|Mr Adams]] and the Provisional IRA&nbsp;... would turn my stomach\",<ref>{{cite Hansard|title=European Council (Special Meeting)|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199293/cmhansrd/1993-11-01/Debate-2.html|date=1 November 1993|column=34|house=House of Commons}}</ref> [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] gave the media an outline of the secret talks indeed held regularly since that February. The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|2000|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|2000}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on: they argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown.

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that [[Tony Blair]]'s legacy appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]]. In 1999, a BBC Radio 4 poll [[Historical rankings of prime ministers of the United Kingdom|ranked him 17th of 19]] among 20th-century British prime ministers;<ref>{{cite news|title=Churchill 'greatest

difficult one, with his mother suffering from [[pleurisy]] and [[pneumonia]] and John Major requiring several blood transfusions due to an infection, causing permanent scarring to his ankles.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=9}} The Major family (John, his parents, and his two older sibling [[Terry Major|Terry]] and Pat){{refn|group=nb|John also had two other half-siblings from his father's affairs which he was not to learn of until much later.<ref>Major, 2000, pgs. 4,6</ref>}} lived at 260 Longfellow Road, [[Worcester Park]], Surrey, a middle-class area where Major's father ran a garden ornaments business and his mother worked in a local library and as a part-time dance teacher.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}} John Major later described the family's circumstances at this time as being \"comfortable but not well off.\"{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=8}} Following a German [[V-1 flying bomb]] attack in the area in 1943 which killed several people, the Majors moved to the village of [[Saham Toney]], [[Norfolk]] for the duration of the [[Second World War|war]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=8}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=9}}\n\nJohn began attending primary school at Cheam Common School from 1948.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=10}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=11}} His childhood was generally happy, and he enjoyed reading, sports (especially [[cricket]] and [[association football|football]]) and keeping pets, such as his rabbits.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=10-12}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=11, 15}} In 1954 John passed the [[11+]] exam, enabling him to go to [[Rutlish School]], a [[grammar school]] in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], though to John's chagrin his father insisted that he register as 'John Major-Ball'.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=14}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=12-13}} The family's fortunes took a turn for the worse, with his father's health deteriorating,{{refn|group=nb|Tom Major had planned to move the family to Canada in his retirement, but his immigration application was rejected due to his failing eyesight.<ref>Major, 2000, pg.15</ref>}} and the business in severe financial difficulties.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=15}} A recalled business loan which the family were unable to repay forced Tom Major to sell the house in Worcester Park in May 1955, with the family moving to a cramped, rented top-floor flat at 144 [[Coldharbour Lane]], [[Brixton]].{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=13}}{{sfn|Major|2000|p=16-17}}{{refn|group=nb|Major was later to learn that the flat was in fact owned by his half-brother Tom Moss.<ref>Major, 200, pgs. 17-8</ref>}} With his parents distracted by their reduced circumstances, John Major's difficulties at Rutlish went unnoticed; acutely conscious of his straitened circumstances vis-\u00e0-vis the other pupils, Major was something of a loner and consistently under-performed (except in sports), coming to see the school as \"a penance to be endured.\"{{sfn|Major|2000|p=20-1}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=13,16}} Major left school just before his 16th birthday in 1959 with just three [[General Certificate of Education|O-level]] passes in History, English Language and English Literature, to his parents disappointment.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=25}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=14}}{{refn|group=nb|In the 1999 BBC documentary ''The Major Years'', Major can be seen getting visibly upset when recalling this

avidly kept up with current affairs by reading newspapers on his long commutes from Brixton to Wimbledon.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=19}} In 1956 Major met local MP [[Marcus Lipton]] at a local church fair and was invited to watch his first debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], where [[Harold Macmillan]] presented his only Budget as [[Chancellor of the

==\nMajor's first job was as a clerk in the London-based insurance brokerage firm [[Alexander Forbes Group Holdings|Price Forbes]] in 1959, though finding the job dull and offering no prospects he  quit.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=26-27}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=16}} Major began working with his brother Terry at the garden ornaments business; this had been sold in 1959, enabling the family to move to a larger

business the following year to care for his ill mother, though when she got better he was unable to find a new job and was unemployed for much of the latter half of 1962, a situation he says was \"degrading.\"{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} After Major became Prime Minister, it was misreported that his failure to get a job as a bus conductor resulted from his failing to pass a maths test; he had in fact passed all of the necessary tests but had been passed over owing to his height.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} In the meantime he studied for a qualification in Banking via

Electricity Board]] (LEB) in [[Elephant and Castle]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=30}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}}\n\nIn 1959 Major had joined the [[Young Conservatives (UK)|Young Conservatives]] in Brixton and soon became a highly active member, which helped increase his confidence following the failure of his school days.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=28}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=19}} Encouraged by fellow Conservative Derek Stone, he started giving speeches on a [[soapbox|soap-box]] in [[Brixton Market]].{{sfn|Major|2000|p=28-29}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=18}} According to his biographer [[Anthony Seldon]], Major brought \"youthful exuberance\" to the Tories in Brixton, but was sometimes in trouble with the professional agent Marion Standing.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=19}} Major stood as a Councillor in the [[1964 Lambeth London Borough Council election]] for [[Larkhall (ward)|Larkhall ward]] at the age of 21 in 1964, losing to Labour.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=31}}{{sfn|Seldon|1998|p=21}} He also assisted local Conservative

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?

On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%.

By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|2000|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|2000|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|2000}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n== Final years in Parliament (1997\u20132001) ==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on: they argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} \n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway.

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.
