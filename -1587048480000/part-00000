David and J. Sopko, receiving a one-year scholarship (1995) at the [[San Francisco Art Institute]], and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 2000.\n\nShe made her first big splash in the art world in 1998 with ''Castle in the Sky'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furtherfield.org/vdrahotova/light/installation.html# |title=Veronika Drahotova - Installation |publisher=Furtherfield.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-03}}</ref> a large-scale light installation funded by the  Soros Foundation. In it, the famous Prague Castle was completely illuminated in a rainbow glow for several nights, and it\u2019s still considered one of the largest public art displays to take place in the Czech Republic.\n\nThe rainbow symbolism from \"Castle in the Sky\" was naturally incorporated into Drahotova\u2019s ever-growing iconographic vocabulary. This highly visualized language of symbols appears persistently throughout her work across all mediums, encouraging a sense of interconnectedness within and between each. The evolution of that iconography can clearly be seen in her early portrait work, which includes the postmodern series \u201cBad Boys\u201d (1997-2004), and plays out prominently in her constructed objects and installations, such as FF (for S. H.; 2004) and POP (Preliminary Orientation in the Problem; 1999).\n\nHer work was most recently featured in Vienna for Art\u2019s Sake (Feb. 2015),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noever-design.com/vienna-for-arts-sake-archive-austria.html |title=Veronika Drahotova - Vienna for Art's Sake | publisher=noever-design.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-01}}</ref> a group show with contributions from more than 100 visual artists, including Christo, Frank Gheary and Zaha Hadid, which will tour Europe and the U.S. as the \u201cLuciano Benetton Collection 10 x 12.\u201d\n\nHer most recent series\u2019 have focused more on painting, specifically large-scale canvases filled with geometric objects that merge with and collide into 3-D relief elements, an implicit commentary on the tension between philosophy and psychology, spiritualism and mathematics. Furthermore, Drahotova has created a new system of painting she refers to as \u2018architectonic.\u2019 This approach utilizes two or more canvases in a single painting, allowing the pieces to be arranged in several predetermined ways to reveal different compositions. By orientating or interchanging the canvases both horizontally and vertically, and rotating them 90 degrees in relation to each other, several compositions emerge. In this way, the canvases of the recent series \u201cMassive Memory\u201d (2015) can be arranged together on the wall in various interchangeable configurations, like interactive panels in a constantly shifting landscape.\n\nIn 2002 Drahotova founded HOME Gallery in Prague, and as director curated more than a dozen exhibitions over two years featuring artists from all over Europe.<ref>[https://www.think.cz/english/art-and-design/home-gallery-prague The Prague Post, archived on Think Magazine], Jan. 2003, by Lizzy Le Quesne</ref>\n\nShe has had more than ten solo shows in the U.S., Japan, and across Europe, and participated in dozens of group shows.

His younger brothers include the advocate [[Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby]] and [[Robert Abercromby of Airthrey|General Robert Abercromby]].<ref name=\"CBD\">[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45|title=Abercromby, Sir Ralph, of Tullibody (1734\u20131801), army officer.|last=Gates|first=David|date=4 October 2007|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby's education was begun by a private tutor, then continued at the school of Mr Moir in [[Alloa]], then considered one of the best in Scotland despite its Jacobite leanings. Ralph attended [[Rugby School]] from 12 June 1748, where he remained until he was 18. Between 1752 and 1753, he was a student at the [[University of Edinburgh]].

He served with his regiment in the [[Seven Years' War]], and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abercromby, Sir Ralph|volume=1|page=44}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment (1773) and [[brevet (military)|brevet]] colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised [[103rd Regiment of Foot (King's Irish Infantry)|King's Irish infantry]].

He was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].\n\nIn July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] to lead an expedition to the West Indies.

He was also made [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight]], [[Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus]] in the Scottish Highlands, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He again entered Parliament as member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798. From 1797 to 1798, he was Commander-in-Chief of the forces in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTo quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{quote|\"There he laboured to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|the rising rebellion]], and to protect the people from military oppression, with the care worthy of a great general and an enlightened and beneficent statesman. When he was appointed to the command in Ireland, an invasion of that country by the French was confidently anticipated by the British government. He used his utmost efforts to restore the discipline of an army that was utterly disorganized; and, as a first step, he anxiously endeavoured to protect the people by re-establishing the supremacy of the civil power, and not allowing the military to be called out, except when it was indispensably necessary for the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of order.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFinding that (he) received no adequate support from the head of the Irish government, and that all his efforts were opposed and thwarted by those who presided in the councils of Ireland, he resigned the command. His departure from Ireland was deeply lamented by the reflecting portion of the people, and was speedily followed by those disastrous results which he had anticipated, and which he so ardently desired and had so wisely endeavoured to prevent.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>}}\n\nAfter holding for a short period the office of [[commander-in-chief in Scotland]], Abercromby, when the enterprise against the Dutch [[Batavian Republic]] was resolved upon in 1799, was again called to command under the Duke of York. The [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799 ended in disaster, but friend and foe alike confessed that the most decisive victory could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover [[Battle of Alexandria|Egypt from France]]. His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties. The debarkation of the troops at [[Abukir]], in the face of strenuous opposition, is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie by Sir Robert Ker Porter (detail).jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie'' by Sir Robert Ker Porter.

March 1801) was a Scottish soldier and politician. He twice served as MP for [[Clackmannanshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire]], rose to the rank of [[lieutenant-general]] in the [[British Army]], was appointed [[Governor of Trinidad]], served as [[Commander-in-Chief, Ireland]], and was noted for his services during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].\n\n==Early life==\nRalph Abercromby was born on 7 October 1734 at [[Menstrie Castle]], [[Clackmannanshire]]. He was the second (but eldest surviving) son of George Abercromby, a lawyer and descendant of the Abercromby family of Birkenbog, Aberdeenshire and Mary Dundas (d. 1767), daughter of Ralph Dundas of Manour, [[Perthshire]]. His younger brothers include the advocate [[Alexander Abercromby, Lord Abercromby]] and [[Robert Abercromby of Airthrey|General Robert Abercromby]].<ref name=\"CBD\">[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], {{ISBN|0-550-18022-2}}, page 4</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45|title=Abercromby, Sir Ralph, of Tullibody (1734\u20131801), army officer.|last=Gates|first=David|date=4 October 2007|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby's education was begun by a private tutor, then continued at the school of Mr Moir in [[Alloa]], then considered one of the best in Scotland despite its Jacobite leanings. Ralph attended [[Rugby School]] from 12 June 1748, where he remained until he was 18. Between 1752 and 1753, he was a student at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. There he studied moral and natural philosophy and civil law, and was regarded by his professors as sound rather than brilliant.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abercromby|first1=James|title=Lieutenant-General Sir Ralph Abercromby, K.

Published 1888.</ref>\n\n==Career==\nOn returning from the continent, Abercromby expressed a strong preference for the military profession, and a [[Cornet (military rank)|cornet]]'s commission was accordingly obtained for him (March 1756) in the [[3rd Dragoon Guards]]. He served with his regiment in the [[Seven Years' War]], and thus, the opportunity afforded him of studying the methods of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], which moulded his military character and formed his tactical ideas.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Abercromby, Sir Ralph|volume=1|page=44}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby rose through the intermediate grades to the rank of lieutenant-colonel of the regiment (1773) and [[brevet (military)|brevet]] colonel in 1780, and in 1781, he became colonel of the newly raised [[103rd Regiment of Foot (King's Irish Infantry)|King's Irish infantry]]. When that regiment was disbanded in 1783, he retired on [[half pay]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He also entered Parliament as MP for [[Clackmannanshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Clackmannanshire]] (1774\u20131780).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1754-1790/member/abercromby-ralph-1734-1801|title= Abercromby, Ralph (1734\u20131801), of Tullibody, Clackmannan.|publisher= History of Parliament Online|accessdate= 14 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nAbercromby was a strong supporter of the American cause in the [[American Revolutionary War]], and remained in Ireland to avoid having to fight against the colonists.<ref>David Andress, ''The Savage Storm: Britain on me Brink in the Age of Napoleon'' (2012) p 61</ref>\n\nWhen France declared war against Great Britain in 1793, Abercromby resumed his duties. He was appointed command of a brigade under the [[Prince Frederick, 1st Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] for service in the [[Netherlands]], where he commanded the advanced guard in the action at [[Le Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis|Le Cateau]]. During the 1794 withdrawal to Holland, he commanded the allied forces in the action at [[Battle of Boxtel|Boxtel]] and was wounded directing operations at Fort St Andries on the [[Waal (river)|Waal]].\n\nIn July 1795, Abercromby was nominated by Secretary of State for War [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville|Henry Dundas]] to lead an expedition to the West Indies. That same month he had been made a [[order of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]] and in August Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Wight - a reward for his services but also possibly an incentive to lead the army in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"EB1911\" /> The appointment of Abercromby as Commander-in-Chief of the Leeward and Windward Islands was officially announced on 5 August.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Divall|first=Carole|title=General Sir Ralph Abercromby and the French Revolutionary Wars 1792-1801|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2019|isbn=978-1526741462|location=Barnsley|pages=72-73}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 March 1796 Abercromby arrived in [[Carlisle Bay, Barbados]] on the ''[[HMS Arethusa (1781)|Arethusa]].''<ref>Divall (2019). pp 84-85.</ref> A third of the 6,000 troops that had arrived on the island before him had already been sent on to [[Saint Vincent (Antilles)|Saint Vincent]] and [[Grenada]], leaving the general with 3,700 soldiers at his disposal.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Martin R.|title=Death Before Glory: The British Soldier in the West Indies in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars 1793-1815|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|year=2015|isbn=9781781593417|location=Barnsley|pages=94}}</ref> Control of much of Saint Vincent been lost to rebelling French planters and native Caribs since early 1795, while Grenada was in the midst of an [[F\u00e9don's rebellion|insurrection led by Julien F\u00e9don]].

The island had been retaken at the cost of 566 men.

He was also made [[Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Wight]], [[Governor of Fort George and Fort Augustus]] in the Scottish Highlands, and promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-general. He again entered Parliament as member for Clackmannanshire from 1796 to 1798. From 1797 to 1798, he was Commander-in-Chief of the forces in [[Ireland]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nTo quote the biographic entry in the 1888 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, {{quote|\"There he laboured to maintain the discipline of the army, to suppress [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|the rising rebellion]], and to protect the people from military oppression, with the care worthy of a great general and an enlightened and beneficent statesman. When he was appointed to the command in Ireland, an invasion of that country by the French was confidently anticipated by the British government. He used his utmost efforts to restore the discipline of an army that was utterly disorganized; and, as a first step, he anxiously endeavoured to protect the people by re-establishing the supremacy of the civil power, and not allowing the military to be called out, except when it was indispensably necessary for the enforcement of the law and the maintenance of order.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nFinding that (he) received no adequate support from the head of the Irish government, and that all his efforts were opposed and thwarted by those who presided in the councils of Ireland, he resigned the command. His departure from Ireland was deeply lamented by the reflecting portion of the people, and was speedily followed by those disastrous results which he had anticipated, and which he so ardently desired and had so wisely endeavoured to prevent.\"<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>}}\n\nAfter holding for a short period the office of [[commander-in-chief in Scotland]], Abercromby, when the enterprise against the Dutch [[Batavian Republic]] was resolved upon in 1799, was again called to command under the Duke of York. The [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799 ended in disaster, but friend and foe alike confessed that the most decisive victory could not have more conspicuously proved the talents of this distinguished officer.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1801, Abercromby was sent with an army to recover [[Battle of Alexandria|Egypt from France]]. His experience in the Netherlands and the West Indies particularly fitted him for this new command, as was proved when he carried his army in health, in spirits, and with the requisite supplies to the destined scene of action despite great difficulties. The debarkation of the troops at [[Abukir]], in the face of strenuous opposition, is justly ranked among the most daring and brilliant exploits of the British army.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie by Sir Robert Ker Porter (detail).jpg|thumb|left|180px|''Death of Gen Sir Ralph Abercrombie'' by Sir Robert Ker Porter.

During the action he was struck by a musket-ball in the thigh; but not until the battle was won and he saw the enemy retreating did he show any sign of pain. He was borne from the field in a hammock, cheered by the blessings of the soldiers as he passed, and conveyed on board the flag-ship [[HMS Foudroyant (1798)|HMS ''Foudroyant'']] which was moored in the harbour.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team were  an amateur outfit who first played here in 1861.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area. Although the Football Association disliked the idea of the owners of the Cup Final venue also possessing their own football team and initially rejected their proposal, a separate company was established to form and own the club.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed \"The Glaziers\", were founded on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]] | accessdate=14 October 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606051751/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | archive-date=6 June 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[English Football League|Football League]] alongside another newly formed London club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace then moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, which is the ground the club still plays at today.<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15\u201319</ref>\n\nThe opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], with Palace losing 0\u20131 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founding member of the [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992\u201393.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39\u201348</ref>\n\n[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994\u201395.]]\nThe club sold [[Mark Bright]] to Sheffield Wednesday, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled for consistency throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for the highest number of points for a relegated club. Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over.\n\n===The yo-yo years (1993\u201398)===\nAlan Smith's first season as manager saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion back to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful.

They currently compete in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of [[English football league system|English football]]. The club play their home matches at [[Selhurst Park]].  \n\nThe historic origins of the club can be traced as far back as 1854, when the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] which included the [[Crystal Palace Park|Crystal Palace Park]] that surrounded the site where various sports facilities were built. It was here that the earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team first played as an amateur outfit in 1861. They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]]. In 1895, the Crystal Palace Company who owned the Palace building began hosting the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] inside its grounds. It was ten years later that the owners decided to form a new professional Palace club to play at the Cup Final venue. They stayed here until 1915, when the club were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at Selhurst Park.\n\nPalace joined the [[Football League]] in 1920, and have overall spent the majority of their league history competing in the top two tiers of English football. Since 1964, they have only dropped below the second tier once, for three seasons between 1974 and 1977. The club's highest ever league finish to date is third place in the old [[Football League First Division|First Division]], now known as the Premier League, achieved in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season. Palace were denied a place in Europe at the end of that season only because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club became one of the original founding members of the Premier League. Palace set two unwanted Premier League records for relegation, in [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393]] they were relegated on 49 points, which is still a record number of points for a relegated Premier League club and are the only club ever to be relegated from the Premier League when finishing fourth from bottom in [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]], as it had been decided that the league would be reduced from 22 to 20 clubs for the following season. Palace have also been FA Cup finalists twice, losing to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on both occasions in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]]. \n      \nThe club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours were originally claret and blue, but in 1973 they decided to change to the red and blue vertical stripes now worn today. Palace have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]] and also share rivalries with fellow [[South London derby|South London]] clubs [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}\n\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|left|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\n===Historic origins: The Exhibition Palace and playing at the FA Cup Final venue (1854\u20131920)===\nIn 1854, the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]] had been relocated from [[Hyde Park, London]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]].

The original [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team were  an amateur outfit who first played here in 1861.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]], reaching the semi-finals where they lost to the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the [[Football Association]] found a new permanent venue for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] at the sports stadium situated inside the historic Palace grounds. Some years later the owners, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own professional football team to play at the stadium. The owners wanted a club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.

This achievement meant they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to win a championship in their first season as a league club.

Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s. After the war, Palace were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]].\n\n===The Sixties: Historic Real Madrid visit and promotion to the top flight (1958\u201373)===\n[[File:Di stefano real madrid cf (cropped).png|thumb|left|[[Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano]], who played for Real Madrid against Palace in 1962.  The ''Croydon Advertiser'' reported that his \"move that led to Madrid's fourth goal was conducted with effortless ease at walking pace.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=John|title=Nearly 25, 000 See Real Dazzle, But Palace Fight Back|newspaper=Croydon Advertiser|date=20 April 1962|page=24}}</ref> ]]\nThe club remained in Division Three South until [[1957\u201358 in English football|1957\u201358]] when the league was restructured which saw clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth \u2013 just below the cut \u2013 and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay was only brief. Palace chairman [[Arthur Wait]] appointed the ex-[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960, and his exciting style of football was a joy to watch for the Palace fans. The [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season saw Palace gain promotion and they also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in an historic friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had ever played a match in London and was only two weeks before they were due to play [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1962 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. A full strength Madrid team beat Palace 4\u20133. Although Rowe resigned due to health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963\u201364 in English football|1963\u201364]] and [[1968\u201369 in English football|1968\u201369]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19\u201320, 32\u20137</ref>\n\nPalace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, and achieved some memorable results, arguably the best was a 5\u20130 home win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1972\u201373 in English football|1972\u201373]] season. Arthur Wait stepped down as chairman during that season and was replaced by Raymond Bloye who appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as manager in March 1973, with Bert Head moving upstairs to become general manager. Unfortunately the managerial change came too late to save the club from relegation back to the Second Division.\n\n===Bouncing between the divisions (1973\u201384)===\nAfter the disappointment of relegation, worse was to follow for the club. Under the management of Allison, Palace were immediately relegated again finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]]. It was also under Allison that the club changed its nickname from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\", and ended its association with claret and blue [[Kit (association football)|kit]] colours by deciding to change to the red and blue vertical stripes worn today. Palace enjoyed a run to the semi-finals of the [[1975\u201376 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and Chelsea along the way. Allison resigned at the end of the 1975\u201376 campaign after failing to get the club out of the third tier, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted back to the top flight with successive promotions in [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]] and [[1978\u201379 in English football|1978\u201379]]; the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions.\n\nThat team from 1979 was dubbed \"The Team of the Eighties\", and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] season. However financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break-up of that talented group of players, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain its position in the top flight. Palace were relegated from the First Division in [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]]' takeover of the club. They struggled back in the second tier, and Noades even appointed the ex-[[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]] manager [[Alan Mullery]], which was very unpopular with the Palace fans.\n\n===Steve Coppell years: FA Cup finalists and League title challengers (1984\u201393)===\nOn 4 June 1984, former Manchester United and [[England national football team|England]] player [[Steve Coppell]] who had recently retired from the game due to injury was appointed as manager, and it was under his stewardship and rebuilding that the club achieved promotion via the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1988\u201389]]. Palace followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3\u20133 with Manchester United after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the first match but losing the replay 0\u20131. The club were able to build on this success and the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season saw them achieve their highest ever league finish of third place in the top flight. Palace were to be denied a European place at the end of that season because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club also returned to Wembley and won the [[Full Members Cup]]. Palace beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4\u20131 after extra-time in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]].<ref name=\"Business: Club History\"/> During the following season star striker [[Ian Wright]] left the club to join [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]].

In her first three months in office, she faced strikes by labor unions as the city's transit workers, public school teachers and firefighters all went on strike. She effectively banned handgun possession for guns unregistered or purchased after the enactment of an ordinance instituting a two-year re-registration program. Byrne used special events, such as [[ChicagoFest]], to revitalize Navy Pier and the downtown Chicago Theatre. Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party endorsed Senator [[Edward Kennedy]] for president in 1980, but incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]] won the Illinois Democratic Primary and even carried Cook County and the city of Chicago. Simultaneously, Byrne and the Cook County Democratic Party's candidate for Cook County State's Attorney (chief local prosecutor), 14th Ward Alderman [[Edward M. Burke]], lost in the Democratic primary to [[Richard M. Daley]], the son of her late mentor; Daley then unseated GOP incumbent Bernard Carey in the general election.\nOther events in her mayoralty include [[Pope John Paul II]]'s debut papal visit that October and the finding of Soviet [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] escapee Walter Polovchak the following year\u20141980\u2014and his announcement of his desire to stay in America permanently and not go back to the USSR with his parents.\n\nOn November 11, 1981, [[Dan Goodwin]], who had successfully climbed the [[Sears Tower]] the previous spring, battled for his life on the side of the [[John Hancock Center]]. William Blair, Chicago's fire commissioner, had ordered the [[Chicago Fire Department]] to stop Goodwin by directing a full-power fire hose at him and by using fire axes to break window glass in Goodwin's path.
