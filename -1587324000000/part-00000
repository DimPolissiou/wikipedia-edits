Later, the species was placed together with most European newts in the genus ''[[Triturus]]''. This genus however was found to be [[polyphyletic]],{{r|TitusLarson1995|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} and the small-bodied newts, including the smooth newt, were split off as separate genus ''[[Lissotriton]]'' in 2004.{{r|Garcia-Paris2004|p=233}} This genus name had first been introduced by the English zoologist [[Thomas Bell (zoologist)|Thomas Bell]] in 1839, and the smooth newt is the genus' [[type species]].{{r|Bell1839|p=132}}\n\nOther English names that have been used in the literature for the smooth newt include: common newt, great water-newt, common water-newt, warty eft, water eft, common smooth newt, small newt, small eft, small evet, and brown eft.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\nThree subspecies are currently accepted: ''L. v. vulgaris'', ''L. v. ampelensis'' and ''L. v. meridionalis''. Four former subspecies from southern Europe and west Asia are now recognised as separate species, as studies have found them to be genetically separated: the [[Greek smooth newt]] (''L. graecus''), [[Kosswig's smooth newt]] (''L. kosswigi''), the [[Caucasian smooth newt]] (''L. lantzi'') and [[Schmidtler\u2019s smooth newt]] (''L. schmidtleri''). To distinguish the smooth newt from these related species, the English name \"northern smooth newt\" has been suggested. The five smooth newt species and the [[Carpathian newt]] (''L. montadoni''), which is their [[sister species]], have been referred to as the \"smooth newt [[species complex]].{{r|Frost2020|PabijanZielinski2017|WielstraCanestrelli2018}}\n\n==Description==\nOutside the breeding season, male and female smooth newts are hard to distinguish \u2013 both sexes are of similar size (roughly {{cvt|10|cm}} head-to-tail length), and a similar pale brown to yellow colouration. Their main visible differences are two \u2013 the male newt has a single black line running down the centre of the spine, the female has two parallel lines on either side of the centre. On closer inspection, the male's [[cloaca]] is very distended, whilst the female's is nearly invisible.\n\nDuring the breeding season, the male becomes darker than the female, and develops a tall, wavy, translucent crest along the spine and tail, with dark spots covering the rest of the body, including the belly, which becomes a far more vivid pink or orange colour than it is in winter and autumn. The female also develops spots, but not on the belly, which is paler than those of the males, and they are generally smaller. The female does not develop a crest. Smooth newts have paddle-like tails for increased swimming speeds.{{r|amphibiaweb}}\n\nThe nominal subspecies, ''L. v. vulgaris'', is found in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].\n\nFemales and nonbreeding males are pale brown or olive green, often with two darker stripes on the back. Both sexes have orange bellies, although paler in females, which is covered in rounded black spots. They also have pale throats with conspicuous spots. This helps to distinguish them from [[palmate newt]]s that have pale unspotted throats, and with which they are often confused. When on land, they have velvety skin. During the breeding season, male smooth newts develop a continuous wavy (rather than jagged) crest that runs from their heads to their tails, and their spotted markings become more apparent. They are also distinguishable from females by their fringed toes.{{r|1=herpconstrust|2=Beebee2000|p2=26}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe smooth newt occurs in western Asia and most of Europe. It is not present in southern France, in southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula, and is also not found on many Mediterranean islands. It is typically a lowland species, ranging up to about {{convert|1000|m}} but reaches {{convert|2150|m}} in Austria. It is found in damp meadows, field edges, parks, gardens, woods and stone piles.{{r|Collins|p=46-47}}\n\nWhile the smooth newt occurs almost exclusively in the northern hemisphere, scientists have recently documented the first instance of a newt species establishing in the wild in Australia, and the first invasive population of this species in the southern hemisphere.{{r|Tingley2014}} See \"An invasive species in Australia\" (below) for more information.\n\n==Life cycle==\nAdult smooth newts emerge from [[hibernation]] on land from late February to May, and head towards fresh water to breed. They favour ponds and shallow lakesides over running water. At this time, both sexes become more strikingly and colourfully marked, with vivid spots and orange bellies. The male also develops a wavy crest along the back and tail \u2013 the sexes are clearly different during the breeding season.\n\nDuring courtship, the male newt [[courtship display|display]]s for his prospective mate by vibrating his tail in front of her in a distinctive fashion. The male then deposits a sperm-containing capsule, a [[spermatophore]], in front of his mate, who manoeuvres herself into a position where she can pick up the capsule with her [[cloaca]] \u2013 fertilisation then occurring inside the female. Thus fertilised, after a few days the female starts to lay eggs.  These are placed individually, usually under aquatic plant leaves at a rate of 7 to 12 eggs per day. Altogether, a total of 400 eggs may be produced over the season.\n\nAfter two to three weeks (depending on water temperature), the eggs hatch to a [[larva]]l form \u2013 a [[tadpole]] or eft. For a few days, the larvae live off the food reserves contained within their yolk sacs (left over from the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] stage). After this, they start to eat freshwater [[plankton]], and later insect larvae, molluscs, and similar foods (unlike frog and toad tadpoles, newts are carnivorous throughout their lives).  \n<gallery mode=packed>\nTriturusVulgarisLarva.JPG|A well-advanced larval newt, with feathery gills\nSmooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) nymph.jpg|Nymph\n</gallery>\n\nThe newt larvae initially look like small fish fry, but later they become similar to miniature adults, but with \"feathery\" external gills emerging from behind the head on either side. As the tadpoles mature, they develop legs (front first), and the growth and use of their lungs is matched by a gradual shrinkage of the gills. Thus, the larva gradually shifts from being fully aquatic to possessing a body suitable for a mostly [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] existence, the young newt typically leaving the water after 10 weeks.  However, some may overwinter in the larval state, only emerging from the water the following year.{{r|mjking}} Smooth newts take around three years to become sexually mature, on average living for six years. Most adult and juvenile newts hibernate over winter in moist, sheltered areas above ground, emerging in the spring.\n\n==Mate selection==\n\nFemale mate choice is an important concept in evolutionary biology because it bears on female and male reproductive success.  Experiments were carried out with ''Lissotriton vulgaris'' in which female newts were paired sequentially with two males having different degrees of genetic relatedness to the female.  It was found that the more genetically dissimilar male had a higher paternity share than the more related male.{{r|Jehle2007}} Female choice may reflect an avoidance of inbreeding with related males that could lead to less fit progeny ([[inbreeding depression]]).\n\n==An invasive species in Australia==\nThe newt was first detected in Melbourne, Australia, in 2011. Four additional sites were found in and around Melbourne in 2012, and another two sites were identified in 2013.{{r|Tingley2014}} In 2016, the newt was found at another new site, and at least one previous site.{{r|ParkWatch2016}} Although the full extent of establishment is not known, some of the sites where newts have been detected are quite far apart \u2013 up to {{convert|5|km|spell=in}} from the original incursion, so scientists suspect that the species has spread considerably.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nThe smooth newt was available in the pet trade for decades before it was declared a \"controlled pest animal\" in Victoria in 1997, and prohibited Australia-wide in 2010. Therefore, this invasion is likely to have originated from the release or escape of captive animals.{{r|VicSmooth}}\n\n===Spread===\nResearchers cannot yet say how widely the species will spread because this is the first newt species found in the wild in Australia. However, smooth newts are prolific breeders and can survive in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Based on where they live in Europe \u2013 fields, woodlands, and a range of disturbed habitats, scientists suspect that they're capable of surviving in many areas of southern Australia. Furthermore, the climate of south-eastern Australia resembles the species' native range, and climate matching suggests that large parts of NSW, Victoria, eastern Tasmania, southern South Australia, and south-western Western Australia are suitable for newt habitation.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\n===Impacts===\nDue to the unique nature of this invasion in the southern hemisphere, it is difficult to predict likely impacts. However, scientists such as Tingley et al. (2014) note that on average, exotic species with only distant relatives in their invaded ranges tend to have greater impacts because the native species probably lack co-evolved defences against them.{{r|Tingley2014}} Potential impacts arise from predation and competition, toxicity, and disease spread.{{r|VicSmooth}}\n\nSmooth newts are generalist carnivores with a broad diet including invertebrates, crustaceans, and the eggs and hatchlings of frogs and fish. Therefore, they are likely to prey on and compete for food with a wide range of Australian terrestrial and freshwater species{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nThere is also a risk that smooth newts could poison their predators, like cane toads do. Any native animal that ingests the potentially deadly skin secretions produced by the newt could be affected, including wading birds, snakes, lizards, turtles, fish and mammals.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nSmooth newts are also potential transmitters of chytrid fungus, because a close relative of the newt carries this disease. Chytrid fungus has decimated frog populations worldwide, and caused extinctions and widespread declines in Australian frogs.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\n===Biosecurity===\nGovernment authorities decided not to attempt to eradicate the newt nearly two years after it was first detected in Australia. It has been suggested that high levels of uncertainty about the likely spread and impact of smooth newts in Australia contributed to the decision not to act.{{r|InvCouncil2014}} However, experts contend that the decision-making process was too slow and failed to take the [[precautionary principle]] into account. They claim that high levels of uncertainty should favour a quick decision to act, because by the time the impacts of the newt become apparent it will be too late to eradicate.{{r|Mrkaja|Tingley2014|InvCouncil2014}} Scientists are now calling on government authorities to revisit this decision before eradication is too difficult and costly to consider.{{r|Lovett2017|ParkWatch2016|Bailey2017|InvCouncil2014}}\n\n==Conservation status in Europe==\n[[File:Wooden Animal Trail Camouflaged Smooth Newt.jpg|thumb|Painted wooden smooth newt, part of a children's [[nature trail]] in [[Gunnersbury Triangle]] local nature reserve]]\n\nAll species of newts are protected in Europe. Laws prohibit the killing, destruction, and the selling of newts. While the species is by no means endangered, [[IUCN]] lists insufficient data to make an assessment for two of the subspecies.\n\nIn the UK, the smooth newt is protected under Schedule 5 of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] with respect to sale only. It is therefore illegal to sell individuals of the species, but their destruction or capture is still permitted. They are also listed under Annex III of the Bern Convention.\nThe smooth newt is the only newt native to [[Ireland]], and it is protected there under the Wildlife Acts (1976 and 2000). It is an offence to capture or kill a newt in Ireland without a licence.{{r|NPWS}}\n\nAs indicated in the foregoing section, while smooth newts are a protected species in Europe, they were declared a 'controlled pest animal' in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 1997, and prohibited Australia-wide in 2010, due to their invasive potential.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"amphibiaweb\">Amphibia Web - \"Smooth newt\" (January, 2003); http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/aw/search/index.html</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bailey2017\">Bailey, M; February 5, 2017; \"Poisonous Smooth Newt Threatens Health of Melbourne\u2019s Waterways\"; ''Herald Sun'' http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/south-east/poisonous-smooth-newt-threatens-health-of-melbourne-waterways/news-story/cc21d5da3ece80c1769b156c6a4aa07a.

It is not present in southern France, in southern Italy and the Iberian Peninsula, and is also not found on many Mediterranean islands. It is typically a lowland species, ranging up to about {{convert|1000|m}} but reaches {{convert|2150|m}} in Austria. It is found in damp meadows, field edges, parks, gardens, woods and stone piles.{{r|Collins|p=46-47}}\n\nWhile the smooth newt occurs almost exclusively in the northern hemisphere, scientists have recently documented the first instance of a newt species establishing in the wild in Australia, and the first invasive population of this species in the southern hemisphere.{{r|Tingley2014}} See \"An invasive species in Australia\" (below) for more information.\n\n==Life cycle==\nAdult smooth newts emerge from [[hibernation]] on land from late February to May, and head towards fresh water to breed. They favour ponds and shallow lakesides over running water. At this time, both sexes become more strikingly and colourfully marked, with vivid spots and orange bellies. The male also develops a wavy crest along the back and tail \u2013 the sexes are clearly different during the breeding season.\n\nDuring courtship, the male newt [[courtship display|display]]s for his prospective mate by vibrating his tail in front of her in a distinctive fashion. The male then deposits a sperm-containing capsule, a [[spermatophore]], in front of his mate, who manoeuvres herself into a position where she can pick up the capsule with her [[cloaca]] \u2013 fertilisation then occurring inside the female. Thus fertilised, after a few days the female starts to lay eggs.  These are placed individually, usually under aquatic plant leaves at a rate of 7 to 12 eggs per day. Altogether, a total of 400 eggs may be produced over the season.\n\nAfter two to three weeks (depending on water temperature), the eggs hatch to a [[larva]]l form \u2013 a [[tadpole]] or eft. For a few days, the larvae live off the food reserves contained within their yolk sacs (left over from the [[Egg (biology)|egg]] stage). After this, they start to eat freshwater [[plankton]], and later insect larvae, molluscs, and similar foods (unlike frog and toad tadpoles, newts are carnivorous throughout their lives).  \n<gallery widths=\"200px\">\nTriturusVulgarisLarva.JPG|A well-advanced larval newt, with feathery gills\nSmooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris) nymph.jpg|Nymph\n</gallery>\n\nThe newt larvae initially look like small fish fry, but later they become similar to miniature adults, but with \"feathery\" external gills emerging from behind the head on either side. As the tadpoles mature, they develop legs (front first), and the growth and use of their lungs is matched by a gradual shrinkage of the gills. Thus, the larva gradually shifts from being fully aquatic to possessing a body suitable for a mostly [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] existence, the young newt typically leaving the water after 10 weeks.  However, some may overwinter in the larval state, only emerging from the water the following year.{{r|mjking}} Smooth newts take around three years to become sexually mature, on average living for six years. Most adult and juvenile newts hibernate over winter in moist, sheltered areas above ground, emerging in the spring.\n\n==Mate selection==\n\nFemale mate choice is an important concept in evolutionary biology because it bears on female and male reproductive success.  Experiments were carried out with ''Lissotriton vulgaris'' in which female newts were paired sequentially with two males having different degrees of genetic relatedness to the female.  It was found that the more genetically dissimilar male had a higher paternity share than the more related male.{{r|Jehle2007}} Female choice may reflect an avoidance of inbreeding with related males that could lead to less fit progeny ([[inbreeding depression]]).\n\n==An invasive species in Australia==\nThe newt was first detected in Melbourne, Australia, in 2011. Four additional sites were found in and around Melbourne in 2012, and another two sites were identified in 2013.{{r|Tingley2014}} In 2016, the newt was found at another new site, and at least one previous site.{{r|ParkWatch2016}} Although the full extent of establishment is not known, some of the sites where newts have been detected are quite far apart \u2013 up to {{convert|5|km|spell=in}} from the original incursion, so scientists suspect that the species has spread considerably.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nThe smooth newt was available in the pet trade for decades before it was declared a \"controlled pest animal\" in Victoria in 1997, and prohibited Australia-wide in 2010. Therefore, this invasion is likely to have originated from the release or escape of captive animals.{{r|VicSmooth}}\n\n===Spread===\nResearchers cannot yet say how widely the species will spread because this is the first newt species found in the wild in Australia. However, smooth newts are prolific breeders and can survive in a wide range of terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Based on where they live in Europe \u2013 fields, woodlands, and a range of disturbed habitats, scientists suspect that they're capable of surviving in many areas of southern Australia. Furthermore, the climate of south-eastern Australia resembles the species' native range, and climate matching suggests that large parts of NSW, Victoria, eastern Tasmania, southern South Australia, and south-western Western Australia are suitable for newt habitation.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\n===Impacts===\nDue to the unique nature of this invasion in the southern hemisphere, it is difficult to predict likely impacts. However, scientists such as Tingley et al. (2014) note that on average, exotic species with only distant relatives in their invaded ranges tend to have greater impacts because the native species probably lack co-evolved defences against them.{{r|Tingley2014}} Potential impacts arise from predation and competition, toxicity, and disease spread.{{r|VicSmooth}}\n\nSmooth newts are generalist carnivores with a broad diet including invertebrates, crustaceans, and the eggs and hatchlings of frogs and fish. Therefore, they are likely to prey on and compete for food with a wide range of Australian terrestrial and freshwater species{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nThere is also a risk that smooth newts could poison their predators, like cane toads do. Any native animal that ingests the potentially deadly skin secretions produced by the newt could be affected, including wading birds, snakes, lizards, turtles, fish and mammals.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\nSmooth newts are also potential transmitters of chytrid fungus, because a close relative of the newt carries this disease. Chytrid fungus has decimated frog populations worldwide, and caused extinctions and widespread declines in Australian frogs.{{r|Tingley2014}}\n\n===Biosecurity===\nGovernment authorities decided not to attempt to eradicate the newt nearly two years after it was first detected in Australia. It has been suggested that high levels of uncertainty about the likely spread and impact of smooth newts in Australia contributed to the decision not to act.{{r|InvCouncil2014}} However, experts contend that the decision-making process was too slow and failed to take the [[precautionary principle]] into account. They claim that high levels of uncertainty should favour a quick decision to act, because by the time the impacts of the newt become apparent it will be too late to eradicate.{{r|Mrkaja|Tingley2014|InvCouncil2014}} Scientists are now calling on government authorities to revisit this decision before eradication is too difficult and costly to consider.{{r|Lovett2017|ParkWatch2016|Bailey2017|InvCouncil2014}}\n\n==Conservation status in Europe==\n[[File:Wooden Animal Trail Camouflaged Smooth Newt.jpg|thumb|Painted wooden smooth newt, part of a children's [[nature trail]] in [[Gunnersbury Triangle]] local nature reserve]]\n\nAll species of newts are protected in Europe. Laws prohibit the killing, destruction, and the selling of newts. While the species is by no means endangered, [[IUCN]] lists insufficient data to make an assessment for two of the subspecies.\n\nIn the UK, the smooth newt is protected under Schedule 5 of the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]] with respect to sale only. It is therefore illegal to sell individuals of the species, but their destruction or capture is still permitted. They are also listed under Annex III of the Bern Convention.\nThe smooth newt is the only newt native to [[Ireland]], and it is protected there under the Wildlife Acts (1976 and 2000). It is an offence to capture or kill a newt in Ireland without a licence.{{r|NPWS}}\n\nAs indicated in the foregoing section, while smooth newts are a protected species in Europe, they were declared a 'controlled pest animal' in the state of Victoria, Australia, in 1997, and prohibited Australia-wide in 2010, due to their invasive potential.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"amphibiaweb\">Amphibia Web - \"Smooth newt\" (January, 2003); http://elib.cs.berkeley.edu/aw/search/index.html</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bailey2017\">Bailey, M; February 5, 2017; \"Poisonous Smooth Newt Threatens Health of Melbourne\u2019s Waterways\"; ''Herald Sun'' http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/south-east/poisonous-smooth-newt-threatens-health-of-melbourne-waterways/news-story/cc21d5da3ece80c1769b156c6a4aa07a.

The style is found in government edifices, commercial projects, and residential buildings in [[Boroughs of New York City|all five boroughs]]. The architecture of the period was influenced not just by decorative arts influences from across the world, but also local zoning regulations.\n\nTheir proliferation first fueled by the [[Roaring Twenties]] and speculation, [[Art Deco]] buildings range in size and sophistication from towering [[skyscraper]]s and office buildings to modest middle-class housing and municipal buildings. First defined by the colorful, lavishly-decorated skyscrapers of Manhattan, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and changing tastes pushed Art Deco to more subdued applications in the 1930s. The lull in construction during [[World War II]] and rise of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] led to the end of new Art Deco in the city.\n\nAfter falling out of favor and suffering from neglect [[History of New York City (1946\u20131977)|during the city's downturn]] in the latter half of the 20th century, New York's Art Deco has been reappraised; among its most treasured and recognizable buildings are the Art Deco [[Empire State Building]] and [[Chrysler Building]], and Art Deco skyscrapers formed the core of the city's skyline. Today, many of New York's finest Art Deco examples are protected by historic preservation laws, while others have been lost to development or neglect.\n<!-- for intro image: 50164u.tif (Chrysler, Art Deco bronx, Brooklyn central library) -->\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Drawing, Study for Maximum Mass Permitted by the 1916 New York Zoning Law, Stage 4, 1922 (CH 18468717).jpg|thumb|One of architect and illustrator [[Hugh Ferriss]]' illustrations, demonstrating an approach to fulfilling [[1916 Zoning Resolution|New York City's setbacks requirements]] that would come to define the city's Art Deco buildings.|alt=]]\n\n[[Art Deco in the United States|American Art Deco]] has its origins in European arts, especially the ''style moderne'' popularized at the 1925 [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] from which Art Deco draws its name (''Exposition internationale des '''arts d\u00e9co'''ratifs et industriels modernes'').

An exploding population, flush economic times, cheap credit, and lax zoning combined to encourage a building boom. The real estate market was so frenetic that old buildings were regularly torn down for new construction after standing for only a few years.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|42}} Builders tore down twice as many buildings as went up, with the new buildings occupying two or more old lots. The result was that the amount of office space in New York City increased by 92% in the back half of the 1920s.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|49\u201350}}\n\nIn New York City specifically, zoning regulations had major impacts on the design of its buildings. The development of the [[elevator]] and [[Steel frame|steel-framed buildings]] enabled the construction of buildings far taller than ever before\u2014the [[skyscraper]]. The rise of ever-larger skyscrapers such as the 40-story [[Equitable Building (New York City)|Equitable Building]] helped spur the passage of the United States' first citywide zoning code, the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]].<ref name=\"dunlap_2016\"/> The regulations, intended to prevent tall buildings from choking out light and air at street level, required tall buildings to \"[[Setback (land use)|set back]]\" from street level depending on the width of the street and the zoned area.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/> Once a building rose up and set back to cover just 25% of the lot, clients and architects were limited not by city codes but by money and engineering as to the height of their project.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|48}} The impact of the new regulations was not felt until later in the decade, as the entry of the United States into [[World War I]] slowed construction.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/>\n\nEarly buildings built to conform to the new setback codes did so unimaginatively\u2014the [[Crown Building (Manhattan)|Heckscher Building]] in Midtown (completed 1921) set back evenly like a stack of boxes as it rose\u2014but more novel interpretations of the law would follow.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/><!-- more on drawings from bl_1975? --> A major influence on the resulting skyscrapers was Finn [[Eliel Saarinen]]'s [[Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design|second-place entry]] for [[Chicago]]'s [[Tribune Tower]], considered a liberating alternative for a skyscraper style unbeholden to either [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Classical architecture|Classical]] architecture.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|7\u20138}} Also influential were architect and illustrator [[Hugh Ferriss]]' series of speculative architectural illustrations exploring how to make buildings that met the zoning requirements.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/><ref name=\"shaw_2017\"/> Ferriss' illustrations envisioned buildings as sculptural forms rather than simple boxes.

New York's architects were at the forefront of using new materials, including synthetics like [[Bakelite]] and [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] plastics,  as well as [[Stainless steel#History|Nirosta]], a corrosion-resistant steel alloy that made exterior metal on skyscrapers more feasible.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|68}} Aluminum's declining price and lighter weight than steel led to it being a common choice for interior and exterior usage.<ref name=\"capitman_1994\"/> Other common materials were brick and multicolored terra cotta.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/>\n\nArchitectural historian [[Rosemarie Haag Bletter]] described the most pronounced element of Art Deco as \"its use of sumptuous ornament\". The most dynamic elements were reserved for entrances and at the tops of buildings, with multiple materials combined to form dazzling colors or rich texture. Sometimes the buildings were shaded\u2014using darker-colored materials at the base, and then gradually lightening towards the top\u2014to increase the building's visibility.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|37}} Art Deco buildings in the city were also richly appointed inside and out with reliefs, mosaics, murals, and other art.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/> Allegorical depictions\u2014such as beehives of industry on the [[Fred F. French Building|French Building]], personifications of virtues at [[Rockefeller Center]], or figures portraying industry and the arts at the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|International Magazine Building]]<!-- double check this link-->\u2014were common decorative elements.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|47, 72}} The entries and lobbies of these skyscrapers often drew direct influence from the painted sets and stages of theaters, with framing like hanging curtains.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nArchitect [[Ely Jacques Kahn]] commented in 1926 on the emerging style that his brethren were creating with their buildings:\n\n<blockquote>[It] is so characteristic of New York that it would be more logical, by far, to call it a New York Style. [...] Decoration becomes a far more precious thing than a collection of dead leaves, [[Festoon|swags]], bull's heads and [[cartouche]]s. It becomes a means of enriching the surface with a play of light and shade, voices and solids. [Today's ornamental forms] respond to the bulk and simplicity of the skyscraper itself.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/></blockquote>\n\nDeco in New York became intrinsically linked with commercial architecture. Its focus on rich ornamentation and sensory appeal appealed to commercial patrons who wanted an \"acceptable\" modern style. These developers in turn gave architects a permissive mandate to create in the style, as long as the end result was not too shocking.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|40\u201343}} The buildings rose to the height where the cost of added space equalized with the commercial value of that space.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|13}} The emerging style was contemporaneously called the \"vertical style\", \"skyscraper style\", or simply \"modern\",<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> with the characteristic look of setback buildings leading to them being called \"[[Wedding-cake style|wedding cake]]\" buildings.<ref name=\"messler_1986\"/>{{rp|79}}<ref name=\"barr_2016\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n[[File:Self-Referential Building - 70 Pine.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from an entrance to [[70 Pine Street]], featuring aluminum spandrels with geometric ornamentation and a miniature limestone model of the building itself.]]\nThe demand for modern buildings was such that even architectural firms known for more restrained and classical designs adopted the new style. [[Cross & Cross]]'s main practice was for discreet townhomes and banks, but in the late 1920s they produced modern skyscrapers such as the [[General Electric Building|RCA Victor Building]]. The 50-story skyscraper turned Gothic tracery into stylized lightning bolts.<ref name=\"gray_2014-02-07\"/> Another conservative firm that moved to modernistic designs was [[Walker & Gillette]], whose best-known Art Deco building in New York is the [[Fuller Building]].<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> Buildings already being constructed were sometimes appended with Art Deco flourishes; the [[1501 Broadway|Paramount Building]] (1926) had an Art Deco clock tower appended to a Beaux-Arts base.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|appx 22B}} These buildings were constructed either as headquarters for established and emerging companies, or else speculative projects where money would be drawn from renting out the space in the new building. The design of speculative buildings was chiefly driven by maximizing rentable space, whereas corporate buildings served as advertisements for the corporations themselves\u2014in some cases, sacrificing revenue for what architect [[Timothy L. Pflueger]] termed \"special architectural appeal\". Even with these corporate buildings, however, the owners would often lend space to smaller businesses and treat them as real estate investments.<ref name=\"ward_1992\"/>{{rp|162\u2013163}} The very buildings often spoke to the business conducted there. The RCA Building's wave motifs represent the power of radio, while the [[Chrysler Building]] would have ornamental touches of radiators and hubcaps for the automobile company.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> With the [[330 West 42nd Street|McGraw-Hill Building]],<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|61}} [[Wyndham New Yorker Hotel]], and [[Daily News Building]], the buildings feature their names in prominent signage or embedded into the very facade. Because the true shape of the building was often hard to grasp for a street-level observer, many of the skyscrapers featured miniature versions of the building itself as part of their ground-level decoration.<ref name=\"breeze_2003\"/>{{rp|37}}<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"gray_1998-03-08\"/>\n\nIn the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and [[Lower Manhattan|downtown Manhattan]], the skyline was quickly transformed by the proliferation of Art Deco high-rises.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> Arguably the first Art Deco skyscraper was the [[Verizon Building|Barclay-Vesey Building]] at 140 West Street, built from 1923 to 1927 and conceived by [[Ralph Thomas Walker]]. Its exterior was decorated with motifs derived from Aztec designs, and the lobby featured a vaulting ceiling with frescoes detailing the history of communication.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|111}} Other notable Art Deco skyscrapers in downtown include the [[1 Wall Street|Irving Trust Company Building]] (1929\u20131931), designed with a \"curtain\" exterior and [[Hildreth Meiere]]-produced mosaics in the interior;<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|99\u2013102}} [[120 Wall Street]] (1929\u20131930), with classic wedding-cake form and a red granite and limestone base;<ref name=\"nash_1999\"/>{{rp|71}} and the [[20 Exchange Place|City Bank-Farmers Trust Building]], featuring abstract heads along the facade looking down at street level, and bronzed doors featuring transportation methods.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|106\u2013109}} The final skyscraper built before World War II in the Financial District was [[70 Pine Street]], built 1932.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|102}} It featured unique double-deck elevators servicing two lobby floors, designed to maximize the profitable space of the small plot.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"gray_1998-03-08\"/>\n\nIn comparison to downtown, which already had skyscrapers dating to the previous century and fewer available plots, [[Midtown Manhattan]] was only just beginning to develop its skyline as Art Deco became popular, with its business district booming after the construction of [[Grand Central Terminal]] and the undergrounding of previously exposed train tracks opening up new plots for development.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> <!-- 42nd Street proved to be Midtown's main thoroughfare of Art Deco skyscrapers -->\n\nNew York's architects were caught in a furious race for the title of [[List of tallest buildings|tallest building in the world]], and several Art Deco buildings vied for the title. By the end of 1930 there were more than 11 building plans on file of more than 60 floors; among them were the Chrysler Building and the [[Empire State Building]], both of which increased in height from their 1928 and 1929 plans, respectively.<ref name=\"gray_2010-01-28\"/> In competition with [[40 Wall Street]] for the title of tallest building, [[William Van Alen|Van Alen]] secretly constructed the Chrysler Building's {{convert|185|foot|m}} steel spire within the building itself, hoisting it and securing it into position in a single day, claiming the title of tallest building.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> The triumph was short-lived; a month later Al Smith updated the plans for the Empire State Building,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/01/08/94228622.pdf|title=Smith Skyscraper Has a Novel Design|last=|first=|date=1930|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 8, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> adding more stories and a 200-foot spire of its own so that dirigibles could moor there.<ref name=\"gray_2010-09-26\"/> The Chrysler Building would remain the tallest building in the world for just eleven months{{efn|May 27, 1930<ref name=\"NYT-Chrysler-Open-1930\">{{cite news | title=Chrysler Building, City's Highest, Open | work=The New York Times|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331 | date=May 28, 1930 | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/05/28/96134315.pdf | access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref> to May 1, 1931<ref name=\"NYTimes-ESB-Open-1931\"/>}} before being overtaken by the Empire State Building.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"NYTimes-ESB-Open-1931\">{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1931/05/02/102231255.pdf|title=Empire State Tower, Tallest in World, is Opened by Hoover|date=May 2, 1931|work=The New York Times|access-date=October 23, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n<!-- market crash -->\n[[File:Vincent lopez empire state building at night 1937 loc.jpg|thumb|upright|The Empire State Building towers above the New York skyline in 1937.

The immediate impact of the Depression was a sharp contraction in building of all kinds; one architectural firm went from 17 filed plans for buildings up to 30 stories in 1929 to just three plans in 1930, the tallest being four stories.<ref name=\"gray_2012-10-04\"/>\n\n<!-- rockefeller center-->\nIn the shadow of the deepening Depression, the [[Metropolitan Opera]] abandoned its plans to move to a new three-block complex financed by [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] Rockefeller decided to proceed with the project, hiring three different architectural firms, including Hood and [[Harvey Wiley Corbett]], who would leave the project to work on the [[Metropolitan Life North Building]]. The architects envisioned a plan for buildings arranged on several axes, clad in the same materials, windows grouped in vertical columns, and grand entrances. At the center was [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]. The buildings on the wings of the grand entrance were occupied by foreign governments (French, British, and Italian), who decided on the ornamentation for the building.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> The Rockefellers earmarked $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|150000|1930|fmt=c}} adjusted for inflation) for art in the plaza alone, filling the space with paintings, reliefs, and sculptural forms.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|16}} The decorative features focus on the achievements of humankind, mythology, and stories of education and commerce.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|18, 33}}\n\n===Commercial===\nThe heyday of Art Deco skyscrapers was effectively ended by the Great Depression, but Art Deco had proliferated outwards across the city in myriad forms.<ref name=\"knowles_2014\"/> Art Deco proved a popular style for an expanding range of modern commercial edifices that proliferated during the period\u2014department stores, news offices, and transportation.<ref name=\"knowles_2014\"/><ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\nThe initial prevailing wisdom was that the real estate market would quickly recover as the stock market had drained capital from construction.<ref name=\"gray_2009-04-23\"/> To tide landowners over until economic conditions improved, many built \"[[Taxpayer (building)|taxpayers]]\" on their lots\u2014single or two-story buildings. Despite being intended as temporary, many of these buildings remained for decades afterwards.<ref name=\"gray_2004-08-29\"/> One such Art Deco taxpayer was the East River Savings Bank on 22 Cortlandt Street, which replaced a fifteen-story building from the 1890s. The ''New York Times'' dubbed the lot \"the most valuable piece of New York real estate for a tax payer in the city.\" Despite being a more modest building, the structure is appointed with polished stone eagles, interior marble, and at one time featured a {{convert|3000|ft2|m2|abbr=|adj=on}} mural of the [[East River]].<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> Completed speculative buildings faced issues in the difficult economy\u2014the Empire State Building took more in as a tourist attraction than from tenants, and office buildings across Midtown felt pinched by the Rockefeller Center's aggressive tactics to lure and keep tenants.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|58}}\n\nAs the 1930s progressed, the rental market began to improve, and the pace of construction increased.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_03\"/> The buildings that went up in this period tended to be more reserved, with grayer, more austere versions of Art Deco; Bletter suggests that this change was due to the lush, colorful look of the earlier style appearing \"frivolous\" in the 1930s and the influence of mechanization.

The style is found in government edifices, commercial projects, and residential buildings in [[Boroughs of New York City|all five boroughs]]. The architecture of the period was influenced not just by decorative arts influences from across the world, but also local zoning regulations.\n\nTheir proliferation first fueled by the [[Roaring Twenties]] and speculation, [[Art Deco]] buildings range in size and sophistication from towering [[skyscraper]]s and office buildings to modest middle-class housing and municipal buildings. First defined by the colorful, lavishly-decorated skyscrapers of Manhattan, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] and changing tastes pushed Art Deco to more subdued applications in the 1930s. The lull in construction during [[World War II]] and rise of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] led to the end of new Art Deco in the city.\n\nAfter falling out of favor and suffering from neglect [[History of New York City (1946\u20131977)|during the city's downturn]] in the latter half of the 20th century, New York's Art Deco has been reappraised; among its most treasured and recognizable buildings are the Art Deco [[Empire State Building]] and [[Chrysler Building]], and Art Deco skyscrapers formed the core of the city's skyline. Today, many of New York's finest Art Deco examples are protected by historic preservation laws, while others have been lost to development or neglect.\n<!-- for intro image: 50164u.tif (Chrysler, Art Deco bronx, Brooklyn central library) -->\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:Drawing, Study for Maximum Mass Permitted by the 1916 New York Zoning Law, Stage 4, 1922 (CH 18468717).jpg|thumb|One of architect and illustrator [[Hugh Ferriss]]' illustrations, demonstrating an approach to fulfilling [[1916 Zoning Resolution|New York City's setbacks requirements]] that would come to define the city's Art Deco buildings.|alt=]]\n\n[[Art Deco in the United States|American Art Deco]] has its origins in European arts, especially the ''style moderne'' popularized at the 1925 [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] from which Art Deco draws its name (''Exposition internationale des '''arts d\u00e9co'''ratifs et industriels modernes''). While the United States would not officially participate, Americans\u2014including New York architect\u00a0[[Irwin Chanin]]<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|55}}\u2014visited the exposition,<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|47}}  and the government sent a delegation to the expo. Their resulting reports helped spread the style to America.<ref name=\"lpc_report_2011-09-20\"/>{{rp|6}} Other influences included [[German expressionism]], the [[Vienna Secession|Austrian Secession]], [[art nouveau]], [[cubism]], and the ornament of African and Central and South American cultures.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\" />{{rp|8\u20139}}<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> In America, Art Deco architecture would take on different forms in different regions of the country, influenced by local culture, laws, and tastes.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|42}}\n\nArt Deco came into style just as New York itself was being rapidly transformed. An exploding population, flush economic times, cheap credit, and lax zoning combined to encourage a building boom. The real estate market was so frenetic that old buildings were regularly torn down for new construction after standing for only a few years.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|42}} Builders tore down twice as many buildings as went up, with the new buildings occupying two or more old lots. The result was that the amount of office space in New York City increased by 92% in the back half of the 1920s.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|49\u201350}}\n\nIn New York City specifically, zoning regulations had major impacts on the design of its buildings. The development of the [[elevator]] and [[Steel frame|steel-framed buildings]] enabled the construction of buildings far taller than ever before\u2014the [[skyscraper]]. The rise of ever-larger skyscrapers such as the 40-story [[Equitable Building (New York City)|Equitable Building]] helped spur the passage of the United States' first citywide zoning code, the [[1916 Zoning Resolution]].<ref name=\"dunlap_2016\"/> The regulations, intended to prevent tall buildings from choking out light and air at street level, required tall buildings to \"[[Setback (land use)|set back]]\" from street level depending on the width of the street and the zoned area.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/> Once a building rose up and set back to cover just 25% of the lot, clients and architects were limited not by city codes but by money and engineering as to the height of their project.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|48}} The impact of the new regulations was not felt until later in the decade, as the entry of the United States into [[World War I]] slowed construction.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/>\n\nEarly buildings built to conform to the new setback codes did so unimaginatively\u2014the [[Crown Building (Manhattan)|Heckscher Building]] in Midtown (completed 1921) set back evenly like a stack of boxes as it rose\u2014but more novel interpretations of the law would follow.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/><!-- more on drawings from bl_1975? --> A major influence on the resulting skyscrapers was Finn [[Eliel Saarinen]]'s [[Eliel Saarinen's Tribune Tower design|second-place entry]] for [[Chicago]]'s [[Tribune Tower]], considered a liberating alternative for a skyscraper style unbeholden to either [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Classical architecture|Classical]] architecture.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|7\u20138}} Also influential were architect and illustrator [[Hugh Ferriss]]' series of speculative architectural illustrations exploring how to make buildings that met the zoning requirements.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"dolkart_2003_01\"/><ref name=\"shaw_2017\"/> Ferriss' illustrations envisioned buildings as sculptural forms rather than simple boxes. Architect [[Talbot Hamlin]] described Ferriss' work as \"a magic wand to set the American city architecture free from its nightmare. [...] No longer was the high building apparently built by the mile and cut off to order, but it was composed break upon break, buttress on buttress. The possibilities of poetry entered in.\"<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|48\u201349}}\n\nPrecursors to the Art Deco skyscrapers that would soon go up across the city were buildings such as [[Raymond Hood]]'s [[American Radiator Building]], which was neo-Gothic in general style but featured abstract ornament that would characterize Art Deco.<ref name=\"gray_1994-02-20\"/> Another early transitional building was the Madison Belmont Building at 181 Madison Avenue (1924\u20131925), which featured traditional ornamentation and organization on upper floors, combined with Art Deco motifs on the lower floors. The ironwork was provided by [[Edgar Brandt]], who contributed the iron entrance gates to the 1925 Paris Exhibition.<ref name=\"lpc_report_2011-09-20\"/>{{rp|1,5\u20136}}\n\n==Art Deco in the city==\n===Vertical style===\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = New York has such courage and enthusiasm that everything can be begun again, sent back to the building yard and made into something still greater, something mastered!

The setback laws resulted in three-dimensional, sculptural buildings, with long, uninterrupted piers rising between columns of windows and decorated [[spandrel]]s.<ref name=\"robins_2014\" /><ref name=\"messler_1986\"/> These choices were made to emphasize the height of the buildings as an overriding consideration,<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|37}} a choice mimicked even on much shorter buildings built across town. New York's architects were at the forefront of using new materials, including synthetics like [[Bakelite]] and [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]] plastics,  as well as [[Stainless steel#History|Nirosta]], a corrosion-resistant steel alloy that made exterior metal on skyscrapers more feasible.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/><ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|68}} Aluminum's declining price and lighter weight than steel led to it being a common choice for interior and exterior usage.<ref name=\"capitman_1994\"/> Other common materials were brick and multicolored terra cotta.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/>\n\nArchitectural historian [[Rosemarie Haag Bletter]] described the most pronounced element of Art Deco as \"its use of sumptuous ornament\". The most dynamic elements were reserved for entrances and at the tops of buildings, with multiple materials combined to form dazzling colors or rich texture. Sometimes the buildings were shaded\u2014using darker-colored materials at the base, and then gradually lightening towards the top\u2014to increase the building's visibility.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|37}} Art Deco buildings in the city were also richly appointed inside and out with reliefs, mosaics, murals, and other art.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/> Allegorical depictions\u2014such as beehives of industry on the [[Fred F. French Building|French Building]], personifications of virtues at [[Rockefeller Center]], or figures portraying industry and the arts at the [[Hearst Tower (Manhattan)|International Magazine Building]]<!-- double check this link-->\u2014were common decorative elements.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|47, 72}} The entries and lobbies of these skyscrapers often drew direct influence from the painted sets and stages of theaters, with framing like hanging curtains.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nArchitect [[Ely Jacques Kahn]] commented in 1926 on the emerging style that his brethren were creating with their buildings:\n\n<blockquote>[It] is so characteristic of New York that it would be more logical, by far, to call it a New York Style. [...] Decoration becomes a far more precious thing than a collection of dead leaves, [[Festoon|swags]], bull's heads and [[cartouche]]s. It becomes a means of enriching the surface with a play of light and shade, voices and solids. [Today's ornamental forms] respond to the bulk and simplicity of the skyscraper itself.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/></blockquote>\n\nDeco in New York became intrinsically linked with commercial architecture. Its focus on rich ornamentation and sensory appeal appealed to commercial patrons who wanted an \"acceptable\" modern style. These developers in turn gave architects a permissive mandate to create in the style, as long as the end result was not too shocking.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|40\u201343}} The buildings rose to the height where the cost of added space equalized with the commercial value of that space.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|13}} The emerging style was contemporaneously called the \"vertical style\", \"skyscraper style\", or simply \"modern\",<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> with the characteristic look of setback buildings leading to them being called \"[[Wedding-cake style|wedding cake]]\" buildings.<ref name=\"messler_1986\"/>{{rp|79}}<ref name=\"barr_2016\"/>{{rp|164}}\n\n[[File:Self-Referential Building - 70 Pine.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from an entrance to [[70 Pine Street]], featuring aluminum spandrels with geometric ornamentation and a miniature limestone model of the building itself.]]\nThe demand for modern buildings was such that even architectural firms known for more restrained and classical designs adopted the new style. [[Cross & Cross]]'s main practice was for discreet townhomes and banks, but in the late 1920s they produced modern skyscrapers such as the [[General Electric Building|RCA Victor Building]]. The 50-story skyscraper turned Gothic tracery into stylized lightning bolts.<ref name=\"gray_2014-02-07\"/> Another conservative firm that moved to modernistic designs was [[Walker & Gillette]], whose best-known Art Deco building in New York is the [[Fuller Building]].<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> Buildings already being constructed were sometimes appended with Art Deco flourishes; the [[1501 Broadway|Paramount Building]] (1926) had an Art Deco clock tower appended to a Beaux-Arts base.<ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|appx 22B}} These buildings were constructed either as headquarters for established and emerging companies, or else speculative projects where money would be drawn from renting out the space in the new building. The design of speculative buildings was chiefly driven by maximizing rentable space, whereas corporate buildings served as advertisements for the corporations themselves\u2014in some cases, sacrificing revenue for what architect [[Timothy L. Pflueger]] termed \"special architectural appeal\".

The architects envisioned a plan for buildings arranged on several axes, clad in the same materials, windows grouped in vertical columns, and grand entrances. At the center was [[30 Rockefeller Plaza]]. The buildings on the wings of the grand entrance were occupied by foreign governments (French, British, and Italian), who decided on the ornamentation for the building.<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> The Rockefellers earmarked $150,000 (${{Inflation|US|150000|1930|fmt=c}} adjusted for inflation) for art in the plaza alone, filling the space with paintings, reliefs, and sculptural forms.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|16}} The decorative features focus on the achievements of humankind, mythology, and stories of education and commerce.<ref name=\"berenholtz_2005\"/>{{rp|18, 33}}\n\n===Commercial===\nThe heyday of Art Deco skyscrapers was effectively ended by the Great Depression, but Art Deco had proliferated outwards across the city in myriad forms.<ref name=\"knowles_2014\"/> Art Deco proved a popular style for an expanding range of modern commercial edifices that proliferated during the period\u2014department stores, news offices, and transportation.<ref name=\"knowles_2014\"/><ref name=\"robinson&bletter_1975\"/>{{rp|24}}\n\nThe initial prevailing wisdom was that the real estate market would quickly recover as the stock market had drained capital from construction.<ref name=\"gray_2009-04-23\"/> To tide landowners over until economic conditions improved, many built \"[[Taxpayer (building)|taxpayers]]\" on their lots\u2014single or two-story buildings. Despite being intended as temporary, many of these buildings remained for decades afterwards.<ref name=\"gray_2004-08-29\"/> One such Art Deco taxpayer was the East River Savings Bank on 22 Cortlandt Street, which replaced a fifteen-story building from the 1890s. The ''New York Times'' dubbed the lot \"the most valuable piece of New York real estate for a tax payer in the city.\" Despite being a more modest building, the structure is appointed with polished stone eagles, interior marble, and at one time featured a {{convert|3000|ft2|m2|abbr=|adj=on}} mural of the [[East River]].<ref name=\"robins_2014\"/> Completed speculative buildings faced issues in the difficult economy\u2014the Empire State Building took more in as a tourist attraction than from tenants, and office buildings across Midtown felt pinched by the Rockefeller Center's aggressive tactics to lure and keep tenants.<ref name=\"flowers_2011\"/>{{rp|58}}\n\nAs the 1930s progressed, the rental market began to improve, and the pace of construction increased.<ref name=\"dolkart_2003_03\"/> The buildings that went up in this period tended to be more reserved, with grayer, more austere versions of Art Deco; Bletter suggests that this change was due to the lush, colorful look of the earlier style appearing \"frivolous\" in the 1930s and the influence of mechanization.

He is the Captain of the King [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]]'s Archers.<ref>The [[Garde du Corps (France)#2nd Company (1st French Company)|true Captain]] in 1482 was [[Jacques Ier de Crussol]], vicomte d'Uz\u00e8s.</ref> His name comes from [[Phoebus]], the [[Greek god]] of the sun (also called [[Apollo]]).\n\n==In the novel==\nIn the original novel, Phoebus is an [[antagonist]]. Despite being of noble birth and very handsome, he is also vain, untrustworthy, and a [[womanizing|womanizer]]. He saves [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame)|Esmeralda]] from [[Quasimodo]] and she falls in love with him. Phoebus makes a convincing show of returning her affections, but merely wants a night of passion. Esmeralda arranges to meet Phoebus and tells him of her love for him, and he convinces her that he feels the same way about her. He is in fact engaged to his cousin, Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, who is a spiteful socialite and jealous of Esmeralda's beauty. Not only that, he has agreed to let Archdeacon [[Claude Frollo]] spy on his meeting with Esmeralda.\n\nThis decision proves his undoing, since as the couple prepare to have sex, the jealous Frollo attacks Phoebus by stabbing him in the back. Frollo makes a quick get-away and Phoebus is presumed dead with Esmeralda, being the only one present, presumed to be the killer. Phoebus, however, is not dead and soon recovers from his injury. But this does not stop Esmeralda from being tried and sentenced to death for his attempted murder as well as for witchcraft. Phoebus could have proven her innocence, but he remained silent. In the end of the novel, he marries Fleur-de-Lys, and watches Esmeralda's execution with apparently little or no remorse. Whilst being one of the few characters to survive in the novel, Hugo implies that his marriage will not be a romantic or happy one.\n\n==Adaptations==\nAmong the actors who have played Phoebus over the years in each adaptation of the novel are:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

He was voiced by [[Kevin Kline]] and animated by [[Russ Edmonds]]. He returns to Paris from the wars to be Captain of the Guard under Frollo, who is portrayed as a judge in this version, because his predecessor was a \"bit of a disappointment\" to Frollo. However, Phoebus begins to harbor a great dislike towards Frollo for his harsh methods, and displays sympathy towards the downtrodden and poor, shown when he steps in to stop two of Frollo's thugs from arresting Esmeralda for stealing money (which was honestly obtained), and requests to stop the citizens from torturing Quasimodo at the Festival of Fools. He becomes fond of Esmeralda, such as complimenting her for fighting as well as a man, and the two truly fall in love (unlike the Phoebus from the novel, who only wanted passion from Esmeralda). Midway through the film, as Frollo descends into a homicidal madness and burns down almost half the city in his ruthless manhunt for Esmeralda, after developing a lust for her, Phoebus finally rebels against Frollo when he objects to burning an innocent family's house with them inside just because they had given shelter to gypsies in the past with no evidence that they have any knowledge of Esmeralda's current whereabouts. He is immediately sentenced to death for his rebellion and, after attempting to escape from Frollo and his men, is almost killed by being struck by an arrow and falling into the River Seine, but is rescued by Esmeralda from drowning. Esmeralda takes him to Notre Dame and leaves him in Quasimodo's care. Despite Quasimodo distrusting him, he and Phoebus join forces to find the Court of Miracles, the gypsy hideout, before Frollo attacks, but they are all captured when it is revealed that Frollo tricked them into helping him find the Court.\n\nIn the climactic battle, Phoebus escapes captivity to rally the French citizens to fight against Frollo's thugs and liberate their city. He pursues Frollo into the cathedral and witnesses both Frollo and Quasimodo fall from the balcony, catching Quasimodo in time to save his life. In the aftermath, Phoebus steps down to let Quasimodo have his turn with Esmeralda, but then Quasimodo finally accepts Phoebus as a good friend and blesses his romance with Esmeralda, to the couple's delight.\n\n===In the second film===\nIn Disney's 2002 direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', Phoebus (again voiced by Kline) is married to Esmeralda and has a young son, Zephyr, who resembles him, with her. He continues to serve as Captain of the Guard under the new Minister of Justice, and investigates a series of thefts throughout Paris which coincide with the arrival of a gypsy circus troupe, led by Sarousch. His investigation leads him to conclude that Sarousch and his accomplice, Madelleine, are the culprits, putting a strain on his friendship with Quasimodo, who is developing a budding relationship with Madelleine. Sarousch fools Phoebus into thinking Madelleine is the sole thief so that he can steal La Fid\u00e8le, Notre Dame's most valuable bell. However, in the process, Zephyr is kidnapped. Phoebus leads the city guard to trap Sarousch, who almost escapes by holding Zephyr hostage. When Madelleine and Quasimodo rescue Zephyr, Phoebus and his men arrest Sarousch. At the Festival of Romance, he loudly declares his enduring love for his wife.\n\n===Later Disney appearances===\nThis incarnation of Phoebus makes his debut appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. His role in the game is identical to the first film.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|France|Literature}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/characters.html The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Characters] at [[Spark Notes|SparkNotes.com]]\n* Rebello, Stephen.

In the aftermath, Phoebus steps down to let Quasimodo have his turn with Esmeralda, but then Quasimodo finally accepts Phoebus as a good friend and blesses his romance with Esmeralda, to the couple's delight.\n\n===In the second film===\nIn Disney's 2002 direct-to-video sequel, ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame II]]'', Phoebus (again voiced by Kline) is married to Esmeralda and has a young son, Zephyr, who resembles him, with her. He continues to serve as Captain of the Guard under the new Minister of Justice, and investigates a series of thefts throughout Paris which coincide with the arrival of a gypsy circus troupe, led by Sarousch. His investigation leads him to conclude that Sarousch and his accomplice, Madelleine, are the culprits, putting a strain on his friendship with Quasimodo, who is developing a budding relationship with Madelleine. Sarousch fools Phoebus into thinking Madelleine is the sole thief so that he can steal La Fid\u00e8le, Notre Dame's most valuable bell. However, in the process, Zephyr is kidnapped. Phoebus leads the city guard to trap Sarousch, who almost escapes by holding Zephyr hostage. When Madelleine and Quasimodo rescue Zephyr, Phoebus and his men arrest Sarousch. At the Festival of Romance, he loudly declares his enduring love for his wife.\n\n===Later Disney appearances===\nThis incarnation of Phoebus makes his debut appearance in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series in ''[[Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance]]'', but voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]. His role in the game is identical to the first film.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|France|Literature}}\n{{Reflist}}\n* [http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/characters.html The Hunchback of Notre Dame: Characters] at [[Spark Notes|SparkNotes.com]]\n* Rebello, Stephen.

At the end of his apprenticeship, saving \u00a310 from his wages he opened his first store at the corner of Eastborough and Globe Street in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], selling remnants from merchants. The area was full of poverty, and the store was therefore popular with [[housewives]].\n\nTrade increased and William needed bigger premises to operate. Two corner units on Market Street and Queen Street were purchased in 1886. Further buildings were acquired and within ten years almost all of one side of Market Street was owned by Boyes. The store was named \u201cThe Remnant Warehouse\u201d and is still known as the Rem by older residents of Scarborough.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://imfromyorkshire.uk.com/made-in-yorkshire-volume-25-boyes/|title=Boyes - Made in Yorkshire - Volume 25|date=26 August 2015|website=I'm From Yorkshire|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref> In 1900 Boyes became a limited company when William and three friends, James Pirie, Henry Merrie Cross and JH Harrison invested in the business.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buying well, selling cheap still pays off |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/6951008.buying-well-selling-cheap-still-pays-off/|date=24 May 2015|website=[[The Northern Echo]] |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the years William added more products to the range and the store went from a warehouse to a department store.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boyes History |url=https://www.boyes.co.uk/boyes-history/ |website=www.boyes.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> The company began to expand to [[York]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Grimsby]] in the following years.

Boyes took over the former [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] unit in the centre.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/17443981.boyes-to-move-from-north-parade-to-kirkgate-shopping-centre/|title=Boyes to move from North Parade to Kirkgate Shopping Centre|newspaper=[[Telegraph and Argus]]|date=19 February 2019|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nBoyes has expanded its reach further by opening several stores in the East Midlands and as far south as Cambridgeshire. The company reached its landmark 50th store with the opening of the [[Coalville]] store in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Burnett|first1=Clare|title=130-year-old Yorkshire retail chain expands with 2 new stores in the Midlands|url=https://bdaily.co.uk/hospitality/10-03-2014/130-year-old-yorkshire-retail-chain-expands-with-2-new-stores-in-the-midlands/|work=BDaily|date=10 March 2014|accessdate=8 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe company has increased store numbers in many cases by moving into units vacated by other retailers. They have taken over ex-Woolworths stores in Cleethorpes, [[Bishop Auckland]] and Coalville. Former Co-op department stores in [[Brighouse]], [[Ilkley]], [[March, Cambridgeshire|March]] and [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]] have been taken over, and a couple of vacated Marks and Spencer stores in [[Grantham]] and [[South Shields]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Soult |first1=Graham |title=Five years on from Woolies\u2019 collapse, Boyes signs for the Coalville store |url=https://www.soultsretailview.co.uk/2013/11/26/five-years-on-from-woolies-collapse-boyes-signs-for-the-coalville-store/ |website=Soult\u2019s Retail View |accessdate=29 November 2019 |date=26 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years the company has relocated some of its branches to new locations in the same town. As well as the Bradford relocation, in 2017 the [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] store was relocated due to the original one being demolished for the building of a new [[Lidl]] supermarket.

William Boyes founded the firm in 1881 in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[North Yorkshire]] and it has been run by generations of the Boyes family ever since.\n\nThe company's slogan is \"for good value\" and the stores specialise in the discount retail sector, stocking a mixture of regular lines, one off special purchases and clearance items. Boyes stores stock over 30,000 products over a large range including household products, fashion and footwear.<ref name=\"auto3\">{{cite web |title=Boyes - Business to Business |url=https://www.boyes.co.uk/about-business-to-business/ |website=www.boyes.co.uk |accessdate=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIts full trading name is '''W Boyes and Co.

At the end of his apprenticeship, saving \u00a310 from his wages he opened his first store at the corner of Eastborough and Globe Street in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], selling remnants from merchants. The area was full of poverty, and the store was therefore popular with [[housewives]].\n\nTrade increased and William needed bigger premises to operate. Two corner units on Market Street and Queen Street were purchased in 1886. Further buildings were acquired and within ten years almost all of one side of Market Street was owned by Boyes. The store was named \u201cThe Remnant Warehouse\u201d and is still known as the Rem by older residents of Scarborough.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://imfromyorkshire.uk.com/made-in-yorkshire-volume-25-boyes/|title=Boyes - Made in Yorkshire - Volume 25|date=26 August 2015|website=I'm From Yorkshire|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref> In 1900 Boyes became a limited company when William and three friends, James Pirie, Henry Merrie Cross and JH Harrison invested in the business.<ref>{{cite web |title=Buying well, selling cheap still pays off |url=https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/6951008.buying-well-selling-cheap-still-pays-off/|date=24 May 2015|website=[[The Northern Echo]] |accessdate=15 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the years William added more products to the range and the store went from a warehouse to a department store.<ref>{{cite web |title=Boyes History |url=https://www.boyes.co.uk/boyes-history/ |website=www.boyes.co.uk |accessdate=4 November 2019}}</ref> The company began to expand to [[York]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] and [[Grimsby]] in the following years. Stores in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[North Shields]] were also opened, but closed in the [[Great Depression]].\n\nOn 26 February 1915, the store was destroyed by a huge fire, which is believed to be the biggest in Scarborough's history. It caused around \u00a370,000 of damage.

The store was destroyed by fire on 8 December 1910. The fire was thought to have begun in the toy department when gas lamps came into contact with Christmas decorations. The fire took six hours to put out, but all staff and customers were safely evacuated. Boyes moved temporarily to Clifford Street whilst their premises were being rebuilt. The fire is estimated to have caused \u00a320,000 of damage.\n\nThere was a delay to the rebuilding of the store in a tragic accident in February 1912. A workman was killed and seven others injured when a clock tower being built collapsed. The store reopened without a clock tower in December 1912.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/15026141.amazing-photos-from-1912-of-the-rebuilding-of-the-boyes-store-gutted-by-fire/|title=Amazing photos from 1912 of the rebuilding of the Boyes store gutted by fire...|newspaper=[[The Press (York)]]|date=16 January 2017|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe building was extended in 1966, and plans were made for it to be modernised in 1978.

The building was replaced with a new property on the same site and went by the Boyes name.\n\nThe store traded well and 1958 Boyes purchased five old properties further down Freeman Street and built a second store in their place. This store opened in May 1961.
