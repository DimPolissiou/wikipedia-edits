In 1773, the Hull Dock Company was formed and Hull's first dock built, on land formerly occupied by [[Hull town walls]]; in the next half century a ring of docks were built around the old down on the site of the former fortifications, known as the Town Docks \u2013  the first, The Dock (1778), (or The Old Dock, known as Queen's Dock after 1855), Humber Dock (1809), and Junction Dock (1829) \u2013 an extension, Railway Dock (1846) was opened to serve the newly built [[Hull and Selby Railway]].\n\nThe first dock east of the river, Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. Docks along the banks of the Humber to the west were begun in 1862 with the construction of the West Dock, later Albert Dock, the William Wright extension, opened in 1880, and a dock further west, St Andrew's Dock, opened in 1883. In 1885, a new eastern dock was built, Alexandra Dock, connected to a new railway line constructed by the same company, the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. In 1914, King George Dock was built jointly by the competing railway companies, the Hull and Barnsley company and the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]; this was extended in 1969 by the Queen Elizabeth Dock extension. As of 2016 Alexandra is being modernised for use in wind farm construction, with a factory, and estuary side quay under construction, a development known as Green Port Hull.\n\nThe Town Docks, Victoria Dock, and St Andrew's Dock fell out of use by the 1970s and were closed, some later infilled and redeveloped, with the Humber and Railway docks converted for leisure craft as [[Hull Marina]].\n\nOther facilities at the port included the Riverside Quay, built on the Humber banks at Albert Dock for passenger ferries and European trains, and the Corporation Pier, from which a [[Humber Ferry]] sailed to [[New Holland, Lincolnshire]]. Numerous industrial works were served by the River Hull, which also hosted a number of dry docks. To the east of Hull, [[Salt End]] near [[Hedon]] became a petroleum distribution point in the 20th&nbsp;century, with piers into the estuary for shipment, and later developed as a chemical works.\n\nAs of 2010, the main port is operated by [[Associated British Ports Holdings|Associated British Ports]] and is estimated to handle one million passengers per year; it is the main softwood timber importation port for the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm |archivedate = 16 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170337/http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm| title = Port of Hull| publisher = Associated British Ports |accessdate = 19 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|The Haven}}{{anchor|The Old Harbour}}\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hull.jpg|thumb|A 17th&nbsp;century map by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] showing position of various [[staithe]]s in the Haven and the [[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull|fortifications of the City Wall]].]]\nHull lies at a naturally advantageous position for a port, on the north side of the [[Humber Estuary]] to the west of a bend southwards giving rise to (on average) deeper water; and the [[River Hull]] flows out into the Humber at the same point.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=158}}<ref group=\"map\">{{Coord|53.738|-0.332|display=inline|type:landmark|name=Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary}} Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary</ref>\n\nAn important event in the history of Hull as a port was its acquisition by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].

The site for the proposed dock was on the Humber foreshore to the west of the River Hull. The Dock Company then proposed a larger dock at the same position, which was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1861{{#tag:ref|One clause of the Hull Docks Act of 1861 was that the Dock Company could be converted to a municipally owned dock trust by the Hull Corporation, additionally the dividends paid by the company were restricted: the Dock Company had been created as a private \"for profit\" company, and was subject to widespread prejudice in the town of Hull that it better served the interests of the shareholders rather than the port itself; the shareholders were characterised as being uninterested in the development of the port.<ref name=\"hh3\"/>|group=\"note\"}}<ref name=\"hh4\">{{harvnb|Sheahan|1864|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref> This dock was known as the Western Dock until its opening in 1869 when it was named Albert Dock; an extension William Wright Dock was opened 1880.<ref name=\"hh3\">{{harvnb|Allison|1969|loc= [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66776#s8 \"The Corporation and the Dock Company, 1835\u201370\"]}}</ref> A third dock (St Andrew's Dock) on the Humber foreshore west of the William Wright Dock was opened in 1883.<ref name=\"ner1\"/> All three docks where ideally suited for trans-shipment by rail as they were directly south of and parallel with the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Selby to Hull railway line]] that terminated in the centre of Hull.\n\nIn 1885, Alexandra Dock opened, which was owned and operated by the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. This ended the Dock Company's monopoly on dock facilities in Hull and led to price cutting competition between the two companies for dock charges; the Dock Company was operating at a loss and from 1886 sought to merge the company into a larger organisation \u2013 the obvious choice being the North Eastern Railway.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=707\u2013708}} In 1891 the Dock Company approached the North Eastern for capital to improve its Albert Dock, leading to the North Eastern Railway acquiring the shares and debts of the Dock Company in exchange for its shares. Instead of improving the Albert Dock, the North Eastern decided to expend a much greater sum on a new dock, east of the Alexandra Dock; however the proposal was opposed by both the Hull and Barnsley, and the Hull Corporation. The Dock Company and NER were legally amalgamated in 1893; one of the clauses of the Act of Parliament allowing the merger stipulated that about \u00a3500,000 would be spent on dock improvements over the next seven years.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=711\u2013715}}\n\nClauses in the 1893 amalgamation bill protecting the Hull and Barnsley company prevented the NER from creating a new deep water dock without consulting the H&BR. This led to a joint proposal for a dock east of Alexandra Dock being submitted, and passed in 1899, as the \"Hull Joint Dock Act\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=716\u2013721}} The new dock was opened in 1914 as the King George Dock.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|p=767}}\n\n===Dock ownership (1922\u2013)===\nThe Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1922,<ref name=\"gd\">{{harvnb|Parkes|1970|p=6}}</ref> making the docks in Hull the responsibility of a single company once again.

In 1962 the [[British Transport Docks Board]] was formed by the [[Transport Act 1962]]. In 1981 the company was privatised by the [[Transport Act 1981]], and [[Associated British Ports]] was formed.

It was not until the later 1760s until the [[Hull Corporation]] acted and employed surveyors to search for a suitable site for a new harbour; at the same time the [[HM Customs|Customs]] sought an end to the need to inspect cargoes handled at the private wharves, and so wished to have the customs procedures incorporated into a new dock or wharf \u2013 a \"legal quay\".{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Timperley|1836|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAn initial survey by [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]] and [[Joseph Robson]] recommended a new harbour on the east side of the River Hull. Though the established development on the east bank tended to preclude a new port there, the same interests were unwilling to see the focus of trade shift away from the west bank where they were already established. In the early 1770s, [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]] was contracted by agriculturalists owning land reliant on the drainage of the River Hull to assess the impact of the proposed new quay on the River Hull. Grundy's report of 1772 suggested either widening the river; or using the channel behind the [[Hull Citadel]], or the moat of the [[Hull town walls]] for both harbourage and drainage \u2013 Grundy also proposed the use of gates in the channel to afford both wet and dry docks.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=2\u20133}} Reports were prepared on the cost ([[John Wooler (engineer)|John Wooler]]) and effect on the river ([[John Smeaton]]) of Grundy's proposal for a quay on the site of the town's moat. The dock was costed at between \u00a355,000 and \u00a360,000, and the quay between \u00a311,000 and \u00a312,000; while Smeaton's report indicated no issues with arising in terms of the flow of the river. After both reports had been given in early 1773 the Corporation and Customs soon reached agreement to proceed with the plan. With limited opposition only on the grounds of effect on drainage an act for the construction was obtained in 1774.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe Old Dock, the first dock in Hull, was built between 1775 and 1778 to a design by [[Henry Berry]] and [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]]; [[Luke Holt]] acted as resident engineer, appointed on [[John Smeaton]]'s recommendation.<ref>Sources:\n*{{harvnb|Baldwin|1973|p=4}}\n*{{cite book|title = Port and harbour engineering| publisher = Ashgate| first = Adrian| last = Jarvis| year = 1998| page = 162|work = Studies in the history of civil engineering| number  =6| oclc = 237318455}}\n*{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Offfz1NSDt0C| title = Civil Engineering Heritage: Eastern and Central England| first = E.A.|last =  Labrum|publisher = Thomas Telford| year =  1994|isbn = 07277-1970-X|chapter = 2.

[[Humberside Fire and Rescue Service]] had initially warned nearby residents to close doors and windows as a precautionary measure, after a tank containing 580 tonnes of [[hydrochloric acid]] sprang a leak at the dock late in the day. By the early hours of 19 September 2017, firefighters confirmed that wind was blowing the vapour away from houses near the United Molasses site, where the leak occurred, and declared the area near the dock safe.\n\nHowever, within 24 hours emergency crews had returned to the site following a change in wind direction, and a number of emergency service vehicles, including an ambulance, could be seen waiting on standby nearby. The acid was later transferred on to tankers to be taken away safely. Eight people reported signs of feeling unwell as a result of the incident. Four were assessed at the scene and discharged immediately and four were taken to hospital for further assessment. All were ultimately discharged after showing no further symptoms.

In 1773, the Hull Dock Company was formed and Hull's first dock built, on land formerly occupied by [[Hull town walls]]; in the next half century a ring of docks were built around the old down on the site of the former fortifications, known as the Town Docks \u2013  the first, The Dock (1778), (or The Old Dock, known as Queen's Dock after 1855), Humber Dock (1809), and Junction Dock (1829) \u2013 an extension, Railway Dock (1846) was opened to serve the newly built [[Hull and Selby Railway]].\n\nThe first dock east of the river, Victoria Dock, opened in 1850. Docks along the banks of the Humber to the west were begun in 1862 with the construction of the West Dock, later Albert Dock, the William Wright extension, opened in 1880, and a dock further west, St Andrew's Dock, opened in 1883. In 1885, a new eastern dock was built, Alexandra Dock, connected to a new railway line constructed by the same company, the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. In 1914, King George Dock was built jointly by the competing railway companies, the Hull and Barnsley company and the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]]; this was extended in 1969 by the Queen Elizabeth Dock extension. As of 2016 Alexandra is being modernised for use in wind farm construction, with a factory, and estuary side quay under construction, a development known as Green Port Hull.\n\nThe Town Docks, Victoria Dock, and St Andrew's Dock fell out of use by the 1970s and were closed, some later infilled and redeveloped, with the Humber and Railway docks converted for leisure craft as [[Hull Marina]].\n\nOther facilities at the port included the Riverside Quay, built on the Humber banks at Albert Dock for passenger ferries and European trains, and the Corporation Pier, from which a [[Humber Ferry]] sailed to [[New Holland, Lincolnshire]]. Numerous industrial works were served by the River Hull, which also hosted a number of dry docks. To the east of Hull, [[Salt End]] near [[Hedon]] became a petroleum distribution point in the 20th&nbsp;century, with piers into the estuary for shipment, and later developed as a chemical works.\n\nAs of 2010, the main port is operated by [[Associated British Ports Holdings|Associated British Ports]] and is estimated to handle one million passengers per year; it is the main softwood timber importation port for the UK.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm |archivedate = 16 July 2011| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716170337/http://www.abports.co.uk/custinfo/ports/hull.htm| title = Port of Hull| publisher = Associated British Ports |accessdate = 19 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|The Haven}}{{anchor|The Old Harbour}}\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Hull.jpg|thumb|A 17th&nbsp;century map by [[Wenceslaus Hollar]] showing position of various [[staithe]]s in the Haven and the [[Fortifications of Kingston upon Hull|fortifications of the City Wall]].]]\nHull lies at a naturally advantageous position for a port, on the north side of the [[Humber Estuary]] to the west of a bend southwards giving rise to (on average) deeper water; and the [[River Hull]] flows out into the Humber at the same point.{{sfn|Lewis|1991|p=158}}<ref group=\"map\">{{Coord|53.738|-0.332|display=inline|type:landmark|name=Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary}} Confluence of River Hull and Humber Estuary</ref>\n\nAn important event in the history of Hull as a port was its acquisition by King [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].

The site for the proposed dock was on the Humber foreshore to the west of the River Hull. The Dock Company then proposed a larger dock at the same position, which was sanctioned by an Act of Parliament in 1861{{#tag:ref|One clause of the Hull Docks Act of 1861 was that the Dock Company could be converted to a municipally owned dock trust by the Hull Corporation, additionally the dividends paid by the company were restricted: the Dock Company had been created as a private \"for profit\" company, and was subject to widespread prejudice in the town of Hull that it better served the interests of the shareholders rather than the port itself; the shareholders were characterised as being uninterested in the development of the port.<ref name=\"hh3\"/>|group=\"note\"}}<ref name=\"hh4\">{{harvnb|Sheahan|1864|pp=293\u2013295}}</ref> This dock was known as the Western Dock until its opening in 1869 when it was named Albert Dock; an extension William Wright Dock was opened 1880.<ref name=\"hh3\">{{harvnb|Allison|1969|loc= [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66776#s8 \"The Corporation and the Dock Company, 1835\u201370\"]}}</ref> A third dock (St Andrew's Dock) on the Humber foreshore west of the William Wright Dock was opened in 1883.<ref name=\"ner1\"/> All three docks where ideally suited for trans-shipment by rail as they were directly south of and parallel with the [[Hull and Selby Railway|Selby to Hull railway line]] that terminated in the centre of Hull.\n\nIn 1885, Alexandra Dock opened, which was owned and operated by the [[Hull Barnsley & West Riding Junction Railway and Dock Company]]. This ended the Dock Company's monopoly on dock facilities in Hull and led to price cutting competition between the two companies for dock charges; the Dock Company was operating at a loss and from 1886 sought to merge the company into a larger organisation \u2013 the obvious choice being the North Eastern Railway.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=707\u2013708}} In 1891 the Dock Company approached the North Eastern for capital to improve its Albert Dock, leading to the North Eastern Railway acquiring the shares and debts of the Dock Company in exchange for its shares. Instead of improving the Albert Dock, the North Eastern decided to expend a much greater sum on a new dock, east of the Alexandra Dock; however the proposal was opposed by both the Hull and Barnsley, and the Hull Corporation. The Dock Company and NER were legally amalgamated in 1893; one of the clauses of the Act of Parliament allowing the merger stipulated that about \u00a3500,000 would be spent on dock improvements over the next seven years.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=711\u2013715}}\n\nClauses in the 1893 amalgamation bill protecting the Hull and Barnsley company prevented the NER from creating a new deep water dock without consulting the H&BR. This led to a joint proposal for a dock east of Alexandra Dock being submitted, and passed in 1899, as the \"Hull Joint Dock Act\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|pp=716\u2013721}} The new dock was opened in 1914 as the King George Dock.{{sfn|Tomlinson|1914|p=767}}\n\n===Dock ownership (1922\u2013)===\nThe Hull and Barnsley Railway became part of the North Eastern Railway in 1922,<ref name=\"gd\">{{harvnb|Parkes|1970|p=6}}</ref> making the docks in Hull the responsibility of a single company once again.

In 1962 the [[British Transport Docks Board]] was formed by the [[Transport Act 1962]]. In 1981 the company was privatised by the [[Transport Act 1981]], and [[Associated British Ports]] was formed.

It was not until the later 1760s until the [[Hull Corporation]] acted and employed surveyors to search for a suitable site for a new harbour; at the same time the [[HM Customs|Customs]] sought an end to the need to inspect cargoes handled at the private wharves, and so wished to have the customs procedures incorporated into a new dock or wharf \u2013 a \"legal quay\".{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=1\u20132}}{{sfn|Timperley|1836|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAn initial survey by [[Robert Mylne (architect)|Robert Mylne]] and [[Joseph Robson]] recommended a new harbour on the east side of the River Hull. Though the established development on the east bank tended to preclude a new port there, the same interests were unwilling to see the focus of trade shift away from the west bank where they were already established. In the early 1770s, [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]] was contracted by agriculturalists owning land reliant on the drainage of the River Hull to assess the impact of the proposed new quay on the River Hull. Grundy's report of 1772 suggested either widening the river; or using the channel behind the [[Hull Citadel]], or the moat of the [[Hull town walls]] for both harbourage and drainage \u2013 Grundy also proposed the use of gates in the channel to afford both wet and dry docks.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=2\u20133}} Reports were prepared on the cost ([[John Wooler (engineer)|John Wooler]]) and effect on the river ([[John Smeaton]]) of Grundy's proposal for a quay on the site of the town's moat. The dock was costed at between \u00a355,000 and \u00a360,000, and the quay between \u00a311,000 and \u00a312,000; while Smeaton's report indicated no issues with arising in terms of the flow of the river. After both reports had been given in early 1773 the Corporation and Customs soon reached agreement to proceed with the plan. With limited opposition only on the grounds of effect on drainage an act for the construction was obtained in 1774.{{sfn|Baldwin|1973|pp=3\u20134}}\n\nThe Old Dock, the first dock in Hull, was built between 1775 and 1778 to a design by [[Henry Berry]] and [[John Grundy, Jr.|John Grundy]]; [[Luke Holt]] acted as resident engineer, appointed on [[John Smeaton]]'s recommendation.<ref>Sources:\n*{{harvnb|Baldwin|1973|p=4}}\n*{{cite book|title = Port and harbour engineering| publisher = Ashgate| first = Adrian| last = Jarvis| year = 1998| page = 162|work = Studies in the history of civil engineering| number  =6| oclc = 237318455}}\n*{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Offfz1NSDt0C| title = Civil Engineering Heritage: Eastern and Central England| first = E.A.|last =  Labrum|publisher = Thomas Telford| year =  1994|isbn = 07277-1970-X|chapter = 2.

[[Humberside Fire and Rescue Service]] had initially warned nearby residents to close doors and windows as a precautionary measure, after a tank containing 580 tonnes of [[hydrochloric acid]] sprang a leak at the dock late in the day. By the early hours of 19 September 2017, firefighters confirmed that wind was blowing the vapour away from houses near the United Molasses site, where the leak occurred, and declared the area near the dock safe.\n\nHowever, within 24 hours emergency crews had returned to the site following a change in wind direction, and a number of emergency service vehicles, including an ambulance, could be seen waiting on standby nearby. The acid was later transferred on to tankers to be taken away safely. Eight people reported signs of feeling unwell as a result of the incident. Four were assessed at the scene and discharged immediately and four were taken to hospital for further assessment. All were ultimately discharged after showing no further symptoms.

This situation results in [[biotin deficiency]].\n\nBiotin, also called vitamin B<sub>7</sub>, is an important water-soluble nutrient that aids in the [[metabolism]] of [[fat]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[protein]]s.  Biotin deficiency can result in behavioral disorders, lack of coordination, learning disabilities and [[seizure]]s. Biotin supplementation can alleviate and sometimes totally stop such symptoms.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms of a biotinidase deficiency can appear several days after birth. These include [[seizure]]s, [[hypotonia]] and muscle/limb weakness, [[ataxia]], [[paresis]], [[hearing loss]], [[optic atrophy]], skin rashes (including [[seborrheic dermatitis]] and [[psoriasis]]), and [[alopecia]]. If left untreated, the disorder can rapidly lead to [[coma]] and death.\n\nBiotinidase deficiency can also appear later in life. This is referred to as \"late-onset\" biotinidase deficiency. The symptoms are similar, but perhaps more mild, because if an individual survives the neonatal period they likely have some residual activity of biotin-related enzymes.

[[Biotinidase]] is the [[enzyme]] that is made by the ''BTD'' gene. Many mutations that cause the enzyme to be nonfunctional or to be produced at extremely low levels have been identified. Biotin is a vitamin that is chemically bound to proteins. (Most vitamins are only loosely associated with proteins.) Without biotinidase activity, the vitamin biotin cannot be separated from foods and therefore cannot be used by the body. Another function of the biotinidase enzyme is to recycle biotin from enzymes that are important in metabolism (processing of substances in cells). When biotin is lacking, specific enzymes called carboxylases cannot process certain proteins, fats, or carbohydrates. Specifically, two essential branched-chain [[amino acids]] ([[leucine]] and [[isoleucine]]) are metabolized differently.\n\nIndividuals lacking functional biotinidase enzymes can still have normal carboxylase activity if they ingest adequate amounts of biotin. The standard treatment regimen calls for 5\u201310&nbsp;mg of biotin per day.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Barry |last1=Wolf |year=2011 |chapter=Biotinidase Deficiency |chapterurl=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1322/ |editor1-first=Roberta A |editor1-last=Pagon |editor2-first=Thomas D |editor2-last=Bird |editor3-first=Cynthia R |editor3-last=Dolan |editor4-first=Karen |editor4-last=Stephens |displayeditors=etal |title=GeneReviews}}{{Page needed|date=April 2011}}</ref>\n\nBiotinidase deficiency is inherited in an [[autosomal recessive]] pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an [[autosome]], and two copies of the defective gene - one from each parent - must be inherited for a person to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are usually not affected by the disorder, but are carriers of one copy of the defective gene.  If both parents are carriers for the biotinidase deficiency, there is a 25% chance that their child will be born with it, a 50% chance the child will be a carrier, and a 25% chance the child will be unaffected.\n\nThe chromosomal locus is at 3p25. The ''BTD'' gene has 4 exons of lengths 79 bp, 265 bp, 150 bp and 1502 bp, respectively.  There are at least 21 different mutations that have been found to lead to biotinidase deficiency. The most common mutations in severe biotinidase deficiency (<10% normal enzyme activity) are: p.Cys33PhefsX36, p.Gln456His, p.Arg538Cys, p.Asp444His, and p.[Ala171Thr;Asp444His]. Almost all individuals with partial biotinidase deficiency (10-30% enzyme activity) have the mutation p.Asp444His in one [[allele]] of the ''BTD'' gene in combination with a second allele.<ref>{{cite report|title=Biotinidase Deficiency|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1322/ | accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nSymptoms of the deficiency are caused by the inability to reuse biotin molecules that are needed for cell growth, production of fatty acids and the metabolism of fats and amino acids. If left untreated, the symptoms can lead to later problems such as comas or death. Unless treatment is administered on a regular basis, symptoms can return at any point during the lifespan.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nBiotinidase deficiency can be found by genetic testing.  This is often done at birth as part of [[newborn screening]] in several states throughout the United States.  Results are found through testing a small amount of blood gathered through a heel prick of the infant.  As not all states require that this test be done, it is often skipped in those where such testing is not required.  Biotinidase deficiency can also be found by sequencing the ''BTD'' gene, particularly in those with a family history or known familial gene mutation.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment is possible but unless continued daily, problems may arise. Currently, this is done through supplementation of 5\u201310&nbsp;mg of oral biotin a day. If symptoms have begun to show, standard treatments can take care of them, such as hearing aids for poor hearing.\n===Dietary Concerns===\nRaw eggs should be avoided in those with [[biotin]] deficiency, because egg whites contain high levels of the anti-nutrient [[avidin]]. The name avidin literally means that this protein has an \"avidity\" (Latin: \"to eagerly long for\") for biotin. Avidin binds irreversibly to biotin and this compound is then excreted in the urine.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nBased on the results of worldwide screening of biotinidase deficiency in 1991, the incidence of the disorder is:\n5 in 137,401 for profound biotinidase deficiency\n*One in 109,921 for partial biotinidase deficiency\n*One in 61,067 for the combined incidence of profound and partial biotinidase deficiency\n*Carrier frequency in the general population is approximately one in 120.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Biotin]]\n*[[Biotin deficiency]]\n*[[Multiple carboxylase deficiency]]\n*[[Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency]]\n*[[3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Dobrowolski |first1=Steven F. |last2=Angeletti |first2=Janine |last3=Banas |first3=Richard A. |last4=Naylor |first4=Edwin W. |title=Real time PCR assays to detect common mutations in the biotinidase gene and application of mutational analysis to newborn screening for biotinidase deficiency |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=100\u20137 |year=2003 |pmid=12618081 |doi=10.1016/S1096-7192(02)00231-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=McMahon |first1=Robert J. |title=Biotin in metabolism and molecular biology |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=22 |pages=221\u201339 |year=2002 |pmid=12055344 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.22.121101.112819}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=C.

Avidin binds irreversibly to biotin and this compound is then excreted in the urine.\n\n==Epidemiology==\nBased on the results of worldwide screening of biotinidase deficiency in 1991, the incidence of the disorder is:\n5 in 137,401 for profound biotinidase deficiency\n*One in 109,921 for partial biotinidase deficiency\n*One in 61,067 for the combined incidence of profound and partial biotinidase deficiency\n*Carrier frequency in the general population is approximately one in 120.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Biotin]]\n*[[Biotin deficiency]]\n*[[Multiple carboxylase deficiency]]\n*[[Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency]]\n*[[3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal |last1=Dobrowolski |first1=Steven F. |last2=Angeletti |first2=Janine |last3=Banas |first3=Richard A. |last4=Naylor |first4=Edwin W. |title=Real time PCR assays to detect common mutations in the biotinidase gene and application of mutational analysis to newborn screening for biotinidase deficiency |journal=Molecular Genetics and Metabolism |volume=78 |issue=2 |pages=100\u20137 |year=2003 |pmid=12618081 |doi=10.1016/S1096-7192(02)00231-7}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=McMahon |first1=Robert J. |title=Biotin in metabolism and molecular biology |journal=Annual Review of Nutrition |volume=22 |pages=221\u201339 |year=2002 |pmid=12055344 |doi=10.1146/annurev.nutr.22.121101.112819}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=C.

The more heroes gathered, the greater the special morph powers can be. At the cost of depleting their battery meter, players can use \"Unite Morph\" forms to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or traverse the environment. The meter can be recharged by performing normal attacks or by picking up batteries dropped by a defeated enemy. Enemies will also drop \"O parts\" (the in-game currency used to buy upgrades), new \"Unite Morph\" abilities and items. To transform the horde of heroes, the appropriate symbol is drawn on the [[Wii U GamePad]]'s touchscreen or right [[analog stick]], such as an \u201cL\u201d for a gun or a squiggly line for a whip.

The only hope for humanity is the Wonderful Ones, a group of superheroes working for the CENTINELS Planetary Secret Service, an organization created by the United Nations.\n\n===Characters===\nThe main protagonists are Will Wedgewood (Wonder-Red), a Blossom City elementary school teacher and the leader of the Wonderful Ones, whose father Arthur is killed by Laambo; Eliot Hooker (Wonder-Blue), a police detective whose older brother is killed by Vijounne; guns expert Jean-Sebastain Renault (Wonder-Green); fashion modeler Mariana Kretzulesco (Wonder-Pink); Russian soldier Ivan Istochinkov (Wonder-Yellow); ninja-in-training Momoe Byakkoin (Wonder-White); and video game player Krishna Ramanujan (Wonder-Black).\n\nThe supporting characters are P-Star, a robot who assists the heroes; Laurence Nelson (Wonder-Captain), the commander of the CENTINELS who was previously known as Wonder-Red; Virgin Victory operator Alice MacGregor; and science chief James Shirogane. Luka Alan Smithee is a Blossom City Elementary School student whose scientist mother, Margarita, died working for the CENTINELS and gave her life so that the artificial intelligence, Mother Platinum, could sustain the Earth's defensive shield. Luka joins the group and becomes Wonder-Goggles at the end of the game. The last member of the Galactic Police Federation is Immorta; her brother, Prince Vorkken, lived at the Roaming Comet Rhullo, but was brainwashed by Gimme, an alien who plants a virus in the form of a bio-weapon insect named Vaaiki on Vorkken's body. Vorkken becomes the space pirate leader of the Guyzoch and sides with Chewgi. The main villain is Jergingha, the supreme overlord of the Geathjerk Federation, who is attempting to use Chi-Q to take back the galaxy from humanity.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story opens with a school bus full of children being attacked by alien invaders known as the Geathjerk. The teacher, Mr. Wedgewood, transforms into the superhero Wonder-Red and teams up with the other superheroes to destroy the aliens with Unite Morph powers. One student, however, Luka, appears disillusioned and expresses his hate for both the heroes and the aliens.\n\nThe heroes then meet on their flagship to plan their defences. The Earth is protected from invasion by a shield, powered by five Super Reactors. The heroes must travel around the world to protect these reactors and destroy the aliens who slip through the shield. As they travel, they meet up with Professor Shirogane, who explains that once the reactors are safe, they will use an orbiting cannon, the Shirogane Comet, to destroy the remainder of the aliens. Along the way, Wonder-Red struggles to lead his team, particularly Wonder-Blue, whose brother was killed by one of the alien leaders, Vijounne. Blue's desire for revenge causes several problems until Red convinces him to cooperate with the team. Also, Luka stows away on the ship and the heroes are forced to bring him along to keep him safe.\n\nThe heroes also repeatedly fight the space pirate Prince Vorkken and his first mate Chewgi. Vorkken is searching for the strongest fighters in the galaxy so that he can have the strength to get revenge on the Geathjerk. Vorkken fights with Unite Morph attacks similar to those of the heroes and serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Wonder-Red in their encounters. With the help of Vorkken's sister, Immorta, the heroes defeat him, and Wonder-Red convinces Vorkken that his desire for revenge has turned him evil.\n\nAt the climax of the story, Luka betrays the heroes and joins the aliens, revealing that his pendant is the key that controls the Super Reactors. Luka explains that his mother died working on the shield that protects the Earth and he wants the aliens to destroy the Earth to get revenge for the loss of his mother. Wonder-Red however, announces that Luka's mother is still alive: she turned herself into Mother Platinum, the computer system that controls Earth's defences. Luka abandons his desire for revenge and Mother Platinum gathers pieces of the destroyed city to create a giant robot named \"Platinum Robo\". Using the robot, the heroes fight their way to the Shirogane Comet and fire its cannon, destroying the invading fleet. Jergingha, leader of the aliens, does not give up and returns in a gigantic fortress with an even bigger fleet. Platinum Robo flies to attack the fortress, while Chewgi and Vorkken arrive to help break through its defences. Upon being confronted, Jerrgingha reveals the Geathjerk are actually from 1,500 years in the future where Earth becomes an evil empire called the Greater Galactic Coelition, which has destroyed the homeworlds of the Geathjerk leaders. Geathjerk has come back in time to destroy Earth to prevent the Coelition from ever existing. Jergingha's fortress turns into a giant robot, even bigger than Platinum Robo, but the Wonderful Ones, Immorta, and Vorkken all combine their power and destroy it, saving the world. The Guyzoch leave with Vorkken to help rebuild the worlds they attacked. The Wonderful Ones vow to make sure Earth never becomes an Evil Empire like Jergingah seemingly predicted. Luka joins the Wonderful 100 to help make up for his mistakes. As a result, the team is renamed to the \"Wonderful 101\".\n\nThe epilogue shows Luka (now \"Wonder-Goggles\") and the other heroes saving a school bus from the aliens, paralleling the game's opening.  The story ends with the heroes continuing their fight against the remaining Geathjerk.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of what would become ''The Wonderful 101'' began during the lifetime of the [[Wii]]. The original idea came from PlatinumGames' president, Tatsuya Minami, who wanted to bring a group of popular or iconic video game characters together in one game. Because different gamers would prefer certain characters over others, the idea of being forced to play as a certain character at various points in the game was quickly scrapped. Instead, all of the characters would be on-screen at once so the player could choose between them at any time. PlatinumGames initially thought of using Nintendo first-party characters, who would work together to get past obstacles, but when the idea was presented to Nintendo, they questioned how the mechanic would fill an entire game. Director [[Hideki Kamiya]] also doubted that the \"conflicting elements\" of the different Nintendo characters could be successfully \"put into a consistent formula\" like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. Further brainstorming was put on hold while he worked on another game, but when progress on that game was halted a year later, work on ''The Wonderful 101'' resumed. Kamiya decided to use the Japanese ''henshin'' / transforming theme, with a group of five original heroes who could unite and transform into various weapons. Soon the group expanded to one hundred heroes and the Japanese superhero style changed to \"an American comic book vibe\".\n\nThe game's design document was released by Platinum after stretch goals in the Kickstarter campaign for the remaster were met.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wonderful Wednesday #1: The Pitch Document |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/platinumgames/the-wonderful-101-remastered/posts/2747969 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |language=en |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Alistair |title=Hideki Kamiya Reveals The Wonderful 101 Design Document |url=https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-reveals-the-wonderful-101-design-document/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the developers had been thinking of making the game for the Wii, when PlatinumGames and Nintendo finalized their partnership, it became Wii U-exclusive. The developers wanted to use the console's unique features effectively, so they came up with drawing on the GamePad as a way to activate the \"Unite Morphs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |title=Wonderful 101 and a World Without Genres |author=Parish, Jeremy |date=September 9, 2013 |website=US Gamer |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909185557/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |archive-date=September 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |title=Hideki Kamiya Interview: Wonderful 101, the Bayonetta 2 Controversy, His Twitter Account and More... |date=August 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060526/https://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |website=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media |accessdate=September 12, 2013  |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe music in this game is an orchestrated score, written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Akira Takizawa, Hitomi Kurokawa, [[Norihiko Hibino]], Masato Kouda, and Rei Kondoh.

Two days later, however, Kamiya posted on [[Twitter]] that he was worried about the lack of marketing for ''The Wonderful 101''. He was referring to the lack of information in magazines or websites, and claimed that the game took almost 1.5 times the resources and manpower as Platinum's biggest game, ''[[Bayonetta]]''.

Nintendo only wanted to publish a new game if it was going to be exclusive to Nintendo Switch, while Platinum wanted the remaster to be on more platforms. Nintendo allowed them to do it, though they wouldn't publish the remaster. This gave Platinum the opportunity to try self-publishing. With the game nearly in a complete state for these new ports, they opted to use Kickstarter not only to judge how popular the game was, and thus mitigate the Kickstarter's stretch goals based on this, but also that there was still a necessary business element to self-publishing that the Kickstarter funds would help cover and deal with risks involved with publishing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Andy |title=Interview: Platinum explains why it\u2019s crowdfunding The Wonderful 101 Remastered |url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |website=[[Video Games Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 3, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203210210/https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |archivedate=February 3, 2020 |date=February 3, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Studio executive director Atsushi Inaba affirmed the Kickstarter was not about money for development but as a means to bring the community together and to make sure what additional content they could bring to the base game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Haydn |title=PlatinumGames: The Wonderful 101 Kickstarter wasn't about the money |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-02-platinum-games-the-wonderful-101-kickstarter-wasnt-about-the-money |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |language=en |date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> Among other cosmetic updates, Platinum had devised a way to take the two-screen approach that had been used on the Wii U version (including the picture-in-picture) into a version that will work on the single-screen platforms.

The game was directed by [[Hideki Kamiya]] and produced by [[Atsushi Inaba]]; the pair also worked together on the ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' series and ''[[\u014ckami]]''. It was released in August 2013 in all major regions except North America, where it released the following month. ''The Wonderful 101'' received generally positive reviews, but failed to meet sales expectations.\n\nIn February 2020, PlatinumGames announced a remastered version for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[PlayStation 4]], financed through [[crowdfunding]], with a planned release in May 2020.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:The Wonderful 101 Unite Morph battle screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of an earlier version of the game depicting a \"Unite Morph\" ability used to battle an opponent. The heroes have combined to form \"Unite Hand\", which is shown punching a large enemy called the Diedough-Goo.]]\n\nIn ''The Wonderful 101'', players control a horde of superheroes from an [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|isometric]] viewpoint and can turn them into various objects called \"Unite Morphs.\" As levels progress, players must explore each stage to find helpless citizens and recruit them to join their army of heroes. The more heroes gathered, the greater the special morph powers can be. At the cost of depleting their battery meter, players can use \"Unite Morph\" forms to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, or traverse the environment. The meter can be recharged by performing normal attacks or by picking up batteries dropped by a defeated enemy. Enemies will also drop \"O parts\" (the in-game currency used to buy upgrades), new \"Unite Morph\" abilities and items. To transform the horde of heroes, the appropriate symbol is drawn on the [[Wii U GamePad]]'s touchscreen or right [[analog stick]], such as an \u201cL\u201d for a gun or a squiggly line for a whip. In specified areas, the GamePad (by default) is used to change the view to a traditional, third-person angle and better explore tighter environments, such as those found indoors and inside caves.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |title=Nintendo All-Access @ E3 2012 - Games |website=E3.nintendo.com |accessdate=July 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920061728/http://e3.nintendo.com/games/#/wiiu/projectp-100 |archivedate=September 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"nintendolife2\">{{cite web |last=Meyer |first=Lee |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101/ |title=Hands On: The Wonderful 101 |work=Nintendo Life |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920093231/http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/06/hands_on_the_wonderful_101 |archive-date=September 20, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Wii-U/The-Wonderful-101-641216.html |title=The Wonderful 101 |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=July 9, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe single-player campaign is broken into levels. Each level ends with a grade depending on a number of factors, such as how long it takes the player to complete the level and how much damage was taken by the player.

The only hope for humanity is the Wonderful Ones, a group of superheroes working for the CENTINELS Planetary Secret Service, an organization created by the United Nations.\n\n===Characters===\nThe main protagonists are Will Wedgewood (Wonder-Red), a Blossom City elementary school teacher and the leader of the Wonderful Ones, whose father Arthur is killed by Laambo; Eliot Hooker (Wonder-Blue), a police detective whose older brother is killed by Vijounne; guns expert Jean-Sebastain Renault (Wonder-Green); fashion modeler Mariana Kretzulesco (Wonder-Pink); Russian soldier Ivan Istochinkov (Wonder-Yellow); ninja-in-training Momoe Byakkoin (Wonder-White); and video game player Krishna Ramanujan (Wonder-Black).\n\nThe supporting characters are P-Star, a robot who assists the heroes; Laurence Nelson (Wonder-Captain), the commander of the CENTINELS who was previously known as Wonder-Red; Virgin Victory operator Alice MacGregor; and science chief James Shirogane. Luka Alan Smithee is a Blossom City Elementary School student whose scientist mother, Margarita, died working for the CENTINELS and gave her life so that the artificial intelligence, Mother Platinum, could sustain the Earth's defensive shield. Luka joins the group and becomes Wonder-Goggles at the end of the game. The last member of the Galactic Police Federation is Immorta; her brother, Prince Vorkken, lived at the Roaming Comet Rhullo, but was brainwashed by Gimme, an alien who plants a virus in the form of a bio-weapon insect named Vaaiki on Vorkken's body. Vorkken becomes the space pirate leader of the Guyzoch and sides with Chewgi. The main villain is Jergingha, the supreme overlord of the Geathjerk Federation, who is attempting to use Chi-Q to take back the galaxy from humanity.\n\n===Plot===\nThe story opens with a school bus full of children being attacked by alien invaders known as the Geathjerk. The teacher, Mr. Wedgewood, transforms into the superhero Wonder-Red and teams up with the other superheroes to destroy the aliens with Unite Morph powers. One student, however, Luka, appears disillusioned and expresses his hate for both the heroes and the aliens.\n\nThe heroes then meet on their flagship to plan their defences. The Earth is protected from invasion by a shield, powered by five Super Reactors. The heroes must travel around the world to protect these reactors and destroy the aliens who slip through the shield. As they travel, they meet up with Professor Shirogane, who explains that once the reactors are safe, they will use an orbiting cannon, the Shirogane Comet, to destroy the remainder of the aliens. Along the way, Wonder-Red struggles to lead his team, particularly Wonder-Blue, whose brother was killed by one of the alien leaders, Vijounne. Blue's desire for revenge causes several problems until Red convinces him to cooperate with the team. Also, Luka stows away on the ship and the heroes are forced to bring him along to keep him safe.\n\nThe heroes also repeatedly fight the space pirate Prince Vorkken and his first mate Chewgi. Vorkken is searching for the strongest fighters in the galaxy so that he can have the strength to get revenge on the Geathjerk. Vorkken fights with Unite Morph attacks similar to those of the heroes and serves as a [[Foil (literature)|foil]] to Wonder-Red in their encounters. With the help of Vorkken's sister, Immorta, the heroes defeat him, and Wonder-Red convinces Vorkken that his desire for revenge has turned him evil.\n\nAt the climax of the story, Luka betrays the heroes and joins the aliens, revealing that his pendant is the key that controls the Super Reactors. Luka explains that his mother died working on the shield that protects the Earth and he wants the aliens to destroy the Earth to get revenge for the loss of his mother. Wonder-Red however, announces that Luka's mother is still alive: she turned herself into Mother Platinum, the computer system that controls Earth's defences. Luka abandons his desire for revenge and Mother Platinum gathers pieces of the destroyed city to create a giant robot named \"Platinum Robo\". Using the robot, the heroes fight their way to the Shirogane Comet and fire its cannon, destroying the invading fleet. Jergingha, leader of the aliens, does not give up and returns in a gigantic fortress with an even bigger fleet. Platinum Robo flies to attack the fortress, while Chewgi and Vorkken arrive to help break through its defences. Upon being confronted, Jerrgingha reveals the Geathjerk are actually from 1,500 years in the future where Earth becomes an evil empire called the Greater Galactic Coelition, which has destroyed the homeworlds of the Geathjerk leaders. Geathjerk has come back in time to destroy Earth to prevent the Coelition from ever existing. Jergingha's fortress turns into a giant robot, even bigger than Platinum Robo, but the Wonderful Ones, Immorta, and Vorkken all combine their power and destroy it, saving the world. The Guyzoch leave with Vorkken to help rebuild the worlds they attacked. The Wonderful Ones vow to make sure Earth never becomes an Evil Empire like Jergingah seemingly predicted. Luka joins the Wonderful 100 to help make up for his mistakes. As a result, the team is renamed to the \"Wonderful 101\".\n\nThe epilogue shows Luka (now \"Wonder-Goggles\") and the other heroes saving a school bus from the aliens, paralleling the game's opening.  The story ends with the heroes continuing their fight against the remaining Geathjerk.\n\n==Development==\nThe development of what would become ''The Wonderful 101'' began during the lifetime of the [[Wii]]. The original idea came from PlatinumGames' president, Tatsuya Minami, who wanted to bring a group of popular or iconic video game characters together in one game. Because different gamers would prefer certain characters over others, the idea of being forced to play as a certain character at various points in the game was quickly scrapped. Instead, all of the characters would be on-screen at once so the player could choose between them at any time. PlatinumGames initially thought of using Nintendo first-party characters, who would work together to get past obstacles, but when the idea was presented to Nintendo, they questioned how the mechanic would fill an entire game. Director [[Hideki Kamiya]] also doubted that the \"conflicting elements\" of the different Nintendo characters could be successfully \"put into a consistent formula\" like in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series. Further brainstorming was put on hold while he worked on another game, but when progress on that game was halted a year later, work on ''The Wonderful 101'' resumed. Kamiya decided to use the Japanese ''henshin'' / transforming theme, with a group of five original heroes who could unite and transform into various weapons. Soon the group expanded to one hundred heroes and the Japanese superhero style changed to \"an American comic book vibe\".\n\nThe game's design document was released by Platinum after stretch goals in the Kickstarter campaign for the remaster were met.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wonderful Wednesday #1: The Pitch Document |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/platinumgames/the-wonderful-101-remastered/posts/2747969 |website=[[Kickstarter]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |language=en |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wong |first1=Alistair |title=Hideki Kamiya Reveals The Wonderful 101 Design Document |url=https://www.siliconera.com/hideki-kamiya-reveals-the-wonderful-101-design-document/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=February 5, 2020 |date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the developers had been thinking of making the game for the Wii, when PlatinumGames and Nintendo finalized their partnership, it became Wii U-exclusive. The developers wanted to use the console's unique features effectively, so they came up with drawing on the GamePad as a way to activate the \"Unite Morphs\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |title=Wonderful 101 and a World Without Genres |author=Parish, Jeremy |date=September 9, 2013 |website=US Gamer |accessdate=September 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160909185557/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/wonderful-101-and-a-world-without-genres |archive-date=September 9, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |title=Hideki Kamiya Interview: Wonderful 101, the Bayonetta 2 Controversy, His Twitter Account and More... |date=August 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060526/https://www.videogamer.com/wiiu/the_wonderful_101/features/article/hideki_kamiya_interview_wonderful_101_the_bayonetta_2_controversy_his_twitter_account_and_more.html |website=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media |accessdate=September 12, 2013  |archivedate=March 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2020}}\nThe music in this game is an orchestrated score, written by Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Akira Takizawa, Hitomi Kurokawa, [[Norihiko Hibino]], Masato Kouda, and Rei Kondoh.

On July 3, 2013, Nintendo introduced their \"Wonderful Wednesday\" social networking campaign to promote ''The Wonderful 101'', where on each Wednesday leading up to the game's launch, they release a new character portrait. Two days later, however, Kamiya posted on [[Twitter]] that he was worried about the lack of marketing for ''The Wonderful 101''. He was referring to the lack of information in magazines or websites, and claimed that the game took almost 1.5 times the resources and manpower as Platinum's biggest game, ''[[Bayonetta]]''.

Nintendo allowed them to do it, though they wouldn't publish the remaster. This gave Platinum the opportunity to try self-publishing. With the game nearly in a complete state for these new ports, they opted to use Kickstarter not only to judge how popular the game was, and thus mitigate the Kickstarter's stretch goals based on this, but also that there was still a necessary business element to self-publishing that the Kickstarter funds would help cover and deal with risks involved with publishing.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Andy |title=Interview: Platinum explains why it\u2019s crowdfunding The Wonderful 101 Remastered |url=https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |website=[[Video Games Chronicle]] |accessdate=February 3, 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200203210210/https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/wonderful-101-remastered/ |archivedate=February 3, 2020 |date=February 3, 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> Studio executive director Atsushi Inaba affirmed the Kickstarter was not about money for development but as a means to bring the community together and to make sure what additional content they could bring to the base game.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Haydn |title=PlatinumGames: The Wonderful 101 Kickstarter wasn't about the money |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-03-02-platinum-games-the-wonderful-101-kickstarter-wasnt-about-the-money |website=[[GamesIndustry.biz]] |accessdate=March 7, 2020 |language=en |date=March 2, 2020}}</ref> Among other cosmetic updates, Platinum had devised a way to take the two-screen approach that had been used on the Wii U version (including the picture-in-picture) into a version that will work on the single-screen platforms.

The sequel, developed by Maxis, takes place in a full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment as opposed to the [[dimetric projection]] of the original game. Sims age through seven life stages, from infancy to old age and subsequent death. Another major feature is the aspiration system. Each Sim exhibits wants and fears according to its aspiration and personality. Consequently, the level of the aspiration meter determines the effectiveness of a Sim at completing tasks. The fulfillment of wants provides aspiration points, which can be used to purchase aspiration rewards. In addition, the game features clear days of the week, with weekends when children can stay home from school and vacation days when adults can take time off work.\n\n''The Sims 2'' is set some 25 years after the original game. For instance, the Goth family has aged significantly with Bella Goth mysteriously vanishing (\"dying\") at some point in the 25-year period. Because the entire game has progressed from 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to [[3D modeling|3D models]], all content in ''The Sims 2'' had to be created from the ground up. Due to this, ''The Sims 2'' was not made backwards-compatible with any content from the first generation of the main series. However, some objects and features from the original series were remade for the sequel.\n\nElectronic Arts released [[The Sims 2 Expansion Compilation|eight expansion packs]] and [[The Sims 2 Stuff packs|nine stuff packs]] for ''The Sims 2''. Over 400 items were also released for the game via ''The Sims 2'' Store. In addition, items including pre-order items were released over the life cycle of this generation.\n\n====''The Sims 3''====\n{{Main|The Sims 3}}\nElectronic Arts released ''[[The Sims 3]]'' on June 2, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sims 3|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/936498-the-sims-3/index.html|work=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> The sequel was announced by EA in November 2006. The game is set 25 years prior to the original game, and features an open, seamless neighborhood, improved tools for Sim creation, enhanced build and buy mode functions, and the introduction of wishes and goals. The game introduced a new form of directed gameplay through small, step-wise goals presented as opportunities which the player may choose to pursue or refuse. ''The Sims 3'' sold 1.4 million copies in the first week, making it the largest release in PC gaming history at the time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Jim|title=The Sims 3 Dominating PC Software Sales|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2009/07/13/the-sims-3-dominating-pc-software-sales|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=IGN|date=July 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[The Sims 3 Expansion Packs|Eleven expansion packs]] and [[The Sims 3 Stuff packs|nine stuff packs]] were released for the third generation of the series.

''The Sims 4'' takes place in an alternative setting from the previous installment of the game. Later in 2014, further details on features and gameplay were announced. A release date of September 2, 2014 was announced at E3 2014.\n\nAs of November 2019, eight expansion packs have been released: Get To Work, Get Together, City Living, Cats and Dogs, Seasons, Get Famous, Island Living, and Discover University. There are eight game packs, and fifteen stuff packs have been released for the fourth generation of the series. Updates have added content that was previously absent due to time restraints, such as basements, ghosts, pools, modular stairs, toddlers and terrain tools. New careers have also been added.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n====''The Sims Online''====\n{{Main|The Sims Online}}\nIn December 2002, Electronic Arts released the Maxis-developed ''[[The Sims Online]]'', which was later named ''EA Land''. It recreates ''The Sims'' as a [[massively multiplayer online game]], where human players can interact with each other. The spin-off did not achieve the same level of success as the original. Reviews for ''The Sims Online'' were lackluster. Many reviewers likened ''The Sims Online'' experience to an enormous [[chat room]]. On August 1, 2008, EA-Land's shops were closed.\n\n====''The Sims Stories''====\n{{Main|The Sims Life Stories|The Sims Pet Stories|The Sims Castaway Stories}}\n''The Sims Stories'' is a series of video games from ''The Sims'' series released in 2007\u20132008 that is based on a modified version of ''The Sims 2'' engine. The modified game engine is optimized for play on systems with weaker specifications such as [[laptop]]s. As such, its system requirements are lower than that of ''The Sims 2'', but it can still be played on [[desktop computer|desktops]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php|title=About \u2013 ''The Sims Stories''|publisher=The Sims 2 (EA)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011252/http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 31, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series is introduced mainly for three segments of the market: those who wish to play ''The Sims 2'' on their laptops (which usually have lower specifications); those who wish to engage in other activities such as instant messaging while playing the game, and; those who are new to the franchise. In addition to a Free Play mode with classic, open-ended game play, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals in order to progress in the storyline. While ''Life Stories'' and ''Pet Stories'' each contain two separate stories, ''Castaway Stories'' contains one story that is double the length of any one story in the first two games. As an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in ''The Sims 2''. For example, fears are completely removed in all three games, and the elder life stage is completely removed in ''Pet Stories''. Officially, the save files from this series are not compatible with the main ''The Sims 2'' games. However, players have experienced success at adapting some files.\n\nThree games have been released to date.<ref>{{cite web| title =About ''The Sims Stories'': Coming Winter 2008| publisher =[[Yahoo!

It is set in medieval time, and although it is based on ''The Sims 3'' engine, it plays very differently. ''The Sims Medieval'' has one expansion pack, ''Pirates and Nobles''.\n\n====''The Sims Social''====\n{{Main|The Sims Social}}\n\nLaunched in August 2011, ''[[The Sims Social]]'' was a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based game developed by [[Playfish]] for [[Facebook]].

''Bustin' Out'' was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], Nintendo [[GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] in the fourth quarter of 2003. Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original ''The Sims'' PC game. It was the second Sims game to not be on the PC; it was a follow up to ''The Sims'', which was very similar to ''Bustin' Out'', except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.\n\n''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is a game focused on Sims living in an urban setting, presumably within Sim City. The player must earn reputation and complete tasks for characters. It was released for Xbox, PlayStation 2, [[Nintendo DS]], Nintendo GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. It features [[The Black Eyed Peas]] as NPCs.\n\n====''The Sims 2''====\n{{Main|The Sims 2|The Sims 2: Pets|The Sims 2: Castaway|The Sims 2: Apartment Pets}}\n\n''[[The Sims 2]]'', ''[[The Sims 2: Pets]]'', and ''[[The Sims 2: Castaway]]'' have been released for various platforms including the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP, Xbox, and Nintendo DS systems.

It is also known for being the first ''Sim'' game released in Japan. ''MySims SkyHeroes'', the newest addition to the ''MySims'' line of games, was released in September 2010.\n\n====''The Sims 3''====\n{{Main|The Sims 3|The Sims 3: World Adventures|The Sims 3: Ambitions|The Sims 3: Pets}}\n\n''[[The Sims 3]]'', ''[[The Sims 3: World Adventures]]'', and ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions]]'' were released for the [[iPhone]]/[[iPod Touch]].

The sequel, developed by Maxis, takes place in a full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment as opposed to the [[dimetric projection]] of the original game. Sims age through seven life stages, from infancy to old age and subsequent death. Another major feature is the aspiration system. Each Sim exhibits wants and fears according to its aspiration and personality. Consequently, the level of the aspiration meter determines the effectiveness of a Sim at completing tasks. The fulfillment of wants provides aspiration points, which can be used to purchase aspiration rewards. In addition, the game features clear days of the week, with weekends when children can stay home from school and vacation days when adults can take time off work.\n\n''The Sims 2'' is set some 25 years after the original game. For instance, the Goth family has aged significantly with Bella Goth mysteriously vanishing (\"dying\") at some point in the 25-year period. Because the entire game has progressed from 2D [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] to [[3D modeling|3D models]], all content in ''The Sims 2'' had to be created from the ground up. Due to this, ''The Sims 2'' was not made backwards-compatible with any content from the first generation of the main series. However, some objects and features from the original series were remade for the sequel.\n\nElectronic Arts released [[The Sims 2 Expansion Compilation|eight expansion packs]] and [[The Sims 2 Stuff packs|nine stuff packs]] for ''The Sims 2''. Over 400 items were also released for the game via ''The Sims 2'' Store. In addition, items including pre-order items were released over the life cycle of this generation.\n\n====''The Sims 3''====\n{{Main|The Sims 3}}\nElectronic Arts released ''[[The Sims 3]]'' on June 2, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sims 3|url=http://www.gamerankings.com/pc/936498-the-sims-3/index.html|work=[[GameRankings]]|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=December 3, 2013}}</ref> The sequel was announced by EA in November 2006. The game is set 25 years prior to the original game, and features an open, seamless neighborhood, improved tools for Sim creation, enhanced build and buy mode functions, and the introduction of wishes and goals. The game introduced a new form of directed gameplay through small, step-wise goals presented as opportunities which the player may choose to pursue or refuse. ''The Sims 3'' sold 1.4 million copies in the first week, making it the largest release in PC gaming history at the time.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Jim|title=The Sims 3 Dominating PC Software Sales|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2009/07/13/the-sims-3-dominating-pc-software-sales|accessdate=December 3, 2013|newspaper=IGN|date=July 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[The Sims 3 Expansion Packs|Eleven expansion packs]] and [[The Sims 3 Stuff packs|nine stuff packs]] were released for the third generation of the series.

''The Sims 4'' takes place in an alternative setting from the previous installment of the game. Later in 2014, further details on features and gameplay were announced. A release date of September 2, 2014 was announced at E3 2014.\n\nAs of November 2019, eight expansion packs have been released: Get To Work, Get Together, City Living, Cats and Dogs, Seasons, Get Famous, Island Living, and Discover University. There are eight game packs, and fifteen stuff packs have been released for the fourth generation of the series. Updates have added content that was previously absent due to time restraints, such as basements, ghosts, pools, modular stairs, toddlers and terrain tools. New careers have also been added.\n\n===Spin-offs===\n====''The Sims Online''====\n{{Main|The Sims Online}}\nIn December 2002, Electronic Arts released the Maxis-developed ''[[The Sims Online]]'', which was later named ''EA Land''. It recreates ''The Sims'' as a [[massively multiplayer online game]], where human players can interact with each other. The spin-off did not achieve the same level of success as the original. Reviews for ''The Sims Online'' were lackluster. Many reviewers likened ''The Sims Online'' experience to an enormous [[chat room]]. On August 1, 2008, EA-Land's shops were closed.\n\n====''The Sims Stories''====\n{{Main|The Sims Life Stories|The Sims Pet Stories|The Sims Castaway Stories}}\n''The Sims Stories'' is a series of video games from ''The Sims'' series released in 2007\u20132008 that is based on a modified version of ''The Sims 2'' engine. The modified game engine is optimized for play on systems with weaker specifications such as [[laptop]]s. As such, its system requirements are lower than that of ''The Sims 2'', but it can still be played on [[desktop computer|desktops]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php|title=About \u2013 ''The Sims Stories''|publisher=The Sims 2 (EA)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011011252/http://thesims2.ea.com/about/sims_stories/index.php|archivedate=October 11, 2007|url-status=dead|accessdate=October 31, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The series is introduced mainly for three segments of the market: those who wish to play ''The Sims 2'' on their laptops (which usually have lower specifications); those who wish to engage in other activities such as instant messaging while playing the game, and; those who are new to the franchise. In addition to a Free Play mode with classic, open-ended game play, the games contain a structured, linear Story mode where players are required to complete a series of goals in order to progress in the storyline. While ''Life Stories'' and ''Pet Stories'' each contain two separate stories, ''Castaway Stories'' contains one story that is double the length of any one story in the first two games. As an introductory series, major features are removed or modified from those in ''The Sims 2''. For example, fears are completely removed in all three games, and the elder life stage is completely removed in ''Pet Stories''. Officially, the save files from this series are not compatible with the main ''The Sims 2'' games. However, players have experienced success at adapting some files.\n\nThree games have been released to date.<ref>{{cite web| title =About ''The Sims Stories'': Coming Winter 2008| publisher =[[Yahoo!

It is set in medieval time, and although it is based on ''The Sims 3'' engine, it plays very differently. ''The Sims Medieval'' has one expansion pack, ''Pirates and Nobles''.\n\n====''The Sims Social''====\n{{Main|The Sims Social}}\n\nLaunched in August 2011, ''[[The Sims Social]]'' was a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]]-based game developed by [[Playfish]] for [[Facebook]].

''Bustin' Out'' was released for the [[PlayStation 2]], [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], Nintendo [[GameCube]], [[Game Boy Advance]], and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]] in the fourth quarter of 2003. Sims can get out of the house to visit other locations such as Shiny Things Lab or Casa Caliente. There are two modes. Bust Out Mode which has mission based gameplay and Freeplay Mode which is open-ended gameplay very much like the original ''The Sims'' PC game. It was the second Sims game to not be on the PC; it was a follow up to ''The Sims'', which was very similar to ''Bustin' Out'', except the aims were shifted to getting job promotions and constantly fulfilling goals to get ahead in the game. The PlayStation 2 version also features the option to play online, though EA no longer supports it.\n\n''[[The Urbz: Sims in the City]]'' is a game focused on Sims living in an urban setting, presumably within Sim City. The player must earn reputation and complete tasks for characters. It was released for Xbox, PlayStation 2, [[Nintendo DS]], Nintendo GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. It features [[The Black Eyed Peas]] as NPCs.\n\n====''The Sims 2''====\n{{Main|The Sims 2|The Sims 2: Pets|The Sims 2: Castaway|The Sims 2: Apartment Pets}}\n\n''[[The Sims 2]]'', ''[[The Sims 2: Pets]]'', and ''[[The Sims 2: Castaway]]'' have been released for various platforms including the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP, Xbox, and Nintendo DS systems.

It is also known for being the first ''Sim'' game released in Japan. ''MySims SkyHeroes'', the newest addition to the ''MySims'' line of games, was released in September 2010.\n\n====''The Sims 3''====\n{{Main|The Sims 3|The Sims 3: World Adventures|The Sims 3: Ambitions|The Sims 3: Pets}}\n\n''[[The Sims 3]]'', ''[[The Sims 3: World Adventures]]'', and ''[[The Sims 3: Ambitions]]'' were released for the [[iPhone]]/[[iPod Touch]].

Most infections are asymptomatic.  Manifestations may include abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, vomiting and weight loss. [[Vitamin B12 deficiency]] with subsequent [[megaloblastic anemia]] may occur, but has not for several decades in ''D. latum'' infections, possibly because of improved [[nutrition]]. In one test, nearly half of the ingested vitamin was absorbed by ''D. latum'' in otherwise healthy patients, while 80\u2013100% was absorbed by the worm in patients with anemia.

Adequate cooking or freezing of freshwater fish will kill the encysted fish tapeworm larvae.  Also, because human feces is an important mechanism for spreading eggs, proper disposal of sewage can cut down on infection of fish and thus of humans.\n\n== Treatment ==\nUpon diagnosis, treatment is quite simple and effective.
