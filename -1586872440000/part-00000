NRFIS is a facility where academia and industry can engage in protecting and growing the country\u2019s infrastructure base and supporting the UK to be a leader in the field of smart infrastructure. NRFIS will be used to support research in the application of advanced sensor technologies to the monitoring of the UK\u2019s existing and future infrastructure. More advanced sensors and appropriate data analysis will ensure better product quality, enhanced construction safety and smarter asset management.\n\n\u201cThe UK needs to do more to invest in infrastructure and its associated services which are so important to the citizens using it every day.
