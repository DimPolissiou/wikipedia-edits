The victim, identified as Am\u00e9lie Delagrange, is a 22-year-old French student visiting the UK. She dies in hospital from serious head injuries.\n\n[[Metropolitan_Police_Service|Metropolitan Police]] select Detective Chief Inspector Colin Sutton to lead a large task force as Senior Investigating Officer. No forensic evidence can be procured from the scene, and there are no links in Delagrange's past that could indicate a motive. There have been several previous attacks and murders of young women in the area, and within 24 hours, the  investigation establishes that she might have been killed by the same person who killed [[Levi Bellfield#Marsha McDonnell|Marsha McDonnell]] on 3 February 2003.\n\nCell tower data indicates Delagrange's phone last made contact to the network in an area close by the river, several miles from the green where she was found. Despite pressure to send divers elsewhere, Sutton insists on dredging the river (Thames) by the nearest car crossing, Walton Bridge, and finally finds the phone and other items owned by the victim. Again resisting doubts, this time from within his own team, Sutton decides to employ a significant portion of his team to survey CCTV footage from the night of the attack. A suspicious [[white van man|white van]] moving around at the time of the attack is found, but it cannot be readily identified since there are over 25,000 similar vans in the UK.\n\nWhen Sutton prioritizes the case over his personal life, missing out on vacations and birthdays, he and his wife Louise argue over possible links to a similar case involving the [[murder of Milly Dowler]], a 13-year-old girl in Surrey, where Louise works as a police analyst. She reveals that her superiors, aware of her link to Sutton, have forbidden her to discuss that case with him.\n\nA WPC who attended the initial crime scene reminds Sutton about a witness report of the day, leading him to a [[suspect |possible suspect]] named Levi Bellfield, a self-employed vehicle [[clamping]] operator. He is known to be violent, and very aggressive to the numerous women in his life; and that he owns several vehicles, including a white van.\n\nSutton scales back a nationwide search for the van, and instead mounts a comprehensive [[Targeted surveillance|surveillance operation]] on Bellfield. It soon becomes clear he actively approaches girls and young women, scaring them. The team learns that he once owned a white people-carrier of a similar description to one used to run over and nearly kill a young woman, named Sarah Knight. They also learn he once lived very close to the site of the Surrey murder. It becomes clear to Sutton that Bellfield is not only their man, but that he is likely to strike again.\n\nA large operation is drawn up to facilitate Bellfield's arrest and at the same time to strike at the addresses of known associates to prevent the loss of possible forensic evidence. A leak to the press alerts the ''[[News of the World]]'', a large [[Tabloid journalism#Red tops|sensationalist tabloid]] in the UK, which plans to run a story of the impending operation well before Sutton and his team are ready. To make ''News of the World'' postpone its story, the investigating team agree to let a journalist and photographer join the operation to get first-hand access to the bust. \n\nAt first, it seems Bellfield has given them the slip, but his current partner Laura Marsh soon reveals he is hiding in the attic, and he is safely apprehended. This gives Sutton and his team just 72 hours before they must charge him with a crime or set him free. With insufficient evidence to link Bellfield to the vehicles used in the various murders at specific times and places, they enlist the cooperation of Marsh to detain Bellfield on a charge of assaulting and raping her, giving them time to keep building their murder charge. At his bail hearing, Bellfield displays his violent temper when he learns he will be incarcerated at [[HM Prison Woodhill|Milton Keynes]], located well outside London.\n\nFinally receiving the support of investigators working on the Milly Dowler case, the team find CCTV evidence tying Bellfield to that case, evidence that had heretofore been overlooked. Realizing that Am\u00e9lie Delagrange might not have been murdered, had the evidence been found earlier, Sutton travels to France to apologize to her parents.\n \nFinally, again with Laura Marsh's assistance, the investigators find a supermarket receipt that backs up her story about Bellfield being alone in their previous house, very close to the site of the Milly Dowler murder, on the very day of that crime. The series ends with the prosecutor finally being satisfied by the available evidence and deciding to charge Bellfield with the murder of Delagrange, as well as the hit-and-run of Sarah Knight, with the murder of Marsha McDonnell to hopefully follow.\n\nAn ending note informs the viewer that on 25 February 2008 Levi Bellfield was convicted of the murders of Marsha McDonnell and Am\u00e9lie Delagrange and the attempted murder of Sarah Knight, and sentenced to three life sentences with a recommendation to never be released from prison. Furthermore, that on 23 June 2011, Bellfield was found guilty of the murder of Milly Dowler, and sentenced to a second life imprisonment.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Martin Clunes]] as [[Chief_inspector|Detective Chief Inspector]] Colin Sutton, Senior Investigating Officer for the case\n* [[Stephen Wight]] as [[Constable#United_Kingdom_and_the_Commonwealth|Detective Constable]] Clive Grace\n* [[Katie Lyons]] as [[Sergeant#UK_Police_Sergeant|Detective Sergeant]] Jo Brunt, DCI Sutton's [[aide-de-camp]]\n* [[Steffan Rhodri]] as DCI Neil Jones\n* [[Claudie Blakley]] as Louise Sutton, Colin's wife and a Surrey police analyst\n*Celyn Jones as Levi Bellfield\n* Kiera Bell as Am\u00e9lie Delagrange\n* Hannah Banks as Marsha [[The Sunday Times|McDonnell]]\n\n==Development==\nThe series is written by screenwriter Ed Whitmore, based on the memoirs of real-life former Met police detective DCI Colin Sutton.<ref>https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-04-04/manhunt-itv-air-date-time-channel-new-crime-drama-itv-martin-clunes/</ref>\n\nOn 6 March 2019, the show was renewed for a second series to premiere in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://renewcanceltv.com/manhunt-renewed-for-season-2-on-itv/|title='Manhunt' Renewed For Season 2 On ITV|website=RenewCancelTV.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Transmissions==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

It first aired on July 12, 1976, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and has also aired on [[CBS]] and in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]].\n\nThe show has had three separate runs; the original run from 1976\u20131985 aired on ABC during the daytime, and had a separate nighttime edition that ran in syndication and was also hosted by [[Richard Dawson]].  In 1988, the series was revived and aired on [[CBS]] and also had a nighttime syndication edition. This version was hosted by [[Ray Combs]] until 1994, and brought back Richard Dawson for the 1994\u20131995 season. A third run began in 1999 in syndication only, and continues to run to this day, being hosted by a series of different hosts, including [[Louie Anderson]] (1999\u20132002), [[Richard Karn]] (2002\u20132006), [[John O'Hurley]] (2006\u20132010), and [[Steve Harvey]] (2010\u2013present). Aside from the hosts, there have been several studio announcers who would introduce the contestants and read credits.  These have included [[Gene Wood]] (1976\u20131985, 1988\u20131995), [[Burton Richardson (announcer)|Burton Richardson]] (1999\u20132010, 2015\u2013present [[Celebrity Family Feud]] only), [[Joey Fatone]] (2010\u20132015), and Rubin Ervin (2015\u2013present). Within a year of its debut, the original version became the number one game show in daytime television; however, as viewing habits changed, the ratings declined. Harvey's takeover in 2010 increased [[Nielsen ratings]] significantly and eventually placed the program among the top five most popular syndicated television shows in the country. Harvey has also surpassed every previous host to date in length of single consecutive tenures, although Dawson hosted more episodes of the show. In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Family Feud'' third in its list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.\n\nThe program has spawned multiple [[International versions of Family Feud|regional adaptations]] in over 50 international markets outside the United States. [[Rerun]]s of Steve Harvey-hosted episodes air on [[Game Show Network]], while reruns of earlier versions air on [[Buzzr]]. Aside from TV shows, there have been also many home editions produced in [[board game]], [[interactive film]], and [[video game]] formats.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\nTwo family teams of five contestants (reduced to four contestants for the 1994-95 season) each compete to win cash and prizes. The original version of the show began with the families being introduced, seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits, after which the host interviewed them.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\">{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013present|pages=450\u2013451|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2009|isbn=0-307-48320-7}}</ref>\n\nUnlike with most other game shows, there is no minimum age necessary to participate in ''Family Feud'', although every family must have at least one person who is 18 years or older.  Each round begins with a \"face-off\" question that serves as a toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people, e.g. 100 single women or men, etc. (e.g., \"This was asked to 100 single men. Name the hour that you get up on Sunday mornings.\").<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers said by at least two people can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the 1988\u201395 versions, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\nThe family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers, with each member giving one answer in sequence. Giving an answer not on the board, or failing to respond within the allotted time, earns one strike. If the family earns three strikes, their opponents are given one chance to \"steal\" the points for the round by guessing any remaining concealed answer; failing to do so awards the points back to the family that originally had control. If the opponents are given the opportunity to \"steal\" the points, then only their team's captain is required to answer the question (except on the Combs version, where all team members were required to answer.) However, the team's captain has the final say as to what answer is given.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> Any remaining concealed answers on the board that were not guessed are then revealed.\n\nWhile a family has control of a question, the members are not allowed to discuss possible answers with one another; each person must respond individually. However, the opposing family may confer in preparation for an attempt to steal, and their captain must respond for them when such an attempt is made.\n\nAnswers are worth one point for every person in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question, including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal (if applicable). The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. In the fourth round of Karn version (for triple point value), the question would only be read once. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" />\n\nPrior to 1999, the game continued as normal until one family reached the necessary total to win. Since then, if neither team reaches the goal after four rounds (or, from 1999 to 2002, if both teams were tied with the same score after the final round), one last question is played for triple value with only the #1 answer displayed.\n\nThe goal of 300 points has been in place in the rules of almost every version of the show. However, when the program premiered in 1976, the goal was 200 points. For the 1984\u201385 season of both the daytime and syndicated program, the goal was increased to 400 points.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=14 June 1985 |language=English}}</ref> For several seasons after the 1999 return to syndication, there was no specific point goal. Instead, four rounds were played, with the last for triple points and only one strike. The family with the most points after the fourth round won the game.\n\n=== Fast Money ===\nTwo members of the winning family play Fast Money for a chance to win a cash bonus. One contestant is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so that he/she cannot see or hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.\n\nAfter the first contestant has either answered all five questions or run out of time, the board is cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\nThe grand prize for winning Fast Money has varied. When the program aired in daytime, families played for $5,000.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=12 July 1976 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=CBS |date=4 July 1988 |language=English}}</ref> The grand prize for syndicated episodes was $10,000 for much of its existence. In 2001, the prize was doubled to $20,000 at the request of then-host Louie Anderson, where it has remained since.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Family Feud |series=E! True Hollywood Story |network=E! |date=2002 |season=6 |number=34 |language=English}}</ref>\n\n=== Returning champions ===\nWhen ''Family Feud\n'' premiered on ABC, network rules dictated how much a family could win. Once any family reached $25,000, they were retired as champions.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=28 May 1980 |quote=Explained by Richard Dawson at the beginning of the episode}}{{Better source|reason=No accompanying quote or transcript.|date=November 2015}}</ref> The accompanying syndicated series that premiered in 1977 featured two new families each episode because of tape bicycling{{Clarify|reason=what is \"tape bicycling\" ?|date=October 2019}} (a practice then common in syndicated television).\n\nThe CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in 1988 also featured returning champions, who could appear for a maximum of five days.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family  |network=CBS |date=14 November 1988}}{{Better source|reason=No accompanying quote or transcript.|date=November 2015}}</ref> For a brief period in the 1994\u201395 season which aired in syndication, there were no returning champions. For these episodes, two new families competed in this first half of each episode. The second half featured former champion families who appeared on ''Family Feud'' between 1977 and  1985, with the winner of the first half of the show playing one of these families in the second half.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=Syndicated |date=8 September 1994}}{{Better source|reason=No accompanying quote or transcript.|date=November 2015}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, two new families appeared on each episode. The returning champions rule was reinstated with the same five-day limit starting with the 2002\u201303 season.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=Syndicated |date=September 2002}}{{Better source|reason=No date for season premiere.

As they are dancing and screaming towards their new car before the final $20,000 round begins, Steve will reveal the final answer.</ref>\n\n=== Bullseye game ===\nIn June 1992, the CBS daytime edition of ''Feud'' expanded from 30 to 60 minutes and became known as the ''Family Feud Challenge.'' As part of the change, a new round was added at the start of each game called \"Bullseye\". This round determined the potential Fast Money stake for each team.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud Challenge |network=CBS |date=June 1992 |language=English}}</ref> Each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it. The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in September 1992, which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the ''New Family Feud.''\n\nThe first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On the first half of the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.\n\nWhen Richard Dawson returned as host of the program in 1994, the round's name was changed to the \"Bankroll\" round.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=Syndication |date=12 September 1994 |language=English}}</ref> Although the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer, the format was modified to three questions from five, with only one member of each family participating for all three questions. The initial stake for each family remained the same ($2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the second). However, the value for each question was $500, $1,500 and $2,500 in the first half, with values doubling for the second half. This meant a potential maximum bank of $7,000 in the first half and $14,000 in the second.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Bullseye round temporarily returned during the 2009\u201310 season. It was played similarly to the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version, with five questions worth from $1,000 to $5,000. However, each family was given a $15,000 starting stake, which meant a potential maximum of a $30,000 bank.\n\n== Hosts and announcers ==\nWhen Family Feud was conceived in 1976, [[Richard Dawson]] (then a panelist regular on the [[Fremantle (company)|Goodson\u2013Todman]] game show ''[[Match Game]]'') had a standing agreement with [[Mark Goodson]] that when the next Goodson\u2013Todman game show was produced, Dawson would be given an audition to host it. Dawson had read in trade publications that a pilot for a new show named ''Family Feud'' was in the works, and it was to be hosted by [[William Shatner]] (although since they were involved in the run-throughs, [[Geoff Edwards]], and [[Jack Narz]], who reputedly was Goodson's initial choice to host, were under consideration). Incensed, Dawson sent his agent to Goodson to threaten an un-funny, silent, and bland Dawson on future ''Match Game'' episodes if Dawson was not given an audition for ''Feud''. Goodson gave in, and Dawson ultimately won the hosting job.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7539078/|title=Game Changers|last=Thompson|first=J. Craig|date=2018|publisher=IMDb|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, the original ABC and first syndicated versions of ''Family Feud'' were hosted by Dawson. As writer David Marc put it, Dawson's on-air personality \"fell somewhere between the brainless sincerity of [[Wink Martindale]] and the raunchy cynicism of [[Chuck Barris]]\".<ref name=\"Marc\">{{cite book|last=Marc|first=David|title=Prime Time, Prime Movers: From ''I Love Lucy'' to ''L.A.

''Match Game'' aired on [[CBS]], and by 1976, CBS vice president [[Fred Silverman]], who had originally commissioned ''Match Game'', had moved to a new position as president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show premiered on ABC's daytime lineup at 1:30 <small>PM</small> ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]])/12:30 <small>PM</small> ([[Central time zone|CT]]/[[Mountain time zone|MT]]/[[Pacific time zone|PT]]) on July 12, 1976, and although it was not an immediate hit, before long it became a ratings winner and eventually surpassed ''Match Game'' to become the highest-rated game show on daytime TV.\n\nDue to the expansion of ''[[All My Children]]'' to one hour in April 1977, the show was moved to 11:30/10:30 <small>AM</small>, as the second part of an hour that had daytime reruns of ''[[Happy Days]]'' (later ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'') as its lead-in. When ''$20,000 Pyramid'' was cancelled in June 1980, it moved a half-hour back to 12 noon/11:00 <small>AM</small>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Feud \u2013 A long history of successful programming.|url=http://www.mansfieldtv.com/family-feud.htm|publisher=Mansfield Television Distribution Co.|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}</ref> It remained the most popular daytime game show until [[Merv Griffin]]'s game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' surpassed it in 1984.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> From May 8, 1978 until May 25, 1984, ABC periodically broadcast hour-long primetime \"All-Star Specials\", in which celebrity casts from various primetime lineup TV series competed instead of ordinary families.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> The popularity of the program inspired Goodson to consider producing a nighttime edition, which launched in syndication on September 19, 1977. Like many other game shows at the time, the nighttime ''Feud'' aired once a week; it expanded to twice a week in January 1979,<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\">Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, p. 72.</ref> and finally to five nights a week (Monday through Friday) in the fall of 1980. However, the viewing habits of both daytime and syndicated audiences were changing.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> When Griffin launched ''Wheel''{{'}}s syndicated version, starring [[Pat Sajak]] and [[Vanna White]], in 1983, that show climbed the ratings to the point where it unseated ''Feud'' as the highest-rated syndicated show;<ref>Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, pp. 250\u2013252.</ref> the syndicated premiere of ''Wheel''{{'}}s sister show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' with [[Alex Trebek]] as host also siphoned ratings from ''Feud'' with its early success. With declining ratings, and as part of a scheduling reshuffle with two of ABC's half-hour soaps, the show moved back to the 11:30/10:30 timeslot in October 1984, as the second part of a one-hour game show block with ''[[Trivia Trap]]'' (later ''[[All-Star Blitz]]'') as its lead in, hoping to make a dent in the ratings of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.\n\nDespite the ratings decline, there was some interest in keeping the show in production. In a 2010 interview, Dawson recalled a meeting with executives from Viacom Enterprises about keeping the show for one more season. Dawson was growing tired of the grueling taping schedule and initially wanted to stop altogether. After discussing the situation with ABC and Viacom, Dawson said that he would return for a final syndicated season of thirty-nine weeks of episodes but would not continue doing the daytime series. After this, Dawson did not hear from Viacom for approximately a week and once they contacted him again, Dawson was told that Viacom was no longer interested in continuing the syndicated ''Feud'' beyond the 1984\u201385 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Dawson Interview|url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/richard-dawson|publisher=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> Viacom made this official in January 1985 ahead of that year's [[NATPE]] convention, and within a few weeks, ABC decided that it too would not renew ''Feud'' for the 1985\u201386 season.<ref>{{cite journal|title=NATPE '85|journal=Broadcasting|date=January 21, 1985|page=52}}</ref> The daytime version came to an end on June 14, 1985.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> The syndicated version aired its last new episode on May 17, 1985, with reruns continuing to air until September of that year.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\n=== 1988\u20131995 ===\n''Family Feud'' moved to CBS with Ray Combs hosting the show on July 4, 1988 at 10:00 <small>AM</small> (ET)/9:00 <small>AM</small> (CT/MT/PT), replacing ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $25,000 Pyramid]]'' (which had aired continuously in that time slot since September 1982, except between January and April 1988, when ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' took its place; CBS began development on ''Family Feud'' shortly after ''Blackout'' was canceled). Like its predecessor, this version also had an accompanying syndicated edition which launched in September of that year. It moved to 10:30/9:30 in January 1991 to make room for a short-lived talk show starring Barbara DeAngelis. At that time frame, it replaced the daytime ''Wheel of Fortune'', which moved back to NBC.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> In June 1992, the network version expanded from its original half-hour format to a full hour, and was retitled ''The Family Feud Challenge'';<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> this new format featured three families per episode, which included two new families competing in the first half-hour for the right to play the returning champions in the second half. ''The Family Feud Challenge'' aired its final new episode on March 26, 1993, with reruns airing until September 10.<ref>Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, p. 73.</ref> The syndicated ''Feud'', meanwhile, remained in production and entered its sixth season in the fall of 1993.\n\nAt this point in its run, the syndicated ''Feud'' had been dealing with a consistent ratings downturn for several years. Although the series was initially able to secure time frames in desirable hours such as the Prime Time Access hour, stations quickly found that other programming, such as tabloid news magazine programs such as ''[[A Current Affair (American TV program)|A Current Affair]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'' and ''[[Hard Copy]]'' were drawing higher ratings and thus sought those shows to replace ''Feud''. Some stations dropped the syndicated ''Feud'' outright, while others relocated it to lower-rated time frames such as overnights. The decline eventually resulted in the ratings bottoming out in 1992-93.\n\nDistributor [[All American Television]] informed Mark Goodson Productions that, unless there was an uptick in the ratings or changes made to the program, they would cease distributing ''Family Feud'' at the end of the 1993-94 season. The responsibility for this was all in the hands of [[Jonathan Goodson]], who had taken over his father's company when Mark Goodson died in 1992. One of the options considered were a host change, which reached a consensus that Combs would be voted out of the show to make way for his predecessor, Richard Dawson.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\" />\n\nThis ran counter to his father's original decision, as Mark Goodson was loyal to Combs from the moment that he hired him and had refused to even consider Dawson due to the trouble he caused for the production staff of the original series. Many members of the original production staff were also working on the revival series and held lingering negative feelings toward Dawson. However, Jonathan Goodson did not have the ties to Combs that his father did, and felt that the change had to at least be necessary in order to keep the production intact.\n\nAfter a rigorous staff meeting, Goodson offered Dawson a contract to return as host of the syndicated ''Feud'', and the semi-retired Dawson agreed to return. Combs was able to finish out the remainder of the season, and, after his final episode that was filmed in early 1994, he signed off and left the studio without even saying goodbye to anybody.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\" />\n\nA revamped ''Family Feud'' returned for a seventh season in September 1994, with Dawson returning as the host. The show expanded from thirty to sixty minutes, reinstated the ''Family Feud Challenge'' format, and did various other things to try to improve the ratings of the show such as modernizing the set, feature families that had previously been champions on the original ''Feud'', and have more themed weeks. Although Dawson did bring a brief ratings surge when he came back, the show could not sustain it long term, and ''Feud'' came to a conclusion at the end of the season. Its final new episode aired on May 26, 1995, with reruns airing until September 8. The show ceased production for nearly four years after failing to come to an agreement with various companies. Outside of the show, former ''Family Feud'' host Ray Combs, whose life was falling apart due to financial ruin, died on June 2, 1996 by hanging himself in a Glendale psychiatric ward.\n\n=== 1999\u2013present ===\n''Family Feud'' returned in syndication on September 20, 1999, with comedian Louie Anderson as the next host. Anderson hosted the show for nearly three years until his release in 2002.<ref name=\"TGGS, 108\">{{cite book|title=TV's Greatest Game Shows: Television's Favorite Game Shows from the 50s, 60s, & More!|publisher=Marshall Publishing & Promotions, Inc.|last=DeMichael|first=Tom|year=2009|page=108|isbn=978-0-9814909-9-1}}</ref> After Anderson's release, Richard Karn took over the show. The format was changed to reintroduce returning champions, allowing them to appear for up to five days. However, even after Karn's takeover, Anderson-hosted episodes continued in reruns that aired on [[Ion Television|PAX TV/Ion Television]].<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> Karn hosted the show for four years, and then, it was John O'Hurley at the helm. The show's [[Nielsen ratings]] were at 1.5, putting it in danger of cancellation once again (as countless affiliates that carried the show from 1999-2010 aired in daytime, graveyard or low-rated time slots). O'Hurley would host the show for four years, and was succeeded by Steve Harvey.

most popular responses to survey questions in order to win cash and prizes. It first aired on July 12, 1976, on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], and has also aired on [[CBS]] and in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]].\n\nThe show has had three separate runs; the original run from 1976\u20131985 aired on ABC during the daytime, and had a separate nighttime edition that ran in syndication and was also hosted by [[Richard Dawson]].  In 1988, the series was revived and aired on [[CBS]] and also had a nighttime syndication edition. This version was hosted by [[Ray Combs]] until 1994, and brought back Richard Dawson for the 1994\u20131995 season. A third run began in 1999 in syndication only, and continues to run to this day, being hosted by a series of different hosts, including [[Louie Anderson]] (1999\u20132002), [[Richard Karn]] (2002\u20132006), [[John O'Hurley]] (2006\u20132010), and [[Steve Harvey]] (2010\u2013present). Aside from the hosts, there have been several studio announcers who would introduce the contestants and read credits.  These have included [[Gene Wood]] (1976\u20131985, 1988\u20131995), [[Burton Richardson (announcer)|Burton Richardson]] (1999\u20132010, 2015\u2013present [[Celebrity Family Feud]] only), [[Joey Fatone]] (2010\u20132015), and Rubin Ervin (2015\u2013present). Within a year of its debut, the original version became the number one game show in daytime television; however, as viewing habits changed, the ratings declined. Harvey's takeover in 2010 increased [[Nielsen ratings]] significantly and eventually placed the program among the top five most popular syndicated television shows in the country. Harvey has also surpassed every previous host to date in length of single consecutive tenures, although Dawson hosted more episodes of the show. In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Family Feud'' third in its list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time.\n\nThe program has spawned multiple [[International versions of Family Feud|regional adaptations]] in over 50 international markets outside the United States. [[Rerun]]s of Steve Harvey-hosted episodes air on [[Game Show Network]], while reruns of earlier versions air on [[Buzzr]]. Aside from TV shows, there have been also many home editions produced in [[board game]], [[interactive film]], and [[video game]] formats.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\nTwo family teams of five contestants (reduced to four contestants for the 1994-95 season) each compete to win cash and prizes. The original version of the show began with the families being introduced, seated opposite each other as if posing for family portraits, after which the host interviewed them.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\">{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle F.|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946\u2013present|pages=450\u2013451|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2009|isbn=0-307-48320-7}}</ref>\n\nUnlike with most other game shows, there is no minimum age necessary to participate in ''Family Feud'', although every family must have at least one person who is 18 years or older.  Each round begins with a \"face-off\" question that serves as a toss-up between two opposing contestants. The host asks a survey question that was previously posed to a group of 100 people, e.g. 100 single women or men, etc. (e.g., \"This was asked to 100 single men. Name the hour that you get up on Sunday mornings.\").<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> A certain number of answers are concealed on the board, ranked by popularity of the survey's responses. Only answers said by at least two people can appear on the board. The first contestant to buzz-in gives an answer; if it is the most popular, his/her family immediately wins the face-off. Otherwise, the opponent responds and the family member providing the higher-ranked answer wins. Ties are broken in favor of the contestant who buzzes-in first. If neither contestant's answer is on the board, the other eight contestants have a chance to respond, one at a time from alternating sides, until an answer is revealed. The family that wins the face-off may choose to play the question or pass control to their opponents (except on the 1988\u201395 versions, when the family who won the face-off automatically gained control of the question).<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\nThe family with control of the question then tries to win the round by guessing all of the remaining concealed answers, with each member giving one answer in sequence. Giving an answer not on the board, or failing to respond within the allotted time, earns one strike. If the family earns three strikes, their opponents are given one chance to \"steal\" the points for the round by guessing any remaining concealed answer; failing to do so awards the points back to the family that originally had control. If the opponents are given the opportunity to \"steal\" the points, then only their team's captain is required to answer the question (except on the Combs version, where all team members were required to answer.) However, the team's captain has the final say as to what answer is given.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> Any remaining concealed answers on the board that were not guessed are then revealed.\n\nWhile a family has control of a question, the members are not allowed to discuss possible answers with one another; each person must respond individually. However, the opposing family may confer in preparation for an attempt to steal, and their captain must respond for them when such an attempt is made.\n\nAnswers are worth one point for every person in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all revealed answers to that question, including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal (if applicable). The number of answers on the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. In the fourth round of Karn version (for triple point value), the question would only be read once. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" />\n\nPrior to 1999, the game continued as normal until one family reached the necessary total to win. Since then, if neither team reaches the goal after four rounds (or, from 1999 to 2002, if both teams were tied with the same score after the final round), one last question is played for triple value with only the #1 answer displayed.\n\nThe goal of 300 points has been in place in the rules of almost every version of the show. However, when the program premiered in 1976, the goal was 200 points. For the 1984\u201385 season of both the daytime and syndicated program, the goal was increased to 400 points.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=14 June 1985 |language=English}}</ref> For several seasons after the 1999 return to syndication, there was no specific point goal. Instead, four rounds were played, with the last for triple points and only one strike. The family with the most points after the fourth round won the game.\n\n=== Fast Money ===\nTwo members of the winning family play Fast Money for a chance to win a cash bonus. One contestant is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage with headphones so that he/she cannot see or hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the first question is asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.\n\nAfter the first contestant has either answered all five questions or run out of time, the board is cleared except for the total score, and the second contestant is then brought out to answer the same five questions. The same rules are followed, but the time limit is extended by five seconds (originally 20, then extended to 25); in addition, if the second contestant duplicates an answer given by the first, a buzzer sounds and he/she must give another answer. If the two contestants reach a combined total of 200 points or more, the family wins the bonus. If not, they are given $5 per point scored as a consolation prize.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\nThe grand prize for winning Fast Money has varied. When the program aired in daytime, families played for $5,000.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=12 July 1976 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=CBS |date=4 July 1988 |language=English}}</ref> The grand prize for syndicated episodes was $10,000 for much of its existence.

Once any family reached $25,000, they were retired as champions.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=ABC |date=28 May 1980 |quote=Explained by Richard Dawson at the beginning of the episode}}{{Better source|reason=No accompanying quote or transcript.|date=November 2015}}</ref> The accompanying syndicated series that premiered in 1977 featured two new families each episode because of tape bicycling{{Clarify|reason=what is \"tape bicycling\" ?|date=October 2019}} (a practice then common in syndicated television).\n\nThe CBS daytime and syndicated versions which began airing in 1988 also featured returning champions, who could appear for a maximum of five days.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family  |network=CBS |date=14 November 1988}}{{Better source|reason=No accompanying quote or transcript.|date=November 2015}}</ref> For a brief period in the 1994\u201395 season which aired in syndication, there were no returning champions.

As part of the change, a new round was added at the start of each game called \"Bullseye\". This round determined the potential Fast Money stake for each team.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud Challenge |network=CBS |date=June 1992 |language=English}}</ref> Each team was given a starting value for their bank and attempted to come up with the top answer to a survey question to add to it. The Bullseye round was added to the syndicated edition in September 1992, which remained 30 minutes and was retitled as the ''New Family Feud.''\n\nThe first two members of each family appeared at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On the first half of the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.\n\nWhen Richard Dawson returned as host of the program in 1994, the round's name was changed to the \"Bankroll\" round.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite episode |series=Family Feud |network=Syndication |date=12 September 1994 |language=English}}</ref> Although the goal remained of giving only the number-one answer, the format was modified to three questions from five, with only one member of each family participating for all three questions. The initial stake for each family remained the same ($2,500 in the first half of the hour and $5,000 in the second). However, the value for each question was $500, $1,500 and $2,500 in the first half, with values doubling for the second half. This meant a potential maximum bank of $7,000 in the first half and $14,000 in the second.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe Bullseye round temporarily returned during the 2009\u201310 season. It was played similarly to the format used from 1992 to 1994 on the syndicated version, with five questions worth from $1,000 to $5,000. However, each family was given a $15,000 starting stake, which meant a potential maximum of a $30,000 bank.\n\n== Hosts and announcers ==\nWhen Family Feud was conceived in 1976, [[Richard Dawson]] (then a panelist regular on the [[Fremantle (company)|Goodson\u2013Todman]] game show ''[[Match Game]]'') had a standing agreement with [[Mark Goodson]] that when the next Goodson\u2013Todman game show was produced, Dawson would be given an audition to host it. Dawson had read in trade publications that a pilot for a new show named ''Family Feud'' was in the works, and it was to be hosted by [[William Shatner]] (although since they were involved in the run-throughs, [[Geoff Edwards]], and [[Jack Narz]], who reputedly was Goodson's initial choice to host, were under consideration). Incensed, Dawson sent his agent to Goodson to threaten an un-funny, silent, and bland Dawson on future ''Match Game'' episodes if Dawson was not given an audition for ''Feud''. Goodson gave in, and Dawson ultimately won the hosting job.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7539078/|title=Game Changers|last=Thompson|first=J. Craig|date=2018|publisher=IMDb|access-date=}}</ref> Thus, the original ABC and first syndicated versions of ''Family Feud'' were hosted by Dawson. As writer David Marc put it, Dawson's on-air personality \"fell somewhere between the brainless sincerity of [[Wink Martindale]] and the raunchy cynicism of [[Chuck Barris]]\".<ref name=\"Marc\">{{cite book|last=Marc|first=David|title=Prime Time, Prime Movers: From ''I Love Lucy'' to ''L.A.

''Match Game'' aired on [[CBS]], and by 1976, CBS vice president [[Fred Silverman]], who had originally commissioned ''Match Game'', had moved to a new position as president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show premiered on ABC's daytime lineup at 1:30 <small>PM</small> ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]])/12:30 <small>PM</small> ([[Central time zone|CT]]/[[Mountain time zone|MT]]/[[Pacific time zone|PT]]) on July 12, 1976, and although it was not an immediate hit, before long it became a ratings winner and eventually surpassed ''Match Game'' to become the highest-rated game show on daytime TV.\n\nDue to the expansion of ''[[All My Children]]'' to one hour in April 1977, the show was moved to 11:30/10:30 <small>AM</small>, as the second part of an hour that had daytime reruns of ''[[Happy Days]]'' (later ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'') as its lead-in. When ''$20,000 Pyramid'' was cancelled in June 1980, it moved a half-hour back to 12 noon/11:00 <small>AM</small>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Feud \u2013 A long history of successful programming.|url=http://www.mansfieldtv.com/family-feud.htm|publisher=Mansfield Television Distribution Co.|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}</ref> It remained the most popular daytime game show until [[Merv Griffin]]'s game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (American game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' surpassed it in 1984.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> From May 8, 1978 until May 25, 1984, ABC periodically broadcast hour-long primetime \"All-Star Specials\", in which celebrity casts from various primetime lineup TV series competed instead of ordinary families.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> The popularity of the program inspired Goodson to consider producing a nighttime edition, which launched in syndication on September 19, 1977. Like many other game shows at the time, the nighttime ''Feud'' aired once a week; it expanded to twice a week in January 1979,<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\">Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, p. 72.</ref> and finally to five nights a week (Monday through Friday) in the fall of 1980. However, the viewing habits of both daytime and syndicated audiences were changing.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> When Griffin launched ''Wheel''{{'}}s syndicated version, starring [[Pat Sajak]] and [[Vanna White]], in 1983, that show climbed the ratings to the point where it unseated ''Feud'' as the highest-rated syndicated show;<ref>Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, pp. 250\u2013252.</ref> the syndicated premiere of ''Wheel''{{'}}s sister show ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' with [[Alex Trebek]] as host also siphoned ratings from ''Feud'' with its early success. With declining ratings, and as part of a scheduling reshuffle with two of ABC's half-hour soaps, the show moved back to the 11:30/10:30 timeslot in October 1984, as the second part of a one-hour game show block with ''[[Trivia Trap]]'' (later ''[[All-Star Blitz]]'') as its lead in, hoping to make a dent in the ratings of ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]''.\n\nDespite the ratings decline, there was some interest in keeping the show in production. In a 2010 interview, Dawson recalled a meeting with executives from Viacom Enterprises about keeping the show for one more season. Dawson was growing tired of the grueling taping schedule and initially wanted to stop altogether. After discussing the situation with ABC and Viacom, Dawson said that he would return for a final syndicated season of thirty-nine weeks of episodes but would not continue doing the daytime series. After this, Dawson did not hear from Viacom for approximately a week and once they contacted him again, Dawson was told that Viacom was no longer interested in continuing the syndicated ''Feud'' beyond the 1984\u201385 season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Dawson Interview|url=http://emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/richard-dawson|publisher=Archive of American Television|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> Viacom made this official in January 1985 ahead of that year's [[NATPE]] convention, and within a few weeks, ABC decided that it too would not renew ''Feud'' for the 1985\u201386 season.<ref>{{cite journal|title=NATPE '85|journal=Broadcasting|date=January 21, 1985|page=52}}</ref> The daytime version came to an end on June 14, 1985.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" /> The syndicated version aired its last new episode on May 17, 1985, with reruns continuing to air until September of that year.<ref name=\"David Schwartz 1995, p. 72\" />\n\n=== 1988\u20131995 ===\n''Family Feud'' moved to CBS with Ray Combs hosting the show on July 4, 1988 at 10:00 <small>AM</small> (ET)/9:00 <small>AM</small> (CT/MT/PT), replacing ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $25,000 Pyramid]]'' (which had aired continuously in that time slot since September 1982, except between January and April 1988, when ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' took its place; CBS began development on ''Family Feud'' shortly after ''Blackout'' was canceled). Like its predecessor, this version also had an accompanying syndicated edition which launched in September of that year. It moved to 10:30/9:30 in January 1991 to make room for a short-lived talk show starring Barbara DeAngelis. At that time frame, it replaced the daytime ''Wheel of Fortune'', which moved back to NBC.<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> In June 1992, the network version expanded from its original half-hour format to a full hour, and was retitled ''The Family Feud Challenge'';<ref name=\"Brooks & Marsh\" /> this new format featured three families per episode, which included two new families competing in the first half-hour for the right to play the returning champions in the second half. ''The Family Feud Challenge'' aired its final new episode on March 26, 1993, with reruns airing until September 10.<ref>Schwartz, Ryan and Wostbrock, p. 73.</ref> The syndicated ''Feud'', meanwhile, remained in production and entered its sixth season in the fall of 1993.\n\nAt this point in its run, the syndicated ''Feud'' had been dealing with a consistent ratings downturn for several years. Although the series was initially able to secure time frames in desirable hours such as the Prime Time Access hour, stations quickly found that other programming, such as tabloid news magazine programs such as ''[[A Current Affair (American TV program)|A Current Affair]]'', ''[[Inside Edition]]'' and ''[[Hard Copy]]'' were drawing higher ratings and thus sought those shows to replace ''Feud''. Some stations dropped the syndicated ''Feud'' outright, while others relocated it to lower-rated time frames such as overnights. The decline eventually resulted in the ratings bottoming out in 1992-93.\n\nDistributor [[All American Television]] informed Mark Goodson Productions that, unless there was an uptick in the ratings or changes made to the program, they would cease distributing ''Family Feud'' at the end of the 1993-94 season. The responsibility for this was all in the hands of [[Jonathan Goodson]], who had taken over his father's company when Mark Goodson died in 1992. One of the options considered were a host change, which reached a consensus that Combs would be voted out of the show to make way for his predecessor, Richard Dawson.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\" />\n\nThis ran counter to his father's original decision, as Mark Goodson was loyal to Combs from the moment that he hired him and had refused to even consider Dawson due to the trouble he caused for the production staff of the original series. Many members of the original production staff were also working on the revival series and held lingering negative feelings toward Dawson. However, Jonathan Goodson did not have the ties to Combs that his father did, and felt that the change had to at least be necessary in order to keep the production intact.\n\nAfter a rigorous staff meeting, Goodson offered Dawson a contract to return as host of the syndicated ''Feud'', and the semi-retired Dawson agreed to return. Combs was able to finish out the remainder of the season, and, after his final episode that was filmed in early 1994, he signed off and left the studio without even saying goodbye to anybody.<ref name=\"autogenerated2002\" />\n\nA revamped ''Family Feud'' returned for a seventh season in September 1994, with Dawson returning as the host. The show expanded from thirty to sixty minutes, reinstated the ''Family Feud Challenge'' format, and did various other things to try to improve the ratings of the show such as modernizing the set, feature families that had previously been champions on the original ''Feud'', and have more themed weeks. Although Dawson did bring a brief ratings surge when he came back, the show could not sustain it long term, and ''Feud'' came to a conclusion at the end of the season. Its final new episode aired on May 26, 1995, with reruns airing until September 8. The show ceased production for nearly four years after failing to come to an agreement with various companies. Outside of the show, former ''Family Feud'' host Ray Combs, whose life was falling apart due to financial ruin, died on June 2, 1996 by hanging himself in a Glendale psychiatric ward.\n\n=== 1999\u2013present ===\n''Family Feud'' returned in syndication on September 20, 1999, with comedian Louie Anderson as the next host. Anderson hosted the show for nearly three years until his release in 2002.<ref name=\"TGGS, 108\">{{cite book|title=TV's Greatest Game Shows: Television's Favorite Game Shows from the 50s, 60s, & More!|publisher=Marshall Publishing & Promotions, Inc.|last=DeMichael|first=Tom|year=2009|page=108|isbn=978-0-9814909-9-1}}</ref> After Anderson's release, Richard Karn took over the show.

The show's [[Nielsen ratings]] were at 1.5, putting it in danger of cancellation once again (as countless affiliates that carried the show from 1999-2010 aired in daytime, graveyard or low-rated time slots). O'Hurley would host the show for four years, and was succeeded by Steve Harvey.
