In his first NFL game, Willis recorded 11 tackles, including 9 solo, and a forced fumble as the 49ers defeated the Arizona Cardinals in dramatic fashion by a score of 20\u201317. For his effort, he won the Diet Pepsi Rookie of the Week Award. One of Willis's strongest performances came against the [[Minnesota Vikings]], as he led the 49ers defense in containing [[NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year|Offensive Rookie of the Year]], [[Adrian Peterson]], who managed just 3 yards on 14 carries. Willis's most impressive statistical performance came in week 16 at home against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Other honors earned at the conclusion of his first professional season included being named [[NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year|AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year]], first-team [[All-Pro]], and [[National Football League Alumni|NFL Alumni Linebacker of the Year]]. He was the only rookie in the NFL to make the AP All-Pro squad and the first defensive rookie from the 49ers to make the Pro Bowl since [[Ronnie Lott]] in 1981. His season was capped by being named one of [[ESPN The Magazine]]'s \"NEXT\" athletes of 2008, alongside [[New York Yankees|Yankee]] [[Joba Chamberlain]] and [[Portland Trail Blazers|Trail Blazer]] [[Brandon Roy]].\n\n===2008 season===\n[[File:Patrick Willis on field pregame at Eagles at 49ers 10-12-08.JPG|thumb|right|Willis in October 2008]]\n\nIn his second NFL season, Willis scored his first career NFL [[touchdown]] against Seattle, returning an interception for 86 yards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200809140sea.htm |title=San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks - September 14th, 2008 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 16, 2018}}</ref>\nOn December 16, during another dominating season with the 49ers, Willis was named the starting inside linebacker for the NFC Pro Bowl team.

He also had a huge game in week 4 against St. Louis finishing with 8 tackles, 2.5 sacks and an interception return for a 23-yard touchdown.\n\nThe biggest improvement in his game from the previous year was the increased sideline-to-sideline range. Willis made 54 tackles on plays labeled as \"Wide left\" or \"Wide right\" which accounted for 35.5% of his total tackles. In that area, he led all inside linebackers by a large margin.

However, shortly before the Pro Bowl, which was set in South Florida, Willis decided to play it safe and opted not to play due to a leg injury he sustained.

Willis had also made a habit of making it to the Pro Bowl.

It is located about 5&nbsp;km east of the main city centre of [[Heraklion]], near the municipality of [[Nea Alikarnassos]].  It is a shared civil/military facility.  The airport is named after Heraklion native [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a Greek writer and philosopher. Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is Crete's main and busiest airport, serving [[Heraklion]] (\u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf), [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Aghios Nikolaos]] (\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2), [[Malia, Crete|Malia]] (M\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1), [[Hersonissos]] (\u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2), [[Stalida]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1), [[Elounda]] (\u0395\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) and other resorts.\n\nA new airport for Heraklion, located 39&nbsp;km to the south-east of the city at [[Kastelli, Heraklion|Kasteli]], is under construction and due to open by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.gtp.gr/2019/02/22/kasteli-airport-deal-signed-project-ready-take-off/|title=Kasteli Airport Deal Signed, Project Ready to Take Off|date=2019-02-22|website=GTP Headlines|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Once completed, the new [[Kasteli Airport|Kasteli International Airport]] will replace the current Heraklion International Airport as the hub for central Crete.\n\n==History==\nThe airport first opened in March 1939.  This was then merely a piece of flat agricultural land.  The first aeroplane (a [[Junkers Ju 52]]) carried the first passengers to the site.  During the [[Second World War]] operations ceased, but in the fall of 1946 traffic resumed, introducing the [[DC-3]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heraklion Airport History|url=http://www.heraklion-airport.info/history.html|work=www.heraklion-airport.info|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the airport only offered very basic service, with only primitive installations on the site, in the form of three tents, smoke for wind determination and storm lamps for runway lighting.\n\nIn 1947, the first (small) terminal was erected. [[Hellenic Airlines]] started commercial flights in 1948. At that time, a total of 4,000 people were served. The year 1953 saw the construction of a paved runway which was initially 1,850 meters long and oriented as 09/27. The next major event followed in 1954, when a four-engined [[DC-4]] aircraft landed for the first time at the airport. In that year the airport handled approximately 18,000 passengers. From 1957 onward, the new [[Olympic Airways]] used the airport, starting services with the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]] aircraft. Jojo AIr also flew here but ended service on July 2, 2001.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1971, the runway was extended to 2,680 meters and a new terminal and other facilities were constructed, essentially making it a new airport. On March 18, 1971, the first charter flight from abroad ([[British Airways]]) operated at the airport. The new airport itself was officially inaugurated on May 5, 1972.\n\n== Terminal Extension ==\n{{prose|date=August 2018}}\nThe latest airport expansion projects began in October 2017. The projects will be entirely financed by the Duty Free Shops SA, in agreement with the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport and the Hellenic Ministry of Waters, without any cost to the Greek government, include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ekriti.gr/kriti-irakleio/prohoroyn-ta-erga-sto-aerodromio-irakleioy-pote-paradidetai-neo-ktirio-foto#sthash.tL6z5A0S.dpbs|title=\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf \u0397\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 -

It is located about 5&nbsp;km east of the main city centre of [[Heraklion]], near the municipality of [[Nea Alikarnassos]].  It is a shared civil/military facility.  The airport is named after Heraklion native [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], a Greek writer and philosopher. Nikos Kazantzakis Airport is Crete's main and busiest airport, serving [[Heraklion]] (\u0397\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf), [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Aghios Nikolaos]] (\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u039d\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03c2), [[Malia, Crete|Malia]] (M\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b9\u03b1), [[Hersonissos]] (\u03a7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2), [[Stalida]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1), [[Elounda]] (\u0395\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1) and other resorts.\n\nA new airport for Heraklion, located 39&nbsp;km to the south-east of the city at [[Kastelli, Heraklion|Kasteli]], is under construction and due to open by 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.gtp.gr/2019/02/22/kasteli-airport-deal-signed-project-ready-take-off/|title=Kasteli Airport Deal Signed, Project Ready to Take Off|date=2019-02-22|website=GTP Headlines|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> Once completed, the new [[Kasteli Airport|Kasteli International Airport]] will replace the current Heraklion International Airport as the hub for central Crete.\n\n==History==\nThe airport first opened in March 1939.  This was then merely a piece of flat agricultural land.  The first aeroplane (a [[Junkers Ju 52]]) carried the first passengers to the site.  During the [[Second World War]] operations ceased, but in the fall of 1946 traffic resumed, introducing the [[DC-3]] aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heraklion Airport History|url=http://www.heraklion-airport.info/history.html|work=www.heraklion-airport.info|accessdate=13 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt first, the airport only offered very basic service, with only primitive installations on the site, in the form of three tents, smoke for wind determination and storm lamps for runway lighting.\n\nIn 1947, the first (small) terminal was erected. [[Hellenic Airlines]] started commercial flights in 1948. At that time, a total of 4,000 people were served. The year 1953 saw the construction of a paved runway which was initially 1,850 meters long and oriented as 09/27. The next major event followed in 1954, when a four-engined [[DC-4]] aircraft landed for the first time at the airport. In that year the airport handled approximately 18,000 passengers. From 1957 onward, the new [[Olympic Airways]] used the airport, starting services with the [[Douglas DC-6|DC-6]] aircraft. Jojo AIr also flew here but ended service on July 2, 2001.\n\nFrom 1968 until 1971, the runway was extended to 2,680 meters and a new terminal and other facilities were constructed, essentially making it a new airport. On March 18, 1971, the first charter flight from abroad ([[British Airways]]) operated at the airport.

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">Flip Animation blog entry \"Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions\" http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">The Disney Project blog article \"The Making of Cranium Command\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html</ref> Rees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\nWhile work on the animation commenced the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref name=\"David\">Remain Seated Please blog entry \"Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!\" http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=rogpalmeruk>Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/</ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition.

During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">Flip Animation blog entry \"Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions\" http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">The Disney Project blog article \"The Making of Cranium Command\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html</ref> Rees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\nWhile work on the animation commenced the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\nThe show, against all odds, made it open on time for the pavilion's grand opening on October 19, 1989.\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref name=\"David\">Remain Seated Please blog entry \"Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!\" http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=rogpalmeruk>Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/</ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition.

He served three terms as [[prime minister of Greece]] (1944\u20131945, 1963, 1964\u20131965). He was also [[deputy prime minister]] from 1950\u20131952, in the governments of [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] and served numerous times as a cabinet minister, starting in 1923, in a political career that spanned more than five decades.<ref>David Wilsford, ed. ''Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary'' (Greenwood, 1995) pp 368-75.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born at [[Kalentzi]], in the [[Achaea]] region of the northern [[Peloponnese]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> He was the son of Father (papa) Andreas Stavropoulos, an Orthodox [[archpriest]] (protopresvyteros). He studied [[law]] in [[Athens]] and [[political science]] in [[Berlin]]. His political philosophy was heavily influenced by German [[social democracy]]. As a result, he was adamantly opposed to the monarchy and supported generous social policies, but he was also extremely [[anti-communist]] (and specifically against the [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]]'s policies in Greece). As a young man, he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal leader [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who made him governor of [[Chios]] after the [[Balkan Wars]]. One of his brothers, Nikos, was killed in the [[Battle of Kilkis-Lachanas]].\n\nHe married twice. His first wife was Sofia Mineyko, a [[Poles|Polish]] national, daughter of [[Zygmunt Mineyko]] and paternal granddaughter of Stanislaw Mineyko (1802 - 1857). Their son [[Andreas Papandreou]] was born in [[Chios]] in 1919. His second wife was the actress [[Cybele Andrianou]] and their son was named George Papandreou.\n\n==Political career==\nDuring [[National Schism|the political crisis]] surrounding [[Greece in World War I|Greece's entry]] into [[World War I]], Papandreou was one of Venizelos's closest supporters against the pro-German King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]. When Venizelos was forced to flee [[Athens]], Papandreou accompanied him to [[Crete]], and then went to Lesbos, where he mobilised anti-monarchist supporters in the islands and rallied support for Venizelos's insurgent [[Movement of National Defence|pro-Allied government in Thessaloniki]]. \n\n[[File:Plastiras Gonatas and Georgios Papandreou, 1922, in Mousounitsa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The leadership of the [[1922 Revolution]], Colonels [[Nikolaos Plastiras|Plastiras]] and Gonatas, with their political advisor, Georgios Papandreou senior (left).]]\n\nIn the [[1920 Greek legislative election|1920 general election]], Papandreou unsuccessfully ran as an independent liberal in the [[Lesbos]] constituency. In 1921 as a lawyer he defended [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]], during a trial for his critic against King Constantine. Because of an article calling Constantine to resign, he was imprisoned by the royalist regime and later he narrowly escaped assassination from royalist extremists in Lesbos.\n\nFrom January to October 1923, he served as [[Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction|interior minister]] in the cabinet of [[Stylianos Gonatas]]. In the December [[1923 Greek legislative election|1923 elections]], he was elected as a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] member of parliament for Lesvos, and served as finance minister for just 11 days in June 1925, education minister in 1930&ndash;1932 and transport minister in 1933.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Who's Who in Greece|last = |first = |publisher = Athens News|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Athens|pages = 255\u2013256}}</ref> As minister of education he reformed the Greek school system and built many schools for the children of refugees of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|Greco-Turkish War]]. During the dictatorship of Pangalos he was again imprisoned.\n\nIn 1935, he set up the [[Democratic Socialist Party of Greece]]. The same year, a royalist coup by [[Georgios Kondylis]] took place for the reestablishment of monarchy and he was placed in internal exile. A lifelong opponent of the Greek monarchy, he was again exiled in 1938 by the Greek royalist dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]].\n\nFollowing the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] in [[World War II]], he was imprisoned by the Italian authorities. He later left to the Middle East and joined the predominantly Venizelist government-in-exile based in [[Egypt]]. With British support, King [[George II of Greece|George II]] appointed him as PM and under his premiership took place the [[Lebanon conference]] (May 1944) and later the [[Caserta Agreement]] (September 1944), in an attempt to stop the crisis in Greece and the conflicts between [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and non-EAM forces (a prelude of the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]]) and establish a national unity government.\n\n===Liberation of Greece and the ''Dekemvrian\u00e1'' events===\n{{Further|Dekemvriana}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c8\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, \u039f\u03ba\u03c4\u03ce\u03b2\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Papandreou and others on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] of Athens, after the liberation from the Axis powers.]]\n\nAfter the evacuation of Greece from the Axis powers, he entered [[Athens]] (October 1944) as Prime Minister of the [[Greek government-in-exile]] with some units of the Greek army and the allied British. During the same month, he became prime minister in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Greek government of National Unity (1944) {{!}}Greek government of National Unity|el|3=\u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 1944}}, which had succeed the Greek government-in-exile. He tried to normalize the highly polarized situation between the EAM and non-EAM forces, collaborating mainly with the General [[Ronald Scobie]], who was after the Caserta agreement responsible for all the Allied forces.\n\nAlthough he resigned in 1945, after the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' events, he continued to hold high office. From 1946&ndash;1952 he served as labor minister, supplies minister, education minister, finance minister and public order minister. In 1950&ndash;1952, he was also [[deputy prime minister]].\n\nThe 1952&ndash;1961 period was a very difficult one for Papandreou. The liberal political forces in Greece were gravely weakened by internal disputes and suffered electoral defeat from the conservatives. Papandreou continuously accused [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] for these maladies, considering his leadership dour and uninspiring.\n\n===Founder of the Center Union and later confrontation with the Palace===\nIn 1961, Papandreou revived Greek liberalism by founding the [[Center Union]] Party, a confederation of old liberal Venizelists, social democrats and dissatisfied conservatives. After the [[1961 Greek legislative election|elections]] of \"violence and fraud\" of 1961, Papandreou declared a \"[[Relentless Struggle]]\" against the right-wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] and the \"parakr\u00e1tos\" (deep state) of the right.\n\nFinally, his party won the [[1963 Greek legislative election|elections]] of November 1963 and those of 1964, the second with a [[1964 Greek legislative election|landslide majority]]. His progressive policies as premier aroused much opposition in conservative circles, as did the prominent role played by his son [[Andreas Papandreou]], whose policies were seen as being considerably left of center. Andreas disagreed with his father on many important issues, and developed a network of political organizations, the [[Democratic Leagues]] (''Dimokratikoi Syndesmoi'') to lobby for more progressive policies. He also managed to take control of the Center Union's youth organization, [[EDIN]].\n\nPapandreou had opposed the [[Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement]], which led to the foundation of the Republic of [[Cyprus]]. Following clashes between the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities, his government sent a [[Greek army]] division to the island.\n\nKing [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] openly opposed Papandreou's government, and there were frequent ultra-rightist plots in the Army, which destabilised the government. Finally the King engineered a split in the Centre Union and in July 1965, in a crisis known as the ''[[Apostasia of 1965|Apostasia]]'' or ''Iouliana,'' he dismissed the government following a dispute over control of the Ministry of Defence.\n\nAfter the April 1967 military coup by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Colonels' junta]] led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]], Papandreou was arrested. Papandreou died under house arrest in November 1968. His funeral became the occasion for a massive anti-dictatorship demonstration. He is interred at the [[First Cemetery of Athens]], alongside his son Andreas.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Papandreu-Plastiras-generel-state-archives.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Papandreou with [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] officers, 1950]]\n\nPapandreou was regarded as one of the best [[Orator|orators]] in the Greek political scene and a persistent fighter for Democracy. During the Junta and after his death he was often referred to affectionately as '''\"\u03bf \u0393\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\"''' (''o G\u00e9ros tis Dimokrat\u00edas, the old man of Democracy''). Since his grandson [[George Papandreou|George A. Papandreou]] entered politics, most Greek writers use \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (''Ge\u00f3rgios'') to refer to the grandfather and the less formal \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''Gi\u00f3rgos'') to refer to the grandson.\n\n==Works==\n*''The Liberation of Greece'', Athens, 1945\n\n==Decorations and awards==\nIn 1965, the [[University of Belgrade]] awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Andreas Papandreou]], his son\n*[[George Papandreou]], his grandson\n\n==References==\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kassimeris, Christos. \"Causes of the 1967 Greek coup.\" ''Democracy and Security'' 2#1 (2006): 61-72.\n* Wilsford, David, ed.

He was also [[deputy prime minister]] from 1950\u20131952, in the governments of [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] and served numerous times as a cabinet minister, starting in 1923, in a political career that spanned more than five decades.<ref>David Wilsford, ed. ''Political leaders of contemporary Western Europe: a biographical dictionary'' (Greenwood, 1995) pp 368-75.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born at [[Kalentzi]], in the [[Achaea]] region of the northern [[Peloponnese]].<ref name=\"EB\"/> He was the son of Father (papa) Andreas Stavropoulos, an Orthodox [[archpriest]] (protopresvyteros). He studied [[law]] in [[Athens]] and [[political science]] in [[Berlin]]. His political philosophy was heavily influenced by German [[social democracy]]. As a result, he was adamantly opposed to the monarchy and supported generous social policies, but he was also extremely [[anti-communist]] (and specifically against the [[Communist Party of Greece|KKE]]'s policies in Greece). As a young man, he became involved in politics as a supporter of the Liberal leader [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], who made him governor of [[Chios]] after the [[Balkan War]] of 1912. One of his brothers, Nikos, was killed in the [[Battle of Kilkis-Lachanas]].\n\nHe married twice. His first wife was Sofia Mineyko, a [[Poles|Polish]] national, daughter of [[Zygmunt Mineyko]] and paternal granddaughter of Stanislaw Mineyko (1802 - 1857). Their son [[Andreas Papandreou]] was born in [[Chios]] in 1919. His second wife was the actress [[Cybele Andrianou]] and their son was named George Papandreou.\n\n==Political career==\nDuring [[National Schism|the political crisis]] surrounding [[Greece in World War I|Greece's entry]] into [[World War I]], Papandreou was one of Venizelos's closest supporters against the pro-German King [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine I]]. When Venizelos was forced to flee [[Athens]], Papandreou accompanied him to [[Crete]], and then went to Lesbos, where he mobilised anti-monarchist supporters in the islands and rallied support for Venizelos's insurgent [[Movement of National Defence|pro-Allied government in Thessaloniki]]. \n\n[[File:Plastiras Gonatas and Georgios Papandreou, 1922, in Mousounitsa.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The leadership of the [[1922 Revolution]], Colonels [[Nikolaos Plastiras|Plastiras]] and Gonatas, with their political advisor, Georgios Papandreou senior (left).]]\n\nIn the [[1920 Greek legislative election|1920 general election]], Papandreou unsuccessfully ran as an independent liberal in the [[Lesbos]] constituency. In 1921 as a lawyer he defended [[Alexandros Papanastasiou]], during a trial for his critic against King Constantine. Because of an article calling Constantine to resign, he was imprisoned by the royalist regime and later he narrowly escaped assassination from royalist extremists in Lesbos.\n\nFrom January to October 1923, he served as [[Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Reconstruction|interior minister]] in the cabinet of [[Stylianos Gonatas]]. In the December [[1923 Greek legislative election|1923 elections]], he was elected as a [[Venizelism|Venizelist]] [[Liberal Party (Greece)|Liberal Party]] member of parliament for Lesvos, and served as finance minister for just 11 days in June 1925, education minister in 1930&ndash;1932 and transport minister in 1933.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Who's Who in Greece|last = |first = |publisher = Athens News|year = 1959|isbn = |location = Athens|pages = 255\u2013256}}</ref> As minister of education he reformed the Greek school system and built many schools for the children of refugees of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|Greco-Turkish War]]. During the dictatorship of Pangalos he was again imprisoned.\n\nIn 1935, he set up the [[Democratic Socialist Party of Greece]]. The same year, a royalist coup by [[Georgios Kondylis]] took place for the reestablishment of monarchy and he was placed in internal exile. A lifelong opponent of the Greek monarchy, he was again exiled in 1938 by the Greek royalist dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]].\n\nFollowing the [[Axis occupation of Greece]] in [[World War II]], he was imprisoned by the Italian authorities. He later left to the Middle East and joined the predominantly Venizelist government-in-exile based in [[Egypt]]. With British support, King [[George II of Greece|George II]] appointed him as PM and under his premiership took place the [[Lebanon conference]] (May 1944) and later the [[Caserta Agreement]] (September 1944), in an attempt to stop the crisis in Greece and the conflicts between [[National Liberation Front (Greece)|EAM]] and non-EAM forces (a prelude of the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]]) and establish a national unity government.\n\n===Liberation of Greece and the ''Dekemvrian\u00e1'' events===\n{{Further|Dekemvriana}}\n\n[[File:\u0397 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c5\u03c8\u03c9\u03b8\u03b5\u03af \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b7 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, \u039f\u03ba\u03c4\u03ce\u03b2\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 1944.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Papandreou and others on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] of Athens, after the liberation from the Axis powers.]]\n\nAfter the evacuation of Greece from the Axis powers, he entered [[Athens]] (October 1944) as Prime Minister of the [[Greek government-in-exile]] with some units of the Greek army and the allied British. During the same month, he became prime minister in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Greek government of National Unity (1944) {{!}}Greek government of National Unity|el|3=\u039a\u03c5\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u0393\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03b8\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03bd\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 1944}}, which had succeed the Greek government-in-exile. He tried to normalize the highly polarized situation between the EAM and non-EAM forces, collaborating mainly with the General [[Ronald Scobie]], who was after the Caserta agreement responsible for all the Allied forces.\n\nAlthough he resigned in 1945, after the ''[[Dekemvriana]]'' events, he continued to hold high office. From 1946&ndash;1952 he served as labor minister, supplies minister, education minister, finance minister and public order minister. In 1950&ndash;1952, he was also [[deputy prime minister]].\n\nThe 1952&ndash;1961 period was a very difficult one for Papandreou. The liberal political forces in Greece were gravely weakened by internal disputes and suffered electoral defeat from the conservatives. Papandreou continuously accused [[Sofoklis Venizelos]] for these maladies, considering his leadership dour and uninspiring.\n\n===Founder of the Center Union and later confrontation with the Palace===\nIn 1961, Papandreou revived Greek liberalism by founding the [[Center Union]] Party, a confederation of old liberal Venizelists, social democrats and dissatisfied conservatives. After the [[1961 Greek legislative election|elections]] of \"violence and fraud\" of 1961, Papandreou declared a \"[[Relentless Struggle]]\" against the right-wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] and the \"parakr\u00e1tos\" (deep state) of the right.\n\nFinally, his party won the [[1963 Greek legislative election|elections]] of November 1963 and those of 1964, the second with a [[1964 Greek legislative election|landslide majority]]. His progressive policies as premier aroused much opposition in conservative circles, as did the prominent role played by his son [[Andreas Papandreou]], whose policies were seen as being considerably left of center. Andreas disagreed with his father on many important issues, and developed a network of political organizations, the [[Democratic Leagues]] (''Dimokratikoi Syndesmoi'') to lobby for more progressive policies. He also managed to take control of the Center Union's youth organization, [[EDIN]].\n\nPapandreou had opposed the [[Z\u00fcrich and London Agreement]], which led to the foundation of the Republic of [[Cyprus]]. Following clashes between the [[Greek Cypriots|Greek]] and [[Turkish Cypriots|Turkish]] communities, his government sent a [[Greek army]] division to the island.\n\nKing [[Constantine II of Greece|Constantine II]] openly opposed Papandreou's government, and there were frequent ultra-rightist plots in the Army, which destabilised the government. Finally the King engineered a split in the Centre Union and in July 1965, in a crisis known as the ''[[Apostasia of 1965|Apostasia]]'' or ''Iouliana,'' he dismissed the government following a dispute over control of the Ministry of Defence.\n\nAfter the April 1967 military coup by the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974|Colonels' junta]] led by [[Georgios Papadopoulos|George Papadopoulos]], Papandreou was arrested. Papandreou died under house arrest in November 1968. His funeral became the occasion for a massive anti-dictatorship demonstration. He is interred at the [[First Cemetery of Athens]], alongside his son Andreas.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Papandreu-Plastiras-generel-state-archives.jpg|thumb|200px|Georgios Papandreou with [[Nikolaos Plastiras]] and [[Hellenic Gendarmerie|Gendarmerie]] officers, 1950]]\n\nPapandreou was regarded as one of the best [[Orator|orators]] in the Greek political scene and a persistent fighter for Democracy. During the Junta and after his death he was often referred to affectionately as '''\"\u03bf \u0393\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\"''' (''o G\u00e9ros tis Dimokrat\u00edas, the old man of Democracy''). Since his grandson [[George Papandreou|George A. Papandreou]] entered politics, most Greek writers use \u0393\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (''Ge\u00f3rgios'') to refer to the grandfather and the less formal \u0393\u03b9\u03ce\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (''Gi\u00f3rgos'') to refer to the grandson.\n\n==Works==\n*''The Liberation of Greece'', Athens, 1945\n\n==Decorations and awards==\nIn 1965, the [[University of Belgrade]] awarded him an [[honorary doctorate]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Andreas Papandreou]], his son\n*[[George Papandreou]], his grandson\n\n==References==\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2015}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kassimeris, Christos. \"Causes of the 1967 Greek coup.\" ''Democracy and Security'' 2#1 (2006): 61-72.\n* Wilsford, David, ed.

By the mid-1960s, 14 international airlines were landing at the airport.\n\nThe airport's name was changed from Lod to '''Ben Gurion International Airport''' in 1973 to honour Israel's first Prime Minister, [[David Ben-Gurion]], who died that year.\n\n====Terrorist incidents (1972)====\nWhile Ben Gurion Airport has been a target of Palestinian attacks, the adoption of [[airport security|strict security precaution]]s has ensured that no aircraft departing from Ben Gurion airport has ever been [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]]. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at Ben Gurion, contributing to two major incidents in the airport's history.\n\nIn the first incident, on 8 May 1972, four Palestinian [[Black September (group)|Black September]] terrorists [[Hijacking of Sabena Flight 572|hijacked a Sabena flight]] en route from Vienna and forced it to land at Ben Gurion airport. [[Sayeret Matkal]] commandos, including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], led by [[Ehud Barak]] (both future Israeli Prime Ministers) stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two.

From there, passengers proceeded upstairs to the main departures hall, which contained [[Border control|passport control]], [[duty-free shop]]s, [[Airport lounge|VIP lounge]]s, one synagogue and boarding gates. At the gates, travelers would be required to descend a flight of stairs to return to the ground floor where waiting shuttle buses transported them to airplanes on the [[Airport ramp|tarmac]]. The arrivals hall with passport control, luggage carousels, duty-free pick-up and customs was located at the south end of the building. The [[Airport bus#On airport transfer|shuttle-buses]] transferred passengers and crews to and from the terminal to airplanes which were parked on the tarmac over {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} away. After Terminal 3 opened, Terminal 1 was closed except for domestic flights to the airport in [[Eilat]] and government flights such as special immigrant flights from North America and Africa.

Firstly, the public halls have a ''Land-of-Israel character'' with walls painted in the colors of Israel's [[Judean Hills|Judean]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Galilee]] mountains. The Departure Hall is given an atmosphere of vacation and leisure, whilst the Arrivals Hall is given a more urban theme as passengers return to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/Terminal+1/PrinciplesofArchitecturalPlanning_en.htm |title=Principles of Architectural Planning |accessdate=12 April 2008 |publisher=IAA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412034555/http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/Terminal%2B1/PrinciplesofArchitecturalPlanning_en.htm |archivedate=12 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Terminal 1 TLV 19645.jpg|thumb|Private jets on the apron at Terminal 1]]\nIn February 2006, the [[Israel Airports Authority]] announced plans to invest 4.3 million [[Israeli new sheqel|NIS]] in a new VIP wing for [[Business jet|private jet]] passengers and crews, as well as others interested in avoiding the main terminal.

Most [[landing]]s take place on this runway from West to East, approaching from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] over southern Tel Aviv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/israel/ben_gurion_israel.htm |title=Ben Gurion Airport |accessdate=27 April 2007|publisher=World Aero Data}}</ref> During inclement weather, it may also be used for [[takeoff]]s (Direction 12). A 17 million NIS renovation project was completed in November 2007 which reinforced the runway and made it suitable for future [[wide-body aircraft]]. In September 2008, a new [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] serving the runway was activated. The main runway was closed from 2011 until early 2014 in order to accommodate the extension of runway 03/21 and other construction activity in the vicinity of the runway.\n\n===Short runway===\nWhen it was originally built, the short runway (direction '''03/21''') was {{convert|1780|m|abbr=on}} long, making it too short to accommodate most mainline passenger jets. At the time it mainly served [[cargo aircraft]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]] and as a taxiway for runway 26. However, by late 2011, the runway was closed and most of the activity in the military apron to the east of the runway was permanently relocated to the [[Nevatim Airbase]] in southern Israel. In late May 2014 the runway was reopened after having been rebuilt and lengthened to {{convert|2772|m|abbr=on}}, allowing it to handle most types of aircraft. It is equipped with an ILS and mostly handles landings from north to south.\n\n===Quiet runway===\nThe longest runway at the airfield, {{convert|4062|m|abbr=on}}, and the main take off runway from east to west (direction '''08/26'''), is referred to as \"the quiet runway\" since jets taking off in this direction produce less [[noise pollution]] for surrounding residents{{vague|date=November 2014}}. A 24 million NIS renovation project completed in February 2006 reinforced the runway and made it suitable for [[wide-body aircraft]] such as [[Airbus A380]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_070306.htm |title=Renovation of Runway 26-08 Completed; Became Operative on Sunday, February 26 |accessdate=28 April 2007|date=7 March 2006|publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref>\n\n===History and development===\nThe original layout of the airfield as designed by the British in the 1930s included four intersecting 800 m runways suitable for the [[piston engined aircraft]] of the day. However, none of this original layout is visible nowadays since as usage increased and aircraft types and needs changed over the years various runways on the airport's premises were built and removed.\n\nThe main runway (12/30) is the oldest surviving runway in the airport, with the quiet (08/26) and short (03/21) runways having been built in the late 1960s and 1970s. Since very little commercial traffic could operate on the short runway, it meant that for approximately forty years, the airport mostly relied on runways 12/30 and 08/26. This presented a problem however; the fact that these two runways intersect near their western end creates a crisscross pattern between aircraft landing and taking off. This pattern reduces the number of aircraft which can arrive to and depart from the airport and has detrimental safety implications as well.\n\nWith passenger traffic projected to increase, plans were drawn in the 1980s and 90s for the extension of runways 03/21 and 08/26 as a means of alleviating some of Ben Gurion's safety and capacity concerns. These plans were approved in 1997 and construction began in 2010. The extension of runway 03/21 allows the airport to operate in an \"open V\" configuration, allowing for simultaneous landings and take offs on runways 08/26 and 03/21 and thus more than double the number of aircraft movements which can be handled at peak times, while increasing the overall level of air safety in and around the airport. Construction took four years and cost 1 billion NIS (financed from the Israeli Airports Authority budget) and was completed 29 May 2014. It included paving 22 kilometers of runways and taxiways, using more than 1.5 million tons of asphalt, laying one million meters of runway lighting cables, 50,000 meters of high-voltage power lines and 10,000 light fixtures.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-New-Ben-Gurion-airport-runways-inaugurated-1000942781 |title=New Ben Gurion airport runways inaugurated |accessdate=29 May 2014|last=Peretz-Zilberman |first=Sapir |date=29 May 2014|publisher=Globes English |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> The construction of several new taxiways between the existing runways and terminals also significantly reduced [[taxiing|taxi]] times at the airport.\n\n====Citizen objections====\nWhile Ben Gurion Airport is conveniently located in the very center of the country, this fact also means that the airport is surrounded by various residential communities who often complain of noise pollution caused by the airport. Following the completion of the extension of runway 03/21, residents north of the airport sued the Israeli aviation authorities claiming that the authorities intend to use the runway to a greater degree than was originally agreed with them during the approval process for the airport runways' reconfiguration project.\n\n==Security procedures==\n\n===Overview===\nBen Gurion International Airport is the world's most [[airport security|secure airport]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/08/23/what_israeli_security_could_teach_us/ |title=What Israeli security could teach us |accessdate=27 April 2007|last=Jacoby |first=Jeff |date=23 August 2006|newspaper=The Boston Globe }}</ref> Security operates on several levels.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/belal.html |title=Is This What We Really Want? |accessdate=27 April 2007|last=Beyer |first=Lisa |magazine=TIME | date=24 September 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312052712/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/belal.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAll cars, taxis, buses and trucks go through a preliminary security [[Border checkpoint|checkpoint]] before entering the airport compound. Armed [[security guard|guards]] spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may strike up a conversation to further assess the person's intent. [[Undercover|Plainclothes]] armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden [[surveillance camera]]s operate at all times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent|title=What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?|publisher=Access Control & Security Systems|accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref> Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as a minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and [[Strip search|body search]]es may be conducted.\n\nUntil August 2007 there was a system of color codes on [[checked baggage]] but the practice was discontinued after complaints of discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blumenkrantz |first=Zohar |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/colored-tags-for-arabs-luggage-at-ben-gurion-airport-discontinued-1.227007 |title=Color tags discontinued |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> In the past, checked baggage was screened following the personal interview and before passengers arrived at the check-in desks. Occasionally, if security assessed a person as a low risk, they were passed straight through to the check-in desks, bypassing the main [[X-ray]] machines, a practice which also drew some discrimination complaints. This process ceased in April 2014 when the main X-ray machines were removed from the passenger queuing area in terminal 3 and baggage screening began being performed after the baggage was checked-in by airline representatives (as is common in most airports around the world). Terminal 1 began using the same procedure in summer 2017.\n\n===Baggage screening===\nAfter check-in, all checked baggage is screened using sophisticated X-ray and [[Industrial computed tomography|CT]] scanners and put in a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the [[metal detector]]s and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on [[country of origin]], or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited Arab countries are subject to further questioning.<ref name=\"CAv.org\">{{cite news|title=Israel airport is safe but hard to emulate|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg17059.html|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=17 September 2001|first=Paulo|last=Prada|first2=Daniel|last2=Michaels|accessdate=4 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031045808/http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg17059.html|archive-date=31 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\nThe following airlines serve the following destinations at Ben Gurion Airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Full List of Flights to Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv, Israel |url=https://www.touristisrael.com/full-list-flights-tel-aviv-israel/12331/ |accessdate=22 February 2020|date=27 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Passenger===\n<!-- WHEN ADDING A NEW ROUTE, OR ADDING AN END DATE FOR A ROUTE PLEASE ADD A REFERENCE, ALSO ADD THE ROUTE AND LINK ON THE CORRESPONDING AIRPORTS ARTICLE AND THE AIRLINES ARTICLE IF IT IS A NEW DESTINATION, ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT REFERENCED WILL BE REMOVED.

(Israel)|Highway 40]]. The airport is accessible by car or public bus. [[Israel Railways]] operates [[airport rail link|train service from the airport]] to several parts of the country and taxi stands are located outside the arrivals building. A popular transportation option is a [[share taxi]] van, known in Hebrew as a \"monit sherut\" (service cab), going to [[Jerusalem]], [[Haifa]] and [[Beer Sheva]].\n\n===Public transport===\nIsrael has an integrated nationwide [[public transport]] payment system covering multiple transit options  (train, bus and light rail) run by various operators using a single payment card: the [[Rav-Kav]]. It features flexible tariff arrangements and offers free transfers between transit methods within certain geographical zones and time periods. A public transport information office which also issues Rav-Kav cards is located in the arrivals hall of Terminal 3. With a few exceptions, most public transport options (except for taxis and service cabs) do not operate on the Sabbath (i.e., from early Friday evenings to late Saturday evenings as well as certain Jewish holidays).\n\n====Rail====\n[[File:BenGuTra.jpg|thumb|Platform 1 of the airport train station at Terminal 3]]\n{{main|Ben Gurion Airport Railway Station}}\n[[Israel Railways]] operates the Ben Gurion Airport Railway Station, located in the lower level of Terminal 3. From this station passengers may head north-west to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]] and other destinations in the north, or south-east to [[Modi'in]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The journey to [[Tel Aviv Savidor Central railway station]] takes about 18 minutes and to Jerusalem's [[Jerusalem\u2013Yitzhak Navon railway station|Navon station]] about 25 minutes. There is also late night/early morning train service to and from the airport terminating at [[Be'er Sheva Center railway station|Beersheba Center]] via [[Lod railway station|Lod]], [[Ashkelon railway station|Ashkelon]] and selected destinations inbetween. Almost 3.3 million passengers used the railway line to and from the airport in 2009. The service does not operate on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s but on all other days it runs day and night. The line to [[Nahariya]] through Tel Aviv and Haifa operates 24 hours a day on weekdays.\n\n====Bus or taxi====\nThe airport is served by regular inter-city bus lines, limousine and private shuttle services, [[Share taxi|Sherut]] \"shared\" door to door taxi vans and regular taxis.<ref>{{cite web| title=Guidelines for Taxi Passengers| url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/Taxis/| publisher=Israel Airports Authority| accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061117091144/http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/Taxis/| archivedate=17 November 2006| url-status= live}}</ref> Afikim bus company provides 24 hours a day, on the hour, direct service to Jerusalem with line 485. the line departs from Terminal 3 on the 2nd floor and passes through Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web | title=The resource cannot be found. | url=http://www.callkav.gov.il/WebForms/wfrmMain.aspx?width=1024&company=1&language=he&state=# | publisher=Ministry of Transport | access-date=30 September 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714023040/http://www.callkav.gov.il/WebForms/wfrmMain.aspx?width=1024&company=1&language=he&state= | archive-date=14 July 2017 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus number 5 ferries passengers between the terminals and a small bus terminal in the nearby Airport City business park near El Al junction just outside the airport where they can connect to regular Egged bus routes passing through the area.

At the gates, travelers would be required to descend a flight of stairs to return to the ground floor where waiting shuttle buses transported them to airplanes on the [[Airport ramp|tarmac]]. The arrivals hall with passport control, luggage carousels, duty-free pick-up and customs was located at the south end of the building. The [[Airport bus#On airport transfer|shuttle-buses]] transferred passengers and crews to and from the terminal to airplanes which were parked on the tarmac over {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}} away. After Terminal 3 opened, Terminal 1 was closed except for domestic flights to the airport in [[Eilat]] and government flights such as special immigrant flights from North America and Africa.

Firstly, the public halls have a ''Land-of-Israel character'' with walls painted in the colors of Israel's [[Judean Hills|Judean]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Galilee]] mountains. The Departure Hall is given an atmosphere of vacation and leisure, whilst the Arrivals Hall is given a more urban theme as passengers return to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/Terminal+1/PrinciplesofArchitecturalPlanning_en.htm |title=Principles of Architectural Planning |accessdate=12 April 2008 |publisher=IAA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412034555/http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/Terminal%2B1/PrinciplesofArchitecturalPlanning_en.htm |archivedate=12 April 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Terminal 1 TLV 19645.jpg|thumb|Private jets on the apron at Terminal 1]]\nIn February 2006, the [[Israel Airports Authority]] announced plans to invest 4.3 million [[Israeli new sheqel|NIS]] in a new VIP wing for [[Business jet|private jet]] passengers and crews, as well as others interested in avoiding the main terminal.

In addition, air cargo facilities would be relocated to a large, currently-unused tract of land in the northern part of the airport's property (north of runway 08/26) where additional aircraft maintenance facilities would also be built.\n\nIn the meantime, to ease immediate overcrowding problems at Terminal 3's landside terminal, in the Spring of 2018 a temporary large, air-conditioned tent was erected adjacent to Terminal 3 housing 25 check-in counters and security screening facilities.\n\nIn August 2018, the IAA published a tender for the construction and operation of a new terminal, dedicated to handling private and executive aircraft traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.port2port.com/article/Air-Transport/Airports/Israel-Airports-Authority-to-build-private-plane-terminal-at-Ben-Gurion-Airport|title=Israel Airports Authority to build private plane terminal at Ben Gurion Airport|publisher=port2port.co.il|accessdate=28 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Office buildings==\nThe [[Airport City (Israel)|Airport City]] development, a large office park, is located east of the main airport property.

Most [[landing]]s take place on this runway from West to East, approaching from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] over southern Tel Aviv.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/israel/ben_gurion_israel.htm |title=Ben Gurion Airport |accessdate=27 April 2007|publisher=World Aero Data}}</ref> During inclement weather, it may also be used for [[takeoff]]s (Direction 12). A 17 million NIS renovation project was completed in November 2007 which reinforced the runway and made it suitable for future [[wide-body aircraft]]. In September 2008, a new [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] serving the runway was activated. The main runway was closed from 2011 until early 2014 in order to accommodate the extension of runway 03/21 and other construction activity in the vicinity of the runway.\n\n===Short runway===\nWhen it was originally built, the short runway (direction '''03/21''') was {{convert|1780|m|abbr=on}} long, making it too short to accommodate most mainline passenger jets. At the time it mainly served [[cargo aircraft]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]] and as a taxiway for runway 26. However, by late 2011, the runway was closed and most of the activity in the military apron to the east of the runway was permanently relocated to the [[Nevatim Airbase]] in southern Israel. In late May 2014 the runway was reopened after having been rebuilt and lengthened to {{convert|2772|m|abbr=on}}, allowing it to handle most types of aircraft. It is equipped with an ILS and mostly handles landings from north to south.\n\n===Quiet runway===\nThe longest runway at the airfield, {{convert|4062|m|abbr=on}}, and the main take off runway from east to west (direction '''08/26'''), is referred to as \"the quiet runway\" since jets taking off in this direction produce less [[noise pollution]] for surrounding residents{{vague|date=November 2014}}. A 24 million NIS renovation project completed in February 2006 reinforced the runway and made it suitable for [[wide-body aircraft]] such as [[Airbus A380]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_070306.htm |title=Renovation of Runway 26-08 Completed; Became Operative on Sunday, February 26 |accessdate=28 April 2007|date=7 March 2006|publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref>\n\n===History and development===\nThe original layout of the airfield as designed by the British in the 1930s included four intersecting 800 m runways suitable for the [[piston engined aircraft]] of the day. However, none of this original layout is visible nowadays since as usage increased and aircraft types and needs changed over the years various runways on the airport's premises were built and removed.\n\nThe main runway (12/30) is the oldest surviving runway in the airport, with the quiet (08/26) and short (03/21) runways having been built in the late 1960s and 1970s. Since very little commercial traffic could operate on the short runway, it meant that for approximately forty years, the airport mostly relied on runways 12/30 and 08/26. This presented a problem however; the fact that these two runways intersect near their western end creates a crisscross pattern between aircraft landing and taking off. This pattern reduces the number of aircraft which can arrive to and depart from the airport and has detrimental safety implications as well.\n\nWith passenger traffic projected to increase, plans were drawn in the 1980s and 90s for the extension of runways 03/21 and 08/26 as a means of alleviating some of Ben Gurion's safety and capacity concerns. These plans were approved in 1997 and construction began in 2010. The extension of runway 03/21 allows the airport to operate in an \"open V\" configuration, allowing for simultaneous landings and take offs on runways 08/26 and 03/21 and thus more than double the number of aircraft movements which can be handled at peak times, while increasing the overall level of air safety in and around the airport. Construction took four years and cost 1 billion NIS (financed from the Israeli Airports Authority budget) and was completed 29 May 2014. It included paving 22 kilometers of runways and taxiways, using more than 1.5 million tons of asphalt, laying one million meters of runway lighting cables, 50,000 meters of high-voltage power lines and 10,000 light fixtures.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-New-Ben-Gurion-airport-runways-inaugurated-1000942781 |title=New Ben Gurion airport runways inaugurated |accessdate=29 May 2014|last=Peretz-Zilberman |first=Sapir |date=29 May 2014|publisher=Globes English |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> The construction of several new taxiways between the existing runways and terminals also significantly reduced [[taxiing|taxi]] times at the airport.\n\n====Citizen objections====\nWhile Ben Gurion Airport is conveniently located in the very center of the country, this fact also means that the airport is surrounded by various residential communities who often complain of noise pollution caused by the airport. Following the completion of the extension of runway 03/21, residents north of the airport sued the Israeli aviation authorities claiming that the authorities intend to use the runway to a greater degree than was originally agreed with them during the approval process for the airport runways' reconfiguration project.\n\n==Security procedures==\n\n===Overview===\nBen Gurion International Airport is the world's most [[airport security|secure airport]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/08/23/what_israeli_security_could_teach_us/ |title=What Israeli security could teach us |accessdate=27 April 2007|last=Jacoby |first=Jeff |date=23 August 2006|newspaper=The Boston Globe }}</ref> Security operates on several levels.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/belal.html |title=Is This What We Really Want? |accessdate=27 April 2007|last=Beyer |first=Lisa |magazine=TIME | date=24 September 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312052712/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/belal.html|archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nAll cars, taxis, buses and trucks go through a preliminary security [[Border checkpoint|checkpoint]] before entering the airport compound. Armed [[security guard|guards]] spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars, taxis and boarding buses, exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers. Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may strike up a conversation to further assess the person's intent. [[Undercover|Plainclothes]] armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden [[surveillance camera]]s operate at all times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent|title=What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?|publisher=Access Control & Security Systems|accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref> Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol. Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as a minute, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and [[Strip search|body search]]es may be conducted.\n\nUntil August 2007 there was a system of color codes on [[checked baggage]] but the practice was discontinued after complaints of discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|last=Blumenkrantz |first=Zohar |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/colored-tags-for-arabs-luggage-at-ben-gurion-airport-discontinued-1.227007 |title=Color tags discontinued |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2007-08-07 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> In the past, checked baggage was screened following the personal interview and before passengers arrived at the check-in desks. Occasionally, if security assessed a person as a low risk, they were passed straight through to the check-in desks, bypassing the main [[X-ray]] machines, a practice which also drew some discrimination complaints. This process ceased in April 2014 when the main X-ray machines were removed from the passenger queuing area in terminal 3 and baggage screening began being performed after the baggage was checked-in by airline representatives (as is common in most airports around the world). Terminal 1 began using the same procedure in summer 2017.\n\n===Baggage screening===\nAfter check-in, all checked baggage is screened using sophisticated X-ray and [[Industrial computed tomography|CT]] scanners and put in a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Following the check-in process, passengers continue to personal security and passport control. Before passing through the [[metal detector]]s and putting carry-on baggage through the X-ray machine at the security checkpoint, passports and boarding passes are re-inspected and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are verified once again. Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on [[country of origin]], or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited Arab countries are subject to further questioning.<ref name=\"CAv.org\">{{cite news|title=Israel airport is safe but hard to emulate|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg17059.html|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=17 September 2001|first=Paulo|last=Prada|first2=Daniel|last2=Michaels|accessdate=4 May 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031045808/http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg17059.html|archive-date=31 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\nThe following airlines serve the following destinations at Ben Gurion Airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=Full List of Flights to Ben Gurion Airport, Tel Aviv, Israel |url=https://www.touristisrael.com/full-list-flights-tel-aviv-israel/12331/ |accessdate=22 February 2020|date=27 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Passenger===\n<!-- WHEN ADDING A NEW ROUTE, OR ADDING AN END DATE FOR A ROUTE PLEASE ADD A REFERENCE, ALSO ADD THE ROUTE AND LINK ON THE CORRESPONDING AIRPORTS ARTICLE AND THE AIRLINES ARTICLE IF IT IS A NEW DESTINATION, ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT REFERENCED WILL BE REMOVED.

(Israel)|Highway 40]]. The airport is accessible by car or public bus. [[Israel Railways]] operates [[airport rail link|train service from the airport]] to several parts of the country and taxi stands are located outside the arrivals building. A popular transportation option is a [[share taxi]] van, known in Hebrew as a \"monit sherut\" (service cab), going to [[Jerusalem]], [[Haifa]] and [[Beer Sheva]].\n\n===Public transport===\nIsrael has an integrated nationwide [[public transport]] payment system covering multiple transit options  (train, bus and light rail) run by various operators using a single payment card: the [[Rav-Kav]]. It features flexible tariff arrangements and offers free transfers between transit methods within certain geographical zones and time periods. A public transport information office which also issues Rav-Kav cards is located in the arrivals hall of Terminal 3. With a few exceptions, most public transport options (except for taxis and service cabs) do not operate on the Sabbath (i.e., from early Friday evenings to late Saturday evenings as well as certain Jewish holidays).\n\n====Rail====\n[[File:BenGuTra.jpg|thumb|Platform 1 of the airport train station at Terminal 3]]\n{{main|Ben Gurion Airport Railway Station}}\n[[Israel Railways]] operates the Ben Gurion Airport Railway Station, located in the lower level of Terminal 3. From this station passengers may head north-west to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]] and other destinations in the north, or south-east to [[Modi'in]] and [[Jerusalem]]. The journey to [[Tel Aviv Savidor Central railway station]] takes about 18 minutes and to Jerusalem's [[Jerusalem\u2013Yitzhak Navon railway station|Navon station]] about 25 minutes. There is also late night/early morning train service to and from the airport terminating at [[Be'er Sheva Center railway station|Beersheba Center]] via [[Lod railway station|Lod]], [[Ashkelon railway station|Ashkelon]] and selected destinations inbetween. Almost 3.3 million passengers used the railway line to and from the airport in 2009. The service does not operate on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday]]s but on all other days it runs day and night. The line to [[Nahariya]] through Tel Aviv and Haifa operates 24 hours a day on weekdays.\n\n====Bus or taxi====\nThe airport is served by regular inter-city bus lines, limousine and private shuttle services, [[Share taxi|Sherut]] \"shared\" door to door taxi vans and regular taxis.<ref>{{cite web| title=Guidelines for Taxi Passengers| url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/Taxis/| publisher=Israel Airports Authority| accessdate=27 April 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061117091144/http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/Taxis/| archivedate=17 November 2006| url-status= live}}</ref> Afikim bus company provides 24 hours a day, on the hour, direct service to Jerusalem with line 485. the line departs from Terminal 3 on the 2nd floor and passes through Terminal 1.<ref>{{cite web | title=The resource cannot be found. | url=http://www.callkav.gov.il/WebForms/wfrmMain.aspx?width=1024&company=1&language=he&state=# | publisher=Ministry of Transport | access-date=30 September 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714023040/http://www.callkav.gov.il/WebForms/wfrmMain.aspx?width=1024&company=1&language=he&state= | archive-date=14 July 2017 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus number 5 ferries passengers between the terminals and a small bus terminal in the nearby Airport City business park near El Al junction just outside the airport where they can connect to regular Egged bus routes passing through the area.

[[Tel Aviv]] placed second in the grouping of airports which carry between 5 and 15 million passengers per year behind [[Japan]]'s [[Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport|Nagoya Airport]]. The survey consisted of 34 questions. A random sampling of 350 passengers at the departure gate were asked how satisfied they were with the service, infrastructure and facilities. Ben Gurion received a rating of 3.94 out of 5, followed by Vienna, Munich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, Copenhagen and Helsinki.
