She was found guilty of performing medical experiments on [[concentration camp]] inmates and sentenced to 20 years in prison.]]\nOne of the most fundamental ethical principles in human experimentation is that the experimenter should not subject the participants in the experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves.  This idea was first codified in the [[Nuremberg Code]]<ref>[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/archive/nurcode.html The Nuremberg Code], U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, accessed and archived, 20 December 2015</ref> in 1947, which was a result of the [[Doctors' trial|trials of Nazi doctors]] at the [[Nuremberg trials]] accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments.  Several of these doctors were hanged.  Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part.  The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]].<ref>Altman, pp. xv-xvii</ref>\n\nAnother ethical principle is that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting.  Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an [[AIDS]] vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit.<ref>Altman, p. xx</ref>\n\nAn important element of an ethics committee's oversight is to ensure that [[informed consent]] of the subjects has been given. Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure that is going to take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand.  The principle of informed consent was first enacted in the [[U.S. Army]]'s research into [[Yellow fever]] in [[Cuba]] in 1901.  However, there was no general or official guidance at this time.<ref>Gandevia, p. 43</ref>  That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code.<ref>Altman, pp. xvi,157</ref>  This was further developed in the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] in 1964 by the [[World Medical Association]] which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines.<ref>Gandevia, pp. 43\u201344</ref>\n\nThe convening of ethics committees to approve the research protocol in human experiments was first written into international guidelines in the first revision to the Declaration of Helsinki (Helsinki II, 1975).<ref>Riis, p. 173</ref>  A controversy arose over the fourth revision (1996) concerning placebo trials in [[developing country|developing countries]]. It was claimed that US trials of the anti-[[HIV]] drug [[zidovudine]] in India was in breach of this requirement.

Other notable buildings by Wren include the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], and the south front of [[Hampton Court Palace]]. The [[Wren Building]], the main building at the [[College of William and Mary]], Virginia, is attributed to Wren.\n\nEducated in [[Latin]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], Wren was a founder of the [[Royal Society]] (president 1680\u20131682), and his scientific work was highly regarded by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\n== Life and works ==\nWren was born in [[East Knoyle]] in [[Wiltshire]], the only surviving son of [[Christopher Wren (priest)|Christopher Wren the Elder]] (1589\u20131658) and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from [[Fonthill Bishop]]. Christopher Sr. was at that time the rector of East Knoyle and later [[Dean of Windsor]]. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children were born who died within a few weeks of their birth. Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |title=Wiltshire Council \u2013 Wiltshire Community History Get Wiltshire History Question Information |publisher=History.wiltshire.gov.uk |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311164641/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs a child Wren \"seem'd consumptive.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wren|Ames|Wren|1750}}</ref> Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father's royal appointment as [[Dean of Windsor]] in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nLittle is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at [[Westminster School]] between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by ''Parentalia'', the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there \"for some short time\" before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]]'s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/sir-christopher-wren|title=Sir Christopher Wren {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wadham College.jpg|thumb|[[Wadham College]], Oxford, where Wren was a student in 1650\u201351]]\nSome of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in [[Latin]] and also learned to draw. According to ''Parentalia'', he was \"initiated\" in the principles of mathematics by Dr [[William Holder]], who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, ''Cerebri Anatome'' (1664), published by [[Thomas Willis]], which coined the term \"neurology.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/april-2017/five-depictions-brain|title=Five depictions of the brain - ''The Psychologist''|publisher=bps.org.uk|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> During this time period, Wren manifested an interest in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met [[Sir Charles Scarburgh]] whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nOn 25 June 1650, Wren entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Latin]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with [[John Wilkins]], the Warden of Wadham. The [[Wilkins circle]] was a group whose activities led to the formation of the [[Royal Society]], comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christopher Wren|last=Kerry|first=Downes|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199215249|location=New York|oclc=83977472}}</ref>\n\n===1653\u20131664===\nReceiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls' College]] in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford. His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London in 1657. He was provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and was required to give weekly lectures in both [[Latin]] and English to all who wished to attend; admission was free. Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helping in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:\n\n{{quote|Memorandum November 28, 1660. These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz. The [[Lord Brouncker]], [[Robert Boyle|Mr Boyle]], Mr Bruce, [[Sir Robert Moray]], [[Paul Neile|Sir Paule Neile]], Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, [[William Petty|Dr Petty]], Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill.

In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nIn 1661, Wren was elected [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make occasional trips to London.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThe main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, [[optics]], the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, [[cosmology]], [[mechanics]], [[microscopy]], [[surveying]], medicine and [[meteorology]]. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Windsor|first=Alan|date=March 1984|title=John Soane: The Making of an Architect Pierre de La Ruffini\u00e8re Du Prey|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.2307/989987|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=43|issue=1|pages=84\u201385|doi=10.2307/989987}}</ref>\n\n===1665\u20131716===\n[[File:Library of St. Paul's Cathedral, London-24784264246.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Wren, 1673]]\nIt was probably around this time that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 churches]]; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nWren was [[knight]]ed 14 November 1673. This honour was bestowed on him after his resignation from the Savilian chair in Oxford, by which time he had already begun to make his mark as an architect, both in services to the Crown and in playing an important part in rebuilding London after the Great Fire.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nAdditionally, he was sufficiently active in public affairs to be returned as [[Member of Parliament]] on four occasions.<ref name=HoC7>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/wren-sir-christopher-1632-1723|title=Sir Christopher Wren, 1632 - 1723 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Wren first stood for [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] in a by-election in 1667 for the [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University constituency]], losing by six votes to [[Charles Wheler|Sir Charles Wheler]].<ref name=HoC5>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/cambridge-university|title=Cambridge University, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> He was unsuccessful again in a by-election for the [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University constituency]] in 1674, losing to [[Thomas Thynne, 1st Viscount Weymouth|Thomas Thynne]].<ref name=HoC6>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/oxford-university|title=Oxford University, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> On his third attempt Wren was successful and he sat for [[Plympton Erle (UK Parliament constituency)|Plympton Erle]] during the [[Loyal Parliament]] of 1685 to 1687.<ref name=HoC4>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/plympton-erle|title=Plympton Erle, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Wren was returned for [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]] on 11 January 1689 in the [[1689 English general election|general election]], but his election was declared void on 14 May 1689.<ref name=HoC1>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1660-1690/constituencies/new-windsor|title=New Windsor, 1660 - 1690 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> He was elected again for New Windsor on [[1690 English general election|6 March 1690]], but this election was declared void on 17 May 1690.<ref name=HoC2>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/constituencies/new-windsor|title=New Windsor, 1690 - 1715 |work=[[The History of Parliament]]|accessdate=15 September 2016}}</ref> Over a decade later he was elected unopposed for [[Weymouth and Melcombe Regis (UK Parliament constituency)|Weymouth and Melcombe Regis]] at the [[December 1701 English general election|November 1701 general election]].

In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of [[Bletchingdon]]. Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:\n\n{{quote|I have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye.&nbsp;... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling&nbsp;... but as for me you may be confident I shall never&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=184}} (Some time earlier, Faith had dropped her wristwatch into a pool of water. It had been sent to Wren in London for it to be repaired. This letter was part of a package.)</ref>}}\n\nThis brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] in 1710 and wrote the famous ''[[Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens]]''. Faith Wren died of [[smallpox]] on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n[[File:Christopher Wren.jpeg|thumb|right|Wren, portrait c.1690 by [[John Closterman]]]]\nIn 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3878.htm#i38772 |title=the Peerage.com |publisher=the Peerage.com |date= |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nShe was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions. [[Robert Hooke]], who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=239}}</ref> As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677\u20131702); and a son William, \"Poor Billy\" born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nLike the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren died of [[tuberculosis]] in September 1680. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nBletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]]. An intellectual of considerable ability, he is said to have been the figure who introduced Wren to arithmetic and geometry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=C. S.

In 1712, the ''Letter Concerning Design'' of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], third [[Earl of Shaftesbury]], circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715. On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of [[William Benson (architect)|William Benson]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-30019|title=Wren, Sir Christopher (1632\u20131723), architect, mathematician, and astronomer {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|website=www.oxforddnb.com|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/30019|access-date=2019-06-16|year=2004|last1=Downes|first1=Kerry}}</ref>\n\nIn 1713, he bought the manor of [[Wroxall Abbey|Wroxall]], Warwickshire from the Burgoyne family, to which his son [[Christopher Wren Jr.|Christopher]] retired in 1716 after losing his post as Clerk of Works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/warks/vol3/pp215-220|title=Parishes: Wroxall|publisher=British History Online|accessdate= 10 September 2018}}</ref> Several of Wren's descendants would be buried there in the [[Wren's Cathedral|Church of St Leonard]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral with tomb of Christopher Wren.jpg|thumb|left|Crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral, Wren's memorial on the left]]\nThe Wren family estate was at [[The Old Court House]] in the area of [[Hampton Court]].

According to Parentalia (pp.&nbsp;210\u2013211), his solid model of the moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him. {{quote |text=''He contrived an artificial Eye, truly and dioptrically made (as large as a Tennis-Ball) representing the Picture as Nature makes it: The Cornea, and Crystalline were Glass, the other Humours, Water.'' |source= Parentalia, p.209}} \nHe experimented on terrestrial [[magnetism]] and had taken part in medical experiments while at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In [[Gresham College]], he did experiments involving determining [[longitude]] through [[magnetism|magnetic]] variation and through lunar observation to help with [[navigation]], and helped construct a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the [[microscope]] and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet [[Saturn]] from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni'' but before the work was published, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and ''De corpore saturni'' was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the [[cycloid]] using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.\n\nA year into Wren's appointment as a [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] in [[Oxford]], the [[Royal Society]] was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied [[mechanics]] thoroughly, especially [[elastic collision]]s and [[pendulum]] motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of [[meteorology]]: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket [[rain gauge]] and, in 1663, designed a \"weather-clock\" that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Introduction of Self-Registering Meteorological Instruments|first=Robert P.|last=Multhauf|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|date=1961}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation.\n\nAnother topic to which Wren contributed was [[optics]]. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1669.0018|title = Generatio corporis cylindroidis hyperbolici, elaborandis lentibus hyperbolicis accommodati, auth.

[[Robert Hooke]] had theorised that planets, moving [[in vacuo]], describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the [[Kepler's laws]] with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', which was later to be expanded into the ''Principia''.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]], ed.; ''Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics'', 1st ed., 2005, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365</ref>\n\nMentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, [[ballistics]], water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. [[Thomas Birch]]'s ''History of the Royal Society'' (1756\u201357) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded.\n\n==Architectural career==\n\nIn Wren's age, the profession of architect as understood today did not exist. Since the early years of the 17th century it was not unusual for well-educated young men (''virtuosi'') to take up architecture as a gentlemanly activity, a pursuit widely accepted as a branch of applied mathematics. This is implicit in the writings of [[Vitruvius]] and explicit in such 16th century authors as [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]. When Wren was a student at Oxford, he became familiar with Vitruvius' ''De architectura'' and absorbed intuitively the fundamentals of architectural design. In 1668, building work began on Wren\u2019s designs for Emmanuel College Chapel in Cambridge and the Garden Quadrangle in Trinity College in Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=776}}</ref> In English Medieval tradition, buildings had been constructed to the needs of the patron and the suggestions of building professionals, such as master carpenters or master bricklayers.\n\nThrough the Royal Society and his use of optics, the King noticed Wren's works. In 1661 he was approached by his cousin Matthew with a royal commission, as \"one of the best Geometers in Europe\", to direct the re-fortification of [[Tangier]]. Wren excused himself on grounds of health. Although this invitation may have arisen from Charles II's casual opportunism in matching people to tasks, Wren is believed to have been already on the way to practice as an architect. Before the end of 1661 Wren was unofficially advising on the repair of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] after two decades of its neglect and distress; his architectural interests were also evident to his associates at the time. Two years later, he set out on his only foreign journey, to Paris and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], during which he undertook the first-hand study of modern design and construction.\n\nBy this time, Wren had mastered and thoroughly understood the principles of architecture. Unlike several of his colleagues, who regarded it as a set of rules and formulas for design, he had acquired, understood, and exploited the necessary combination of reason and intuition, experience and imagination.<ref>''Sir Christopher Wren: Natural Cause of Beauty''</ref>\n\nWren's first architectural project was the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] in Cambridge, which his uncle [[Matthew Wren]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], asked him to design in 1663. The second was the design of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in [[Oxford]], completed in 1668. This, the gift of Archbishop [[Gilbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] to his old university, was influenced by the form of the ancient [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, thus achieving a combination of classical and modern empirical design.\n\n===St Paul's Cathedral===\n[[File:P623 Christopher Wren's Plan for Rebuilding London after Great Fire of 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Wren's plan for rebuilding after the [[Great Fire of London]]]]\n[[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.\n\nWren had been involved in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London]] reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.\n[[File:St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's [[Greek Cross]] design for St Paul's.]]\n\nIt was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1670|second rebuilding act]] was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the [[City of London]]. Wren presented his initial \"First Model\" for St Paul's. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called \"Great Model\", was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a \"cathedral form\" desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before.\n[[File:St Paul's - the final design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's cathedral as built.]]\n\nThe cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a [[balustrade]] around the proof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt [[Parthian shot|parthian comment]] that \"ladies think nothing well without an edging\".<ref>Bolton and Hendry, eds., ''The Wren Society'', 20 vols.</ref>\n\n===Major architectural works in the 1670s and 1680s===\n[[File:Hampton Court 02.jpg|thumb|[[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131702)]]\nDuring the 1670s Wren received significant secular commissions which manifest both the maturity and the variety of his architecture and the sensitivity of his response to diverse briefs.\n\nAmong many of his remarkable designs at this time, the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|monument]] (1671\u201376)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> commemorating the Great Fire also involved [[Robert Hooke]], but Wren was in control of the final design, the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] (1675\u201376),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\">{{harvnb|Downes|1988|p=131}}</ref> and the [[Wren Library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1676\u201384)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> were the most important ones.\n\n[[File:WrenLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wren Library]], Trinity College, Cambridge University]]\n\nIn 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel, Windsor]] be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.<ref>{{cite book|last=London|first=H. Stanford|title=The Queen's Beasts|publisher=Newman Neame|date=1953|page=15}}</ref>\n\nBy historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for a monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the [[Chelsea Hospital]] (1682\u201392),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function. The reconstruction of the state room at [[Windsor Castle]] was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of [[Hugh May]], who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.\n\nBetween 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the [[King's House, Winchester]], where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that \" a year is a great time in my life\".\n\nAfter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to [[Whitehall]] (1685\u201387).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> The new king, [[James II of England|James II]], required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the [[Mary of Modena|Queen]]. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as [[Kensington Palace]] (1689\u201396)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and [[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131700).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/>\n\nThe erection of the present [[Windsor Guildhall]] was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir [[Thomas Fitz]] (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed at a cost of \u00a32687 - 1s - 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for [[Corn exchange|corn markets]].\n\nThe story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren's connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] for Windsor, commissioned the statue of [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the cornmarket from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Pamela |last1=Marson|first2=Brigitte |last2=Mitchell|title=Windsor Guildhall: History and Tour|year=2015|publisher=Friends of the Windsor & Royal Borough Museum|isbn=9780-9010-3309-3|page=7}}</ref> The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals.\n\nWren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Naval Hospital]],<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and in 1698 he was appointed [[Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey|Surveyor of Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jardine|2003|p=440}}</ref> He resigned the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature<ref>Westminster Abbey Muniments</ref> [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]'s revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School.\n\n==Achievement and legacy==\n\nAt his death, Wren was 90 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]). Even the men he had trained and who owed much of their success to Wren's original and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The [[Baroque]] school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to [[Inigo Jones]]. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, but they could not forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the church of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve (now the [[Panth\u00e9on]]); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St Isaac's]] (1840\u201342) in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]] at Washington, D.C. (1855\u201365).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649414/Sir-Christopher-Wren/8009/Concurrent-projects |title=Sir Christopher Wren (English architect) : Concurrent projects \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the potency of the influence of Wren's work on English architecture was reduced. The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]],<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-lutyens From www.Answers.com re Lutyens]: ''Lutyens' Neo-Georgian work, which he jokingly referred to as his \"Wrennaissance Style\" (after the great English baroque architect Christopher Wren) is typified by the use of English baroque forms and details''.</ref> who died in 1944. With the purposeful elimination of historic influences from [[International Style (architecture)|international architecture in the early 20th century]], Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\nSince at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the ''Goose and Gridiron'' at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] churchyard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |title=Manifesto of 1778 issued by The Lodge of Antiquity, formerly The Old Lodge of St Paul, &nbsp;to preserve the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth |publisher=Lodgeroomus.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721114928/http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been \"adopted\" on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul's, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] made the claims in his widely circulated ''Constitutions'' while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the \"speculative\" or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death. By the standards of his time a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or \"interest\" of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the ''Rummer and Grapes'', a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School).\n\nIn 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778).\n\nThe evidence whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2011}}</ref> of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and [[Aubrey]]'s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.\n\n==Trivia==\nAt one time Wren was credited with the design of the King's House at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that \"They were high enough!\", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, \"Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough.\"<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Mark Noble (biographer)|first=Mark|last=Noble|title=Biographical History of England|url=https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog|date=1806|page=[https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog/page/n330 327]}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|\u00a350 banknote]] (Series D) issued in modern time. The notes were printed between 1981 and 1994 and in circulation until 1996.\n\n==Gallery of architectural work==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Sheldonian Theatre Oxford.jpg|Sheldonian Theatre, Oxford University\nFile:Sheldonian Theatre Interior, Oxford, UK -

Other notable buildings by Wren include the [[Royal Hospital Chelsea]], [[Royal Naval College, Greenwich]], and the south front of [[Hampton Court Palace]]. The [[Wren Building]], the main building at the [[College of William and Mary]], Virginia, is attributed to Wren.\n\nEducated in [[Latin]] and [[Aristotelian physics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], Wren was a founder of the [[Royal Society]] (president 1680\u20131682), and his scientific work was highly regarded by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Blaise Pascal]].\n\n== Life and works ==\nWren was born in [[East Knoyle]] in [[Wiltshire]], the only surviving son of [[Christopher Wren (priest)|Christopher Wren the Elder]] (1589\u20131658) and Mary Cox, the only child of the Wiltshire squire Robert Cox from [[Fonthill Bishop]]. Christopher Sr. was at that time the rector of East Knoyle and later [[Dean of Windsor]]. It was while they were living at East Knoyle that all their children were born; Mary, Catherine and Susan were all born by 1628 but then several children were born who died within a few weeks of their birth. Their son Christopher was born in 1632 then, two years later, another daughter named Elizabeth was born. Mary must have died shortly after the birth of Elizabeth, although there does not appear to be any surviving record of the date. Through Mary Cox, however, the family became well off financially for, as the only heir, she had inherited her father's estate.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |title=Wiltshire Council \u2013 Wiltshire Community History Get Wiltshire History Question Information |publisher=History.wiltshire.gov.uk |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311164641/http://history.wiltshire.gov.uk/community/getfaq.php?id=131 |archive-date=11 March 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs a child Wren \"seem'd consumptive.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Wren|Ames|Wren|1750}}</ref> Although a sickly child, he would survive into robust old age. He was first taught at home by a private tutor and his father. After his father's royal appointment as [[Dean of Windsor]] in March 1635, his family spent part of each year there, but little is known about Wren's life at Windsor. He spent his first eight years at East Knoyle and was educated by the Rev. William Shepherd, a local clergyman.<ref name=\"history.wiltshire.gov.uk\"/>\n\nLittle is known of Wren's schooling thereafter, during dangerous times when his father's Royal associations would have required the family to keep a very low profile from the ruling Parliamentary authorities. It was a tough time in his life, but one which would go on to have a significant impact upon his later works. The story that he was at [[Westminster School]] between 1641 and 1646 is substantiated only by ''Parentalia'', the biography compiled by his son, a fourth Christopher, which places him there \"for some short time\" before going up to Oxford (in 1650); however, it is entirely consistent with headmaster [[Richard Busby|Doctor Busby]]'s well-documented practice of educating the sons of impoverished Royalists and Puritans alike, irrespective of current politics or his own position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/architecture-biographies/sir-christopher-wren|title=Sir Christopher Wren {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Wadham College.jpg|thumb|[[Wadham College]], Oxford, where Wren was a student in 1650\u201351]]\nSome of Wren's youthful exercises preserved or recorded (though few are datable) showed that he received a thorough grounding in [[Latin]] and also learned to draw. According to ''Parentalia'', he was \"initiated\" in the principles of mathematics by Dr [[William Holder]], who married Wren's elder sister Susan (or Susanna) in 1643. His drawing was put to academic use in providing many of the anatomical drawings for the anatomy textbook of the brain, ''Cerebri Anatome'' (1664), published by [[Thomas Willis]], which coined the term \"neurology.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-30/april-2017/five-depictions-brain|title=Five depictions of the brain - ''The Psychologist''|publisher=bps.org.uk|accessdate=31 March 2017}}</ref> During this time period, Wren manifested an interest in the design and construction of mechanical instruments. It was probably through Holder that Wren met [[Sir Charles Scarburgh]] whom Wren assisted in his anatomical studies.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nOn 25 June 1650, Wren entered [[Wadham College, Oxford]], where he studied [[Latin]] and the works of [[Aristotle]]. It is anachronistic to imagine that he received scientific training in the modern sense. However, Wren became closely associated with [[John Wilkins]], the Warden of Wadham. The [[Wilkins circle]] was a group whose activities led to the formation of the [[Royal Society]], comprising a number of distinguished mathematicians, creative workers and experimental philosophers. This connection probably influenced Wren's studies of science and mathematics at Oxford. He graduated B.A. in 1651, and two years later received M.A.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christopher Wren|last=Kerry|first=Downes|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199215249|location=New York|oclc=83977472}}</ref>\n\n===1653\u20131664===\nReceiving his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in 1653, Wren was elected a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls' College]] in the same year and began an active period of research and experiment in Oxford. His days as a fellow of All Souls ended when Wren was appointed Professor of Astronomy at [[Gresham College]], London in 1657. He was provided with a set of rooms and a stipend and was required to give weekly lectures in both [[Latin]] and English to all who wished to attend; admission was free. Wren took up this new work with enthusiasm. He continued to meet the men with whom he had frequent discussions in Oxford. They attended his London lectures and in 1660, initiated formal weekly meetings. It was from these meetings that the Royal Society, England's premier scientific body, was to develop. He undoubtedly played a major role in the early life of what would become the Royal Society; his great breadth of expertise in so many different subjects helping in the exchange of ideas between the various scientists. In fact, the report on one of these meetings reads:\n\n{{quote|Memorandum November 28, 1660. These persons following according to the usual custom of most of them, met together at Gresham College to hear Mr Wren's lecture, viz. The [[Lord Brouncker]], [[Robert Boyle|Mr Boyle]], Mr Bruce, [[Sir Robert Moray]], [[Paul Neile|Sir Paule Neile]], Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, [[William Petty|Dr Petty]], Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill.

In addition to being a founder member of the Society, Wren was president of the Royal Society from 1680 to 1682.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nIn 1661, Wren was elected [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] of [[Astronomy]] at Oxford, and in 1669 he was appointed Surveyor of Works to Charles II. From 1661 until 1668 Wren's life was based in Oxford, although his attendance at meetings of the Royal Society meant that he had to make occasional trips to London.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nThe main sources for Wren's scientific achievements are the records of the Royal Society. His scientific works ranged from astronomy, [[optics]], the problem of finding [[longitude]] at sea, [[cosmology]], [[mechanics]], [[microscopy]], [[surveying]], medicine and [[meteorology]]. He observed, measured, dissected, built models and employed, invented and improved a variety of instruments.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Windsor|first=Alan|date=March 1984|title=John Soane: The Making of an Architect Pierre de La Ruffini\u00e8re Du Prey|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/cgi/doi/10.2307/989987|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|volume=43|issue=1|pages=84\u201385|doi=10.2307/989987}}</ref>\n\n===1665\u20131723===\n[[File:Library of St. Paul's Cathedral, London-24784264246.jpg|thumb|left|Bust of Wren, 1673]]\nIt was probably around this time that Wren was drawn into redesigning a battered [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Making a trip to Paris in 1665, Wren studied the architecture, which had reached a climax of creativity, and perused the drawings of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], the great Italian sculptor and architect, who himself was visiting Paris at the time. Returning from Paris, he made his first design for St Paul's. A week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]] destroyed two-thirds of the city. Wren submitted his plans for rebuilding the city to King Charles II, although they were never adopted. With his appointment as King's Surveyor of Works in 1669, he had a presence in the general process of rebuilding the city, but was not directly involved with the rebuilding of houses or companies' halls. Wren was personally responsible for the rebuilding of [[List of Christopher Wren churches in London|51 churches]]; however, it is not necessarily true to say that each of them represented his own fully developed design.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nWren was [[knight]]ed 14 November 1673.

In 1669, the 37-year-old Wren married his childhood neighbour, the 33-year-old Faith Coghill, daughter of Sir John Coghill of [[Bletchingdon]]. Little is known of Faith's life or demeanour, but a love letter from Wren survives, which reads, in part:\n\n{{quote|I have sent your Watch at last & envy the felicity of it, that it should be soe near your side & soe often enjoy your Eye.&nbsp;... .but have a care for it, for I have put such a spell into it; that every Beating of the Balance will tell you 'tis the Pulse of my Heart, which labors as much to serve you and more trewly than the Watch; for the Watch I beleeve will sometimes lie, and sometimes be idle & unwilling&nbsp;... but as for me you may be confident I shall never&nbsp;...<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=184}} (Some time earlier, Faith had dropped her wristwatch into a pool of water.

This letter was part of a package.)</ref>}}\n\nThis brief marriage produced two children: Gilbert, born October 1672, who suffered from convulsions and died at about 18 months old, and Christopher, born February 1675. The younger Christopher was trained by his father to be an architect. It was this Christopher that supervised the topping out ceremony of [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] in 1710 and wrote the famous ''[[Parentalia, or, Memoirs of the family of the Wrens]]''. Faith Wren died of [[smallpox]] on 3 September 1675. She was buried in the [[chancel]] of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] beside the infant Gilbert. A few days later Wren's mother-in-law, Lady Coghill, arrived to take the infant Christopher back with her to Oxfordshire to raise.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n[[File:Christopher Wren.jpeg|thumb|right|Wren, portrait c.1690 by [[John Closterman]]]]\nIn 1677, 17 months after the death of his first wife, Wren remarried, this time to Jane Fitzwilliam, daughter of [[William FitzWilliam, 2nd Baron FitzWilliam]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p3878.htm#i38772 |title=the Peerage.com |publisher=the Peerage.com |date= |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref> and his wife Jane Perry, the daughter of a prosperous London merchant.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nShe was a mystery to Wren's friends and companions. [[Robert Hooke]], who often saw Wren two or three times every week, had, as he recorded in his diary, never even heard of her, and was not to meet her till six weeks after the marriage.<ref>{{harvnb|Tinniswood|2001|p=239}}</ref> As with the first marriage, this too produced two children: a daughter Jane (1677\u20131702); and a son William, \"Poor Billy\" born June 1679, who was developmentally delayed.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nLike the first, this second marriage was also brief. Jane Wren died of [[tuberculosis]] in September 1680. She was buried alongside Faith and Gilbert in the chancel of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Wren was never to marry again; he lived to be over 90 years old and of those years was married only nine.{{citation needed|date = October 2015}}\n\nBletchingdon was the home of Wren's brother-in-law William Holder who was rector of the local church. Holder had been a Fellow of [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].

In 1712, the ''Letter Concerning Design'' of [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Anthony Ashley Cooper]], third [[Earl of Shaftesbury]], circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, his taste and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren was appointed to the Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715.

According to Parentalia (pp.&nbsp;210\u2013211), his solid model of the moon attracted the attention of the King who commanded Wren to perfect it and present it to him. {{quote |text=''He contrived an artificial Eye, truly and dioptrically made (as large as a Tennis-Ball) representing the Picture as Nature makes it: The Cornea, and Crystalline were Glass, the other Humours, Water.'' |source= Parentalia, p.209}} \nHe experimented on terrestrial [[magnetism]] and had taken part in medical experiments while at [[Wadham College, Oxford|Wadham College]], performing the first successful injection of a substance into the bloodstream (of a dog). In [[Gresham College]], he did experiments involving determining [[longitude]] through [[magnetism|magnetic]] variation and through lunar observation to help with [[navigation]], and helped construct a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=on}} telescope with Sir Paul Neile. Wren also studied and improved the [[microscope]] and telescope at this time. He had also been making observations of the planet [[Saturn]] from around 1652 with the aim of explaining its appearance. His hypothesis was written up in ''De corpore saturni'' but before the work was published, [[Christiaan Huygens|Huygens]] presented his theory of the rings of Saturn. Immediately Wren recognised this as a better hypothesis than his own and ''De corpore saturni'' was never published. In addition, he constructed an exquisitely detailed lunar model and presented it to the king. In 1658, he found the length of an arc of the [[cycloid]] using an exhaustion proof based on dissections to reduce the problem to summing segments of chords of a circle which are in geometric progression.\n\nA year into Wren's appointment as a [[Savilian Chair of Astronomy|Savilian Professor]] in [[Oxford]], the [[Royal Society]] was created and Wren became an active member. As Savilian Professor, Wren studied [[mechanics]] thoroughly, especially [[elastic collision]]s and [[pendulum]] motions. He also directed his far-ranging intelligence to the study of [[meteorology]]: in 1662, he invented the tipping bucket [[rain gauge]] and, in 1663, designed a \"weather-clock\" that would record temperature, humidity, rainfall and barometric pressure. A working weather clock based on Wren's design was completed by Robert Hooke in 1679.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Introduction of Self-Registering Meteorological Instruments|first=Robert P.|last=Multhauf|journal=United States National Museum Bulletin|date=1961}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Wren experimented on muscle functionality, hypothesizing that the swelling and shrinking of muscles might proceed from a fermentative motion arising from the mixture of two heterogeneous fluids. Although this is incorrect, it was at least founded upon observation and may mark a new outlook on medicine: specialisation.\n\nAnother topic to which Wren contributed was [[optics]]. He published a description of an engine to create perspective drawings and he discussed the grinding of conical lenses and mirrors. Out of this work came another of Wren's important mathematical results, namely that the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution is a ruled surface. These results were published in 1669.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1098/rstl.1669.0018|title = Generatio corporis cylindroidis hyperbolici, elaborandis lentibus hyperbolicis accommodati, auth.

[[Robert Hooke]] had theorised that planets, moving [[in vacuo]], describe orbits around the Sun because of a rectilinear inertial motion by the tangent and an accelerated motion towards the Sun. Wren's challenge to [[Edmond Halley|Halley]] and Hooke, for the reward of a book worth thirty shillings, was to provide, within the context of Hooke's hypothesis, a mathematical theory linking the [[Kepler's laws]] with a specific force law. Halley took the problem to Newton for advice, prompting the latter to write a nine-page answer, ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'', which was later to be expanded into the ''Principia''.<ref>[[Ivor Grattan-Guinness|Grattan-Guinness, Ivor]], ed.; ''Landmark Writings in Western Mathematics'', 1st ed., 2005, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365</ref>\n\nMentioned above are only a few of Wren's scientific works. He also studied other areas, ranging from agriculture, [[ballistics]], water and freezing, light and refraction, to name only a few. [[Thomas Birch]]'s ''History of the Royal Society'' (1756\u201357) is one of the most important sources of our knowledge not only of the origins of the Society, but also the day-to-day running of the Society. It is in these records that most of Wren's known scientific works are recorded.\n\n==Architectural career==\n\nIn Wren's age, the profession of architect as understood today did not exist. Since the early years of the 17th century it was not unusual for well-educated young men (''virtuosi'') to take up architecture as a gentlemanly activity, a pursuit widely accepted as a branch of applied mathematics. This is implicit in the writings of [[Vitruvius]] and explicit in such 16th century authors as [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]] and [[Leonard Digges (scientist)|Leonard Digges]]. When Wren was a student at Oxford, he became familiar with Vitruvius' ''De architectura'' and absorbed intuitively the fundamentals of architectural design. In 1668, building work began on Wren\u2019s designs for Emmanuel College Chapel in Cambridge and the Garden Quadrangle in Trinity College in Oxford.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the City|last=Caves|first=R. W.|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=978-0415862875|location=|pages=776}}</ref> In English Medieval tradition, buildings had been constructed to the needs of the patron and the suggestions of building professionals, such as master carpenters or master bricklayers.\n\nThrough the Royal Society and his use of optics, the King noticed Wren's works. In 1661 he was approached by his cousin Matthew with a royal commission, as \"one of the best Geometers in Europe\", to direct the re-fortification of [[Tangier]]. Wren excused himself on grounds of health. Although this invitation may have arisen from Charles II's casual opportunism in matching people to tasks, Wren is believed to have been already on the way to practice as an architect. Before the end of 1661 Wren was unofficially advising on the repair of [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] after two decades of its neglect and distress; his architectural interests were also evident to his associates at the time. Two years later, he set out on his only foreign journey, to Paris and the [[\u00cele-de-France]], during which he undertook the first-hand study of modern design and construction.\n\nBy this time, Wren had mastered and thoroughly understood the principles of architecture. Unlike several of his colleagues, who regarded it as a set of rules and formulas for design, he had acquired, understood, and exploited the necessary combination of reason and intuition, experience and imagination.<ref>''Sir Christopher Wren: Natural Cause of Beauty''</ref>\n\nWren's first architectural project was the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] in Cambridge, which his uncle [[Matthew Wren]], the [[Bishop of Ely]], asked him to design in 1663. The second was the design of the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in [[Oxford]], completed in 1668. This, the gift of Archbishop [[Gilbert Sheldon|Sheldon]] to his old university, was influenced by the form of the ancient [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, thus achieving a combination of classical and modern empirical design.\n\n===St Paul's Cathedral===\n[[File:P623 Christopher Wren's Plan for Rebuilding London after Great Fire of 1666.jpg|thumb|left|Wren's plan for rebuilding after the [[Great Fire of London]]]]\n[[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]] has always been the highlight of Wren's reputation. His association with it spans his whole architectural career, including the 36 years between the start of the new building and the declaration by parliament of its completion in 1711.\n\nWren had been involved in repairs of the old cathedral since 1661. In the spring of 1666, he made his first design for a dome for [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's]]. It was accepted in principle on 27 August 1666. One week later, however, the [[Great Fire of London]] reduced two-thirds of the City to a smoking desert and old St Paul's to a ruin. Wren was most likely at Oxford at the time, but the news, so fantastically relevant to his future, drew him at once to London. Between 5 and 11 September he ascertained the precise area of devastation, worked out a plan for rebuilding the City and submitted it to Charles II. Others also submitted plans. However, no new plan proceeded any further than the paper on which it was drawn. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666|Rebuilding of London Act]] which provided rebuilding of some essential buildings was passed in 1666. In 1669, the King's Surveyor of Works died and Wren was promptly installed.\n[[File:St Paul's - the Greek Cross design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's [[Greek Cross]] design for St Paul's.]]\n\nIt was not until 1670 that the pace of rebuilding started accelerating. A [[Rebuilding of London Act 1670|second rebuilding act]] was passed that year, raising the tax on coal and thus providing a source of funds for rebuilding of churches destroyed within the [[City of London]]. Wren presented his initial \"First Model\" for St Paul's. This plan was accepted, and demolition of the old cathedral began. By 1672, however, this design seemed too modest, and Wren met his critics by producing a design of spectacular grandeur. This modified design, called \"Great Model\", was accepted by the King and the construction started in November 1673. However, this design failed to satisfy the [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] and clerical opinion generally; moreover, it had an economic drawback. Wren was confined to a \"cathedral form\" desired by the clergy. In 1674 he produced the rather meagre Classical-Gothic compromise known as the Warrant Design. However, this design, called so from the royal warrant of 14 May 1675 attached to the drawings, is not the design upon which work had begun a few weeks before.\n[[File:St Paul's - the final design.jpg|thumb|right|Wren's cathedral as built.]]\n\nThe cathedral that Wren started to build bears only a slight resemblance to the Warrant Design. In 1697, the first service was held in the cathedral when Wren was 65. There was still, however, no dome. Finally in 1711 the cathedral was declared complete, and Wren was paid the half of his salary that, in the hope of accelerating progress, [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] had withheld for 14 years since 1697. The cathedral had been built for 36 years under his direction, and the only disappointment he had about his masterpiece was the dome: against his wishes the commission engaged Thornhill to paint the inner dome in false perspective and finally authorised a [[balustrade]] around the proof line. This diluted the hard edge Wren had intended for his cathedral, and elicited the apt [[Parthian shot|parthian comment]] that \"ladies think nothing well without an edging\".<ref>Bolton and Hendry, eds., ''The Wren Society'', 20 vols.</ref>\n\n===Major architectural works in the 1670s and 1680s===\n[[File:Hampton Court 02.jpg|thumb|[[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131702)]]\nDuring the 1670s Wren received significant secular commissions which manifest both the maturity and the variety of his architecture and the sensitivity of his response to diverse briefs.\n\nAmong many of his remarkable designs at this time, the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London|monument]] (1671\u201376)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> commemorating the Great Fire also involved [[Robert Hooke]], but Wren was in control of the final design, the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]] (1675\u201376),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\">{{harvnb|Downes|1988|p=131}}</ref> and the [[Wren Library]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] (1676\u201384)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> were the most important ones.\n\n[[File:WrenLibraryCambridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wren Library]], Trinity College, Cambridge University]]\n\nIn 1682, Wren advised that the original statues of the King's Beasts on [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel, Windsor]] be removed. The pinnacles were left bare until 1925, when replica statues were installed.<ref>{{cite book|last=London|first=H. Stanford|title=The Queen's Beasts|publisher=Newman Neame|date=1953|page=15}}</ref>\n\nBy historical accident, all Wren's large-scale secular commissions dated from after the 1680s. At the age of 50 his personal development, as was that of English architecture, was ready for a monumental but humane architecture, in which the scales of individual parts relates both to the whole and to the people who used them. The first large project Wren designed, the [[Chelsea Hospital]] (1682\u201392),<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> does not entirely satisfy the eye in this respect, but met its brief with distinction and such success that even in the 21st century it fulfills its original function. The reconstruction of the state room at [[Windsor Castle]] was notable for the integration of architecture, sculpture and painting. This commission was in the hand of [[Hugh May]], who died in February 1684, before the construction finished; Wren assumed his post and finalised the works.\n\nBetween 1683 and 1685 he was much occupied in designing the [[King's House, Winchester]], where Charles II had hoped to spend his declining years, but which was never completed. When Wren promised that it would be complete within a year the King, who was conscious of his mortality, replied that \" a year is a great time in my life\".\n\nAfter the death of Charles II in 1685, Wren's attention was directed mainly to [[Whitehall]] (1685\u201387).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> The new king, [[James II of England|James II]], required a new chapel and also ordered a new gallery, council chamber and a riverside apartment for the [[Mary of Modena|Queen]]. Later, when James II was removed from the throne, Wren took on architectural projects such as [[Kensington Palace]] (1689\u201396)<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and [[Hampton Court]] (1689\u20131700).<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/>\n\nThe erection of the present [[Windsor Guildhall]] was begun in 1687, under the direction of Sir [[Thomas Fitz]] (or Fiddes) but there is a story that on his death in 1689, the task was taken over by Sir Christopher Wren. It was completed at a cost of \u00a32687 - 1s - 6d. The new building was supported around its perimeter by stone columns, providing a covered area beneath as a venue for [[Corn exchange|corn markets]].\n\nThe story is widely told that the borough Council demanded that Wren should insert additional columns within the covered area, in order to support the weight of the heavy building above; Wren, however, was adamant that these were not necessary. Eventually the council insisted and, in due course, the extra supporting columns were built, but Wren made them slightly short, so that they do not quite touch the ceiling, hence proving his claim that they were not necessary. However, there is little evidence that Wren was ever involved in the design or construction of the Guildhall. It is now believed that the story grew out of Wren's connections with Windsor and that his son, also called Christopher Wren, who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] for Windsor, commissioned the statue of [[Prince George of Denmark]] in 1713 on the south end of the building and his name was engraved underneath. The pillars were probably moved into the cornmarket from the east side of the building when an extension was added in 1829.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Pamela |last1=Marson|first2=Brigitte |last2=Mitchell|title=Windsor Guildhall: History and Tour|year=2015|publisher=Friends of the Windsor & Royal Borough Museum|isbn=9780-9010-3309-3|page=7}}</ref> The gaps at the top of the pillars are now filled with tiles smaller than the capitals.\n\nWren did not pursue his work on architectural design as actively as he had before the 1690s, although he still played important roles in a number of royal commissions. In 1696 he was appointed Surveyor of [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Naval Hospital]],<ref name=\"Downes1988p131\"/> and in 1698 he was appointed [[Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey|Surveyor of Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jardine|2003|p=440}}</ref> He resigned the former role in 1716 but held the latter until his death, approving with a wavering signature<ref>Westminster Abbey Muniments</ref> [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Burlington]]'s revisions of Wren's own earlier designs for the great Archway of Westminster School.\n\n==Achievement and legacy==\n\nAt his death, Wren was 90 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]). Even the men he had trained and who owed much of their success to Wren's original and leadership were no longer young. Newer generations of architects were beginning to look past Wren's style. The [[Baroque]] school his apprentices had created was already under fire from a new generation that brushed Wren's reputation aside and looked back beyond him to [[Inigo Jones]]. Architects of the 18th century could not forget Wren, but they could not forgive some elements in his work they deemed unconventional. The churches left the strongest mark on subsequent architecture. In France, where English architecture rarely made much impression, the influence of St Paul's Cathedral can be seen in the church of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve (now the [[Panth\u00e9on]]); begun in 1757, it rises to a drum and dome similar to St Paul's, and there are other versions inspired by Wren's dome, from [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral|St Isaac's]] (1840\u201342) in [[Saint Petersburg]] to the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]] at Washington, D.C. (1855\u201365).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/649414/Sir-Christopher-Wren/8009/Concurrent-projects |title=Sir Christopher Wren (English architect) : Concurrent projects \u2013 Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, the potency of the influence of Wren's work on English architecture was reduced. The last major architect who admitted to being dependent on him was [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]],<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/edwin-lutyens From www.Answers.com re Lutyens]: ''Lutyens' Neo-Georgian work, which he jokingly referred to as his \"Wrennaissance Style\" (after the great English baroque architect Christopher Wren) is typified by the use of English baroque forms and details''.</ref> who died in 1944. With the purposeful elimination of historic influences from [[International Style (architecture)|international architecture in the early 20th century]], Wren's work gradually stopped being perceived as a mine of examples applicable to contemporary design.\n\n==Freemasonry==\n\nSince at least the 18th century, the Lodge of Antiquity No. 2, one of the four founding Masonic Lodges of the [[Premier Grand Lodge of England]] in 1717, has claimed Christopher Wren to have been its Master at the ''Goose and Gridiron'' at [[St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul's]] churchyard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |title=Manifesto of 1778 issued by The Lodge of Antiquity, formerly The Old Lodge of St Paul, &nbsp;to preserve the Ancient Landmarks of Freemasonry, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth |publisher=Lodgeroomus.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721114928/http://www.lodgeroomus.net/downloadcenter/uploads/manifesto1778.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Whilst he was rebuilding the cathedral he is said to have been \"adopted\" on 18 May 1691 (that is, accepted as a sort of honorary member or patron, rather than an operative). Their 18th-century maul with its 1827 inscription claiming that it was used by Wren for the foundation stone of St. Paul's, belonging to the Lodge and on display in the Library and Museum of Freemasonry in London, corroborates the story. [[James Anderson (Freemason)|James Anderson]] made the claims in his widely circulated ''Constitutions'' while many of Wren's friends were still alive, but he made many highly creative claims as to the history or legends of Freemasonry. There is also a clear possibility of confusion between the operative workmen's lodges which might naturally have welcomed the boss, and the \"speculative\" or gentlemen's lodges which became highly fashionable just after Wren's death. By the standards of his time a gentleman like Wren would not generally join an artisan body{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}; however the workmen of St Paul's cathedral would naturally have sought the patronage or \"interest\" of their employer, and within Wren's lifetime there was a predominantly gentlemen's Lodge at the ''Rummer and Grapes'', a mile upriver at Westminster (where Wren had been to School).\n\nIn 1788, the Lodge of Antiquity thought they were buying a portrait of Wren which now dominates Lodge Room 10, in the same building as the Museum; but it is now identified with [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], not Wren. Nevertheless, this recorded event and many old records attest the fact that Antiquity thought that Wren had been its Master, at a time when it still held its minute books for the relevant years (which were lost by Preston at some date after 1778).\n\nThe evidence whether Wren was a speculative freemason is the subject of the Prestonian Lecture<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2011}}</ref> of 2011, which concludes on the evidence of two obituaries and [[Aubrey]]'s memoirs, with supporting materials, that he did indeed attend the closed meeting in 1691, probably of the Lodge of Antiquity, but that there is nothing to suggest that he was ever a Grand Officer as claimed by Anderson.\n\n==Trivia==\nAt one time Wren was credited with the design of the King's House at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]]. The attribution gave rise to an apocryphal story in which [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who was over six feet tall, complained about the low ceilings. Wren, who was not so tall, replied that \"They were high enough!\", at which the king crouched down until he was on a level with his Surveyor and strutted about saying, \"Ay, Ay, Sir Christopher, I think they are high enough.\"<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Mark Noble (biographer)|first=Mark|last=Noble|title=Biographical History of England|url=https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog|date=1806|page=[https://archive.org/details/abiographicalhi04grangoog/page/n330 327]}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wren appeared on the reverse of the first British [[Banknotes of the pound sterling|\u00a350 banknote]] (Series D) issued in modern time.

Weber's main intellectual concern was in understanding the processes of [[Rationalisation (sociology)|rationalisation]], [[Secularization|secularisation]], and \"[[disenchantment]]\", which he took to be the result of a new way of thinking about the world,<ref>{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-11671-3|edition=14th|location=Boston|page=88}}</ref> associating such processes with the rise of [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]].<ref name= \"Habermas, J\u00fcrgen 1990 p2\" /> \n\nWeber is best known for his thesis of combining [[economic sociology]] and the [[sociology of religion]], emphasising the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism (contrasting Marx's [[historical materialism]]).<ref group=\"lower-roman\">Weber's (2002/1905) references to \"Superstructure\" and \"base\" are unambiguous references to Marxism's base/superstructure theory. (''Protestant Ethic'' 1905, pp. 19, 35).</ref> Weber would first elaborate his theory in his seminal work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), in which he attributes [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Protestantism]] as one of the major \"elective affinities\" involved in the rise of [[Market economy|market-driven]] capitalism and the [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] [[Nation state|nation-state]] in the Western world. Arguing the boosting of capitalism as a basic tenet of Protestantism, Weber would suggest that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.<ref name=\":1\">Weber, Max 2002 [1905].

Among these categories, Weber's analysis of [[bureaucracy]] would emphasize that modern state institutions are increasingly based on the latter (rational-legal authority).\n\nWeber also made a variety of other contributions in [[economic history]], [[Economics|theory]], and [[Economic methodology|methodology]]. His analysis of modernity and rationalisation would significantly influence the [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]]. After the [[First World War]], he was among the founders of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]]. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919.

''Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives''. Kuala Lumpur, MY: [[Pearson Education|Pearson Publishers]]. {{ISBN|978-967-349-233-6}}.</ref> Firstly, Weber argued that bureaucracy is \"based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized across-the-board competencies of the various offices\" which are \"are underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative regulations.\"<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|76}} \n\nIn particular, Weber notes three aspects that \"constitute the essence of bureaucratic administration\" in the [[public sector]], and \"the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company\" in the [[private sector]]:<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|76-7}}\n\n* A rigid division of labor is established that clearly identifies regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.\n* Regulations describe firmly established chains of command and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply.\n* Hiring people with particular, certified qualifications supports regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties.\n\nIn this sense, Weber would explain bureaucracy through nine main characteristics/principles:\n\n# Specialized roles\n# Recruitment based on merit (e.g. tested through open competition)\n# Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer in an administrative system\n# Careerism with systematic salary structure\n# Hierarchy, responsibility and accountability\n# Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control\n# Supremacy of abstract rules\n# Impersonal authority (e.g. office bearer does not bring the office with them)\n# Political neutrality\n\n==== Benefits of bureaucracy ====\nAs Weber noted, real bureaucracy is less optimal and effective than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerate, especially when used to analyze individual levels in an organization. However, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic Model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules, and discipline.<ref name=\"James W. Fesler, 1965\">[[James W. Fesler|Fesler, James W]]. 1965. \"Bureaucratic Phenomena.\" ''[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]'' 10:163.</ref>\n\n==== Weaknesses of bureaucracy ====\nCompetencies, efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially when dealing with oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy\u2014inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output\u2014tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organization's work vision and mission. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.<ref name=\"Ibrahim, 2012\" />[[File:Manuskript max weber rechtssoziologie.jpg|thumb|A page from the typescript of the sociology of law within [[Economy and Society]]]]\n===Rationalisation===\nMany scholars have described [[Rationalization (sociology)|''rationalisation'']] and the question of [[Individualism|individual freedom]] in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-167\"/><ref name=\"Ritzer2009-30\"/><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-151\"/> This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between [[psychological]] motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily religion), and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-148\"/>\n\nWeber understood rationalisation, first, as the individual cost-benefit calculation; second, as the wider bureaucratic organisation of the organisations; and finally, in the more general sense, as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (i.e. [[disenchantment|''disenchantment'']]).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-151\"/><blockquote>The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the \"disenchantment of the world\".<ref name=\"Koshul2005\" /></blockquote>Weber began his studies of the subject in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in [[ascetic]] [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|Protestant denominations]], particularly [[Calvinism]], shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.<ref name=\"Bendix60\" /><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\" /> In Protestant religion, Christian [[piety]] towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of [[calling (religious)|''calling'']]).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\" /> The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.<ref name=\"Andrew J. Weigert\" />\n\nWeber continued his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on [[bureaucracy]] and on the classification of legitimate [[authority]] into three types\u2014[[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]], [[Traditional authority|traditional]] and [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]]\u2014of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> In these works Weber described what he saw as society's movement towards rationalisation.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart from the rest of the world.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> Rationalisation relied on deep changes in ethics, religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation:<ref name=\"Habermas, J\u00fcrgen 1990 p2\" />\n\n{{quote|What Weber depicted was not only the secularisation of Western ''culture'', but also and especially the development of modern ''societies'' from the viewpoint of rationalisation. The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action. To the degree that everyday life was affected by this cultural and societal rationalisation, traditional forms of life\u2014which in the early modern period were differentiated primarily according to one's trade\u2014were dissolved.|[[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]|''Modernity's Consciousness of Time'' (1985)|source=}}\n\nFeatures of rationalisation include increasing knowledge, growing impersonality and enhanced control of social and material life.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> Weber was ambivalent towards rationalisation; while admitting it was responsible for many advances, in particular, freeing humans from traditional, restrictive and illogical social guidelines, he also criticised it for dehumanising individuals as \"cogs in the machine\" and curtailing their freedom, trapping them in the bureaucratic [[iron cage]] of rationality and bureaucracy.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-167\" /><ref name=\"Ritzer2009-38-42\" /><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-177\" /> Related to rationalisation is the process of [[disenchantment]], in which the world is becoming more explained and less mystical, moving from [[polytheistic]] religions to [[monotheistic]] ones and finally to the Godless science of [[modernity]].<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> However, another interpretation of Weber's theory of disenchantment, advanced by [[historian of religion]] Jason Josephson-Storm, claims that Weber does not envision a binary between rationisation and magical thinking, and that Weber actually referred to the sequestering and professionalisation of magic when he described disenchantment, not to the disappearances of magic.<ref name=\"Josephson-Storm\">{{Cite book|last=Josephson-Storm|first=Jason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ|title=The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences|date=2017|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=|isbn=978-0-226-40336-6|location=Chicago|pages=}}</ref>{{rp|299\u2013300}} Regardless, for Weber the processes of rationalisation affect all of society, removing \"[[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] values\u2026from public life\" and making art less creative.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-151-152\" />\n\nIn a [[dystopian]] critique of rationalisation, Weber notes that modern society is a product of an [[individualistic]] drive of the [[Reformation]], yet at the same time, the society created in this process is less and less welcoming of individualism:<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> \"How is it at all possible to salvage any remnants of 'individual' freedom of movement in any sense given this all-powerful trend?\"<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" />\n\n===Sociology of religion===\nWeber's work in the field of [[sociology of religion]] began with the essay ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and continued with his analyses in ''[[The Religion of China]]'', ''[[The Religion of India]]'', and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]''. His work on other religions, however, would be interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following ''Ancient Judaism'' with studies of early Christianity and Islam.<ref name=\"Bendix285\"/> The three main themes within the essays were: the effect of religious ideas on economic activities; the relation between [[social stratification]] and religious ideas; and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/>\n\nWeber saw religion as one of the core forces in society.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-153\"/> His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the [[Western world|Occident]] and the [[Orient]], although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/> He maintained that [[Calvinist]] (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had a major impact on the [[social innovation]] and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the [[rationalism]] of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise.<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/> In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or what he referred to as \"[[disenchantment]] of the world\".<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/>\n\nWeber also proposed a [[Sociocultural evolution|socio-evolutionary]] model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to [[polytheism]], then to [[pantheism]], [[monotheism]] and finally, [[ethical monotheism]].<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-154\"/> According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed [[professionalisation]] and the evolution of ever more sophisticated [[priesthood]].<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-155\"/> As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-158\"/>\n\n====''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''====\n{{Main|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism}}\n[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of a German edition of ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]\n''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is Weber's most famous work.<ref name=\"EESoc-22\"/> It has been argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the [[economic system|economic sphere]].<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> In the essay, Weber puts forward the thesis that [[Calvinism|Calvinist ethic]] and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> He notes the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany. Weber also notes that societies having more Protestants were those with a more highly developed capitalist economy.<ref name=\":1\" />{{Rp|15-16}} Similarly, in societies with different religions, most successful business leaders were Protestant.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> Weber thus argued that Roman Catholicism impeded the development of the capitalist economy in the West, as did other religions such as [[Confucianism]] and [[Buddhism]] elsewhere in the world:<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\" />\n\n{{quote|The development of the concept of the calling quickly gave to the modern entrepreneur a fabulously clear conscience\u2014and also industrious workers; he gave to his employees as the wages of their ascetic devotion to the calling and of co-operation in his ruthless exploitation of them through capitalism the prospect of eternal salvation.|Max Weber|title=''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' (1905)|source=}}\n\nChristian religious devotion had historically been accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit.<ref name=\"Bendix57\"/> Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism\u2014notably [[Calvinism]]\u2014were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance.<ref name=\"Bendix60\"/> Weber argued that there were many reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].<ref name=\"Bendix54\"/> In particular, the [[Protestant ethic]] (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> The notion of [[Calling (religious)|calling]] meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; just being a member of the Church was not enough.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\"/> [[Predestination]] also reduced agonising over [[economic inequality]] and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of [[salvation]] in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/><ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> The believers therefore justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> Weber would call this the \"spirit of capitalism\": it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind\u2014and inevitably led to\u2014the capitalist economic system.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the [[base and superstructure|economic \"base\"]] of society determines all other aspects of it.<ref name=\"Bendix60\"/>\n\nWeber abandoned research into Protestantism as his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional theologian, had begun work on the book ''Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area: laying the groundwork for a comparative analysis of religion and society.<ref name=\"Bendix49\"/>\n\nThe phrase \"[[Protestant work ethic|work ethic]]\" used in modern commentary is a derivative of the \"[[Protestant ethic]]\" discussed by Weber. It was adopted when the idea of the Protestant ethic was generalised to apply to the Japanese people, Jews and other non-Christians and thus lost its religious connotations.<ref name=\"SwedbergAgevall2005\"/>\n\n====''The Religion of China''====\n{{Main|The Religion of China}}\n''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'' was Weber's second major work on the sociology of religion. Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C.&nbsp;K. Wang.<ref>Weber, Max. 1968 [1915]. ''[[The Religion of China]].'' New York: Free Press. {{Google books|id=eTgvAAAAYAAJ|title=Lay summary}}.</ref> Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with [[Puritanism#Beliefs|Puritanism]]. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China.<ref name=\"Bendix98\"/> He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese [[patrimonialism]] and [[officialdom]] and [[religion in China|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy in China|philosophy]] (primarily, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.<ref name=\"Bendix98\"/>\n\nAccording to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational thought]], each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Confucianism's goal was \"a cultured status position\", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are \"tools of God\".<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/>\n\n====''The Religion of India''====\n{{Main|The Religion of India}}\n''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.<ref name=\"Bendix142\"/> In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/>\n\nWeber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly [[mysticism|mystical]] experience.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to give ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (aka [[ethical prophecy|ethical prophecies]]), notably from the [[Near East]] region to the [[exemplary prophecy|exemplary prophecies]] found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/><ref name=\"Bendix90\"/> It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/>\n\n====''Ancient Judaism''====\n{{Main|Ancient Judaism (book)}}\nIn ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'', his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[Western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]].<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> He contrasted the innerworldly [[asceticism]] developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India.<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections.<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish [[prophecy]].<ref name=\"Bendix204\"/>\n\nWeber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.\n\nWeber's death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Job]], [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early Christianity and [[Islam]].\n\n====Theodicy of fortune and misfortune====\nThe 'theodicy of fortune and misfortune' within sociology is the theory, as Weber suggested, of how \"members of different social classes adopt different belief systems, or theodices, to explain their social situation.\"<ref name=\"Plye, Davidson\">{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/stratification.htm|title=Stratification|last=Plye, Davidson|first=and James Ralph|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[Theodicy|''theodicy'']] was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion. There is an ethical part of religion, that includes:<ref name=\"Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7\">{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos|first=Kevin Kivisto, and Peter William|title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0742561113|location=New York|page=7|pages=}}</ref> \n\n# '''[[Soteriology]]''': how people understand themselves to be capable of a ''correct'' relationship with supernatural powers; and\n# '''Theodicy''': how to explain evil\u2014or why bad things seem to happen to those who seem to be good people.\n\nThere is a separation of different theodicies with regard to class: \"theodicies of misfortune tend to the belief that wealth and other manifestations of privilege are indications or signs of evil.\u2026 In contrast, theodicies of fortune emphasise the notion that privileges are a blessing and are deserved.\"<ref name=\"Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 7\" /> \n\nWeber also distinguishes that, \"the affluent embrace good fortune theodicies, which emphasise that prosperity is a blessing of God\u2026[while] theodices of misfortune emphasise that affluence is a sign of evil and that suffering in this world will be rewarded in the next.\"<ref name=\"Plye, Davidson\" /> Therefore, these two distinctions can be applied not only to class structure within society but denomination and racial segregation within religion.\n\nWeber defines the importance of societal class within religion by examining the difference between the two theodicies and to what class structures they apply. The concept of \"work ethic\" is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant \"work ethic\", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0742561113|location=New York|page=142}}</ref> Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.<ref name=\"Plye, Davidson\" />\n\nThese two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community. The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains. For example, mainline churches, with their upper class congregations \"promote[d] order, stability, and conservatism, and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power,\" because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation.<ref name=\"Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137\">{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0742561113|location=New York|page=137}}</ref> In contrast, [[Pentecostal Churches of Christ|Pentecostal churches]] adopted the theodicy of misfortune. They instead \"advocated change intended to advance the cause of justice and fairness\".<ref name=\"Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137\" /> Thus the learned and upper class religious churches who preach the theodicy of fortune, ultimately support capitalism and corporation, while the churches who adopted the theodicy of misfortune, instead preached equality and fairness.\n\n===The state, politics, and government===\n{{see also|Max Weber and German politics}}\n\nIn [[political sociology]], one of Weber's most influential contributions is his essay \"''Politik als Beruf''\" (\"[[Politics as a Vocation]]\"), in which he defines \"the [[State (polity)|state]]\" as an entity that possesses a [[Monopoly on violence|monopoly on ''the legitimate use of physical force'']].<ref>Weber, Max. 2015 [1919]. \"Politics as Vocation.\" Pp. 129\u201398 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.</ref><ref name=\"E-PoV\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Phelps|first1=Martha Lizabeth|title=Doppelgangers of the State: Private Security and Transferable Legitimacy|journal=Politics & Policy|date=December 2014|volume=42|issue=6|pages=824\u201349|doi=10.1111/polp.12100}}</ref> \n\nAccordingly, Weber proposed that politics is the sharing of state power between various groups, whereas political leaders are those who wield this power.<ref name=\"E-PoV\" /> As such, a politician, in Weber's view, must not be a man of the \"true Christian ethic\" (i.e. the ethic of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]), in that one cannot have the injunction to 'turn the other cheek'.<ref name=\"PaV\" /> An adherent of such an ethic ought rather to be understood as a [[saint]], for it is only saints, according to Weber, that can appropriately follow it.<ref name=\"PaV\" /> The political realm is no realm for saints; a politician ought to marry the [[:de:Verantwortungsethik|''verantwortungsethik'']] and the [[:de:Gesinnungsethik|''gesinnungsethik'']] (\"ethic of ''attitude''\" and the \"ethic of ''responsibility''\")<ref>Weber, Marx. 2004 [1919]. \"'[https://www.textlog.de/2296.html Gesinnungsethik' versus 'Verantwortungsethik'].\" ''[[Politics as a Vocation|Politik als Beruf]]'' [Politk as a Vocation]. \u2014 via ''textlog''.</ref> and must possess both a passion for his vocation and the capacity to distance himself from the subject of his exertions (the governed).<ref name=\"PaV\" />\n\nWeber distinguished three [[ideal type]]s of political leadership (aka three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):<ref name=\"Ibrahim, 2012\" /><ref>Weber, Max. 2015 [1919]. \"Politics as Vocation.\" Pp. 135\u201336 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.

This resulted in a monograph, ''[[The City (Weber book)|The City]]'', which he probably compiled from research conducted in 1911\u20131913. It was published posthumously in 1921, and, in 1924, was incorporated into the second part of his ''[[Economy and Society]]'', as the sixteenth chapter, \"The City (Non-legitimate Domination)\".\n\nAccording to Weber, the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity, employed in a variety of specialised trades, and physically separated from the surrounding countryside, only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution:<ref name=\"City2\">Quoted in {{cite book|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|url=https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend|title=Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait|publisher=University of California Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0-520-03194-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend/page/79 79]|authorlink=Reinhard Bendix|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets\u2026who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures.

After his death, the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow [[Marianne Weber|Marianne]]. The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne's work and intellectual commitment. The composition includes a wide range of essays dealing with Weber's views regarding sociology, [[social philosophy]], politics, [[social stratification]], [[World religions|world religion]], [[diplomacy]], and other subjects. \n\nBeginning in 1956, the German jurist [[Johannes Wincklemann]] began editing and organizing the German edition of ''Economy and Society'' based on his study of the papers that Weber left at his death. English versions of the work were published as a collected volume in 1968, as edited by [[Guenther Roth|Gunther Roth]] and Claus Wittich.  As a result of the various editions in German and English, there are differences between the organization of the different volumes. The book is typically published in a two volume set in both German and English, and is more than 1000 pages long.\n\n====Methodological individualism====\nThough his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting [[economic history]], Weber's defence of \"[[methodological individualism]]\" in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by [[Carl Menger]], the founder of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, in the context of the academic ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (\"debate over methods\") of the late 19th century.<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/> The phrase ''methodological individualism'', which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]], was coined by the Austrian-American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber.<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/> According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]] or [[Analytic philosophy|descriptive]], because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract \"[[ideal type|ideal (pure) types]]\".<ref name=\"capa\"/> This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''[[Verstehen]]''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the \"[[rational economic man]]\" (''[[homo economicus]]''), which is at the heart of modern [[mainstream economics]].<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/><ref name=\"capa\"/>\n\n====Marginalism and psychophysics====\nUnlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the [[Marginalism|marginal theory of value]] (aka \"marginalism\") and taught it to his students.<ref name=\"Swedberg-econ-soc\"/><ref name=\"Schweitzer\"/> In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the [[Weber-Fechner law]]. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of [[psychophysics]] by [[Lionel Robbins]], [[George Stigler]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stigler | first1 = George | year = 1950 | title = The Development of Utility Theory | journal = The Journal of Political Economy | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 373\u201396 | jstor=1825710 | doi=10.1086/256980}}</ref> and [[Friedrich Hayek]], though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of \"[[behavioral economics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mass | first1 = Harro | year = 2009 | title = Disciplining Boundaries: Lionel Robbins, Max Weber, and the Borderlands of Economics, History, and Psychology | journal = Journal of the History of Economic Thought | volume = 31 | issue = 4| page = 500 | doi = 10.1017/S1053837209990289 }}</ref>\n\n====Economic history====\nWeber's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' as well as in his other works on the [[sociology of religion]].<ref name=\"capa\"/> He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of [[ancient world|ancient]] capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state.<ref>Weber, Max.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. \"Urbanisation and Social Structure in the Ancient World\", pp. 290\u2013314.</ref> Other contributions include his early work on the [[Die R\u00f6mische Agrargeschichte in ihrer Bedeutung f\u00fcr das Staats- und Privatrecht|economic history of Roman agrarian society]] (1891) and on the [[Condition of Farm Labour in Eastern Germany|labour relations in Eastern Germany]] (1892), his analysis of the [[Zur Geschichte der Handelsgesellschaften im Mittelalter|history of commercial partnerships in the Middle Ages]] (1889), his critique of [[Marxism]], the discussion of the roles of [[idealism]] and [[materialism]] in the history of capitalism in his ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922) and his ''[[Wirtschaftsgeschichte|General Economic History]]'' (1923), a notable example of the kind of empirical work associated with the German Historical School.<ref name=\"capa\"/>\n\nAlthough today Weber is primarily read by sociologists and [[Social philosophy|social philosophers]], Weber's work did have a significant influence on [[Frank Knight]], one of the founders of the neoclassical [[Chicago school of economics]], who translated Weber's ''General Economic History'' into English in 1927.<ref name=\"Emmett\"/> Knight also wrote in 1956 that Max Weber was the only economist who dealt with the problem of understanding the emergence of modern capitalism \"...from the angle which alone can yield an answer to such questions, that is, the angle of comparative history in the broad sense.\"<ref name=\"Schweitzer\" />\n\n====Economic calculation====\nWeber, like his colleague [[Werner Sombart]], regarded [[Cost-benefit analysis|economic calculation]] and especially the [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] method of business accounting, as one of the most important forms of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] associated with the development of modern capitalism.<ref name=\"SwedbergAgevall2005-22\"/> Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to critique socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently to satisfy human needs.<ref name=\"Tribe\"/> Socialist intellectuals like [[Otto Neurath]] had realised that in a completely socialised economy, [[price]]s would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) [[economic calculation problem|economic calculation]].<ref name=\"Tribe\" /><ref name=\"StanfordNeurathSup\"/> According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of [[Imputation (economics)|imputation]] (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of [[capital good]]s).<ref name=\"Tribe\"/><ref name=\"StanfordNeurathSup\"/> Weber wrote that, under full socialism:<ref name=\"EconSoc-calculation\" />\n\n{{quote|In order to make possible a rational utilisation of the means of production, a system of in-kind accounting would have to determine \"value\"\u2014indicators of some kind for the individual capital goods which could take over the role of the \"prices\" used in book valuation in modern business accounting. But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of \"social utility\", that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements ... Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented. The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation. We cannot speak of a rational \"planned economy\" so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational \"plan\".|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nThis argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref name=\"Tribe\" /><ref name=\"Hulsmann\"/> Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918,<ref name=\"Mises-Weber\"/> and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Haberler\"/> [[Friedrich Hayek]] in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of \"[[dispersed knowledge]]\" in markets.<ref>[[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek, Friedrich]]. 1948. \"[https://mises.org/daily/4590/media.aspx?action=author&ID=425 Socialist Calculation].\" In ''[[Individualism and Economic Order]].''

Weber's main intellectual concern was in understanding the processes of [[Rationalisation (sociology)|rationalisation]], [[Secularization|secularisation]], and \"[[disenchantment]]\", which he took to be the result of a new way of thinking about the world,<ref>{{cite book|last=Macionis|first=John J.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson|year=2012|isbn=978-0-205-11671-3|edition=14th|location=Boston|page=88}}</ref> associating such processes with the rise of [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]].<ref name= \"Habermas, J\u00fcrgen 1990 p2\" /> \n\nWeber is best known for his thesis of combining [[economic sociology]] and the [[sociology of religion]], emphasising the importance of cultural influences embedded in religion as a means for understanding the genesis of capitalism (contrasting Marx's [[historical materialism]]).<ref group=\"lower-roman\">Weber's (2002/1905) references to \"Superstructure\" and \"base\" are unambiguous references to Marxism's base/superstructure theory. (''Protestant Ethic'' 1905, pp. 19, 35).</ref> Weber would first elaborate his theory in his seminal work, ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), in which he attributes [[Asceticism|ascetic]] [[Protestantism]] as one of the major \"elective affinities\" involved in the rise of [[Market economy|market-driven]] capitalism and the [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]] [[Nation state|nation-state]] in the Western world. Arguing the boosting of capitalism as a basic tenet of Protestantism, Weber would suggest that the spirit of capitalism is inherent to Protestant religious values.<ref name=\":1\">Weber, Max 2002 [1905]. ''The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism,'' translated by S. Kalberg. Roxbury Publishing.</ref> ''Protestant Ethic'' would form the earliest part in Weber's broader investigations into world religion, as he would go on to examine the [[The Religion of China|religions of China]] and [[The Religion of India|India]], as well as [[Ancient Judaism (book)|ancient Judaism]], with particular regard to their differing economic consequences and conditions of [[social stratification]]. \n\nThrough another major work, \"[[Politics as a Vocation]]\", Weber would define \"the [[State (polity)|state]]\" as an entity that successfully claims a \"[[monopoly on violence|monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force]] within a given territory.\" He would also be the first to categorise social authority into distinct forms: [[Charismatic authority|charismatic]], [[Traditional authority|traditional]], and [[Rational-legal authority|rational-legal]]. Among these categories, Weber's analysis of [[bureaucracy]] would emphasize that modern state institutions are increasingly based on the latter (rational-legal authority).\n\nWeber also made a variety of other contributions in [[economic history]], [[Economics|theory]], and [[Economic methodology|methodology]]. His analysis of modernity and rationalisation would significantly influence the [[critical theory]] associated with the [[Frankfurt School]]. After the [[First World War]], he was among the founders of the liberal [[German Democratic Party]]. He also ran unsuccessfully for a seat in parliament and served as advisor to the committee that drafted the ill-fated democratic [[Weimar Constitution]] of 1919.

For Christmas in 1876 Weber, at thirteen years old, would gift his parents two historical essays, entitled \"About the course of German history, with special reference to the positions of the Emperor and the Pope\", and \"About the Roman Imperial period from Constantine to the migration of nations\".<ref>Sica, Alan (2004).

In 1888, he joined the ''[[Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik]]'',<ref name=\"WaSI\" /> a new professional association of German economists affiliated with the [[Historical school of economics|historical school]], who saw the role of economics primarily as finding solutions to the social problems of the age and who pioneered large scale statistical studies of economic issues. He also involved himself in politics, joining the left-leaning [[Evangelical Social Congress]].<ref name=\"Max Weber and German Politics, 1890\u20131920\" /> In 1890, the Verein established a research program to examine \"[[Polish question|the Polish question]]\", or ''[[ostflucht]]'': the influx of Polish farm workers into [[Former eastern territories of Germany|eastern Germany]] as local labourers migrated to Germany's rapidly [[industrialization|industrialising]] cities.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> Weber was put in charge of the study and wrote a large part of the final report,<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /><ref name=\"WaSI\" /> which generated considerable attention and controversy, marking the beginning of Weber's renown as a social scientist.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\" /> \n\nFrom 1893 to 1899, Weber was a member of the ''[[Pan-German League|Alldeutscher Verband]]'' (Pan-German League), an organization that campaigned against the influx of the Polish workers; the degree of Weber's support for the [[Germanisation of Poles during the Partitions|Germanisation of Poles]] and similar nationalist policies is still debated by modern scholars.<ref name=\"MommsenSteinberg1990\" /><ref name=\"Hobsbawm1987\" /> In some of his work, in particular his provocative lecture on \"The Nation State and Economic Policy\" delivered in 1895, Weber criticises the immigration of Poles and blames the [[Junker (Prussia)|Junker]] class for perpetuating Slavic immigration to serve their selfish interests.<ref name=\":2\">Weber, Max. 1994 [1895].

He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and would not return until 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described in a personal [[chronology]] that was destroyed by his wife.

''Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives''. Kuala Lumpur, MY: [[Pearson Education|Pearson Publishers]]. {{ISBN|978-967-349-233-6}}.</ref> Firstly, Weber argued that bureaucracy is \"based on the general principle of precisely defined and organized across-the-board competencies of the various offices\" which are \"are underpinned by rules, laws, or administrative regulations.\"<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|76}} \n\nIn particular, Weber notes three aspects that \"constitute the essence of bureaucratic administration\" in the [[public sector]], and \"the essence of a bureaucratic management of a private company\" in the [[private sector]]:<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|76-7}}\n\n* A rigid division of labor is established that clearly identifies regular tasks and duties of the particular bureaucratic system.\n* Regulations describe firmly established chains of command and the duties and capacity to coerce others to comply.\n* Hiring people with particular, certified qualifications supports regular and continuous execution of the assigned duties.\n\nIn this sense, Weber would explain bureaucracy through nine main characteristics/principles:\n\n# Specialized roles\n# Recruitment based on merit (e.g. tested through open competition)\n# Uniform principles of placement, promotion, and transfer in an administrative system\n# Careerism with systematic salary structure\n# Hierarchy, responsibility and accountability\n# Subjection of official conduct to strict rules of discipline and control\n# Supremacy of abstract rules\n# Impersonal authority (e.g. office bearer does not bring the office with them)\n# Political neutrality\n\n==== Benefits of bureaucracy ====\nAs Weber noted, real bureaucracy is less optimal and effective than his ideal-type model. Each of Weber's principles can degenerate, especially when used to analyze individual levels in an organization. However, when implemented in a group setting in an organization, some form of efficiency and effectiveness can be achieved, especially with regard to better output. This is especially true when the Bureaucratic Model emphasizes qualification (merits), specialization of job-scope (labour), hierarchy of power, rules, and discipline.<ref name=\"James W. Fesler, 1965\">[[James W. Fesler|Fesler, James W]]. 1965. \"Bureaucratic Phenomena.\" ''[[Administrative Science Quarterly]]'' 10:163.</ref>\n\n==== Weaknesses of bureaucracy ====\nCompetencies, efficiency and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially when dealing with oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy\u2014inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output\u2014tasks are often routine and can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes feel that they are not part of the organization's work vision and mission. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.<ref name=\"Ibrahim, 2012\" />[[File:Manuskript max weber rechtssoziologie.jpg|thumb|A page from the typescript of the sociology of law within [[Economy and Society]]]]\n===Rationalisation===\nMany scholars have described [[Rationalization (sociology)|''rationalisation'']] and the question of [[Individualism|individual freedom]] in an increasingly rational society, as the main theme of Weber's work.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/><ref name=\"Calhoun2002-167\"/><ref name=\"Ritzer2009-30\"/><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-151\"/> This theme was situated in the larger context of the relationship between [[psychological]] motivations, cultural values and beliefs (primarily religion), and the structure of the society (usually determined by the economy).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-148\"/>\n\nWeber understood rationalisation, first, as the individual cost-benefit calculation; second, as the wider bureaucratic organisation of the organisations; and finally, in the more general sense, as the opposite of understanding the reality through mystery and magic (i.e. [[disenchantment|''disenchantment'']]).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-151\"/><blockquote>The fate of our times is characterised by rationalisation and intellectualisation and, above all, by the \"disenchantment of the world\".<ref name=\"Koshul2005\" /></blockquote>Weber began his studies of the subject in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'', in which he argued that the redefinition of the connection between work and piety in Protestantism and especially in [[ascetic]] [[List of the largest Protestant denominations|Protestant denominations]], particularly [[Calvinism]], shifted human effort towards rational efforts aimed at achieving economic gain.<ref name=\"Bendix60\" /><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\" /> In Protestant religion, Christian [[piety]] towards God was expressed through one's secular vocation (secularisation of [[calling (religious)|''calling'']]).<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-162\" /> The rational roots of this doctrine, he argued, soon grew incompatible with and larger than the religious and so the latter were eventually discarded.<ref name=\"Andrew J.

The new structures of society were marked by the differentiation of the two functionally intermeshing systems that had taken shape around the organisational cores of the capitalist enterprise and the bureaucratic state apparatus. Weber understood this process as the institutionalisation of purposive-rational economic and administrative action.

His work on other religions, however, would be interrupted by his sudden death in 1920, which prevented him from following ''Ancient Judaism'' with studies of early Christianity and Islam.<ref name=\"Bendix285\"/> The three main themes within the essays were: the effect of religious ideas on economic activities; the relation between [[social stratification]] and religious ideas; and the distinguishable characteristics of Western civilisation.<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/>\n\nWeber saw religion as one of the core forces in society.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-153\"/> His goal was to find reasons for the different development paths of the cultures of the [[Western world|Occident]] and the [[Orient]], although without judging or valuing them, like some of the contemporary thinkers who followed the [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] paradigm; Weber wanted primarily to explain the distinctive elements of the [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/> He maintained that [[Calvinist]] (and more widely, Protestant) religious ideas had a major impact on the [[social innovation]] and development of the economic system of the West, but noted that they were not the only factors in this development. Other notable factors mentioned by Weber included the [[rationalism]] of scientific pursuit, merging observation with mathematics, science of scholarship and jurisprudence, rational systematisation and bureaucratisation of government administration and economic enterprise.<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/> In the end, the study of the sociology of religion, according to Weber, focused on one distinguishing part of the Western culture, the decline of beliefs in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], or what he referred to as \"[[disenchantment]] of the world\".<ref name=\"BendixChapter9\"/>\n\nWeber also proposed a [[Sociocultural evolution|socio-evolutionary]] model of religious change, showing that in general, societies have moved from magic to [[polytheism]], then to [[pantheism]], [[monotheism]] and finally, [[ethical monotheism]].<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-154\"/> According to Weber, this evolution occurred as the growing economic stability allowed [[professionalisation]] and the evolution of ever more sophisticated [[priesthood]].<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-155\"/> As societies grew more complex and encompassed different groups, a hierarchy of gods developed and as power in the society became more centralised, the concept of a single, universal God became more popular and desirable.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-158\"/>\n\n====''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''====\n{{Main|The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism}}\n[[File:Die protestantische Ethik und der 'Geist' des Kapitalismus original cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of a German edition of ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'']]\n''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' is Weber's most famous work.<ref name=\"EESoc-22\"/> It has been argued that this work should not be viewed as a detailed study of Protestantism, but rather as an introduction into Weber's later works, especially his studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economic behaviour as part of the rationalisation of the [[economic system|economic sphere]].<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> In the essay, Weber puts forward the thesis that [[Calvinism|Calvinist ethic]] and ideas influenced the development of capitalism.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-35-37\"/> He notes the post-Reformation shift of Europe's economic centre away from Catholic countries such as France, Spain and Italy, and toward Protestant countries such as the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany.

Hans H. Gerth edited and translated this text into English, with an introduction by C.&nbsp;K. Wang.<ref>Weber, Max. 1968 [1915]. ''[[The Religion of China]].'' New York: Free Press. {{Google books|id=eTgvAAAAYAAJ|title=Lay summary}}.</ref> Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Western Europe, especially those aspects that contrasted with [[Puritanism#Beliefs|Puritanism]]. His work also questioned why capitalism did not develop in China.<ref name=\"Bendix98\"/> He focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese [[patrimonialism]] and [[officialdom]] and [[religion in China|Chinese religion]] and [[philosophy in China|philosophy]] (primarily, [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]]), as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.<ref name=\"Bendix98\"/>\n\nAccording to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational thought]], each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> However, to both those qualities were just means to the final goal and here they were divided by a key difference.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Confucianism's goal was \"a cultured status position\", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are \"tools of God\".<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/> Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.<ref name=\"Bendix135\"/>\n\n====''The Religion of India''====\n{{Main|The Religion of India}}\n''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' was Weber's third major work on the sociology of religion. In this work he deals with the structure of Indian society, with the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] doctrines of [[Hinduism]] and the [[heterodox]] doctrines of [[Buddhism]], with modifications brought by the influence of popular religiosity and finally with the impact of religious beliefs on the secular ethic of Indian society.<ref name=\"Bendix142\"/> In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> The [[Caste system in India|Indian caste system]] made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/> Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant in the context of the advancement of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-37-38\"/>\n\nWeber ended his research of society and religion in India by bringing in insights from [[The Religion of China|his previous work on China]] to discuss similarities of the Asian belief systems.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> He notes that the beliefs saw the meaning of life as otherworldly [[mysticism|mystical]] experience.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> The social world is fundamentally divided between the educated elite, following the guidance of a [[prophet]] or wise man and the uneducated masses whose beliefs are centered on magic.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> In Asia, there was no [[Messianic prophecy]] to give ''plan and meaning to the everyday life of educated and uneducated alike''.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/> Weber juxtaposed such Messianic prophecies (aka [[ethical prophecy|ethical prophecies]]), notably from the [[Near East]] region to the [[exemplary prophecy|exemplary prophecies]] found on the Asiatic mainland, focused more on reaching to the educated elites and enlightening them on the proper ways to live one's life, usually with little emphasis on hard work and the material world.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/><ref name=\"Bendix90\"/> It was those differences that prevented the countries of the [[Western world|Occident]] from following the paths of the earlier Chinese and Indian civilisations. His next work, [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]] was an attempt to prove this theory.<ref name=\"Bendix199\"/>\n\n====''Ancient Judaism''====\n{{Main|Ancient Judaism (book)}}\nIn ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'', his fourth major work on the sociology of religion, Weber attempted to explain the factors that resulted in the early differences between [[Oriental]] and [[Western culture|Occidental]] [[religiosity]].<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> He contrasted the innerworldly [[asceticism]] developed by Western Christianity with mystical contemplation of the kind developed in India.<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> Weber noted that some aspects of Christianity sought to conquer and change the world, rather than withdraw from its imperfections.<ref name=\"Bendix200\"/> This fundamental characteristic of Christianity (when compared to Far Eastern religions) stems originally from ancient Jewish [[prophecy]].<ref name=\"Bendix204\"/>\n\nWeber claimed that Judaism not only fathered Christianity and Islam, but was crucial to the rise of the modern Occidental state; Judaism's influence was as important as Hellenistic and Roman cultures.\n\nWeber's death in 1920 prevented him from following his planned analysis of [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Job]], [[Talmudic]] Jewry, early Christianity and [[Islam]].\n\n====Theodicy of fortune and misfortune====\nThe 'theodicy of fortune and misfortune' within sociology is the theory, as Weber suggested, of how \"members of different social classes adopt different belief systems, or theodices, to explain their social situation.\"<ref name=\"Plye, Davidson\">{{cite web|url=http://hirr.hartsem.edu/ency/stratification.htm|title=Stratification|last=Plye, Davidson|first=and James Ralph|date=|website=|publisher=Encyclopedia of Religion and Society|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of [[Theodicy|''theodicy'']] was expanded mainly with the thought of Weber and his addition of ethical considerations to the subject of religion.

The concept of \"work ethic\" is attached to the theodicy of fortune; thus, because of the Protestant \"work ethic\", there was a contribution of higher class outcomes and more education among Protestants.<ref>{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0742561113|location=New York|page=142}}</ref> Those without the work ethic clung to the theodicy of misfortune, believing wealth and happiness were granted in the afterlife. Another example of how this belief of religious theodicy influences class, is that those of lower status, the poor, cling to deep religiousness and faith as a way to comfort themselves and provide hope for a more prosperous future, while those of higher status cling to the sacraments or actions that prove their right of possessing greater wealth.<ref name=\"Plye, Davidson\" />\n\nThese two theodicies can be found in the denominational segregation within the religious community. The main division can be seen between the mainline Protestant and evangelical denominations and their relation to the class into which their particular theodicy pertains. For example, mainline churches, with their upper class congregations \"promote[d] order, stability, and conservatism, and in so doing proved to be a powerful source of legitimation of the status quo and of existing disparities in the distribution of wealth and power,\" because much of the wealth of the church comes from the congregation.<ref name=\"Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto 2008 137\">{{cite book|last=Christiano, Swatos, Kivisto|first=Kevin, William, Peter|title=Sociology of Religion|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc|year=2008|isbn=978-0742561113|location=New York|page=137}}</ref> In contrast, [[Pentecostal Churches of Christ|Pentecostal churches]] adopted the theodicy of misfortune.

The move towards a [[rational-legal]] structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end.<ref name=\"Bendix303\" /> Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the [[social evolutionism]] theory. This ties to his broader concept of [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-38-42\" />\n\n{{quote|Bureaucratic administration means fundamentally domination through knowledge.|Max Weber<ref name=\"Bureaucratic\"/>}}\n\nWeber described many ideal types of public administration and government in his masterpiece ''[[Economy and Society]]'' (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-38-42\" /><ref name=\"Bureaucratic\" /> It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term.<ref name=\"BuSach\" /> Many aspects of modern [[public administration]] go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called \"Weberian civil service\".<ref name=\"Hooghe2001\" /> As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society.<ref name=\"Ritzer2009-38-42\" /><ref name=\"Bureaucratic\" />\n\nWeber listed several preconditions for the emergence of the bureaucracy, which resulted in a need for a more efficient administrative system, including:<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-172-176\" /> \n\n* The growth in space and population being administered\n* The growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a [[monetary economy]].<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-172-176\" /> \n\nDevelopment of [[information and communications technology|communication]] and transportation technologies made more efficient administration possible (and popularly requested) and [[democratisation]] and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.<ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-172-176\" />\n\nWeber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.<ref name=\"Bureaucratic\" /><ref name=\"AllanAllan2005-172-176\" />\n\n{{quote|The decisive reason for the advance of the bureaucratic organisation has always been its purely technical superiority over any other form of organisation.|Max Weber<ref name=\"Hooghe2001\"/>}}\n\nWhile recognising bureaucracy as the most efficient form of organisation and even indispensable for the modern state, Weber also saw it as a threat to individual freedoms and the ongoing bureaucratisation as leading to a \"polar night of icy darkness\", in which increasing rationalisation of human life traps individuals in the aforementioned \"[[iron cage]]\" of bureaucratic, rule-based, rational control.<ref name=\"Bureaucratic\" /><ref name=\"GRitzer\" /> To counteract bureaucrats, the system needs entrepreneurs and politicians.<ref name=\"Bureaucratic\" />\n\n====Social stratification====\nWeber also formulated a [[three-component theory of stratification]], with social class, [[social status]] and political party as conceptually distinct elements.<ref name=\"Bendix85\" />  The three-component theory of stratification is in contrast to [[Karl Marx]] simpler theory of social class that ties all social stratification to what people own. In Weber's theory, issues of honour and prestige are important.  This distinction is most clearly described in Weber's essay ''Classes, Staende, Parties'', which was first published in his book Economy and Society.<ref>Max Weber, \"The Distribution of Power Within the ''Gemeinschaft:'' Classes, ''Staende'', Parties\" pp. 59\u201372 in ''Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society'', edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters.</ref>  The three components of Weber's theory are:\n\n*'''Social Class''': based on economically determined relationship to the market (owner, [[renting|renter]], employee, etc.)\n*[[Social status|'''Status''']] ({{Lang-de|Stand}}): based on non-economic qualities like honour, prestige and religion\n*'''Party''': affiliations in the political domain\n\nAll three dimensions have consequences for what Weber called \"[[life chances]]\" (opportunities to improve one's life).<ref name=\"Bendix85\" /> Weber scholars maintain a sharp distinction between the terms ''status'' and ''class,'' even though, in casual use, people tend to use them interchangeably.<ref>Waters, Tony, and Dagmar Waters. 2016. \"[https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms20162 Are the terms 'socio-economic status' and 'class status' a warped form of reasoning for Max Weber?]\" ''[[Palgrave Communications]]'' 2(16002).</ref>\n\n===Study of the city===\nAs part of his overarching effort to understand the unique development of the Western world, Weber produced a detailed general study of the city as the characteristic locus of the social and economic relations, political arrangements, and ideas that eventually came to define the West. This resulted in a monograph, ''[[The City (Weber book)|The City]]'', which he probably compiled from research conducted in 1911\u20131913. It was published posthumously in 1921, and, in 1924, was incorporated into the second part of his ''[[Economy and Society]]'', as the sixteenth chapter, \"The City (Non-legitimate Domination)\".\n\nAccording to Weber, the city as a politically autonomous organisation of people living in close proximity, employed in a variety of specialised trades, and physically separated from the surrounding countryside, only fully developed in the West and to a great extent shaped its cultural evolution:<ref name=\"City2\">Quoted in {{cite book|last=Bendix|first=Reinhard|url=https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend|title=Max Weber: An Intellectual Portrait|publisher=University of California Press|year=1977|isbn=978-0-520-03194-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/maxweberintellec0000bend/page/79 79]|authorlink=Reinhard Bendix|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The origin of a rational and inner-worldly ethic is associated in the Occident with the appearance of thinkers and prophets\u2026who developed in a social context that was alien to the Asiatic cultures.

After his death, the final organization and editing of the book fell to his widow [[Marianne Weber|Marianne]]. The final German form published in 1921 reflected very much Marianne's work and intellectual commitment. The composition includes a wide range of essays dealing with Weber's views regarding sociology, [[social philosophy]], politics, [[social stratification]], [[World religions|world religion]], [[diplomacy]], and other subjects. \n\nBeginning in 1956, the German jurist [[Johannes Wincklemann]] began editing and organizing the German edition of ''Economy and Society'' based on his study of the papers that Weber left at his death. English versions of the work were published as a collected volume in 1968, as edited by [[Guenther Roth|Gunther Roth]] and Claus Wittich.  As a result of the various editions in German and English, there are differences between the organization of the different volumes. The book is typically published in a two volume set in both German and English, and is more than 1000 pages long.\n\n====Methodological individualism====\nThough his research interests were always in line with those of the German historicists, with a strong emphasis on interpreting [[economic history]], Weber's defence of \"[[methodological individualism]]\" in the social sciences represented an important break with that school and an embracing of many of the arguments that had been made against the historicists by [[Carl Menger]], the founder of the [[Austrian School]] of economics, in the context of the academic ''[[Methodenstreit]]'' (\"debate over methods\") of the late 19th century.<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/> The phrase ''methodological individualism'', which has come into common usage in modern debates about the connection between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]], was coined by the Austrian-American economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in 1908 as a way of referring to the views of Weber.<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/> According to Weber's theses, social research cannot be fully [[Induction (philosophy)|inductive]] or [[Analytic philosophy|descriptive]], because ''understanding'' some phenomenon implies that the researcher must go beyond mere description and ''interpret'' it; interpretation requires classification according to abstract \"[[ideal type|ideal (pure) types]]\".<ref name=\"capa\"/> This, together with his antipositivistic argumentation (see ''[[Verstehen]]''), can be taken as a methodological justification for the model of the \"[[rational economic man]]\" (''[[homo economicus]]''), which is at the heart of modern [[mainstream economics]].<ref name=\"StanfordIndividualism\"/><ref name=\"capa\"/>\n\n====Marginalism and psychophysics====\nUnlike other historicists, Weber also accepted the [[Marginalism|marginal theory of value]] (aka \"marginalism\") and taught it to his students.<ref name=\"Swedberg-econ-soc\"/><ref name=\"Schweitzer\"/> In 1908, Weber published an article in which he drew a sharp methodological distinction between psychology and economics and attacked the claims that the marginal theory of value in economics reflected the form of the psychological response to stimuli as described by the [[Weber-Fechner law]]. Max Weber's article has been cited as a definitive refutation of the dependence of the economic theory of value on the laws of [[psychophysics]] by [[Lionel Robbins]], [[George Stigler]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stigler | first1 = George | year = 1950 | title = The Development of Utility Theory | journal = The Journal of Political Economy | volume = 58 | issue = 5| pages = 373\u201396 | jstor=1825710 | doi=10.1086/256980}}</ref> and [[Friedrich Hayek]], though the broader issue of the relation between economics and psychology has come back into the academic debate with the development of \"[[behavioral economics]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mass | first1 = Harro | year = 2009 | title = Disciplining Boundaries: Lionel Robbins, Max Weber, and the Borderlands of Economics, History, and Psychology | journal = Journal of the History of Economic Thought | volume = 31 | issue = 4| page = 500 | doi = 10.1017/S1053837209990289 }}</ref>\n\n====Economic history====\nWeber's best known work in economics concerned the preconditions for capitalist development, particularly the relations between religion and capitalism, which he explored in ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' as well as in his other works on the [[sociology of religion]].<ref name=\"capa\"/> He argued that bureaucratic political and economic systems emerging in the Middle Ages were essential in the rise of modern capitalism (including rational book-keeping and organisation of formally free labour), while they were a hindrance in the case of [[ancient world|ancient]] capitalism, which had a different social and political structure based on conquest, slavery, and the coastal city-state.<ref>Weber, Max.

But it is not at all clear how such indicators could be established and in particular, verified; whether, for instance, they should vary from one production unit to the next (on the basis of economic location), or whether they should be uniform for the entire economy, on the basis of \"social utility\", that is, of (present and future) consumption requirements ... Nothing is gained by assuming that, if only the problem of a non-monetary economy were seriously enough attacked, a suitable accounting method would be discovered or invented. The problem is fundamental to any kind of complete socialisation. We cannot speak of a rational \"planned economy\" so long as in this decisive respect we have no instrument for elaborating a rational \"plan\".|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nThis argument against socialism was made independently, at about the same time, by [[Ludwig von Mises]].<ref name=\"Tribe\" /><ref name=\"Hulsmann\"/> Weber himself had a significant influence on Mises, whom he had befriended when they were both at the University of Vienna in the spring of 1918,<ref name=\"Mises-Weber\"/> and, through Mises, on several other economists associated with the Austrian School in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Haberler\"/> [[Friedrich Hayek]] in particular elaborated the arguments of Weber and Mises about economic calculation into a central part of free market economics's intellectual assault on socialism, as well as into a model for the spontaneous coordination of \"[[dispersed knowledge]]\" in markets.<ref>[[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek, Friedrich]]. 1948. \"[https://mises.org/daily/4590/media.aspx?action=author&ID=425 Socialist Calculation].\" In ''[[Individualism and Economic Order]].''

But whereas Durkheim, following [[Auguste Comte|Comte]], worked in the [[sociological positivism|positivist]] tradition, Weber was instrumental in developing an [[antipositivism|antipositivist]], [[hermeneutic]], tradition in the [[social sciences]].<ref name=\"JKRhoads\"/> In this regard he belongs to a similar tradition as his German colleagues [[Werner Sombart]], [[Georg Simmel]], and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who stressed the differences between the methodologies appropriate to the social and the natural sciences.<ref name=\"JKRhoads\"/>\n\nWeber presented sociology as the science of human [[social action]]; action that he separated into [[Traditional action|traditional]], [[Affectional action|affectional]], [[Value-rational action|value-rational]] and [[Instrumental action|instrumental]].<ref name=\"Ferrante\"/><ref name=\"Ritzer2009-33\"/> To Weber, sociology was:<ref>Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'', in Runciman, W.G., ''Weber: Selections in Translation'', Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 7.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\u2026the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By \"action\" in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful''\u2026the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the \"meaning\" to be thought of as somehow objectively \"correct\" or \"true\" by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history and any kind of ''a priori'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter \"correct\" or \"valid\" meaning.|Max Weber|title=''The Nature of Social Action'' (1922)|source=}}\n\nIn his own time, however, Weber was viewed primarily as a historian and an economist.<ref name=\"WPet\"/><ref name=\"PRBaehr\"/> The breadth of Weber's topical interests is apparent in the depth of his [[social theory]], [[Joachim Radkau]] (2009) writing:<ref name=\":0\" />{{Rp|(inside sleeve)}}\n\n{{quote|The affinity between capitalism and Protestantism, the religious origins of the Western world, the force of charisma in religion as well as in politics, the all-embracing process of rationalisation and the bureaucratic price of progress, the role of legitimacy and of violence as the offspring of leadership, the \"disenchantment\" of the modern world together with the never-ending power of religion, the antagonistic relation between intellectualism and eroticism: all these are key concepts which attest to the enduring fascination of Weber's thinking.|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nMany of Weber's works famous today were collected, revised and published [[posthumous work|posthumously]]. Significant interpretations of his writings were produced by such sociological luminaries as [[Talcott Parsons]] and C. Wright Mills. Parsons in particular imparted to Weber's works a functionalist, [[teleological]] perspective; this personal interpretation has been criticised for a latent conservatism.<ref>Fish, Jonathan S. 2005. ''Defending the Durkheimian Tradition. Religion, Emotion and Morality.'' Aldershot: [[Ashgate Publishing]].</ref>\n\nWeber influenced many later social theorists, such as [[Theodor Adorno]], [[Max Horkheimer]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]].<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/> Different elements of his thought were emphasised by [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Ludwig Lachmann]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Raymond Aron]].<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/> According to the Austrian economist [[Ludwig von Mises]], who had met Weber during his time at the University of Vienna, \"The early death of this genius was a great disaster for Germany. Had Weber lived longer, the German people of today would be able to look to this example of an '[[Aryan race|Aryan]]' who would not be broken by [[Nazism|National Socialism]].\"<ref>[[Ludwig von Mises|von Mises, Ludwig]]. 2009 [1940]. ''[https://mises.org/books/memoirs_mises.pdf Memoirs].'' Auburn, AL: [[Mises Institute]]. p. 88.</ref>\n\nWeber's friend, the psychiatrist and existentialist philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]], described him as \"the greatest German of our era.\" Weber's untimely death felt to Jaspers \"as if the German world had lost its heart.\"<ref>Quoted in Baehr, Peter. 2001. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=uN__U6VdHEgC&pg=PA410 The Grammar of Prudence: Arendt, Jaspers and the Appraisal of Max Weber].\" In ''Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem'', edited by S. E. Aschheim. Berkley: University of California Press. p. 410.</ref> Harvard professor [[Paul Tillich]] (1968) observed about Weber that he was \"perhaps the greatest scholar in Germany of the nineteenth century.\"<ref>[[Paul Tillich|Tillich, Paul]]. 1968. ''A History of Christian Thought''. p.&nbsp;233.</ref>\n\n==Critical responses to Weber==\nWeber's explanations are highly specific to the historical periods he analysed.<ref name= \"AllanAllan2005-150-151\" /> Some academics disagree, pointing out that, despite the fact that Weber did write in the early twentieth century, his ideas remain alive and relevant for understanding issues like politics, bureaucracy, and social stratification today.<ref name=\":4\" />{{Rp|1-18}}\n\nMany scholars, however, disagree with specific claims in Weber's historical analysis. For example, the economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1954) argued that capitalism did not begin with the [[Industrial Revolution]] but in 14th century Italy.<ref>{{cite book |last= Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title= History of Economic Analysis |url= https://archive.org/details/historyofeconomi0000schu |url-access= registration | publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1954}}</ref> In [[Milan]], Venice and [[Florence]], the small [[Italian city-states|city-state]] governments led to the development of the earliest forms of capitalism.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title= Economic Thought Before Adam Smith | publisher= Ludwig von Mises Press |year= 1995 |page=142}}</ref> In the 16th century, [[Antwerp]] was a commercial centre of Europe. Also, the predominantly Calvinist country of Scotland did not enjoy the same economic growth as the Netherlands, England and New England. It has been pointed out that the Netherlands, which had a Calvinist majority, industrialised much later in the 19th century than predominantly Catholic Belgium, which was one of the centres of the Industrial Revolution on the European mainland.<ref>{{cite book |last= Evans |first= Eric J. |title= The Forging of the Modern State: Early Industrial Britain, 1783\u20131870 | publisher= Longman |year=1983 |page= 114 |isbn=978-0-582-48969-1}}</ref> Emil Kauder (1953) expanded Schumpeter's argument, by arguing the hypothesis that [[Calvinism]] hurt the development of capitalism by leading to the development of the [[labour theory of value]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Kauder |first=Emil |title= The Retarded Acceptance of the Marginal Utility Theory |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=67 |issue= 4 |pages=564\u201375 |year=1953 |jstor= 1883602 |doi= 10.2307/1883602}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nFor an extensive list of Max Weber's works, see [[Max Weber bibliography]].\n\nWeber wrote in German. Original titles printed after his death (1920) are most likely [[Anthology|compilations]] of his unfinished works (of the ''Collected Essays... ''form).  Many translations are made of parts or sections of various German [[original]]s and the names of the translations often do not reveal what part of German work they contain. Weber's work is generally quoted according to the critical [https://www.mohr.de/en/multi-volume-work/max-weber-gesamtausgabe-323700000 ''Max Weber-Gesamtausgabe''] (Collected Works edition), which is

The conquest was undertaken by the British as a campaign in 1758, with the acquisition of Canada made official in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that concluded the Seven Years' War.\n\nThe term is usually used when discussing the impact of the British conquest on the 70,000 French inhabitants, as well as the [[First Nations]]. At issue in popular and scholarly debate ever since is the treatment Britain provided the French population, and the long-term historical impact for good or ill.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Citation style|Section|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:French and indian war map.svg|thumb|275px|Although the [[military of New France]] saw early success during the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]], a series of campaigns between 1758 and 1760 saw the British capture most of the French colony of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]].]]\nThe Conquest represents the final episode of a long series of conflicts between Britain and France over their North American colonies.  In the decades preceding the Seven Years' War and the Conquest of New France, both Britain and France's interest toward their North American colonies rapidly grew and the region became an important source of tensions between the two powers. [[British North America]] became a very lucrative export market during the first half of the 18th century and gained in importance in the eyes of British policymakers. The growing economic value of the North American colonies convinced many influential members of the British public that those colonies should be expanded and that France's territorial claims on the continent should not be allowed to stand in the way.<ref name=Baugh>{{cite book|last=Baugh|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel A.

This change encouraged the British government to increase its commitments toward its North American colonies and their backcountry (ex: the [[Ohio Valley]]).<ref name=Hofstra>{{citation|last=Rapp|first=Paul|title=Cultures in Conflict: The Seven Years' War in North America|editor=Warren R.

On the contrary, many French policymakers believed that the colony was an economic drain for France and argued that its value was mostly strategic. France's leaders felt it would be difficult to compete with Royal Navy and were afraid that Great Britain's maritime superiority could threaten its profitable colonies in the West Indies as well as its standing in Europe.\n\n===Opposing forces===\n{{See also|Military of New France}}\nFrom a of numerical point of view, New France had always been at disadvantage when compared to the more populous British colonies. When the hostilities began, New France could only claim a population of approximately 80,000 white inhabitants, 55,000 of whom lived in Canada. In opposition, the British colonies could count on a population of 1,160,000 white inhabitants and 300,000 black slaves.<ref name=Borneman>{{citation|last=Borneman|first=Walter R.|author-link=Walter R.

In 1755, New France was defended by 3,500 professional soldiers, while the English colonies relied on two Irish regiments \u2014 between 1,500 and 2,000 career soldiers \u2014 who were supported by two other regiments of New England conscripts. Thus, the balance of power on land was initially more or less equal. On the seas, the situation was much more one-sided in favor of the British Navy. In 1755, Britain had 90 warships against France's 50, a disparity that would only widen with time. This maritime domination gave Britain a clear advantage in term of its ability to send reinforcements and supply to its North American colonies.<ref name=Guelton>{{Citation|last=Guelton|first=Frederick|language=French|title=La Guerre de Sept Ans en Nouvelle-France|chapter=La Guerre de Sept Ans: le context fran\u00e7ais|publisher=P U DE PARIS-SORBONNE|isbn=978-2840507772|pages=67\u20138}}</ref>\n<!-- Original references for this section:\n[1] William R.

The [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|siege of Louisbourg]] would represent the first major battle (and the first major British victory) of The Conquest. From Louisbourg, Wolfe led his troops up the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and headed towards [[Quebec]].  Upon arrival, the army set up base five kilometres from Quebec City at the [[\u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans]] (whose French inhabitants had evacuated when the news of Louisbourg surfaced).<ref name=Ward>{{Citation|last=Ward|first=Matthew C.|title=The Battle for Quebec 1759: Britain's Conquest of Canada|publisher=The History Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0752452203}}</ref>{{rp|65}} After the British base was firmly established, Wolfe ordered his artillerymen to begin bombarding [[Quebec City]].

The French army's principal commander, [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]], was, however, always hesitant to commit his troops to a single attack or position. Believing that the British campaign would eventually run out of supplies (or would be crushed by Canada's harsh winter), Montcalm's strategy focused primarily on defence.<ref name=Stacey>{{citation|last=Stacey|first=C.P.|author-link=Charles Perry Stacey|title=Quebec, 1759: The Siege and the Battle|editor=Donald E.

Aware that the British campaign was on its last legs, he mustered his remaining troops and resources for one last campaign.<ref name=Carrier>{{Citation|last=Carrier|first=Roch|title=Montcalm & Wolfe: Two Men Who Forever Changed the Course of Canadian History|year=2014|publisher=HarperCollins|translator=Donald Winkler}}</ref>{{rp|267}} Wolfe would land his troops on the north-shore of Quebec City, and force the French into a fight by marching directly toward the city's core.\n\n===Quebec campaign 1759-60===\n[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''<br>by [[Benjamin West]]. Oil on canvas, 1770]]\nOn 13 September, Wolfe's plan seemed to work: with uncharacteristic haste, Montcalm ordered the bulk of his men to stop the British in their tracks, fearing that, \"If we give them the time to dig in, we'll never be able to attack them with the troops we have.\"<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|279}} The two armies would clash a kilometre away from Quebec City just north of the Plains of Abraham. In the ensuing battle, Major-General Wolfe was fatally wounded. Nonetheless, the British were able to break the French lines relatively quickly and pursue the French fighters as they fled back to Quebec. During the pursuit, General Montcalm was struck and fatally injured \u2013 he would die shortly later in his house on rue Saint-Louis.<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|288}}\n\nThe impact of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], especially the deaths of Montcalm and Wolfe, has sometimes been exaggerated.<ref name=Ward />{{rp|8}} Though a major victory, the epic battle did not, at the time, guarantee success for the British campaign. Likewise, though Montcalm's death was a huge blow to French morale, it was not the essential element of defeat. The Conquest, simply put, was more than the efforts of two men culminating in one battle. As Matthew Ward argues, the success of the British Conquest in fact hinged more on the safe arrival of the British relief fleet in May 1760.<ref name=Ward />{{rp|8}} After the Plains of Abraham, the French had regrouped in Montreal under the command of [[Fran\u00e7ois Gaston de L\u00e9vis]], leaving the under-supplied British to endure a harsh Canadian winter in a city they had already destroyed. Following the battle, on 18 September 1759, the [[Articles of Capitulation of Quebec]] was signed between British and French authorities.\n\nIn April 1760, in a final effort to reclaim Quebec City, the French army (now based in [[Montreal]]) launched an assault against the British at [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]], just outside the walls of Quebec City. The battle, in sheer casualties, represented a French victory. Ultimately, however, the French were [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|unable to retake Quebec City]] and forced to retreat to Montreal, where they would soon surrender.<ref name=Manning>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Stephen|title=Quebec: The Story of Three Sieges|chapter=Hold at All Costs|place=Montreal|publisher=McGill-Queens University Press|year=2009|asin=B01182SL7W}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Montreal \u2013 1760===\n[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Montreal in September 1760 to British forces under Jeffrey Amherst]]\n{{Main|Montreal Campaign|Articles of Capitulation of Montreal}}\nAfter the failed siege of Quebec, the British commanders were eager to bring the Conquest to a close. In July British forces numbering around 18,000 men under the overall direction of [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]], advanced on Montreal from three separate directions. One under Amherst from [[Lake Ontario]], the other under James Murray from Qu\u00e9bec and the third under [[William Haviland]] from [[Fort Crown Point]].\n\nThe three 'prongs' which lasted nearly two months completely eliminated all French forts and positions. In addition many Canadians deserted or surrendered their arms to British forces while the native allies of the French sought peace and neutrality. By September 6 all three forces had joined up and surrounded Montreal. L\u00e9vis tried to negotiate a surrender with '[[Honours of war|Honours of War]]' but Amherst refused to accept this.<ref name=\"Parkman1452\">{{Harvnb|Parkmen et al|2014|p=1452}}</ref> L\u00e9vis however was overruled by [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]] the French civilian [[List of governors general of Canada|Governor]] who persuaded him to surrender to avoid another bloodbath.\n\nOn 8 September 1760, L\u00e9vis and Vaudreuil surrendered the entire French colony of Canada.<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|307\u20138}} Thus, with the capitulation of Montreal, the British had effectively won the war. The details of the Conquest, however, still had to be sorted out between England and France. In line with the Old World's \"rules of war\", Britain assured the 60,000 to 70,000 Francophone inhabitants freedom from deportation and from confiscation of property, freedom of religion, the right to migrate to France, and equal treatment in the fur trade.<ref name=Miquelon>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|volume=1|last=Miquelon|first=Dale|place=Edmonton|publisher=Hurtig Publishers|year=1988}}</ref>{{rp|491}}\n\n==Treaty of Paris \u2013 1763==\n\nThe final details were worked out between British and French diplomats in Europe, an ocean apart from the actual battlefields. In February 1763, the Treaty of Paris made the northern portion of New France (including Canada and some additional lands to the south and west) officially a British colony.<ref name=Miquelon /> Ultimately, Canada would be transferred over to the British without much protest.<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|310}} As I.K. Steele points out, the Conquest of Canada was only one part of the Seven Years' War, and France was willing to surrender Canada peacefully in exchange for their more profitable colonies in the [[West Indies]], particularly [[Guadeloupe]].<ref name=Steele>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Ian Kenneth|title=Guerillas and Grenadiers; the Struggle for Canada, 1689-1760|url=https://archive.org/details/guerillasgrenadi0000stee|url-access=registration|series=The Frontenac Library|year=1969|publisher=Ryerson Press|isbn=978-0770002725}}</ref>{{rp|130}} In addition, the deal struck between France and England allowed France to retain the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of Newfoundland, securing their access to the lucrative Atlantic fisheries.<ref name=Buckner>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip|last2=Reid|first2=John G.|author2-link=John G.

On the one hand, there was a need to appease the French, who \u2013 defeat in war notwithstanding \u2013 continued to present a major threat to British interests given their demographic advantage. This implied giving up either Canada or the [[French Caribbean]] islands. Ultimately, the decision was taken to forfeit the French sugar islands even though they were far more economically significant than the North American French colonies. This was in part because annexing the French ''[[Antilles]]'' would have been a blow to national pride that the French Monarchy would have been unable to accept, thus hampering the prospect of a rapid and mutually beneficial peace settlement. But more importantly, the retention of Canada was motivated by the argument that removing the French presence from North America would reinforce the security of Britain's Empire in the region.\n\n===Quebec Act===\n[[File:The British colonies in North America.jpg|thumb|275px|Map of [[British America]] after 1763. The [[Quebec Act]] saw the expansion of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]'s borders to include a significant portion of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].]]\nThe [[Quebec Act]] was voted in the commons on 15 June 1774. It extended the frontier of the colony, giving control over the region exploited by Montreal fur traders to the Province of Quebec, it endowed ''Canadiens'' with freedom of worship and confirmed the continuance of the ''[[Coutume|Coutume de Paris]]'' in Civil law and English practice in criminal law. It also abandoned the commitment to calling a legislative assembly, a belated recognition that the Irish model had failed in Quebec.\n\n===Mutual adaptations===\n\nThe consequences of the change of imperial regime are best described by Donald Fyson's notion of mutual adaptations.<ref name=Fyson>{{cite book|editor-last=Buckner|editor-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Reid|editor2-first=John G.|editor2-link=John G. Reid|last=Fyson|first=Donald|chapter=The Conquered and the Conqueror|title=Revisiting 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Perspective|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2012|isbn=978-1442644076}}</ref>{{rp|190}} His conception of the relationship between the conquered and the conqueror implies that one must to do away with the idea that, as British identity and the English language came to underpin the mode of governance, the legislative, administrative and judicial branches of the old legal and social order collapsed and the ''Canadiens'' population was too passive to actively participate in this transformation for better or for worse. Instead, everyday practices and structures highlight the practical and utilitarian nature of the mutual adjustments that occurred between colonial administrators, British civilian population and ''Canadien'' inhabitants.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|192}}\n\n===Religious adaptation===\n\nA first example of mutual adaptation is the status of Catholics within the legal framework of the colony. Official policy following the incorporation of the first civil government of Quebec in 1763 mandated the imposition of all penal acts that formed the public law of Britain, including the [[Act of Supremacy 1558|1558 Act of Supremacy]] which barred Catholics from holding remunerated government positions. This exclusionary sentiment is echoed in the Quebec grand jury presentment of October 1764, which objected to the presence of Catholic Jurors as an \"open Violation of our most sacred Laws and Libertys, and tending to the utter subversion of the protestant Religion and his Majesty's power authority, right, and possession of the province to which we belong.\"<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|195}} However, beyond this seemingly rigid religious ideology, the judicial framework presented ambiguities that permitted Governor Murray to make exceptions to accommodate practical realities. Nuanced language in the framing of the October 1764 presentment, which only excluded \"papist[s] or popish recusant convict[s]\"<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|195}} and not papists in general, provided colonial administrators the leeway to account for the administrative necessities of running a country populated in majority by a foreign ethnic group. Indeed, the limited number of Protestant males in the colony (they numbered 200 in 1763 and crept to no more than 700 by 1775) meant that Carleton, and Murray before him, had to look elsewhere to staff the state apparatus, and the only available pool was the ''Canadien'' population.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|196}} The shifting legal definition of Catholicism in the Province of Quebec represents not an instance of British cultural domination and paternal enforcement, but rather a propensity for mutual adaptation in the face of regional circumstances and challenges.\n\n===Political adaptation===\n\nThe political dimension of the colony under early British rule is also revelatory of a series of intertwined adaptive processes. Indeed, not only did the ''Canadiens'' have to adapt to unfamiliar power dynamics, but the British officials and civilian population were also forced to adjust in order to acclimate to new constructs of governance.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|199}} At the macro level, authoritarian political structures were retained under both the military regime and civil government. Murray presided over a \"paternalistic, intrusive and controlling government,\" which was in many ways reminiscent of the French regime.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|199}} In this arrangement, it was incumbent upon the British civilian population to adapt to an unusual lack of parliamentary institutions. So, for example, many conflicts erupted between British merchants and colonial administrators, explaining in part why many of the former came to support American revolutionaries in 1775-1776.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|200}}\n\n===Colonial space===\n[[File:Saint Lawrence River SPOT 1298.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and surrounding farmland. Rather than reorganise the properties of New France to a more traditional British set-up, the British adopted the [[seigneurial system of New France]].]]\nThe continued use of French structures ran deeper than this flavour of authoritarianism: it also included a spatial and symbolic dimension. Rather than reorganise the division of property into the traditional English township, the British made do with the existing organisation of land.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|200}} The continued use of the French-Canadian parish as the basis of the administrative spatial conception of the colony's territory illustrates British adaptation to existing modes of land-ownership instead of imposing their own. Spatiality and political symbolism were also integral to the decision to continue using previously French ''loci'' of power. So, for example, the Chateau St-Louis, the Jesuit college and the Recollet church preserved their administrative functions under British rule. This was particularly disconcerting for British civilians who found themselves being tried in Catholic buildings.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|201}}\n\n===Economic effect===\nThe economic outcome of the Conquest of New-France is best understood within the larger context of the imperial economic structures in which it participated and thus in relation to the events and economic imperatives of the metropoles of France and Great-Britain. At the close of the Seven Years' War, both belligerents faced widely divergent economic outcomes.\n\n====Impact on British economy====\nDuring the war, British territorial expansion and naval hegemony had proven a great boon for maritime commerce as well as for internal production. Military expenditure \u2013 and in particular spending on naval construction and armament \u2013 fuelled a burgeoning metal-working sector. There was also an expansion of the British textile industry, with the purchase of uniforms serving as catalyst. Overall, during the war, exports went up fourteen per cent and imports, eight per cent.<ref name=Poussou>{{cite book|last=Poussou|first=Jean-Pierre|title= La chute de la Nouvelle-France: De l'affaire Jumonville au trait\u00e9 de Paris|editor-last=Fonck|editor-first=Bertrand|editor2-last=Veyssi\u00e8re|editor2-first=Laurent|language=French|isbn=978-2894488287|place=Quebec|publisher=Serpentrion|chapter=Les cons\u00e9quence \u00e9conomiques de la guerre de Sept Ans}}</ref>{{rp|267}} The return to peace brought two decades of quasi-depression. The government had contracted important sums in debt in order to wage war, and annual spending rose from a peacetime low of 6-7 million pounds to a high of 21 million during the conflict.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|268}} The economic irrelevance of the war was compounded by the fact that the territory won in North America (i.e. Canada) was only valuable in that it provided security for the other British colonies on the continent, its most important trade \u2013the fur-pelt \u2013 having crumbled due to the war and to Pontiac's revolts.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|274}} This fact, combined with the failure of the Irish solution for populating Quebec left the British with few options to alleviate their outstanding war debts except by raising taxes on its other colonies. The series of taxation methods implemented in the wake of the Seven Years' War participated in the mounting frustrations that climaxed in the American Revolution.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|275}} Furthermore, it can also be concluded that the absorption of Quebec directly contributed to the frustrations that boiled over in the American Revolution because it removed the reason for blocking the westward expansion of the thirteen colonies \u2013 i.e. the French threat. Indeed, without a rational basis for stopping western settlement, the British decision to call western territories 'Indian land' frustrated colonial expectations of expansionism and gave legitimacy to complaints of metropolitan despotism.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|278}} In brief, the war of Conquest and by extension the Seven Years' War proved unprofitable to the British, bringing little economic reward and instead precipitating the dislocation of a profitable portion of the empire.\n\n====Impact on French economy====\n\nThe French situation was quite the opposite. During the war, the French Atlantic commerce suffered due to reduced trade with its Caribbean colonies: exports dropped by 75 per cent and imports dropped by 83 per cent.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|267}} French industry did not profit so radically from wartime expenditure, in part because its members failed to impose themselves as contenders on the high seas, but also because they did not have the same level of economic infrastructure as the British to begin with. The 1763 ''Trait\u00e9 de Paris'' confirmed the British possession of the province of Quebec and the French retention of Caribbean colonies and Newfoundland fisheries. This arrangement explains why defeat was of little to no economic consequence to the French state: it had managed to rid itself of territory it had long considered excess weight, while holding on to the parts of the empire that were central to its commercial prosperity. Furthermore, given the lull in French economic activity that took place during the war, the return to peace meant a revival of French trade. The year following the peace agreement saw sugar production from the Caribbean surpass the 1753 high of 46 million ''livres,'' to 63 million ''livres''. By 1770, the sugar trade was yielding 89 million ''livres;'' by 1777, it accounted for 155 million ''livres.''<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|279}}\n\n====Impact on Quebec economy====\nAs for the local economic consequences, it was established by Fernand Ouellet that once the direct damage of warfare was addressed, economic fallout was minimal. In fact, the outcome of British conquest was manifestly positive on the economic front. For example, the conquest of Quebec formed the genesis of a logging trade that was non existent during the French regime. From 6000 barrels of pine per year, the Colony under English dominion increased production to 64 000 barrels by 1809.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|282}} Furthermore, the British encouraged the immigration prerequisite to the economic expansion of Canada during the 19th century. Indeed, in 1769, Canadian exports were valued at 127,000 pounds sterling, and by 1850 they had grown to 2,800,000 pounds sterling.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|283}}\n\n==Historiography and memory==\nThe Conquest is a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Historical opinion remains divided over the ultimate legacy of the Conquest, particularly in Quebec. Much of the contention is between those that see it as having negative economic and political consequences for Quebec and French-Canadians and those that see the Conquest as positive and integral to the survival of Quebec in North America. Much of the historiographical debate surrounding the Conquest is linked to the rise of Quebec nationalism and new schools of thought developed at the time of the [[Quiet Revolution]].\n\nThe Quebec school of history, originated from Laval University in Quebec City, posits that the Conquest was ultimately essential to the survival and growth of Quebec. The Laval school includes those Francophone historians such as [[Fernand Ouellet]] and Jean Hamelin who see the positive benefit of the Conquest as enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule in a hostile North America.<ref>Jaenen, p.40.</ref> They argue that the Conquest exposed French Canadians to constitutional government and parliamentary democracy and with the [[Quebec Act]], guaranteed the survival of French customs in an otherwise Anglo-Protestant continent. Scholars such as Donald Fyson have pointed to the Quebec legal system as a particular success, with the continuation of French civil law and the introduction of liberal modernity.<ref>Donald Fyson, \"Between the Ancien R\u00e9gime and Liberal Modernity: Law, Justice and State Formation in colonial Quebec, 1760-1867,\" ''History Compass'' (2014), 1#5 pp 412-432</ref>\n\nThe Montreal school, originating at the University of Montreal and including historians such as [[Michel Brunet (historian)|Michel Brunet]], [[Maurice S\u00e9guin]], and Guy Fr\u00e9gault, posits that the Conquest is responsible for the economic and political retardation of Quebec. These historians tried to explain the economic inferiority of the French-Canadians by arguing that the Conquest \"destroyed an integral society and decapitated the commercial class; leadership of the conquered people fell to the Church; and, because commercial activity came to be monopolized by British merchants, national survival concentrated on agriculture.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Carl Berger|title=The writing of Canadian history: aspects of English-Canadian historical writing since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjgVAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=U of Toronto Press|pages=185\u201386}}</ref>\n\nA major figure of the Montreal school was the nationalist priest and historian [[Lionel Groulx]]. Groulx promoted the view that the Conquest began a long legacy of underdevelopment and discrimination. It was only the tenacity of French Canadians in opposition to the alien rule of the British, Groulx argued, that had helped the French Canadians survive in a hostile North America.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lionel-Adolphe Groulx|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lionel-adolphe-groulx/|website = The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Susan Mann|last = Trofimenkoff}}</ref>\n\nBefore the growth of Quebec nationalism, much of elite opinion saw the Conquest as positive, with one provincial politician claiming, \"the last shot fired to defend the British Empire in North America would be fired by a French-Canadian.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = From French to British Regime|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/from-french-to-british-regime-feature/|website = The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Louis|last = Massicotte}}</ref> French\u2013Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the Conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Qu\u00e9bec's nationalism. Even the \"pro-Conquest\" Laval school is part of the larger trend of renewed Quebec scholarship during the Quiet Revolution. Historian Jocelyn L\u00e9tourneau suggested in the 21st century, \"1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control.\"<ref>Phillip Buckner and John G.

The conquest was undertaken by the British as a campaign in 1758, with the acquisition of Canada made official in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] that concluded the Seven Years' War.\n\nThe term is usually used when discussing the impact of the British conquest on the 70,000 French inhabitants, as well as the [[First Nations]]. At issue in popular and scholarly debate ever since is the treatment Britain provided the French population, and the long-term historical impact for good or ill.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Citation style|Section|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:French and indian war map.svg|thumb|275px|Although the [[military of New France]] saw early success during the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]], a series of campaigns between 1758 and 1760 saw The British capture most of the French colony of [[Canada (New France)|Canada]].]]\nThe Conquest represents the final episode of a long series of conflicts between Britain and France over their North American colonies.  In the decades preceding the Seven Years' War and the Conquest of New France, both Britain and France's interest toward their North American colonies rapidly grew and the region became an important source of tensions between the two powers. [[British North America]] became a very lucrative export market during the first half of the 18th century and gained in importance in the eyes of British policymakers. The growing economic value of the North American colonies convinced many influential members of the British public that those colonies should be expanded and that France's territorial claims on the continent should not be allowed to stand in the way.<ref name=Baugh>{{cite book|last=Baugh|first=Daniel|author-link=Daniel A.

This change encouraged the British government to increase its commitments toward its North American colonies and their backcountry (ex: the [[Ohio Valley]]).<ref name=Hofstra>{{citation|last=Rapp|first=Paul|title=Cultures in Conflict: The Seven Years' War in North America|editor=Warren R.

On the contrary, many French policymakers believed that the colony was an economic drain for France and argued that its value was mostly strategic. France's leaders felt it would be difficult to compete with Royal Navy and were afraid that Great Britain's maritime superiority could threaten its profitable colonies in the West Indies as well as its standing in Europe.\n\n===Opposing forces===\n{{See also|Military of New France}}\nFrom a of numerical point of view, New France had always been at disadvantage when compared to the more populous British colonies. When the hostilities began, New France could only claim a population of approximately 80,000 white inhabitants, 55,000 of whom lived in Canada. In opposition, the British colonies could count on a population of 1,160,000 white inhabitants and 300,000 black slaves.<ref name=Borneman>{{citation|last=Borneman|first=Walter R.|author-link=Walter R.

In 1755, New France was defended by 3,500 professional soldiers, while the English colonies relied on two Irish regiments \u2014 between 1,500 and 2,000 career soldiers \u2014 who were supported by two other regiments of New England conscripts. Thus, the balance of power on land was initially more or less equal. On the seas, the situation was much more one-sided in favor of the British Navy. In 1755, Britain had 90 warships against France's 50, a disparity that would only widen with time. This maritime domination gave Britain a clear advantage in term of its ability to send reinforcements and supply to its North American colonies.<ref name=Guelton>{{Citation|last=Guelton|first=Frederick|language=French|title=La Guerre de Sept Ans en Nouvelle-France|chapter=La Guerre de Sept Ans: le context fran\u00e7ais|publisher=P U DE PARIS-SORBONNE|isbn=978-2840507772|pages=67\u20138}}</ref>\n<!-- Original references for this section:\n[1] William R.

The [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|siege of Louisbourg]] would represent the first major battle (and the first major British victory) of The Conquest. From Louisbourg, Wolfe led his troops up the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and headed towards [[Quebec]].

The French army's principal commander, [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]], was, however, always hesitant to commit his troops to a single attack or position.

Likewise, though Montcalm's death was a huge blow to French morale, it was not the essential element of defeat. The Conquest, simply put, was more than the efforts of two men culminating in one battle. As Matthew Ward argues, the success of the British Conquest in fact hinged more on the safe arrival of the British relief fleet in May 1760.<ref name=Ward />{{rp|8}} After the Plains of Abraham, the French had regrouped in Montreal under the command of [[Fran\u00e7ois Gaston de L\u00e9vis]], leaving the under-supplied British to endure a harsh Canadian winter in a city they had already destroyed. Following the battle, on 18 September 1759, the [[Articles of Capitulation of Quebec]] was signed between British and French authorities.\n\nIn April 1760, in a final effort to reclaim Quebec City, the French army (now based in [[Montreal]]) launched an assault against the British at [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]], just outside the walls of Quebec City. The battle, in sheer casualties, represented a French victory. Ultimately, however, the French were [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|unable to retake Quebec City]] and forced to retreat to Montreal, where they would soon surrender.<ref name=Manning>{{cite book|last=Manning|first=Stephen|title=Quebec: The Story of Three Sieges|chapter=Hold at All Costs|place=Montreal|publisher=McGill-Queens University Press|year=2009|asin=B01182SL7W}}</ref>\n\n===Surrender of Montreal \u2013 1760===\n[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|The capitulation of Montreal in September 1760 to British forces under Jeffrey Amherst]]\n{{Main|Montreal Campaign|Articles of Capitulation of Montreal}}\nAfter the failed siege of Quebec, the British commanders were eager to bring the Conquest to a close. In July British forces numbering around 18,000 men under the overall direction of [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]], advanced on Montreal from three separate directions. One under Amherst from [[Lake Ontario]], the other under James Murray from Qu\u00e9bec and the third under [[William Haviland]] from [[Fort Crown Point]].\n\nThe three 'prongs' which lasted nearly two months completely eliminated all French forts and positions. In addition many Canadians deserted or surrendered their arms to British forces while the native allies of the French sought peace and neutrality. By September 6 all three forces had joined up and surrounded Montreal. L\u00e9vis tried to negotiate a surrender with '[[Honours of war|Honours of War]]' but Amherst refused to accept this.<ref name=\"Parkman1452\">{{Harvnb|Parkmen et al|2014|p=1452}}</ref> L\u00e9vis however was overruled by [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]] the French civilian [[List of governors general of Canada|Governor]] who persuaded him to surrender to avoid another bloodbath.\n\nOn 8 September 1760, L\u00e9vis and Vaudreuil surrendered the entire French colony of Canada.<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|307\u20138}} Thus, with the capitulation of Montreal, the British had effectively won the war. The details of the Conquest, however, still had to be sorted out between England and France. In line with the Old World's \"rules of war\", Britain assured the 60,000 to 70,000 Francophone inhabitants freedom from deportation and from confiscation of property, freedom of religion, the right to migrate to France, and equal treatment in the fur trade.<ref name=Miquelon>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest|encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|volume=1|last=Miquelon|first=Dale|place=Edmonton|publisher=Hurtig Publishers|year=1988}}</ref>{{rp|491}}\n\n==Treaty of Paris \u2013 1763==\n\nThe final details were worked out between British and French diplomats in Europe, an ocean apart from the actual battlefields. In February 1763, the Treaty of Paris made the northern portion of New France (including Canada and some additional lands to the south and west) officially a British colony.<ref name=Miquelon /> Ultimately, Canada would be transferred over to the British without much protest.<ref name=Carrier />{{rp|310}} As I.K. Steele points out, the Conquest of Canada was only one part of the Seven Years' War, and France was willing to surrender Canada peacefully in exchange for their more profitable colonies in the [[West Indies]], particularly [[Guadeloupe]].<ref name=Steele>{{cite book|last=Steele|first=Ian Kenneth|title=Guerillas and Grenadiers; the Struggle for Canada, 1689-1760|url=https://archive.org/details/guerillasgrenadi0000stee|url-access=registration|series=The Frontenac Library|year=1969|publisher=Ryerson Press|isbn=978-0770002725}}</ref>{{rp|130}} In addition, the deal struck between France and England allowed France to retain the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of Newfoundland, securing their access to the lucrative Atlantic fisheries.<ref name=Buckner>{{cite book|last=Buckner|first=Phillip|last2=Reid|first2=John G.|author2-link=John G. Reid|title=Revisiting 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Perspective|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2012|isbn=978-1442644076}}</ref>{{rp|7}}\n\n== Consequences ==\nBritain's decision to retain Canada was the result of different strategic priorities. On the one hand, there was a need to appease the French, who \u2013 defeat in war notwithstanding \u2013 continued to present a major threat to British interests given their demographic advantage. This implied giving up either Canada or the [[French Caribbean]] islands. Ultimately, the decision was taken to forfeit the French sugar islands even though they were far more economically significant than the North American French colonies. This was in part because annexing the French ''[[Antilles]]'' would have been a blow to national pride that the French Monarchy would have been unable to accept, thus hampering the prospect of a rapid and mutually beneficial peace settlement. But more importantly, the retention of Canada was motivated by the argument that removing the French presence from North America would reinforce the security of Britain's Empire in the region.\n\n===Quebec Act===\n[[File:The British colonies in North America.jpg|thumb|275px|Map of [[British America]] after 1763. The [[Quebec Act]] saw the expansion of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]]'s borders to include a significant portion of the [[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].]]\nThe [[Quebec Act]] was voted in the commons on 15 June 1774. It extended the frontier of the colony, giving control over the region exploited by Montreal fur traders to the Province of Quebec, it endowed ''Canadiens'' with freedom of worship and confirmed the continuance of the ''[[Coutume|Coutume de Paris]]'' in Civil law and English practice in criminal law. It also abandoned the commitment to calling a legislative assembly, a belated recognition that the Irish model had failed in Quebec.\n\n===Mutual adaptations===\n\nThe consequences of the change of imperial regime are best described by Donald Fyson's notion of mutual adaptations.<ref name=Fyson>{{cite book|editor-last=Buckner|editor-first=Phillip|editor2-last=Reid|editor2-first=John G.|editor2-link=John G. Reid|last=Fyson|first=Donald|chapter=The Conquered and the Conqueror|title=Revisiting 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Perspective|publisher=University of Toronto Press, Scholarly Publishing Division|year=2012|isbn=978-1442644076}}</ref>{{rp|190}} His conception of the relationship between the conquered and the conqueror implies that one must to do away with the idea that, as British identity and the English language came to underpin the mode of governance, the legislative, administrative and judicial branches of the old legal and social order collapsed and the ''Canadiens'' population was too passive to actively participate in this transformation for better or for worse. Instead, everyday practices and structures highlight the practical and utilitarian nature of the mutual adjustments that occurred between colonial administrators, British civilian population and ''Canadien'' inhabitants.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|192}}\n\n===Religious adaptation===\n\nA first example of mutual adaptation is the status of Catholics within the legal framework of the colony. Official policy following the incorporation of the first civil government of Quebec in 1763 mandated the imposition of all penal acts that formed the public law of Britain, including the [[Act of Supremacy 1558|1558 Act of Supremacy]] which barred Catholics from holding remunerated government positions. This exclusionary sentiment is echoed in the Quebec grand jury presentment of October 1764, which objected to the presence of Catholic Jurors as an \"open Violation of our most sacred Laws and Libertys, and tending to the utter subversion of the protestant Religion and his Majesty's power authority, right, and possession of the province to which we belong.\"<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|195}} However, beyond this seemingly rigid religious ideology, the judicial framework presented ambiguities that permitted Governor Murray to make exceptions to accommodate practical realities. Nuanced language in the framing of the October 1764 presentment, which only excluded \"papist[s] or popish recusant convict[s]\"<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|195}} and not papists in general, provided colonial administrators the leeway to account for the administrative necessities of running a country populated in majority by a foreign ethnic group. Indeed, the limited number of Protestant males in the colony (they numbered 200 in 1763 and crept to no more than 700 by 1775) meant that Carleton, and Murray before him, had to look elsewhere to staff the state apparatus, and the only available pool was the ''Canadien'' population.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|196}} The shifting legal definition of Catholicism in the Province of Quebec represents not an instance of British cultural domination and paternal enforcement, but rather a propensity for mutual adaptation in the face of regional circumstances and challenges.\n\n===Political adaptation===\n\nThe political dimension of the colony under early British rule is also revelatory of a series of intertwined adaptive processes. Indeed, not only did the ''Canadiens'' have to adapt to unfamiliar power dynamics, but the British officials and civilian population were also forced to adjust in order to acclimate to new constructs of governance.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|199}} At the macro level, authoritarian political structures were retained under both the military regime and civil government. Murray presided over a \"paternalistic, intrusive and controlling government,\" which was in many ways reminiscent of the French regime.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|199}} In this arrangement, it was incumbent upon the British civilian population to adapt to an unusual lack of parliamentary institutions. So, for example, many conflicts erupted between British merchants and colonial administrators, explaining in part why many of the former came to support American revolutionaries in 1775-1776.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|200}}\n\n===Colonial space===\n[[File:Saint Lawrence River SPOT 1298.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and surrounding farmland. Rather than reorganise the properties of New France to a more traditional British set-up, the British adopted the [[seigneurial system of New France]].]]\nThe continued use of French structures ran deeper than this flavour of authoritarianism: it also included a spatial and symbolic dimension. Rather than reorganise the division of property into the traditional English township, the British made do with the existing organisation of land.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|200}} The continued use of the French-Canadian parish as the basis of the administrative spatial conception of the colony's territory illustrates British adaptation to existing modes of land-ownership instead of imposing their own. Spatiality and political symbolism were also integral to the decision to continue using previously French ''loci'' of power. So, for example, the Chateau St-Louis, the Jesuit college and the Recollet church preserved their administrative functions under British rule. This was particularly disconcerting for British civilians who found themselves being tried in Catholic buildings.<ref name=Fyson />{{rp|201}}\n\n===Economic effect===\nThe economic outcome of the Conquest of New-France is best understood within the larger context of the imperial economic structures in which it participated and thus in relation to the events and economic imperatives of the metropoles of France and Great-Britain. At the close of the Seven Years' War, both belligerents faced widely divergent economic outcomes.\n\n====Impact on British economy====\nDuring the war, British territorial expansion and naval hegemony had proven a great boon for maritime commerce as well as for internal production. Military expenditure \u2013 and in particular spending on naval construction and armament \u2013 fuelled a burgeoning metal-working sector. There was also an expansion of the British textile industry, with the purchase of uniforms serving as catalyst. Overall, during the war, exports went up fourteen per cent and imports, eight per cent.<ref name=Poussou>{{cite book|last=Poussou|first=Jean-Pierre|title= La chute de la Nouvelle-France: De l'affaire Jumonville au trait\u00e9 de Paris|editor-last=Fonck|editor-first=Bertrand|editor2-last=Veyssi\u00e8re|editor2-first=Laurent|language=French|isbn=978-2894488287|place=Quebec|publisher=Serpentrion|chapter=Les cons\u00e9quence \u00e9conomiques de la guerre de Sept Ans}}</ref>{{rp|267}} The return to peace brought two decades of quasi-depression. The government had contracted important sums in debt in order to wage war, and annual spending rose from a peacetime low of 6-7 million pounds to a high of 21 million during the conflict.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|268}} The economic irrelevance of the war was compounded by the fact that the territory won in North America (i.e. Canada) was only valuable in that it provided security for the other British colonies on the continent, its most important trade \u2013the fur-pelt \u2013 having crumbled due to the war and to Pontiac's revolts.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|274}} This fact, combined with the failure of the Irish solution for populating Quebec left the British with few options to alleviate their outstanding war debts except by raising taxes on its other colonies. The series of taxation methods implemented in the wake of the Seven Years' War participated in the mounting frustrations that climaxed in the American Revolution.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|275}} Furthermore, it can also be concluded that the absorption of Quebec directly contributed to the frustrations that boiled over in the American Revolution because it removed the reason for blocking the westward expansion of the thirteen colonies \u2013 i.e. the French threat. Indeed, without a rational basis for stopping western settlement, the British decision to call western territories 'Indian land' frustrated colonial expectations of expansionism and gave legitimacy to complaints of metropolitan despotism.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|278}} In brief, the war of Conquest and by extension the Seven Years' War proved unprofitable to the British, bringing little economic reward and instead precipitating the dislocation of a profitable portion of the empire.\n\n====Impact on French economy====\n\nThe French situation was quite the opposite. During the war, the French Atlantic commerce suffered due to reduced trade with its Caribbean colonies: exports dropped by 75 per cent and imports dropped by 83 per cent.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|267}} French industry did not profit so radically from wartime expenditure, in part because its members failed to impose themselves as contenders on the high seas, but also because they did not have the same level of economic infrastructure as the British to begin with. The 1763 ''Trait\u00e9 de Paris'' confirmed the British possession of the province of Quebec and the French retention of Caribbean colonies and Newfoundland fisheries. This arrangement explains why defeat was of little to no economic consequence to the French state: it had managed to rid itself of territory it had long considered excess weight, while holding on to the parts of the empire that were central to its commercial prosperity. Furthermore, given the lull in French economic activity that took place during the war, the return to peace meant a revival of French trade. The year following the peace agreement saw sugar production from the Caribbean surpass the 1753 high of 46 million ''livres,'' to 63 million ''livres''. By 1770, the sugar trade was yielding 89 million ''livres;'' by 1777, it accounted for 155 million ''livres.''<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|279}}\n\n====Impact on Quebec economy====\nAs for the local economic consequences, it was established by Fernand Ouellet that once the direct damage of warfare was addressed, economic fallout was minimal. In fact, the outcome of British conquest was manifestly positive on the economic front. For example, the conquest of Quebec formed the genesis of a logging trade that was non existent during the French regime. From 6000 barrels of pine per year, the Colony under English dominion increased production to 64 000 barrels by 1809.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|282}} Furthermore, the British encouraged the immigration prerequisite to the economic expansion of Canada during the 19th century. Indeed, in 1769, Canadian exports were valued at 127,000 pounds sterling, and by 1850 they had grown to 2,800,000 pounds sterling.<ref name=Poussou />{{rp|283}}\n\n==Historiography and memory==\nThe Conquest is a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Historical opinion remains divided over the ultimate legacy of the Conquest, particularly in Quebec. Much of the contention is between those that see it as having negative economic and political consequences for Quebec and French-Canadians and those that see the Conquest as positive and integral to the survival of Quebec in North America. Much of the historiographical debate surrounding the Conquest is linked to the rise of Quebec nationalism and new schools of thought developed at the time of the [[Quiet Revolution]].\n\nThe Quebec school of history, originated from Laval University in Quebec City, posits that the Conquest was ultimately essential to the survival and growth of Quebec. The Laval school includes those Francophone historians such as [[Fernand Ouellet]] and Jean Hamelin who see the positive benefit of the Conquest as enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule in a hostile North America.<ref>Jaenen, p.40.</ref> They argue that the Conquest exposed French Canadians to constitutional government and parliamentary democracy and with the [[Quebec Act]], guaranteed the survival of French customs in an otherwise Anglo-Protestant continent. Scholars such as Donald Fyson have pointed to the Quebec legal system as a particular success, with the continuation of French civil law and the introduction of liberal modernity.<ref>Donald Fyson, \"Between the Ancien R\u00e9gime and Liberal Modernity: Law, Justice and State Formation in colonial Quebec, 1760-1867,\" ''History Compass'' (2014), 1#5 pp 412-432</ref>\n\nThe Montreal school, originating at the University of Montreal and including historians such as [[Michel Brunet (historian)|Michel Brunet]], [[Maurice S\u00e9guin]], and Guy Fr\u00e9gault, posits that the Conquest is responsible for the economic and political retardation of Quebec. These historians tried to explain the economic inferiority of the French-Canadians by arguing that the Conquest \"destroyed an integral society and decapitated the commercial class; leadership of the conquered people fell to the Church; and, because commercial activity came to be monopolized by British merchants, national survival concentrated on agriculture.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Carl Berger|title=The writing of Canadian history: aspects of English-Canadian historical writing since 1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tjgVAAAAYAAJ|year=1986|publisher=U of Toronto Press|pages=185\u201386}}</ref>\n\nA major figure of the Montreal school was the nationalist priest and historian [[Lionel Groulx]]. Groulx promoted the view that the Conquest began a long legacy of underdevelopment and discrimination. It was only the tenacity of French Canadians in opposition to the alien rule of the British, Groulx argued, that had helped the French Canadians survive in a hostile North America.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Lionel-Adolphe Groulx|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lionel-adolphe-groulx/|website = The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Susan Mann|last = Trofimenkoff}}</ref>\n\nBefore the growth of Quebec nationalism, much of elite opinion saw the Conquest as positive, with one provincial politician claiming, \"the last shot fired to defend the British Empire in North America would be fired by a French-Canadian.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = From French to British Regime|url = http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/from-french-to-british-regime-feature/|website = The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date = 2016-02-22|first = Louis|last = Massicotte}}</ref> French\u2013Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the Conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Qu\u00e9bec's nationalism. Even the \"pro-Conquest\" Laval school is part of the larger trend of renewed Quebec scholarship during the Quiet Revolution. Historian Jocelyn L\u00e9tourneau suggested in the 21st century, \"1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control.\"<ref>Phillip Buckner and John G.

Traditionally ''guoba'' forms during the boiling of rice over direct heat from a flame. This results in the formation of a crust of scorched rice on the bottom of the [[wok]] or cooking vessel. This scorched rice has a firm and crunchy texture with a slight toasted flavour, and is sometimes eaten as a snack.\n\n''Guoba'' is also used as an ingredient in many Chinese dishes with thick sauces, since the bland taste of the scorched rice takes on the flavour of the sauces. ''Guoba'' is also served in soups and stews and prominently featured in [[Sichuan cuisine]]. Since demand for ''guoba'' outstrips traditional production and modern ways of cooking rice (in electric [[rice cooker]]s) do not produce it, ''guoba'' has been commercially manufactured since the late 20th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn Hong Kong and Cantonese-speaking areas of China, scorched rice is known as ''faan ziu'' ([[wikt:\u98ef\u7126|\u98ef\u7126]], lit. \"rice scorch\").\n\n===Indonesia===\n[[File:Intip Cirebon snack.JPG|thumb|Large ''intip'' sold in [[Cirebon]]]]\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], especially [[Central Java]], scorched rice is called ''intip''. It is a specialty of the [[Wonogiri Regency]] area and served as a cracker. The rice cracker is made from the hardened semi-burnt rice that sticks to the inner bottom of rice-cooking vessels. These cooking vessels are filled with water to loosen up the stuck rice. After it is separated from the cooking vessel, the stuck rice is sun-dried until it loses all of its liquid contents. The dried sticky rice is later deep-fried to create a crispy rice cracker.\n\nIn Indonesia there is a similar rice cracker called ''[[rengginang]]''. Unlike ''intip'', however, it is not made from scorched rice salvaged from the bottom of a rice cooking vessel, but created separately from steamed sticky rice, boiled, seasoned, made into a flat and rounded shape, and sun-dried prior to deep-frying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infowonogiri.com/2011/07/intip-panganan-khas-wonogiri-dulu-sisa-makanan-kini-cemilan-gurih-bernilai-ekonomi-tinggi/ |title=Intip \u2013 Panganan Khas Wonogiri.

Because regulating the heat of a wood or charcoal fire is more difficult, a layer of rice at the bottom of the pot would often be slightly burned during cooking; this layer, called ''okoge'', was not discarded, but was eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea.\n\n''Okoge'' is still eaten in Japanese cuisine, and is an important part of the ''[[kaiseki]]'' meal served at [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremonies]], where it is typically served with hot water and pickles as the final course. It has a crispy texture and a nutty flavour.\n\nBecause the cooking temperature of modern electric rice cookers is precisely controlled, ''okoge'' does not usually form naturally during the cooking process. However, there are rice cookers on the market in Japan that have an ''okoge'' setting.

Traditionally ''guoba'' forms during the boiling of rice over direct heat from a flame. This results in the formation of a crust of scorched rice on the bottom of the [[wok]] or cooking vessel. This scorched rice has a firm and crunchy texture with a slight toasted flavour, and is sometimes eaten as a snack.\n\n''Guoba'' is also used as an ingredient in many Chinese dishes with thick sauces, since the bland taste of the scorched rice takes on the flavour of the sauces. ''Guoba'' is also served in soups and stews and prominently featured in [[Sichuan cuisine]]. Since demand for ''guoba'' outstrips traditional production and modern ways of cooking rice (in electric [[rice cooker]]s) do not produce it, ''guoba'' has been commercially manufactured since the late 20th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn Hong Kong and Cantonese-speaking areas of China, scorched rice is known as ''faan ziu'' ([[wikt:\u98ef\u7126|\u98ef\u7126]], lit. \"rice scorch\").\n\n===Indonesia===\n[[File:Intip Cirebon snack.JPG|thumb|Large ''intip'' sold in [[Cirebon]]]]\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], especially [[Central Java]], scorched rice is called ''intip''. It is a specialty of the [[Wonogiri Regency]] area and served as a cracker. The rice cracker is made from the hardened semi-burnt rice that sticks to the inner bottom of rice-cooking vessels. These cooking vessels are filled with water to loosen up the stuck rice. After it is separated from the cooking vessel, the stuck rice is sun-dried until it loses all of its liquid contents. The dried sticky rice is later deep-fried to create a crispy rice cracker.\n\nIn Indonesia there is a similar rice cracker called ''[[rengginang]]''. Unlike ''intip'', however, it is not made from scorched rice salvaged from the bottom of a rice cooking vessel, but created separately from steamed sticky rice, boiled, seasoned, made into a flat and rounded shape, and sun-dried prior to deep-frying.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infowonogiri.com/2011/07/intip-panganan-khas-wonogiri-dulu-sisa-makanan-kini-cemilan-gurih-bernilai-ekonomi-tinggi/ |title=Intip \u2013 Panganan Khas Wonogiri.

Because regulating the heat of a wood or charcoal fire is more difficult, a layer of rice at the bottom of the pot would often be slightly burned during cooking; this layer, called ''okoge'', was not discarded, but was eaten with vegetables or moistened with water, soup, or tea.\n\n''Okoge'' is still eaten in Japanese cuisine, and is an important part of the ''[[kaiseki]]'' meal served at [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremonies]], where it is typically served with hot water and pickles as the final course. It has a crispy texture and a nutty flavour.\n\nBecause the cooking temperature of modern electric rice cookers is precisely controlled, ''okoge'' does not usually form naturally during the cooking process. However, there are rice cookers on the market in Japan that have an ''okoge'' setting.

''C\u01a1m ch\u00e1y'' may be made from the crust of rice left over from cooking rice in an iron pot, or, more commonly since the advent of electric rice cookers in the late 20th century, from leftover rice that is fried in oil over high heat to acquire a crispy texture.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Scorched rice}}\n{{Commons category|Nurungji}}\n{{Commons category|Tahdig}}\n{{Wikibooks|Cookbook:Tahdiq}}\n* [[Cooked rice]]\n* ''[[Sungnyung]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Rice dishes}}\n{{Sichuan cuisine}}\n{{Cuisine of Iran|polo}}\n\n[[Category:Sichuan cuisine]]\n[[Category:Chinese rice dishes]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Japanese rice dishes]]\n[[Category:Korean rice dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Moosa kashani", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIran", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_rice"}

When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place.

When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open the door into it as well, and faces challenges at each floor of this tower as he tries to find his closest companion.\n\nAs the story progresses, the reader gradually explores the lore, history, and motivations of important characters and factions that drive or try to change the fate of the tower, for more than 10,000 years. Mysteries are gradually unveiled and added, as the readers learn about the struggles and triumphs of the inhabitants of the tower.\n\n===Settings===\n====The Tower====\nIn the manhwa, \"The Tower\" is a mysterious structure that is completely enclosed and hosts many unique environments. It is permeated by an element called \"Shinsu\", which has strange properties similar to magic in other comic universes. It is inhabited by many different intelligent species. Living on the top floors is associated with a higher status in the Tower and better living conditions. This is a result of ascension from one floor to the next being only allowed by passing increasingly difficult tests of strength, dexterity and wit. Those former Regulars who reach the top of the Tower are known as Rankers, and are generally much more powerful than others. Rankers are often put to work administering the lower floors. At the top of the Tower sit the \"10 Great Families\", which form the governing body of the Tower. A figure known as King Jahad is the chief leader of this body.\n\nEach floor is composed of three layers: an external Outer Tower which serves as the residential area, an Inner Tower where people are tested, and a Middle Area, which acts as a network linking each floor. Residents of each floor are given the chance to ascend, provided that they are deemed \"worthy\" of doing so by Headon, the First Floor's Guardian and caretaker of the Tower. Such people are referred to as \"Chosen Regulars\" in ''Tower of God''. The Tower is sealed from the vast, unknown \"Outside\" by portentous, impenetrable doors. On rare occasions, extraordinary people are able to open the doors and enter the Tower. Such people are called \"Irregulars\" in the manhwa, and protagonist Twenty-Fifth Bam is one of them.\n\nAccording to the author, each floor is the size of the North American continent.<ref name=\"SIU Blogpost\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.naver.com/inutero3334/140120542441?proxyReferer=|title=SIU Blogpost|date=|publisher=[[Naver]]|accessdate=}}</ref> Each floor often has its own culture, language and governance systems, and it is not uncommon to have nations living in isolation and unaware of the existence of the tower. \n\nOnly Irregulars are exempt from the contract Jahad struck with the Tower Guardians that made him immortal. Thus, only an Irregular can kill Jahad. This fact drives much of the plot in Tower of God.\n\n====Shinsu====\nShinsu ([[Hangul]]: \uc2e0\uc218, [[Revised Romanization of Korean|RR]]: ''Shin-soo''), roughly translated as \"Divine Water\", is a substance found within the Tower in varying concentrations on each floor. On the lower floors, Shinsu is diffuse and inconspicuous, similar to air. However, on higher floors, Shinsu increases in power and concentration, and is said to be viscous and flowing similarly to water. High ''Shinsu resistance'' is required to enter these floors. Residents in the tower must form a contract with the \"administrator\" of the respective floors in order to manipulate Shinsu. However, individual known as \"Irregulars\" seem to be an exception to this case, with one (Enryu) who even managed to kill a seemingly immortal administrator of a floor. \n\nShinsu can be manipulated to enhance physical abilities, powerful weapons, and even manipulate the elements. Bang (Korean-\ubc29) is the number of discrete units of Shinsu control. The more Bangs someone handle, the better the ability to control shinsu. The size of the units is called Myeon (Korean-\uba74), and the concentration is called Soo (Korean-\uc218). Though used with varying degrees of explicitness and even conscious awareness, its use seems to be inextricable from combat within the Tower. Shinsu reinforcement (Korean-\uc2e0\uc218\uac15\ud654-shinsooganghwa) is a technique used to strengthen the body, and is commonly used by Regulars. Those who are strong with Shinsu have their aging slowed to the point where they become effectively immortal. It is unclear to what extent aging is slowed simply by living in the tower without training to use Shinsu. \n\nShinsu does not have a fixed flow, but there is a temporary flow. Using this flow to attack is called flow control. Expert wave controllers could destroy a village with this. Reverse flow control is used to strike back in the direction of the flow and to stop the opponent. Sometimes they are used simultaneously, attacking with flow control and protecting the body with reverse flow control. Flow control is a favored technique of Twenty-Fifth Bam, the main character.\n\n====Positions====\nMost battles in the tower is done in teams. Each person in a team plays a certain role in battle, which are referred to as positions. There are five basic positions: fisherman (Korean-\ub09a\uc2dc\uafbc-nacssiggoon), spear-bearer (Korean-\ucc3d\uc9c0\uae30-changjigi), light-bearer (Korean-\ub4f1\ub300\uc9c0\uae30-deungdaejigi), scout (Korean-\ud0d0\uc0c9\uafbc-tamsecggoon), and wave-controller (Korean-\ud30c\ub3c4\uc7a1\uc774-padojabi). There are other positions, such as guide, but they are rare.\n\n==Media==\n===Manhwa===\nLee Jong-hui launched ''Tower of God'' in Naver's webtoon platform [[Naver Webtoon]] on June 30, 2010.<ref name=\"H131017\">{{cite news |last=Lim |first=Jiseon |date=October 17, 2013 |script-title=ko:0.03%\uc758 \ud655\ub960\u2026\u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1\u2019 \uc313\uc740 \u2018\uc2e0\uc758 \uc190\u2019 |trans-title=0.03% probability, build a \u2018Tower of God\u2019 by \u2018Hand of God\u2019 |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/book/607516.html |language=ko |newspaper=Hani.co.kr |location=Frankfurt |publisher=The Hankyoreh |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Its first and second [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]]s was released simultaneously by Young Com on November 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite tweet|number=1191157424490549248|user=iyoungcom_2|script-title=ko:\ud83c\udf89\ub4dc\ub514\uc5b4 <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1, 2\uad8c\uc774 \ub3d9\uc2dc \ucd9c\uac04\ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4!!\ud83c\udf89  <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> \ucd9c\uac04\uc744 \uae30\ub150\ud558\uc5ec \ud2b8\uc704\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4!\ud83d\udc95  \ubcf8 \uac8c\uc2dc\ubb3c\uc744 RT + \ud314\ub85c\uc6b0 \ud574\uc8fc\uc2e0 \ubd84\ub4e4 \uc911 3\ubd84\uc744 \ucd94\ucca8\ud558\uc5ec <\uc2e0\uc758 \ud0d1> 1\uad8c\uc744 \ubcf4\ub0b4\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4!  \ub9ce\uc740 \ucc38\uc5ec \ubd80\ud0c1\ub4dc\ub9bd\ub2c8\ub2e4~\ud83d\ude0d|language=ko|date=November 4, 2019|access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n''Tower of God'' was the first manhwa and one of the first webtoons to receive official translations by Line Webtoon in 2014, and all unofficial fan translations have since been terminated.

Bam asks where she is going as a giant gate opens up behind them and Rachel lets him know she is climbing the tower. She disappears into the gates and Bam suddenly finds himself on the first floor, with a floorkeeper named Headon. Headon explains to him that to climb the tower he must follow a set of tests from each floor and introduces his own test: to reach and break the ball behind a giant white steel-covered eel. Before he can enter the cage to take the test, a girl named Yuri lands her foot on his face and chatises him in a language he cannot understand. Her partner Evan gives Bam a Pocket so that they can communicate. Headon warns Yuri that she should not interfere by helping a floor climber or else she could be executed. Yuri rubs this off and explains she can't get in trouble if nobody finds out, and that she was curious about this \"Irregular\". She proceeds to help Bam out by lending him her Black March weapon to fight the eel. Bam steps into the cage and lets himself get eaten to cut it up from the inside, and goes to break the ball after the creature spits him out. Bam has trouble breaking it, so Evan suggests that he requests its strength, to which he does and it responds. The weapon shows its spiritual form and breaks the ball, sending them both to the next floor. Once there, Bam discovers the next test is to kill off half of the floor's contestants, and is soon surrounded by other hunters.\n| LineColor           = \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = 3/400 (Three Four-Hundredths)\n| TranslitTitle       = Yonhyaku-bun no San\n| NativeTitle         = 400\u5206\u306e\uff13\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2020|4|8}}{{efn|name=airdate}}\n| ShortSummary        = Bam finds himself surrounded by two other test-takers, Khun and Rak, with the former being a blue-haired boy with a cunning look and the latter a giant anthropomorphic crocodilian. Khun finds interest with Bam since he is carrying the Black March and decides to form an alliance with him. With half the fighters dead, the next request is announced: to find a total of three members to team up with and touch by the end of the countdown. With Rak as the only living being nearby, Bam and Khun try to convince him to join their alliance, but Rak doesn't care and just wants to fight Bam with his weapon. Seeing no other option, they forcefully hold onto him at the last second of the countdown. On the mothership, test administrator Lero Ro's challenge for those remaining is to pass his Shinsu water barrier. All but Bam, who remains standing to his supposed good luck, are pushed back by the Shinsu, but most are eventually able to cross through the barrier. The victors are taken to another room where the third test will take place.

Leigh began [[Rugby Football Union]] competition in 1878, and in 1895 became a founding member of the [[Rugby Football League]] (originally the Northern Rugby Football Union) that broke away from the Rugby Football Union. \n\nFrom that first 1895 season under rugby league rules, through to the end of competition in the [[2018 RFL Championship]] season, Leigh has had 1,469 players, excluding non-playing substitutes, take the field during a competitive first-class match. This includes matches that were subsequently abandoned, expunged or re-played, but excludes [[Exhibition game|friendlies]].\n\nThese Leigh rugby league players have been allocated a sequential heritage number, in order of their appearance, by the Leigh Centurions.<ref name=\"Latham, Michael; Hulme, Mike 1 September 1990\"> Latham, Michael; Hulme, Mike 1 August 1990).

Football League season]]) are an English [[rugby league]] club. Leigh began [[Rugby Football Union]] competition in 1878, and in 1895 became a founding member of the [[Rugby Football League]] (originally the Northern Rugby Football Union) that broke away from the Rugby Football Union. \n\nFrom that first 1895 season under rugby league rules, through to the end of competition in the [[2018 RFL Championship]] season, Leigh has had 1,469 players, excluding non-playing substitutes, take the field during a competitive first-class match. This includes matches that were subsequently abandoned, expunged or re-played, but excludes [[Exhibition game|friendlies]].\n\nThese Leigh rugby league players have been allocated a sequential heritage number, in order of their appearance, by the Leigh Centurions.<ref name=\"Latham, Michael; Hulme, Mike 1 September 1990\"> Latham, Michael; Hulme, Mike 1 August 1990).

As time went on it became increasingly clear that a series of supplementary measures would be taken during the course of the year as a means to restrain an out-of-control budget deficit. These included sharp cuts in spending on state-run [[Health in Portugal|healthcare]], [[Education in Portugal|education]] and [[social security]] systems. His cabinet enforced reforms of the local administration to save money by avoiding unnecessary resource allocation and redundancy. This included extinguishing the 18 [[Civil Government]]s (''Governo Civil'') located across the country<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/home.php?template=SHOWNEWS_V2&id=491923 Demiss\u00f5es aceleram extin\u00e7\u00e3o dos governos civis], [[Jornal de Neg\u00f3cios]] (22 June 2011))</ref> and a large number of [[freguesia (Portugal)|parishes]].<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/politica/freguesias-extincao-paulo-julio-tvi24/1286426-4072.html Governo admite extin\u00e7\u00e3o de 1.500 freguesias], [[TVI24]] (5 October 2011)</ref> According to the [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica|Portuguese Statistics Bureau]], there were 4,261 parishes in Portugal {{As of|2006|lc=on}}.

Due to the unsustainable and growing expenses with public servant salaries and privileges, the ruling party PSD said it would only hire one worker for each five that leave, a rule which revealed the extremely large number of unnecessary redundant public servants that had been signed in across the decades. Hiring procedures for the public service were changed to guarantee an independent process and public servants' wages were taken into account to limit extra payments. On 18 October 2011, the Portuguese Minister of Finance, [[V\u00edtor Gaspar]], said to the Portuguese television [[RTP 1]] that the wage cuts imposed to public servants the previous week in the presentation of the State Budget for 2012 were the only way to avoid a much more painful and complex policy of public servant mass firing. He said that if wage cuts were not enforced, it would be necessary to get rid of about 100,000 public servants immediately (under the terms of the law, Portuguese public servants were shielded from unemployment, so a number of special [[derogation]]s would be needed to achieve this).<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://aeiou.expresso.pt/gaspar-alternativa-aos-cortes-seria-saida-de-100-mil-funcionarios-publicos=f681292 Gaspar: alternativa aos cortes seria sa\u00edda de 100 mil funcion\u00e1rios p\u00fablicos], [[Expresso (newspaper)|Expresso]]</ref> In November 2015, the Socialist Party announced it would terminate with Passos Coelho-era reassignment program for public sector employees which included planned job cuts, called ''Mobilidade Especial'', later ''Requalifica\u00e7\u00e3o''.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://24.sapo.pt/noticias/nacional/artigo/ps-quer-acabar-com-regime-de-requalificacao-na-funcao-publica_19949495.html PS quer acabar com regime de requalifica\u00e7\u00e3o na fun\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica], [[SAPO24]] (7 November 2015)</ref>\n*Public administration: since the beginning the government promised to disclose within 90 days the list of public entities which were to be eliminated, reintegrated in other public institutions or be privatised due to their uselessness. These included dozens of financially strapped public institutions, foundations and public companies at a local, regional and national level, which were considered ineffective and futile due to overspending.\n*Taxes: tax rise. Higher [[indirect tax]]es, like [[VAT]] (IVA), for almost all goods and services.\n*Labour: Labour laws were also altered, but most of the changes did not affect current workers, only those starting a new job from there on, while some public holidays were moved from mid-week to Mondays or Fridays to avoid typical extra-long bank holiday weekends. Faced with growing unemployment and hoping to avoid greater public unrest, the government cut the time needed to qualify for unemployment benefits from 15 to 12 months, but reduced the benefit period from 30 to 18 months and created new rules which reduced the monthly unemployment benefit granted to each unemployed citizen.\n*Privatisations: release of state ownership on the utility [[Energias de Portugal]] (EDP), the grid management company REN \u2013 [[Redes Energ\u00e9ticas Nacionais]], the financial institution [[Banco Portugu\u00eas de Neg\u00f3cios]] and the flag carrier [[TAP Air Portugal]] by the end of 2011. The insurance company of the public bank [[Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos]] (CGD) was also for selling. Revenue from the sale of other parts of CGD was to be used to beef up the bank's capital ratios and its ability to lend to companies. Besides this, the government kept the promise to withdraw its special rights ([[golden share]]s) in companies such as [[Portugal Telecom]].\n*Transports: the [[High-speed rail in Portugal|Lisbon-Madrid high-speed rail line]] was put on hold. The decision was taken bearing in mind the cutting cost measures and the contracts that had already been signed. Transport providers like the Lisbon ([[Carris]]) and Porto bus companies and subway systems were also assessed to see if and when they could be sold off. The government programme also added that the road and rail transport companies, like [[Comboios de Portugal]], \"urgently need\" to solve their chronic operating deficits and growing [[debt]]s. On 8 December 2011 tolls were introduced in four [[shadow toll]] highways and in 2012 more than 300&nbsp;km of railways were closed (to all traffic or to passenger only).\n*Regulators: the regulatory bodies were turned into independent authorities with their officials being chosen through a process which comprises the government, the parliament and the presidency.\n*Media: the media company owned by public broadcasting corporation [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]] was to be restructured as early as 2012 to halt costs, and the privatisation of one of the two TV channels it owns (RTP1 and RTP2) was also on the table. [[Lusa news agency]] was also to be reorganised, following the state's goal of rethinking its position in regard to the national media.\n*Monitoring measures: the government created a special unit to monitor the measures agreed with the so-called international [[European sovereign debt crisis#Austerity and loan agreement|troika]] composed by the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[European Commission]] and [[European Central Bank]]. This special unit was subordinated to [[Carlos Moedas]], the deputy secretary of state of the prime minister Passos Coelho.\n*Health: Public hospitals were turned over to private management \"whenever this is more efficient, maintaining the essentially free health care services\". The fees and taxes a citizen had to pay to use the national health service were substantially increased.\n*Foreign affairs: Passos Coelho's cabinet enforced international relations policies directed towards increased economic relations with Portuguese-speaking countries like [[Angola]] and Brazil, as well as supporting openly the creation of an economic and fiscal government for the European Union. The government also supported a State-backed emigration policy to help unemployed and underemployed citizens who wish to flee rampant poverty and social regression, to find a job in foreign countries.<ref name=\"emigrem 1\">{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.ionline.pt/portugal/portugueses-nao-querem-primeiro-ministro-lhe-diga-emigrem-estrangeiro-0 Portugueses n\u00e3o querem um primeiro-ministro que lhe diga emigrem para o estrangeiro], [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], ionline (19 December 2011)</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/videos/video/13547293/1 Emigrem, mas legalmente], Edi\u00e7\u00e3o das Sete, [[TVI24]] (27 December 2011)</ref> On the other hand, the government created programs that issued residence permits to wealthy foreign investors and skilled workers in high demand.<ref>[https://news.vice.com/article/portugal-brings-back-golden-visas-for-wealthy-foreign-investors Portugal Brings Back 'Golden Visas' For Wealthy Foreign Investors], [[VICE News]] (17 July 2015)</ref>\n\nThe [[Portuguese Constitutional Court]], with the praise of most unions and opposition party leaders, eventually rejected the equivalent to 20% of the government austerity policies proposed by Passos Coelho and his cabinet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/justica/detalhe/constitucional_deixou_passar_80_da_austeridade |title=Constitucional deixou passar 80% da austeridade |last1=Miranda |first1=Elisabete |last2=Almeida Pereira |first2=Catarina |date=27 November 2013 |website= |publisher=Jornal de Neg\u00f3cios |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Constitutional Court let pass 80% of the austerity |access-date=25 June 2018 }}</ref> Most of the rejected proposals were related with [[labor market flexibility]], [[public pensions]]' sustainability, civil servants' privileges and job cuts in the civil service.<ref name=\"jn.pt\"/><ref>[https://www.dinheirovivo.pt/outras/o-tribunal-errou/ O tribunal errou]</ref><ref>[https://expresso.pt/blogues/Opinio/HenriqueRaposo/ATempoeaDesmodo/os-privilegiados-da-adse=f595207 Os provilegiados da ADSE]</ref><ref>[https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/detalhe/passos_coelho_respeita_veto_de_cavaco_mas_nao_altera_diploma_da_adse Passos Coelho \"respeita\" veto de Cavaco mas n\u00e3o altera diploma da ADSE]</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nDuring his first year in cabinet, it became clear that the deep economic and financial crisis of Portugal would prompt several policy changes and increasing dissent over the cabinet's judgement. After an inaugural speech in which he promised, in the long run, to stabilize the economy, promote financial growth, employment and protect the ones who needed the most, he moved on to adopt deep austerity measures that, on the view of his detractors, within the first year of government, led to the exact opposite. High paying jobs and pensions were slashed while the lower ones were less affected.<ref>[https://www.esquerda.net/artigo/passos-coelho-anuncia-mais-sacrif\u00edcios-para-trabalhadores-e-pensionistas/24544 Passos Coelho anuncia mais sacrif\u00edcios para trabalhadores e pensionistas]</ref> In addition, his government had earlier adopted a promoting stance on emigration, often advising the growing number of young unemployed people to leave the country.<ref name=\"emigrem 1\"/> On 15 September 2012, Passos Coelho and his coalition government faced one of the biggest civil protests in the history of Portuguese democracy, where demands were made for solutions to be put in place.

Due to the unsustainable and growing expenses with public servant salaries and privileges, the ruling party PSD said it would only hire one worker for each five that leave, a rule which revealed the extremely large number of unnecessary redundant public servants that had been signed in across the decades. Hiring procedures for the public service were changed to guarantee an independent process and public servants' wages were taken into account to limit extra payments. On 18 October 2011, the Portuguese Minister of Finance, [[V\u00edtor Gaspar]], said to the Portuguese television [[RTP 1]] that the wage cuts imposed to public servants the previous week in the presentation of the State Budget for 2012 were the only way to avoid a much more painful and complex policy of public servant mass firing. He said that if wage cuts were not enforced, it would be necessary to get rid of about 100,000 public servants immediately (under the terms of the law, Portuguese public servants were shielded from unemployment, so a number of special [[derogation]]s would be needed to achieve this).<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://aeiou.expresso.pt/gaspar-alternativa-aos-cortes-seria-saida-de-100-mil-funcionarios-publicos=f681292 Gaspar: alternativa aos cortes seria sa\u00edda de 100 mil funcion\u00e1rios p\u00fablicos], [[Expresso (newspaper)|Expresso]]</ref> In November 2015, the Socialist Party announced it would terminate with Passos Coelho-era reassignment program for public sector employees which included planned job cuts, called ''Mobilidade Especial'', later ''Requalifica\u00e7\u00e3o''.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://24.sapo.pt/noticias/nacional/artigo/ps-quer-acabar-com-regime-de-requalificacao-na-funcao-publica_19949495.html PS quer acabar com regime de requalifica\u00e7\u00e3o na fun\u00e7\u00e3o p\u00fablica], [[SAPO24]] (7 November 2015)</ref>\n*Public administration: since the beginning the government promised to disclose within 90 days the list of public entities which were to be eliminated, reintegrated in other public institutions or be privatised due to their uselessness. These included dozens of financially strapped public institutions, foundations and public companies at a local, regional and national level, which were considered ineffective and futile due to overspending.\n*Taxes: tax rise. Higher [[indirect tax]]es, like [[VAT]] (IVA), for almost all goods and services.\n*Labour: Labour laws were also altered, but most of the changes did not affect current workers, only those starting a new job from there on, while some public holidays were moved from mid-week to Mondays or Fridays to avoid typical extra-long bank holiday weekends. Faced with growing unemployment and hoping to avoid greater public unrest, the government cut the time needed to qualify for unemployment benefits from 15 to 12 months, but reduced the benefit period from 30 to 18 months and created new rules which reduced the monthly unemployment benefit granted to each unemployed citizen.\n*Privatisations: release of state ownership on the utility [[Energias de Portugal]] (EDP), the grid management company REN \u2013 [[Redes Energ\u00e9ticas Nacionais]], the financial institution [[Banco Portugu\u00eas de Neg\u00f3cios]] and the flag carrier [[TAP Air Portugal]] by the end of 2011. The insurance company of the public bank [[Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos]] (CGD) was also for selling. Revenue from the sale of other parts of CGD was to be used to beef up the bank's capital ratios and its ability to lend to companies. Besides this, the government kept the promise to withdraw its special rights ([[golden share]]s) in companies such as [[Portugal Telecom]].\n*Transports: the [[High-speed rail in Portugal|Lisbon-Madrid high-speed rail line]] was put on hold. The decision was taken bearing in mind the cutting cost measures and the contracts that had already been signed. Transport providers like the Lisbon ([[Carris]]) and Porto bus companies and subway systems were also assessed to see if and when they could be sold off. The government programme also added that the road and rail transport companies, like [[Comboios de Portugal]], \"urgently need\" to solve their chronic operating deficits and growing [[debt]]s. On 8 December 2011 tolls were introduced in four [[shadow toll]] highways and in 2012 more than 300&nbsp;km of railways were closed (to all traffic or to passenger only).\n*Regulators: the regulatory bodies were turned into independent authorities with their officials being chosen through a process which comprises the government, the parliament and the presidency.\n*Media: the media company owned by public broadcasting corporation [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]] was to be restructured as early as 2012 to halt costs, and the privatisation of one of the two TV channels it owns (RTP1 and RTP2) was also on the table. [[Lusa news agency]] was also to be reorganised, following the state's goal of rethinking its position in regard to the national media.\n*Monitoring measures: the government created a special unit to monitor the measures agreed with the so-called international [[European sovereign debt crisis#Austerity and loan agreement|troika]] composed by the [[International Monetary Fund]], [[European Commission]] and [[European Central Bank]]. This special unit was subordinated to [[Carlos Moedas]], the deputy secretary of state of the prime minister Passos Coelho.\n*Health: Public hospitals were turned over to private management \"whenever this is more efficient, maintaining the essentially free health care services\". The fees and taxes a citizen had to pay to use the national health service were substantially increased.\n*Foreign affairs: Passos Coelho's cabinet enforced international relations policies directed towards increased economic relations with Portuguese-speaking countries like [[Angola]] and Brazil, as well as supporting openly the creation of an economic and fiscal government for the European Union. The government also supported a State-backed emigration policy to help unemployed and underemployed citizens who wish to flee rampant poverty and social regression, to find a job in foreign countries.<ref name=\"emigrem 1\">{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.ionline.pt/portugal/portugueses-nao-querem-primeiro-ministro-lhe-diga-emigrem-estrangeiro-0 Portugueses n\u00e3o querem um primeiro-ministro que lhe diga emigrem para o estrangeiro], [[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], ionline (19 December 2011)</ref><ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.tvi24.iol.pt/videos/video/13547293/1 Emigrem, mas legalmente], Edi\u00e7\u00e3o das Sete, [[TVI24]] (27 December 2011)</ref> On the other hand, the government created programs that issued residence permits to wealthy foreign investors and skilled workers in high demand.<ref>[https://news.vice.com/article/portugal-brings-back-golden-visas-for-wealthy-foreign-investors Portugal Brings Back 'Golden Visas' For Wealthy Foreign Investors], [[VICE News]] (17 July 2015)</ref>\n\nThe [[Portuguese Constitutional Court]], with the praise of most unions and opposition party leaders, eventually rejected the equivalent to 20% of the government austerity policies proposed by Passos Coelho and his cabinet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/justica/detalhe/constitucional_deixou_passar_80_da_austeridade |title=Constitucional deixou passar 80% da austeridade |last1=Miranda |first1=Elisabete |last2=Almeida Pereira |first2=Catarina |date=27 November 2013 |website= |publisher=Jornal de Neg\u00f3cios |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Constitutional Court let pass 80% of the austerity |access-date=25 June 2018 }}</ref> Most of the rejected proposals were related with [[labor market flexibility]], [[public pensions]]' sustainability, civil servants' privileges and job cuts in the civil service.<ref name=\"jn.pt\"/><ref>[https://www.dinheirovivo.pt/outras/o-tribunal-errou/ O tribunal errou]</ref><ref>[https://expresso.pt/blogues/Opinio/HenriqueRaposo/ATempoeaDesmodo/os-privilegiados-da-adse=f595207 Os provilegiados da ADSE]</ref><ref>[https://www.jornaldenegocios.pt/economia/detalhe/passos_coelho_respeita_veto_de_cavaco_mas_nao_altera_diploma_da_adse Passos Coelho \"respeita\" veto de Cavaco mas n\u00e3o altera diploma da ADSE]</ref>\n\n===Criticism===\nDuring his first year in cabinet, it became clear that the deep economic and financial crisis of Portugal would prompt several policy changes and increasing dissent over the cabinet's judgement. After an inaugural speech in which he promised, in the long run, to stabilize the economy, promote financial growth, employment and protect the ones who needed the most, he moved on to adopt deep austerity measures that, on the view of his detractors, within the first year of government, led to the exact opposite. High paying jobs and pensions were slashed while the lower ones were less affected.<ref>[https://www.esquerda.net/artigo/passos-coelho-anuncia-mais-sacrif\u00edcios-para-trabalhadores-e-pensionistas/24544 Passos Coelho anuncia mais sacrif\u00edcios para trabalhadores e pensionistas]</ref> In addition, his government had earlier adopted a promoting stance on emigration, often advising the growing number of young unemployed people to leave the country.<ref name=\"emigrem 1\"/> On 15 September 2012, Passos Coelho and his coalition government faced one of the biggest civil protests in the history of Portuguese democracy, where demands were made for solutions to be put in place.
