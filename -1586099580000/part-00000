[[User:GreenC bot/Job 18]]}}</ref>\n\nIt was introduced by Thomson and [[Endel Tulving|Tulving]] who suggested that contextual information is encoded with memories which effects the retrieval of said memories. When a person uses information stored in their memory it is necessary that the information is accessible. The accessibility is governed by retrieval cues, these cues are dependent on the encoding pattern; the specific encoding pattern may vary from instance to instance, even if nominally the item is the same, as encoding depends on the context. This conclusion was drawn from a recognition-memory task.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|last2=Thomson|first2=Donald M.|date=1971|title=Retrieval processes in recognition memory: Effects of associative context.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=116\u2013124|doi=10.1037/h0030186|issn=0022-1015}}</ref> A series of psychological experiments were undertaken in the 1970s which continued this work and further showed that context affects our ability to recall information.\n\nThe context may refer to the context in which the information was encoded, the physical location or surroundings, as well as the mental or physical state of the individual at the time of encoding. This principle plays a significant role in both the concept of [[context-dependent memory]] and the concept of [[state-dependent memory]].\n\nExamples of the use of the encoding specificity principle include; studying in the same room as an exam is taken and the recall of information when intoxicated being easier when intoxicated again.\u00a0\n\n==Development of the Concept==\n[[Hermann Ebbinghaus|Ebbinghaus,]] a pioneer of research into memory, noted that associations between items aids recall of information thus the internal context of a list matters. This is because we look for any connection that helps us combine items into meaningful units. This started a lot of research into lists of to-be-remembered (tbr) words, and cues that helped them. In 1968 Tulving and Osler made participants memories a list of 24 tbr words in the absence or presence of cue words. The cue words facilitated recall when present in the input and output of memorising and recalling the words. They concluded that specific retrieval cues can aid recall if the information of their relation to the tbr words is stored at the same time as the words on the list.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|last2=Osler|first2=Shirley|date=1968|title=Effectiveness of retrieval cues in memory for words.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=77|issue=4|pages=593\u2013601|doi=10.1037/h0026069|pmid=5672271|issn=0022-1015}}</ref> Tulving and Thompson studied the effect of the change in context of the tbr by adding, deleting and replacing context words. This resulted in a reduction in the level of recognition performance when the context changed, even though the available information remained context. This led to the encoding specificity principle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Role of Semantics==\n[[Semantics]] do not always play a role in encoding specificity; memory, rather, depends upon the context at encoding and retrieval.<ref name=\"Semantics revisited\">{{cite journal|last=Hannon|first=Brenda|author2=Fergus Craik|year=2001|title=Encoding specificity revisited: The role of semantics|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=231\u2013243|doi=10.1037/h0087369|pmid=11605558|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6439f0acfd5bad4c22e1d0bd47d97c3de9d51aad}}</ref> Early research has shown that semantically related cues should be effective in retrieving a word provided the semantic cue was encoded along with the target word. If the semantically related word is not present at the time of encoding, it will not be efficient at cuing recall for the target word.<ref name=\"Semantic Interpretation\">{{cite journal|last=Reder|first=Lynne|author2=John Anderson |author3=Robert Bjork |title=A semantic interpretation of encoding specificity|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1974|volume=102|issue=4|pages=648\u2013656|doi=10.1037/h0036115}}</ref>\n\nIn a laboratory study, a subject presented with an unrelated word pair is able to recall a target word with much more accuracy when prompted with the unrelated word it was matched with at the time of encoding, than if presented with a semantically related word that was not available during the time of encoding.<ref name=\"Semantics revisited\" /> During a recall task, people benefit equally from a weakly related cue word as from a strongly related cue word, provided the weakly related word was present at encoding.<ref name=\"Semantic Interpretation\" />\n\nRegardless of semantic relatedness of the paired words, participants more effectively recalled target words that had been primed when prompted for recall.<ref name=\"Tulving\">{{cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|author2=Donald Thomson|year=1973|title=Encoding specificity and retrieval processes in episodic memory|journal=Psychological Review|volume=80|issue=5|pages=352\u2013373|doi=10.1037/h0020071|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/e31a771cc15bd4d67bad13a6af0514f80c2d4028}}</ref>  Many of the following experiments employed a method modeled off of Thomson and Tulving's.

State-dependent memory is one example of encoding specificity.

Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign is inherently emotional in nature and therefore very easily remembered. If this advertisement re viewed and encoded in an episodic mode, due to its emotional nature, it would be easily recalled because of the mode of memory during the encoding process. This advertisement is a lasting example of emotional advertisements being easily recalled: it aired only once on September 7, 1964 yet is one of the most remembered and famous campaign advertisements to date.\n\n==== Studying ====\nThe encoding specificity principle has an implication for studying; as the recall of information is aided by the context of encoding the information, suggesting one should study in a similar context to the exam. The way an individual studies should match the way he or she is tested. If one is tested on application of principles to new examples, then one should practice by applying principles during the study session. When students know the requirements for a test or the performance task they can better encode the information while studying and can perform at a higher level when tested.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Studying.

Nairne of Purdue University is the primary opponent of Thomson and Tulving's encoding specificity principle.<ref name=Textbook />  He argues that the encoding-retrieval match is correlational rather than causal and states that many cognitive psychologists consider the principle to be \"sacrosanct\".<ref name=nairne>{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=James S.|title=The myth of the encoding-retrieval match|journal=Memory|year=2002|volume=10|issue=5/6|pages=389\u2013395|doi=10.1080/09658210244000216|citeseerx=10.1.1.377.6640}}</ref>  Nairne suggests that what determines successful memory is cue distinctiveness. He says that good memory may be produced even if there is almost no encoding-retrieval overlap, provided the minimal overlap is highly distinctive.<ref name=nairne />  He characterizes memory as an \"active process of discrimination\"<ref name=nairne />  and proposes that we use cues to choose between several retrieval candidates. Increasing the encoding-retrieval match improves memory performance, he believes, but only because it increases the probability that distinctive features will come into play.<ref name=nairne />\n\nPhillip Higham has also criticised the design and interpretation of Thompson and Tulving's original experiments which used strong and weak cues to generate the encoding specificity principle. He states that the use of forced-report retrieval may have resulted in participants responding to the cues positively, not due to them being encoded at the time of learning but due to pre-experimentally derived associations. Suggesting that the word on the list 'came to mind' at the time of the experiment and that anyone could have given the positive answer. This is seen as even more likely with strong cues.

When a person uses information stored in their memory it is necessary that the information is accessible. The accessibility is governed by retrieval cues, these cues are dependent on the encoding pattern; the specific encoding pattern may vary from instance to instance, even if nominally the item is the same, as encoding depends on the context. This conclusion was drawn from a recognition-memory task.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|last2=Thomson|first2=Donald M.|date=1971|title=Retrieval processes in recognition memory: Effects of associative context.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=87|issue=1|pages=116\u2013124|doi=10.1037/h0030186|issn=0022-1015}}</ref> A series of psychological experiments were undertaken in the 1970s which continued this work and further showed that context affects our ability to recall information.\n\nThe context may refer to the context in which the information was encoded, the physical location or surroundings, as well as the mental or physical state of the individual at the time of encoding. This principle plays a significant role in both the concept of [[context-dependent memory]] and the concept of [[state-dependent memory]].\n\nExamples of the use of the encoding specificity principle include; studying in the same room as an exam is taken and the recall of information when intoxicated being easier when intoxicated again.\u00a0\n\n==Development of the Concept==\n[[Hermann Ebbinghaus|Ebbinghaus,]] a pioneer of research into memory, noted that associations between items aids recall of information thus the internal context of a list matters. This is because we look for any connection that helps us combine items into meaningful units. This started a lot of research into lists of to-be-remembered (tbr) words, and cues that helped them. In 1968 Tulving and Osler made participants memories a list of 24 tbr words in the absence or presence of cue words. The cue words facilitated recall when present in the input and output of memorising and recalling the words. They concluded that specific retrieval cues can aid recall if the information of their relation to the tbr words is stored at the same time as the words on the list.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tulving|first=Endel|last2=Osler|first2=Shirley|date=1968|title=Effectiveness of retrieval cues in memory for words.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=77|issue=4|pages=593\u2013601|doi=10.1037/h0026069|pmid=5672271|issn=0022-1015}}</ref> Tulving and Thompson studied the effect of the change in context of the tbr by adding, deleting and replacing context words. This resulted in a reduction in the level of recognition performance when the context changed, even though the available information remained context. This led to the encoding specificity principle.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Role of Semantics==\n[[Semantics]] do not always play a role in encoding specificity; memory, rather, depends upon the context at encoding and retrieval.<ref name=\"Semantics revisited\">{{cite journal|last=Hannon|first=Brenda|author2=Fergus Craik|year=2001|title=Encoding specificity revisited: The role of semantics|journal=Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=55|issue=3|pages=231\u2013243|doi=10.1037/h0087369|pmid=11605558|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6439f0acfd5bad4c22e1d0bd47d97c3de9d51aad}}</ref> Early research has shown that semantically related cues should be effective in retrieving a word provided the semantic cue was encoded along with the target word.

Second, this phenomenon may be due to the general language-created ambiance of the situation in which participants were tested rather than the specific associations to individual cue words.<ref name=\"Autobiographical memory\" />\n\n== Specific Examples ==\n\n====Diagnosis of disease====\nPatients with [[Alzheimer's disease]] (AD) are unable to effectively process the semantic relationship between two words at encoding to assist in the retrieval process.<ref name=\"Alzheimer's granholm\">{{cite journal|last=Granholm|first=Eric|author2=Nelson Butters|title=Associative encoding and retrieval in Alzheimer's and Huntington's Disease|journal=Brain and Cognition|year=1988|volume=7|issue=3|pages=335\u2013347|doi=10.1016/0278-2626(88)90007-3|pmid=2969744}}</ref> The general population benefits equally from a weakly related cue word as from a strongly related cue word during a recall task, provided the weakly related word was present at encoding. Patients with AD, however, were unable to benefit from the weakly related cue even if it was present at both encoding and retrieval.<ref name=\"Alzheimer's granholm\" /> Instead of relying upon semantic encoding, those with AD presented their most dominant associations to the cue words during recall test. This explains why all AD patients performed well when two strong words were matched together but very poorly when a strong and weak pairs were presented during recall. Deficits in episodic memory are now widely accepted as a characteristic symptom of Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=\"Alzheimers RI-48\">{{cite journal|author=Adam, S.|author2=M.

State-dependent memory is one example of encoding specificity. If an individual encodes information while intoxicated he or she, ideally, should match that state when attempting to recall the encoded information. This type of state-dependent effect is strongest with free recall rather than when strong retrieval cues are present.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Eich|first=James Eric|date=March 1980|title=The cue-dependent nature of state-dependent retrieval|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=8|issue=2|pages=157\u2013173|doi=10.3758/bf03213419|pmid=7382817|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nThis finding is a variation of the context-dependency effect of the encoding specificity principle and is much more apparent with low-imagery words than high-imagery words. Both high and low imagery words, however, are less likely to be recalled while intoxicated due to the inherent nature of intoxication.<ref name=\"alcohol\">{{cite journal|last=Weingartner|first=Herbert|author2=Wolansa Adefras|author3=James E.

In this regard, this encoding specific context trumps the importance of such neural brain activity.  \n\n====Advertising====\nThe emotional nature of [[advertisements]] affects the rate of recall for the advertised product.<ref name=\"Advertising\">{{cite journal|last=Friestad|first=Marian|author2=Esther Thorson|title=Remembering ads: the effects of encoding strategies, retrieval cues and emotional response|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|year=1993|volume=2|issue=1|pages=1\u201323|doi=10.1016/s1057-7408(08)80072-1}}</ref> When the nature of the advertisement was emotional, an encoding focus on [[episodic memory]] (trying to carefully remember the visual content of the commercial) led to a much higher rate of recall for emotional advertisements. Conversely, al peptions,{{typo help inline|date=April 2020}} preferences of given object advertised) led to a much higher recall of specific advertisements.<ref name=\"Advertising\" /> Empirical evidence regarding the nature of emotional advertising provides the advertising industry with data as to how to contour their ads to maximize recall of advertisements. [[Political advertising]] displays this emotional nature of content. A political advertisement<ref name=\"Political ad\">{{cite web|author=Museum of the Moving Image |title=Daisy |url=http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy |publisher=The Living Room Candidate |accessdate=18 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426231953/http://www.livingroomcandidate.org/commercials/1964/peace-little-girl-daisy |archivedate=26 April 2014 }}</ref> from Lyndon B. Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign is inherently emotional in nature and therefore very easily remembered. If this advertisement re viewed and encoded in an episodic mode, due to its emotional nature, it would be easily recalled because of the mode of memory during the encoding process. This advertisement is a lasting example of emotional advertisements being easily recalled: it aired only once on September 7, 1964 yet is one of the most remembered and famous campaign advertisements to date.\n\n==== Studying ====\nThe encoding specificity principle has an implication for studying; as the recall of information is aided by the context of encoding the information, suggesting one should study in a similar context to the exam. The way an individual studies should match the way he or she is tested. If one is tested on application of principles to new examples, then one should practice by applying principles during the study session. When students know the requirements for a test or the performance task they can better encode the information while studying and can perform at a higher level when tested.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Studying. Technical Report No. 155.|last=Anderson, Thomas H.|oclc=967611520}}</ref> Studying information in a manner that is closest to the method of assessment is the optimal method of studying due to it aiding recall of the information in a similar context to that of the assessment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mathews|first=C.

Nairne of Purdue University is the primary opponent of Thomson and Tulving's encoding specificity principle.<ref name=Textbook />  He argues that the encoding-retrieval match is correlational rather than causal and states that many cognitive psychologists consider the principle to be \"sacrosanct\".<ref name=nairne>{{cite journal|last=Nairne|first=James S.|title=The myth of the encoding-retrieval match|journal=Memory|year=2002|volume=10|issue=5/6|pages=389\u2013395|doi=10.1080/09658210244000216|citeseerx=10.1.1.377.6640}}</ref>  Nairne suggests that what determines successful memory is cue distinctiveness. He says that good memory may be produced even if there is almost no encoding-retrieval overlap, provided the minimal overlap is highly distinctive.<ref name=nairne />  He characterizes memory as an \"active process of discrimination\"<ref name=nairne />  and proposes that we use cues to choose between several retrieval candidates. Increasing the encoding-retrieval match improves memory performance, he believes, but only because it increases the probability that distinctive features will come into play.<ref name=nairne />\n\nPhillip Higham has also criticised the design and interpretation of Thompson and Tulving's original experiments which used strong and weak cues to generate the encoding specificity principle. He states that the use of forced-report retrieval may have resulted in participants responding to the cues positively, not due to them being encoded at the time of learning but due to pre-experimentally derived associations. Suggesting that the word on the list 'came to mind' at the time of the experiment and that anyone could have given the positive answer. This is seen as even more likely with strong cues. This is known as the 'lucky guessing' criticism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Higham|first=Philip A.|date=January 2002|title=Strong cues are not necessarily weak: Thomson and Tulving (1970) and the encoding specificity principle revisited|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=30|issue=1|pages=67\u201380|doi=10.3758/bf03195266|pmid=11958356|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975 [[Leo Postman]] conducted experiments on the encoding specificity principle to check the generalisability of the concept. The first experiment focused on the normative strength go the cues presented on the encoding and recall of words and the second on the presence of weak cues in seconding and recall. The results of the experiments failed to support the encoding specificity principle as strong extra-list cues facilitated the recall of tbr words in the presence of weak encoded cues and recall of the original weak encoded cues failed to be recognised in the context of new strong cues.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Postman|first=Leo|date=November 1975|title=Tests of the generality of the principle of encoding specificity|journal=Memory & Cognition|volume=3|issue=6|pages=663\u2013672|doi=10.3758/bf03198232|pmid=24203908|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|35em}}\n\n[[Category:Cognitive psychology]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp + English", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding_specificity_principle"}

Prior to the dedication, Smith taught church members, \"We must have all things prepared, and call our solemn assembly as the Lord has commanded us, that we may be able to accomplish His great work, and it must be done in God's own way.

Until the spring general conference of 1973, solemn assemblies included a vote for the sustaining of the [[Presiding Patriarch|Patriarch to the Church]] (formerly Presiding Patriarch), which office was abolished in 1979. [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Local seventies]] were explicitly included as part of the Melchizedek priesthood voting group as well, until the 1986 dissolution of local quorums of seventy at the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] level. The entire procedure until then had lasted a half hour, given that the voting had been done separately for each of the positions being called upon.<ref>{{cite website |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/04/solemn-assembly-and-sustaining-of-church-officers?lang=eng |title= Solemn Assembly and Sustaining of Church Officers |website= LDS General Conference |date= April 1986 }}</ref>\n\nThe sustaining vote of a solemn assembly is observed by [[General authority|general authorities]] at gatherings of church members at satellite locations on [[Temple Square]], such as the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] and the [[Salt Lake Assembly Hall|Assembly Hall]].

After further critically acclaimed performances in the comedy ''[[Kaathala Kaathala]]'' (1998) and the family drama ''[[Vanathai Pola]]'' (2000), Deva then failed to recreate the success of his earlier films and his box office value began to decline and he subsequently made appearances in supporting roles and low budget Telugu language films. He then successfully ventured into direction with the 2005 [[Telugu cinema|Telugu]] film ''[[Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana]]'', and the success of the project prompted further offers for Deva as a director.
