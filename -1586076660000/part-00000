It runs for about {{convert|138|mi|km}} north\u2013south in northeast Wisconsin from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to the ferry dock in [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]]. Much of the highway is part of the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] from the eastern junction with [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway 10]] (US&nbsp;10) in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]] to its junction with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]]. WIS 42 parallels I-43 from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to Manitowoc, and parallels WIS 57 throughout much of the route, particularly from Manitowoc to [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], meeting the northern terminus of WIS 57 in Sister Bay.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Sheboygan and Kewaunee counties===\n[[File:WI 23-WI 28-WI 42 Terminus.jpg|thumb|left|The three-highway terminus in Sheboygan featuring WIS&nbsp;42 going northward]]\nWIS&nbsp;42 begins at the intersection of North 14th Street and Erie Avenue (also known as Kohler Memorial Drive) in downtown [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], a block north of the bridge crossing the [[Sheboygan River]]. The intersection is the terminus of two other state highways, [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 28|WIS&nbsp;28]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 follows North 14th Street to Calumet Drive, which heads out of the city in a northwesterly direction to its interchange with [[Interstate 43]] (I-43) at exit&nbsp;128 which has four [[roundabout]]s within a mile; two controlling freeway access, a retail development with [[Walmart]] and [[Menards]] at Vanguard Drive, and then CTH-Y. The route continues to the northwest into the city of [[Howards Grove, Wisconsin|Howards Grove]] past [[Howards Grove High School]], where it becomes Madison Avenue. Because there are only two exits in the {{convert|20|mi|km}} between WIS&nbsp;42's junctions with I-43 in Sheboygan and Manitowoc, it also serves as the state-designated Alternate I-43 (along with the roads from those two exits from WIS&nbsp;42) when road incidents close I-43 proper.\n\nAt the intersection of Madison Avenue and South Wisconsin Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 and [[Wisconsin Highway 32|WIS&nbsp;32]] meet. WIS&nbsp;32 continues to the northwest on Madison Avenue, while WIS&nbsp;42 turns north on Wisconsin Drive. WIS&nbsp;42 continues north out of Howards Grove into [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]]. While in southern Manitowoc County, WIS 42 intersects County Trunk Highway XX (CTH-XX), which leads east to I-43 and Cleveland, carrying it for about a mile before CTH-XX heads west towards Kiel in the community of [[Meeme (community), Wisconsin|Meeme]]. It intersects with CTH-C in the town of Newton, also leading east to I-43 while west towards St. Nazianz.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north towards the city of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 151|US&nbsp;151]] (Calumet Avenue) just west of I-43. Turning east, WIS&nbsp;42 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with US&nbsp;151 for about a quarter mile (0.4&nbsp;km) before turning onto I-43 at exit&nbsp;149. WIS&nbsp;42 formerly ran east beyond the interchange with I-43 to South Rapids Road, following the road to the north to Waldo Boulevard and [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;10]] on the north side of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. WIS&nbsp;42 now runs north on I-43 to its interchange with CTH-JJ (exit&nbsp;152).\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and US&nbsp;10 follow Waldo Boulevard to the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], running northeast along the shoreline on Memorial Drive out of the city and into [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]].\n\nCrossing the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] near its confluence with the [[East Twin River (Wisconsin)|East Twin River]] just south of downtown Two Rivers, WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Washington Street. Two blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 310|WIS&nbsp;310]] at 16th Street. Six blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 147|WIS&nbsp;147]] at 22nd Street.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 turns to the east on 22nd Street and crosses over the East Twin River, then turns north on Lincoln Avenue. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;147 are the only two state highways that cross both branches of the Twin Rivers, though WIS&nbsp;147 does not cross the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] until about a mile east of its terminus with I-43 near [[Maribel, Wisconsin|Maribel]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north, running roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline into [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin|Kewaunee County]]. Just south of the city of [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], WIS&nbsp;42 turns east on Krok Road to Lakeshore Drive, where it turns north and heads into the city as Milwaukee Street.\n\nIn downtown Kewaunee, WIS&nbsp;42 meets the eastern terminus of another state highway, [[Wisconsin Highway 29|WIS&nbsp;29]]. WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Main Street after crossing the [[Kewaunee River]] and continues north out of the city.\n\nIn the unincorporated town of [[Alaska, Wisconsin|Alaska]], WIS&nbsp;42 again turns east towards Lake Michigan to follow the shoreline into [[Algoma, Wisconsin|Algoma]] as Lake Street. In downtown Algoma, WIS&nbsp;42 turns north onto 4th Street and crosses the [[Ahnapee River]]. On the north bank of the river, WIS&nbsp;42 turns northwest onto North Water Street and follows the river in a northerly direction to [[Forestville, Wisconsin|Forestville]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], where it becomes Forestville Avenue.\n\n===Door County===\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42Curvy.jpg|thumb|Curvy section near northern terminus]]\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42NorthernTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|Northern terminus]]\nBecause of the geographical features and terrain of Door County, WIS&nbsp;42 makes many abrupt turns as it nears its northern terminus at the tip of the [[Door Peninsula]].\n\nAt its intersection with CTH-J in Forestville, WIS&nbsp;42 heads directly north into Door County. In the unincorporated community [[Maplewood, Wisconsin]], there is a small wayside park with parking, vault toilets and picnic tables in the center of town at the intersection of WIS&nbsp;42, [[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|County Trunk]] H, and the [[Ahnapee State Trail]].<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Ahnapee_Trail_DoorCo-Map.pdf Ahnapee Trail Door County Map]</ref> The wayside park is open a half hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.,<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Parks%20Brochure%202017%20Website%20Final%20Copy.pdf Rules for All Door County Parks]</ref> although the trail is open all 24 hours. This is the only place where the trail crosses WIS&nbsp;42.\n\nPast Maplewood, WIS&nbsp;42 meets with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] a few miles southwest of [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], and heads to the northeast with WIS&nbsp;57 into the city as Green Bay Road. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;57 are the only two state highways to enter Door County.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 crosses over the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal to the southeast of downtown, bypassing the old Michigan Street bridge further upstream. A [[Wisconsin Highway 42 Business (Sturgeon Bay)|business route]] continues north on Green Bay Road to South Madison Avenue, crossing the canal on the Michigan Street bridge into downtown Sturgeon Bay. Turning left to the northwest on Third Avenue, the business route follows CTH-B to Jefferson Street, turning to the northeast on CTH-HH. CTH-HH jogs slightly north around Big Hill Park to Egg Harbor Road, where the business route turns northeast past the Door County Fairgrounds to its intersection with WIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 outside the city.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and 57 run concurrently for another mile to the north until WIS&nbsp;57 turns to the East at Johns Lane. WIS&nbsp;57 runs along the eastern shore of Door County until reaching its eastern terminus with WIS&nbsp;42 in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues north on Egg Harbor Road to CTH-T just west of [[Egg Harbor, Wisconsin|Egg Harbor]]. It then swings around and along the shore of Egg Harbor before continuing to the northeast towards [[Fish Creek, Wisconsin|Fish Creek]].\n\nOutside of Fish Creek, WIS&nbsp;42 takes an abrupt left-hand turn to follow the bluff down to Main Street and the [[Alexander Noble House]]. WIS&nbsp;42 makes an abrupt right onto Main Street and heads to the northeast past [[Peninsula State Park]] into the unincorporated town of Eagle Harbor.\n\nIn Eagle Harbor, the road becomes Water Street as it runs along the shoreline of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]]. It then curves to the northeast, becoming South Bay Shore Drive outside of Sister Bay.

It runs for about {{convert|138|mi|km}} north\u2013south in northeast Wisconsin from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to the ferry dock in [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]]. Much of the highway is part of the [[Lake Michigan Circle Tour]] from the eastern junction with [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|U.S. Highway 10]] (US&nbsp;10) in [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]] to its junction with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]]. WIS 42 parallels I-43 from [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]] to Manitowoc, and parallels WIS 57 throughout much of the route, particularly from Manitowoc to [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], meeting the northern terminus of WIS 57 in Sister Bay.\n\n==Route description==\n\n===Sheboygan and Kewaunee counties===\n[[File:WI 23-WI 28-WI 42 Terminus.jpg|thumb|left|The three-highway terminus in Sheboygan featuring WIS&nbsp;42 going northward]]\nWIS&nbsp;42 begins at the intersection of North 14th Street and Erie Avenue (also known as Kohler Memorial Drive) in downtown [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], a block north of the bridge crossing the [[Sheboygan River]]. The intersection is the terminus of two other state highways, [[Wisconsin Highway 23|WIS&nbsp;23]] and [[Wisconsin Highway 28|WIS&nbsp;28]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 follows North 14th Street to Calumet Drive, which heads out of the city in a northwesterly direction to its interchange with [[Interstate 43]] (I-43) at exit&nbsp;128 which has four [[roundabout]]s within a mile; two controlling freeway access, a retail development with [[Walmart]] and [[Menards]] at Vanguard Drive, and then CTH-Y. The route continues to the northwest into the city of [[Howards Grove, Wisconsin|Howards Grove]] past [[Howards Grove High School]], where it becomes Madison Avenue. Because there are only two exits in the {{convert|20|mi|km}} between WIS&nbsp;42's junctions with I-43 in Sheboygan and Manitowoc, it also serves as the state-designated Alternate I-43 (along with the roads from those two exits from WIS&nbsp;42) when road incidents close I-43 proper.\n\nAt the intersection of Madison Avenue and South Wisconsin Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 and [[Wisconsin Highway 32|WIS&nbsp;32]] meet. WIS&nbsp;32 continues to the northwest on Madison Avenue, while WIS&nbsp;42 turns north on Wisconsin Drive. WIS&nbsp;42 continues north out of Howards Grove into [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc County]]. While in southern Manitowoc County, WIS 42 intersects County Trunk Highway XX (CTH-XX), which leads east to I-43 and Cleveland, carrying it for about a mile before CTH-XX heads west towards Kiel in the community of [[Meeme (community), Wisconsin|Meeme]]. It intersects with CTH-C in the town of Newton, also leading east to I-43 while west towards St. Nazianz.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north towards the city of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]], where it intersects [[U.S. Route 151|US&nbsp;151]] (Calumet Avenue) just west of I-43. Turning east, WIS&nbsp;42 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with US&nbsp;151 for about a quarter mile (0.4&nbsp;km) before turning onto I-43 at exit&nbsp;149. WIS&nbsp;42 formerly ran east beyond the interchange with I-43 to South Rapids Road, following the road to the north to Waldo Boulevard and [[U.S. Route 10 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;10]] on the north side of [[Manitowoc, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]]. WIS&nbsp;42 now runs north on I-43 to its interchange with CTH-JJ (exit&nbsp;152).\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and US&nbsp;10 follow Waldo Boulevard to the shore of [[Lake Michigan]], running northeast along the shoreline on Memorial Drive out of the city and into [[Two Rivers, Wisconsin|Two Rivers]].\n\nCrossing the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] near its confluence with the [[East Twin River (Wisconsin)|East Twin River]] just south of downtown Two Rivers, WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Washington Street. Two blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 310|WIS&nbsp;310]] at 16th Street. Six blocks north, it meets the eastern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 147|WIS&nbsp;147]] at 22nd Street.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 turns to the east on 22nd Street and crosses over the East Twin River, then turns north on Lincoln Avenue. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;147 are the only two state highways that cross both branches of the Twin Rivers, though WIS&nbsp;147 does not cross the [[West Twin River (Wisconsin)|West Twin River]] until about a mile east of its terminus with I-43 near [[Maribel, Wisconsin|Maribel]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues to the north, running roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline into [[Kewaunee County, Wisconsin|Kewaunee County]]. Just south of the city of [[Kewaunee, Wisconsin|Kewaunee]], WIS&nbsp;42 turns east on Krok Road to Lakeshore Drive, where it turns north and heads into the city as Milwaukee Street.\n\nIn downtown Kewaunee, WIS&nbsp;42 meets the eastern terminus of another state highway, [[Wisconsin Highway 29|WIS&nbsp;29]]. WIS&nbsp;42 becomes Main Street after crossing the [[Kewaunee River]] and continues north out of the city.\n\nIn the unincorporated town of [[Alaska, Wisconsin|Alaska]], WIS&nbsp;42 again turns east towards Lake Michigan to follow the shoreline into [[Algoma, Wisconsin|Algoma]] as Lake Street. In downtown Algoma, WIS&nbsp;42 turns north onto 4th Street and crosses the [[Ahnapee River]]. On the north bank of the river, WIS&nbsp;42 turns northwest onto North Water Street and follows the river in a northerly direction to [[Forestville, Wisconsin|Forestville]] in [[Door County, Wisconsin|Door County]], where it becomes Forestville Avenue.\n\n===Door County===\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42Curvy.jpg|thumb|Curvy section near northern terminus]]\n[[File:WisconsinHighway42NorthernTerminus.jpg|right|thumb|Northern terminus]]\nBecause of the geographical features and terrain of Door County, WIS&nbsp;42 makes many abrupt turns as it nears its northern terminus at the tip of the [[Door Peninsula]].\n\nAt its intersection with CTH-J in Forestville, WIS&nbsp;42 heads directly north into Door County. In the unincorporated community [[Maplewood, Wisconsin]], there is a small wayside park with parking, vault toilets and picnic tables in the center of town at the intersection of WIS&nbsp;42, [[County Trunk Highways (Wisconsin)|County Trunk]] H, and the [[Ahnapee State Trail]].<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Ahnapee_Trail_DoorCo-Map.pdf Ahnapee Trail Door County Map]</ref> The wayside park is open a half hour before sunrise to 11 p.m.,<ref>[http://map.co.door.wi.us/parks/Parks%20Brochure%202017%20Website%20Final%20Copy.pdf Rules for All Door County Parks]</ref> although the trail is open all 24 hours. This is the only place where the trail crosses WIS&nbsp;42.\n\nPast Maplewood, WIS&nbsp;42 meets with [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] a few miles southwest of [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin|Sturgeon Bay]], and heads to the northeast with WIS&nbsp;57 into the city as Green Bay Road. WIS&nbsp;42 and WIS&nbsp;57 are the only two state highways to enter Door County.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 crosses over the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal to the southeast of downtown, bypassing the old Michigan Street bridge further upstream. A [[Wisconsin Highway 42 Business (Sturgeon Bay)|business route]] continues north on Green Bay Road to South Madison Avenue, crossing the canal on the Michigan Street bridge into downtown Sturgeon Bay. Turning left to the northwest on Third Avenue, the business route follows CTH-B to Jefferson Street, turning to the northeast on CTH-HH. CTH-HH jogs slightly north around Big Hill Park to Egg Harbor Road, where the business route turns northeast past the Door County Fairgrounds to its intersection with WIS&nbsp;42/WIS&nbsp;57 outside the city.\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 and 57 run concurrently for another mile to the north until WIS&nbsp;57 turns to the East at Johns Lane. WIS&nbsp;57 runs along the eastern shore of Door County until reaching its eastern terminus with WIS&nbsp;42 in [[Sister Bay, Wisconsin|Sister Bay]].\n\nWIS&nbsp;42 continues north on Egg Harbor Road to CTH-T just west of [[Egg Harbor, Wisconsin|Egg Harbor]]. It then swings around and along the shore of Egg Harbor before continuing to the northeast towards [[Fish Creek, Wisconsin|Fish Creek]].\n\nOutside of Fish Creek, WIS&nbsp;42 takes an abrupt left-hand turn to follow the bluff down to Main Street and the [[Alexander Noble House]]. WIS&nbsp;42 makes an abrupt right onto Main Street and heads to the northeast past [[Peninsula State Park]] into the unincorporated town of Eagle Harbor.\n\nIn Eagle Harbor, the road becomes Water Street as it runs along the shoreline of [[Green Bay (Lake Michigan)|Green Bay]]. It then curves to the northeast, becoming South Bay Shore Drive outside of Sister Bay. Meeting the northern terminus of [[Wisconsin Highway 57|WIS&nbsp;57]] at Gateway Drive, WIS&nbsp;42 once again swings to the northeast towards [[Ellison Bay, Wisconsin|Ellison Bay]].\n\nJust outside town, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east on School Road to its intersection with Europe Bay Road, where it turns north towards [[Gills Rock, Wisconsin|Gills Rock]]. At Gills Rock, WIS&nbsp;42 turns due east and then turns slightly to the southeast before heading due east again to its eastern terminus at the [[Washington Island (Wisconsin)#Transportation|Washington Island Ferry]] dock at Port Des Morts Drive in unincorporated town of [[Northport, Door County, Wisconsin|Northport]].\n{{-}}\n\n==Major intersections==\n{{jcttop|length_ref=<ref name=WisDOT3>{{cite book |author= Region&nbsp;3 Staff |title= State Trunk Highway Log for Region&nbsp;3 |date= May 14, 2009 |publisher= [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] |location= Green Bay, WI |pages= 253\u2013276, 656}}</ref>}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Sheboygan\n|cspan=3\n|location=Sheboygan\n|mile=0.00\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|23|WI|28|Tour|LMCT|dir1=west|dir2=west}} (Erie Ave)\n|notes=Southern terminus}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Sheboygan\n|area=town\n|mile=3.43\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|city1=Milwaukee|city2=Green Bay}}\n|notes=Exit&nbsp;128 on I-43}}\n{{WIint\n|location=Howards Grove\n|mile=7.53\n|road={{jct|state=WI|WI|32|city1=Sheboygan Falls|city2=Kiel}}\n|notes=}}\n{{WIint\n|county=Manitowoc\n|cspan=6\n|location=Manitowoc\n|lspan=4\n|mile=26.18\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|US|151|dir1=south|city1=Chilton|city2=Fond du Lac}}\n|notes=Western end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency}}\n{{WIint\n|mile=26.58\n|mile2=26.81\n|type=concur\n|road={{jct|state=WI|I|43|Tour|LMCT|dir1=south|city1=Milwaukee}}<br/>{{jct|state=WI|US|151|WI-Bus|42|Tour|LMCT|dir1=north|dir2=north|city1=Manitowoc|dab2=Manitowoc}}\n|notes=Southern end of I-43 concurrency; eastern end of US&nbsp;151 concurrency; exit&nbsp;149 on I-43; southern terminus of Bus.

Lawrence]], Jessica Chambers, a friend of his youth portrayed in ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', and [[Frieda Weekley]] (n\u00e9e von Richthofen), his mistress and wife. It was published posthumously in 1987 as ''D. H. Lawrence. Nottingham Connections''.\n\nIn 1952 she published ''The Hop Dog'' (1952) in collaboration with Molly Thorp.

She left sketches of the Colonel de Basil's [http://www.nypl.org/ead/675#idp84352 Ballet Russe] when it toured England in the 1930s.\n\nLavrin also created many portraits sketches from daily life on paper in the 1950s. Her landscape oil works and watercolor portraits of her children and family are mostly held in private collections. The [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford]] has a collection of her original illustrations. She is also represented in the collection of the Maribor Art Gallery in Slovenia. Her dry points of Yugoslavia published in 1935, in which the landscape is expressed in volumes and the people are captured as in snap shots. The Yugoslavia dry points aimed at witnessing a country and its people and have a very important historical value as they captured a region that would change irreversibly after World War II.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Connelly, William, \u201cNora Lavrin.

In the 1920s and 1930s she exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer exhibition; Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, Nottingham Society of Artists and galleries in England and, later in 1961, in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.\n\n==World War II==\n[[File:Land Girls unloading Flax (Art.IWM ART LD 3587).jpg|thumb|''Land Girls unloading Flax'', 1943, (Art.IWM ART LD 3587)]]\nDuring World War II the Lavrins were living in London. Janko Lavrin worked for the [[BBC World Service]] and Nora taught at a number of the art schools, including the Hammersmith School of Art, that had remained open during the conflict. Nora  was also spent time outside London recording the work done by the [[Women's Land Army (World War II)|Women's Land Army]] and several of these pieces were purchased by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] and are now held by the [[Imperial War Museum]].<ref name=\"LGirls\"/> Lavrin continued to illustrate books including [[Averil Demuth]]'s ''Trudi and Hansel'' (1938) and [[Hilda Lewis]]'s ''The Ship that Flew ''(1939, 1986). She also illustrated [[Elizabeth Kyle]]\u2019s ''The Seven Sapphires'' (1944), ''Holly Hotel'' (1945), ''Mirror of Castle Doone'' (1947) and ''Lost Karin'' (1947).\n\n==Later life==\nAfter the War Lavrin illustrated books on Slovene literature such as ''[https://lic.ned.univie.ac.at/en/node/19391 Vladimir Levstik]'', ''An Adder\u2019s Nest'' (1931, 1943), [[Ivan Cankar]]\u2019s ''The Bailiff Yerney and his Rights'' (London 1946), and ''The Ward of Our Lady of Mercy'' (Slovenia 1976), and [[Matej Bor]]\u2019s ''A Wanderer in the Atomic Age'' (1967 and 1970). She also illustrated translations of several English classics into Slovene such as ''[[Villette (novel)|Villete]]'' by [[Charlotte Bront\u00eb]] (Ljubljana 1965), ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'' by [[Anne Bront\u00eb]], and ''[[The Return of the Native]]'', ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' and ''[[The Mayor of Casterbridge]]'' by [[Thomas Hardy]]. Among her publications is a personal memoir of the relationship between [[D. H. Lawrence]], Jessica Chambers, a friend of his youth portrayed in ''[[Sons and Lovers]]'', and [[Frieda Weekley]] (n\u00e9e von Richthofen), his mistress and wife. It was published posthumously in 1987 as ''D. H. Lawrence. Nottingham Connections''.\n\nIn 1952 she published ''The Hop Dog'' (1952) in collaboration with Molly Thorp. The story was later adapted into a children\u2019s film, ''[[Adventure in the Hopfields]]'' (1954).<ref name=IMDBnl>{{cite web |author=|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165075/ |title=''Adventure in the Hopfields'' (1954).|date= |accessdate=11 December 2016|work=IMDB}}</ref> Lavrin's interest in ballet sets and costumes resulted in her designs for ''Love and Litigation'', choreographed by [[Pino Mlakar]] for the Slovene National Dance Company in 1956. She left sketches of the Colonel de Basil's [http://www.nypl.org/ead/675#idp84352 Ballet Russe] when it toured England in the 1930s.\n\nLavrin also created many portraits sketches from daily life on paper in the 1950s. Her landscape oil works and watercolor portraits of her children and family are mostly held in private collections. The [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford]] has a collection of her original illustrations. She is also represented in the collection of the Maribor Art Gallery in Slovenia. Her dry points of Yugoslavia published in 1935, in which the landscape is expressed in volumes and the people are captured as in snap shots. The Yugoslavia dry points aimed at witnessing a country and its people and have a very important historical value as they captured a region that would change irreversibly after World War II.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Connelly, William, \u201cNora Lavrin.
