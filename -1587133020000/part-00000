Its primary role is in support of contingency operations and vanguard brigades requiring tactical helicopter resources.\n\nNo. 408 Squadron's mandate also includes supporting [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations]] and [[NATO peacekeeping]] operations, land force training, and support to other government departments. For example, 408 Squadron's eight Griffons were assigned to support the Canadian contingent in the [[Balkan]]s in 1999. Their job was to ferry small teams of paratroopers, infantrymen, and tankers to certain areas to check out water reservoirs, power grids, suspected weapons caches, minefields, and mass grave sites.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:RCAF Lancaster Mk II RAF Linton-on-Ouse WWII HU 56276.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Bombing up a 408 Squadron [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster Mk II]] at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]], England</center>]]\nNo. 408 Squadron's history dates back to 24 June 1941, when [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s directive called for the formation of 408 Squadron as part of [[No. 5 Group RAF]].  It was to be the second [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) [[bomber]] squadron formed overseas. Goose Squadron, as it was to become known, was initially based at [[RAF Lindholme]] in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], and equipped with [[Handley Page Hampden]]s. During the war, the Goose Squadron converted aircraft several times. No 408 would change from Hampden aircraft to the [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]], and then to the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] in August 1943 after moving to [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]] and becoming part of [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 Group]].\n\nIt flew 4,610 sorties and dropped 11,340 tons of bombs. A total of 170 aircraft were lost and 933 personnel were killed, listed as missing in action (MIA) or prisoners of war (POW). Squadron members won two hundred decorations, and 11 battle honours for its wartime operations<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.forfreedom.ca/?page_id=6|title=WWII \u2013 408 \"Goose\" Squadron Association|website=www.forfreedom.ca|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\nOn 5 September 1945 No 408 Squadron was officially disbanded.\n\nOn 10 January 1949,  Goose Squadron was reformed at [[RCAF Station Rockcliffe]], Ontario. Equipped with eight [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster Mark X]] photographic aircraft, it was tasked with the mapping of Canada, specifically the far North. In 1962, the squadron formed a flight of [[Canadair CT-133 Silver Star]] aircraft and given the additional task of photo reconnaissance missions in support of Army exercises.\n\nOn February 29, 1964, the Lancaster aircraft were retired and replaced with [[Douglas DC-3|Dakotas]]. The Goose Squadron was moved to [[Rivers, Manitoba]], and re-designated as a transport support and area reconnaissance squadron.\n\nOn May 1, 1964, RCAF Station Rivers Transport Support Flight with its [[C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Boxcars]] was transferred into 408 Squadron. In 1965, the Boxcars were replaced by CC-130 Hercules aircraft. As the decade drew to a close, 408 Squadron was once again redesignated. On October 1, 1968, it started its long history with 10 Tactical Air Group as a \"Tactical Fighter Squadron\".\n\nDuring this post-war era, the squadron flew seven different aircraft: the Lancaster, [[PBY Catalina|Cansos]], [[Noorduyn Norseman|Norseman]], Dakotas, Boxcars, T-33s, and [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules]] aircraft. Late in 1970, the squadron was once more disbanded.\n\nOn January 1, 1971, 408 Squadron was once again re-activated at [[CFB Edmonton|Namao]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], as a tactical helicopter squadron (THS) and equipped with CH-135 Twin Huey and CH-136 [[OH-58 Kiowa|Kiowa]] helicopters.\n\nIts primary tasking is to provide tactical aviation to the army. The mission includes air mobile assault, [[MEDEVAC|air ambulance]], air observation, reconnaissance insertions, troop movement, airborne command and control platform and dropping [[paratrooper]]s. In September 1996, the squadron was re-equipped with CH-146 Griffon helicopters.\n\nPersonnel from 408 Squadron deployed to Afghanistan nearly continually from 2006 until 2011. Initially forming a Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) detachment using the [[SAGEM Sperwer|CU-161 Sperwer]]. From 2008, 408 members were deployed to Kandahar airfield operating the [[Bell CH-146 Griffon|CH-146 Griffon]] and [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-147D]] helicopters as part of the Joint Task Force Afghanistan Air Wing. The primary role of the JTF-A Air Wing was to provide transportation, reconnaissance, armed escort, and fire support to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/squadron/408-squadron.page|title=408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron {{!}} Royal Canadian Air Force|last=Government of Canada|first=National Defence|date=2013-02-25|website=www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nFile:408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.jpg|408 Squadron hangar exterior, 2011\nFile:CH-135139TwinHuey01A.JPG|[[UH-1N Twin Huey|Bell CH-135 Twin Huey]] serving with 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron on Exercise RV85 during 1985\nFile:408SqnFieldRV83.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Headquarters on Exercise RV83, Camp Wainwright, 1983\nFile:BellCH136Kiowa01.JPG|[[OH-58 Kiowa|Bell CH-136 Kiowa]] of 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Camp Wainwright 1984\nFile:Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colour at the Alberta Aviation Museum.JPG|Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colours at the Alberta Aviation Museum\n</gallery>\n\n==Badges==\n<gallery>\nImage:408SqnCrest.JPG| 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron official badge c. 1985\nImage:408SqnBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial badge from c. 1950\u201385\nImage:408SqnAnniversary.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial 40th anniversary badge worn 1981\u201383\nImage:408LOHFltBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron LOH Flight badge worn by [[OH-58 Kiowa|CH-136 Kiowa]] crews c. 1990.

It is co-located with [[1 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] at [[CFB Edmonton|Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Edmonton]].\n\nEquipped with 16 [[CH-146 Griffon]] helicopters, it rotates a high combat-readiness level with [[400 Squadron]] ([[CFB Borden]], [[Ontario]]) and [[430 Squadron]] ([[CFB Valcartier]], [[Quebec]]). Its primary role is in support of contingency operations and vanguard brigades requiring tactical helicopter resources.\n\nNo. 408 Squadron's mandate also includes supporting [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations]] and [[NATO peacekeeping]] operations, land force training, and support to other government departments. For example, 408 Squadron's eight Griffons were assigned to support the Canadian contingent in the [[Balkan]]s in 1999. Their job was to ferry small teams of paratroopers, infantrymen, and tankers to certain areas to check out water reservoirs, power grids, suspected weapons caches, minefields, and mass grave sites.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:RCAF Lancaster Mk II RAF Linton-on-Ouse WWII HU 56276.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Bombing up a 408 Squadron [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster Mk II]] at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]], England</center>]]\nNo. 408 Squadron's history dates back to 24 June 1941, when [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s directive called for the formation of 408 Squadron as part of [[No. 5 Group RAF]].  It was to be the second [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) [[bomber]] squadron formed overseas. Goose Squadron, as it was to become known, was initially based at [[RAF Lindholme]] in [[Yorkshire]], [[England]], and equipped with [[Handley Page Hampden]]s. During the war, the Goose Squadron converted aircraft several times. No 408 would change from Hampden aircraft to the [[Handley Page Halifax|Halifax]], and then to the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]] in August 1943 after moving to [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]] and becoming part of [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 Group]].\n\nIt flew 4,610 sorties and dropped 11,340 tons of bombs. A total of 170 aircraft were lost and 933 personnel were killed, listed as missing in action (MIA) or prisoners of war (POW). Squadron members won two hundred decorations, and 11 battle honours for its wartime operations.\n\nOn 5 September 1945 No 408 Squadron was officially disbanded.\n\nOn 10 January 1949,  Goose Squadron was reformed at [[RCAF Station Rockcliffe]], Ontario. Equipped with eight [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster Mark X]] photographic aircraft, it was tasked with the mapping of Canada, specifically the far North. In 1962, the squadron formed a flight of [[Canadair CT-133 Silver Star]] aircraft and given the additional task of photo reconnaissance missions in support of Army exercises.\n\nOn February 29, 1964, the Lancaster aircraft were retired and replaced with [[Douglas DC-3|Dakotas]]. The Goose Squadron was moved to [[Rivers, Manitoba]], and re-designated as a transport support and area reconnaissance squadron.\n\nOn May 1, 1964, RCAF Station Rivers Transport Support Flight with its [[C-119 Flying Boxcar|C-119 Boxcars]] was transferred into 408 Squadron. In 1965, the Boxcars were replaced by CC-130 Hercules aircraft. As the decade drew to a close, 408 Squadron was once again redesignated. On October 1, 1968, it started its long history with 10 Tactical Air Group as a \"Tactical Fighter Squadron\".\n\nDuring this post-war era, the squadron flew seven different aircraft: the Lancaster, [[PBY Catalina|Cansos]], [[Noorduyn Norseman|Norseman]], Dakotas, Boxcars, T-33s, and [[C-130 Hercules|Hercules]] aircraft. Late in 1970, the squadron was once more disbanded.\n\nOn January 1, 1971, 408 Squadron was once again re-activated at [[CFB Edmonton|Namao]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], as a tactical helicopter squadron (THS) and equipped with CH-135 Twin Huey and CH-136 [[OH-58 Kiowa|Kiowa]] helicopters.\n\nIts primary tasking is to provide tactical aviation to the army. The mission includes air mobile assault, [[MEDEVAC|air ambulance]], air observation, reconnaissance insertions, troop movement, airborne command and control platform and dropping [[paratrooper]]s. In September 1996, the squadron was re-equipped with CH-146 Griffon helicopters.\n\n==Images==\n<gallery>\nFile:408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.jpg|408 Squadron hangar exterior, 2011\nFile:CH-135139TwinHuey01A.JPG|[[UH-1N Twin Huey|Bell CH-135 Twin Huey]] serving with 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron on Exercise RV85 during 1985\nFile:408SqnFieldRV83.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Headquarters on Exercise RV83, Camp Wainwright, 1983\nFile:BellCH136Kiowa01.JPG|[[OH-58 Kiowa|Bell CH-136 Kiowa]] of 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron Camp Wainwright 1984\nFile:Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colour at the Alberta Aviation Museum.JPG|Canadair CT-133 Silver Star, older RCAF colours at the Alberta Aviation Museum\n</gallery>\n\n==Badges==\n<gallery>\nImage:408SqnCrest.JPG| 408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron official badge c. 1985\nImage:408SqnBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial badge from c. 1950\u201385\nImage:408SqnAnniversary.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron unofficial 40th anniversary badge worn 1981\u201383\nImage:408LOHFltBadge.JPG|408 Tactical Helicopter Squadron LOH Flight badge worn by [[OH-58 Kiowa|CH-136 Kiowa]] crews c. 1990.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded. Bandi\u0107 played a role in the crisis by becoming a city councilman in 1995 and the leader of the Zagreb SDP in 1997.<ref name=javno_biografija>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/hr/hrvatska/clanak.php?id=49365\n |title       = Biografija: Milan Bandi\u0107\n |date        = 2007-06-02\n |accessdate  = 2008-08-01\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |language    = Croatian\n |url-status  = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://www.webcitation.org/68EJ2pyfI?url=http://dalje.com/hr-hrvatska/biografija--milan-bandic/49365\n |archivedate = 2012-06-06\n}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first campaign his [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] background became an issue, as the [[Croatian Peasant Party]] (HSS) suggested that only a native citizen of Zagreb could become the city's mayor. HSS also launched a propaganda campaign against [[Herzegovinians]] in an effort to undermine Bandi\u0107's campaign. The party hoped that the majority of Zagreb voters would turn away from Bandi\u0107. Those expectations were not fulfilled and Bandi\u0107 later used his Herzegovinian background as an advantage, broadening his support among the ordinary citizens of Zagreb.\n\nThe HDZ under Bandi\u0107 eventually lost power in the Croatian capital in 2000.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\n==={{anchor|First and second term (2000\u20132002)}}First and second terms (2000\u20132002)===\n{{see also|2000 Zagreb local elections|2001 Zagreb local elections}}\n\nBandi\u0107 was elected [[mayor]] of Zagreb in 2000<ref name=izbori>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | title = Izbori odr\u017eani 7. svibnja 2000.\n | work = Gradski zavod za automatsku obradu podataka\n | accessdate = 2008-07-27\n | language = Croatian\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100129103926/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2000Lokalni/izbori_2000_.html\n | archive-date = 2010-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n}}</ref> and re-elected in the city election in 2001.<ref name=izbori_2001>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| title = Izbori odr\u017eani 20. svibnja 2001.\n| work = City Bureau for Automatic Data Processing\n| accessdate = 2008-08-04\n| language = Croatian\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080316190322/http://www.zgizbori.hr/2001Lokalni/rezultati.html\n| archive-date = 2008-03-16\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref> His rise in influence among SDP politicians and on the Zagreb political scene created a backlash by the [[Croatian People's Party]] (HNS), the other left-of-center party led by [[Vesna Pusi\u0107]], who did not trust his nationalist populism and his occasional run-ins with the courts. The HNS campaigned against the SDP in the 2000 elections. However, the HNS entered into a coalition with the SDP in 2001.

Afterwards, he claimed he had simply spoken to the journalist in a loud voice.<ref name=threatened_journalist />\n\nAs of October 2007 Bandi\u0107 was under investigation by the [[USKOK]] (Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organized Crime) about several deals he made as mayor of Zagreb, including the July 2007 exchange of a lot at the intersection of Maksimirska Street and [[Gojko \u0160u\u0161ak Avenue|\u0160u\u0161ak Avenue]] for a lot in [[Sesvetski Kraljevec]]. A court-appointed expert allowed the exchange at a price of 1,300 kuna per square meter (\u20ac185) for the Sesvete lot (located in the suburbs, outside the [[Zagreb bypass]]) and 2,300 kuna (\u20ac321) for the Maksimirska lot (located in the [[Maksimir]] district, several hundred meters from downtown). New experts considered the lot on Maksimirska Street to be more valuable than the lot in Sesvetski Kraljevec. Thus, a USKOK source testified that Bandi\u0107 made a deal damaging to the city budget.

He demonstrated organizational ability and populist political instincts. These abilities allowed the SDP to gain in Zagreb blue-collar neighborhoods and attract votes which the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) and its then-president [[Franjo Tu\u0111man]] had considered theirs by default. As such, he proved to be a valuable asset for the Social Democratic Party. In 1993 he became party secretary.<ref name=Barilar/>\n\nConflict between HDZ and SDP manifested in the [[1995 Croatian parliamentary election|1995 parliamentary]] and City of [[Zagreb]] elections, leading to the [[Zagreb Crisis]]: an electoral alliance (in which the SDP was a major partner) won a majority in the Zagreb elections and chose [[Goran Grani\u0107]] as the new mayor, but Franjo Tu\u0111man used a legal loophole to stop Grani\u0107 from taking office. Several subsequent elections were held, with the SDP winning each time and Tu\u0111man promptly removing every candidate. For a time Zagreb was a city without a mayor, which led to public unrest and protests in [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]. With the final 1997 election of the HDZ candidate [[Marina Matulovi\u0107-Dropuli\u0107]] as the mayor of Zagreb, the crisis faded.

The two companies with whom Bandi\u0107 dealt were headed by inexperienced students, furthering the appearance of impropriety.<ref name=bandic_index_uskok>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |title       = Bandi\u0107 Under Investigation For Corruption\n |accessdate  = 2008-09-28\n |date        = 2007-10-03\n |work        = Javno.hr\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071004041519/http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=86401\n |archivedate = 2007-10-04\n}}</ref><ref name=uskok>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak.aspx?id=360440\n| title = Bandi\u0107 o istrazi USKOK-a: Neka institucije rade svoj posao\n| accessdate = 2008-02-16\n| date = 2007-10-03\n| work = Vijesti.net\n| language = Croatian\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Cvjetni prolaz'' case===\nBandi\u0107 was involved in the ''Cvjetni prolaz'' case (a lengthy affair beginning in 2007), which centered on the controversial demolition and conversion of historical buildings in Petar Preradovi\u0107 Square into a [[shopping mall]] in Zagreb's [[Donji grad (Zagreb)|Lower Town]] area.<ref name=cg_intro_nac>{{cite web |url=http://www.nacional.hr/articles/view/30633/5/ |title=Preobra\u017eenska 6 i kino Zagreb nisu spomenici |accessdate=2008-05-16 |date=2007-01-15 |work=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]] |last=Cviti\u0107 |first=Plamenko |language=Croatian |trans-title=Preobra\u017eenska 6 and Cinema Zagreb are no monuments |archivedate=30 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68og8jEQ3?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/30633/preobrazenska-6-i-kino-zagreb-nisu-spomenici |url-status=dead }}</ref> The project was headed by developer Tomislav Horvatin\u010di\u0107, who was alleged to have used illegal means in an attempt to [[evict]] the buildings' residents.

Bandi\u0107's statement was corroborated by several of his nearby colleagues; other journalists at the rear of the bus did not hear anything said by Bandi\u0107, due to noise inside the vehicle.
