However, the 1 euro coin was missing in this election, because [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]], the then economy minister, had already decided it would sport the ''[[Vitruvian man]]'' of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Leonardo's work is highly symbolical as it represents the [[Renaissance]] focus on man as the measure of all things, and has simultaneously a round shape that fits the coin perfectly. As Ciampi observed, this represents the \"coin to the service of Man\", instead of Man to the service of money.\n\n==Italian euro design==\nFor [[Euro coins#Depiction of euro coinage - Reverse

This gave him insight into the French defences that would prove crucial in the upcoming [[Franco-Prussian War]], in which he played a significant role. Later, as principal assistant to Field-Marshal [[Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], Chief of the Imperial General Staff, von Waldersee gained influence with the future Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], who promoted him Chief of Staff on his accession.\n\nWhen the Peking legation compound was besieged by the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer insurgents]] in 1900, von Waldersee was appointed as head of an 8-nation relief force. Although he arrived too late to take part in the fighting, he conducted punitive expeditions which succeeded in pacifying the Boxers.\n\n==Family==\nAlfred von Waldersee was the fifth of six children of the Prussian cavalry general Franz Heinrich Count von Waldersee (1791\u20131873) and Bertha von H\u00fcnerbein (1799\u20131859).  Franz Heinrich von Waldersee was the son of Franz Anton von Waldersee (1763\u20131823), an illegitimate son of [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau|Leopold III Friedrich Franz, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau]] (1740\u20131817) and of Johanne Eleonore Hoffmeier (1739\u20131816). Nevertheless, Franz Anton was raised and educated at the ducal court and in 1786 was created a ''[[Graf]]'', or Count.\n\nThe Waldersee family estate, Waterneverstorf, is located on the Baltic coast near [[Behrensdorf]] in the German federal state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].\n\n==Early years and beyond==\nWaldersee was born at [[Potsdam]] into a military and aristocratic family. After attending several cadet schools, in 1850 he was commissioned as a ''Leutnant'' into the Artillery Corps of the [[Prussian army]] and he soon attracted the favorable notice of his superiors.  In his first major campaign, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, he served as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to General of Artillery [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828-1885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], with whom he was present at [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. In the course of this campaign, Count Waldersee was promoted to major and assigned to the Prussian General Staff. Thereafter, he served on the staff of X Army Corps, a new formation in the conquered kingdom of [[Hanover]]. In January 1870, he became military attach\u00e9 at the [[Paris]] embassy of Prussia.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|wstitle=Waldersee, Alfred, Count|inline=y|volume=28|page=258}}</ref> At this post he was able to gather intelligence on troop strengths and other information on the French military that proved valuable in the campaigns to come.\n\nIn the [[Franco-Prussian War]], [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Count Waldersee, recognized for his military prowess and recent analysis of the adversary's armed forces, proved a most useful assistant to the \"supreme War-Lord.\" He was present at the great battles around [[Metz]], assigned to the staff of General [[Friedrich Franz II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]; and later in operations against [[Antoine Eug\u00e8ne Alfred Chanzy|Chanzy]]'s army on the [[Loire]]. The grand duke was a prominent soldier, but not a tactician of note, and the successful outcome of the western campaign was largely due to his adviser, Waldersee.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAt the end of the war, Waldersee received the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross, First Class]], and was entrusted with the difficult post of German representative at Paris, in which his tact and courtesy were marked. At the end of 1871, Waldersee took command of the 13th [[Uhlan]] Regiment at Hanover, and two years later became chief of staff of the Hanoverian army corps, in which he had served before 1870.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nOn 14 April 1874, he married [[Mary von Waldersee|Mary Esther Lee]] (1837\u20131914), third daughter of the wealthy [[New York City]] merchant David Lee and widow of Prince Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein. Mary had previously been created Princess of N\u00f6er by the Emperor of Austria. She became an advocate for the poor in Prussia and was honored for her compassion.<ref>Hutto, Richard Jay, ''Crowning Glory: American Wives of Princes and Dukes''.

With this appointment, Waldersee was already seen as the likely successor of the octogenarian field marshal. On several occasions Waldersee accompanied Prince Wilhelm, the future Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], on trips abroad to represent the prince's grandfather, Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]]. Out of these trips grew a tenuous teacher-student relationship, but Waldersee was seen by Wilhelm's liberal parents Crown Prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Friedrich Wilhelm]] and [[Victoria, Princess Royal]] as \"anti-Semitic, narrowly zealous in religion, and reactionary... the quartermaster general was the personification of everything Wilhelm's parents most detested.\"<ref>Clarke, Christopher.

Field Marshal Moltke finally retired in August 1888, and Waldersee's appointment to succeed him was a foregone conclusion:<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> the newly crowned 29-year-old Kaiser Wilhelm II gave his consent.\n\nWaldersee essentially followed the Moltke line until he ran headlong into the often unpredictable young emperor.  In 1890, at the autumn maneuvers ''[Kaiserman\u00f6ver]'' of the Imperial Army, Waldersee had the effrontery to soundly \"defeat\" the formations under control of the impetuous Wilhelm II. Waldersee thus lost the confidence of his sovereign and was relieved of his duties and reassigned to command [[IX Corps (German Empire)|IX Army Corps]] at [[Altona, Hamburg|Hamburg-Altona]], a clear demotion but still an assignment of importance. Waldersee, despite all that had happened, would establish his Hamburg residence near the Bismarck retirement estate at [[Friedrichsruh]].

This gave him insight into the French defences that would prove crucial in the upcoming [[Franco-Prussian War]], in which he played a significant role. Later, as principal assistant to Field-Marshal [[Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]], Chief of the Imperial General Staff, von Waldersee gained influence with the future Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], who promoted him Chief of Staff on his accession.\n\nWhen the Peking legation compound was besieged by the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer insurgents]] in 1900, von Waldersee was appointed as head of an 8-nation relief force. Although he arrived too late to take part in the fighting, he conducted punitive expeditions which succeeded in pacifying the Boxers.\n\n==Family==\nAlfred von Waldersee was the fifth of six children of the Prussian cavalry general Franz Heinrich Count von Waldersee (1791\u20131873) and Bertha von H\u00fcnerbein (1799\u20131859).  Franz Heinrich von Waldersee was the son of Franz Anton von Waldersee (1763\u20131823), an illegitimate son of [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau|Leopold III Friedrich Franz, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau]] (1740\u20131817) and of Johanne Eleonore Hoffmeier (1739\u20131816). Nevertheless, Franz Anton was raised and educated at the ducal court and in 1786 was created a ''[[Graf]]'', or Count.\n\nThe Waldersee family estate, Waterneverstorf, is located on the Baltic coast near [[Behrensdorf]] in the German federal state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]].\n\n==Early years and beyond==\nWaldersee was born at [[Potsdam]] into a military and aristocratic family. After attending several cadet schools, in 1850 he was commissioned as a ''Leutnant'' into the Artillery Corps of the [[Prussian army]] and he soon attracted the favorable notice of his superiors.  In his first major campaign, the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, he served as ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to General of Artillery [[Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1828-1885)|Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia]], with whom he was present at [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz]]. In the course of this campaign, Count Waldersee was promoted to major and assigned to the Prussian General Staff. Thereafter, he served on the staff of X Army Corps, a new formation in the conquered kingdom of [[Hanover]].

The grand duke was a prominent soldier, but not a tactician of note, and the successful outcome of the western campaign was largely due to his adviser, Waldersee.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAt the end of the war, Waldersee received the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross, First Class]], and was entrusted with the difficult post of German representative at Paris, in which his tact and courtesy were marked.

Waldersee, officially still second under Moltke, had been elevating the military attach\u00e9s at the Imperial embassies into \"a virtually independent diplomatic service\", often managing to bypass the Foreign Ministry.<ref name = Crankshaw/>{{rp|405}} After one such breach of protocol was detected at the Vienna embassy, Waldersee was subsequently \"hauled over the coals\" by Bismarck in person, to demonstrate to the military establishment who was in charge of foreign affairs.<ref name = Crankshaw/>{{rp|406}} In 1888, the Emperor Wilhelm I died and Frederich become Emperor Frederich III, but as the new emperor was already dying of throat cancer, Waldersee cancelled his plans for a ''putsch'', guessing correctly that Frederich would be dead soon enough and his friend, Wilhelm who was now Crown Prince, would soon be the Emperor. Field Marshal Moltke finally retired in August 1888, and Waldersee's appointment to succeed him was a foregone conclusion:<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> the newly crowned 29-year-old Kaiser Wilhelm II gave his consent.\n\nWaldersee essentially followed the Moltke line until he ran headlong into the often unpredictable young emperor.  In 1890, at the autumn maneuvers ''[Kaiserman\u00f6ver]'' of the Imperial Army, Waldersee had the effrontery to soundly \"defeat\" the formations under control of the impetuous Wilhelm II. Waldersee thus lost the confidence of his sovereign and was relieved of his duties and reassigned to command [[IX Corps (German Empire)|IX Army Corps]] at [[Altona, Hamburg|Hamburg-Altona]], a clear demotion but still an assignment of importance. Waldersee, despite all that had happened, would establish his Hamburg residence near the Bismarck retirement estate at [[Friedrichsruh]]. In 1898, he was appointed inspector-general of the Third Army at Hanover, the transfer orders being accompanied by eulogistic expressions of Wilhelm II's goodwill.\n\n==Expedition to China==\n[[File:GERMAN OFFICERS WELCOMING FIELD-MARSHAL COUNT VON WALDERSEEAT THE RAILWAY STATION, TIENTSIN.jpg|thumb|German Officers Welcoming Field-Marshal Count Von Waldersee At The Railway Station, Tientsin]]\n[[File:Waldersee.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Count Waldersee in China]]\nTwo thousand European and Chinese Christians were trapped in the legation compound at [[Peking]] by [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer insurgents]] in 1900.
