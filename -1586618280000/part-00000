[[Hong Kong]] became a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]] and continues to maintain governing and economic systems separate from those of [[mainland China]].\n\nThis event ended 156 years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. The territory was Britain's last substantial overseas possession. With a population of about 6.5 million in 1997, Hong Kong constituted 97% of the total population of all [[British Overseas Territories|British Dependent Territories]] at the time. The retrocession is considered by some to definitively mark the end of the [[British Empire]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Acquisition of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|250px|Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and the lease of the [[New Territories]] in 1898.]]\n\nBy the 1820s and 1830s, the British had conquered parts of India and had intentions of growing cotton in these lands to offset the amount of cotton they were buying from America. When this endeavour failed, the British realised they could grow poppies at an incredible rate. These poppies could then be turned into opium, which the Chinese highly desired, but their laws prohibited. So the British plan was grow poppies in India, convert it into opium, smuggle the opium in China and trade it for tea, and sell the tea back in Britain. The illegal opium trade was highly successful, and the drug was very profitably smuggled into China in extremely large volumes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Chinese Opium Wars|last=Beeching|first=Jack|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1975|isbn=|location=New York|pages=74}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom obtained control over portions of Hong Kong's territory through three treaties concluded with [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] after the [[Opium Wars]]:\n\n* 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]]: [[Hong Kong Island]] ceded in perpetuity\n* 1860 [[Convention of Peking]]: [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and [[Stonecutter's Island]] additionally ceded\n* 1898 [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]]: the [[New Territories]] and [[Outlying Islands, Hong Kong|outlying islands]] leased for 99 years until 1997\n\nDespite the finite nature of the New Territories lease, this portion of the colony was developed just as rapidly as, and became highly integrated with, the rest of Hong Kong. As the end of the lease approached, and by the time of serious negotiations over the future status of Hong Kong in the 1980s, it was thought impractical to separate the ceded territories and return only the New Territories to China. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, large-scale [[infrastructures|infrastructure]] investments had been made in the New Territories, with break-evens lying well past 30 June 1997.<ref name=\"Akers-Jones\" />\n\nWhen the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758]] in 1971, it began to act diplomatically on its previously lost sovereignty over both Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. In March 1972, the Chinese UN representative, [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]], wrote to the United Nations Decolonization Committee to state the position of the Chinese government:\n\n:\"The questions of Hong Kong and Macau belong to the category of questions resulting from the series of unequal treaties which the imperialists imposed on China. Hong Kong and Macau are part of Chinese territory occupied by the British and Portuguese authorities. The settlement of the questions of Hong Kong and Macau is entirely within China's sovereign right and do not at all fall under the ordinary category of colonial territories. Consequently they should not be included in the list of colonial territories covered by the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial territories and people.

Thatcher later said that Deng told her bluntly that China could easily take Hong Kong by force, stating that \"I could walk in and take the whole lot this afternoon\", to which she replied that \"there is nothing I could do to stop you, but the eyes of the world would now know what China is like\".<ref>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article67028.ece China plotted Hong Kong invasion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408004455/http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/article67028.ece |date=8 April 2016 }}, Michael Sheridan, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 25 June 2007</ref>\n\nAfter her visit with Deng in Beijing, Thatcher was received in Hong Kong as the first British Prime Minister to set foot on the territory whilst in office. At a press conference, Thatcher re-emphasised the validity of the three treaties, asserting the need for countries to respect treaties on universal terms: \"There are three treaties in existence; we stick by our treaties unless we decide on something else. At the moment, we stick by our treaties.\"<ref name=\"Cottrell\" />\n\nAt the same time, at the 5th session of the 5th [[National People's Congress]], the constitution was amended to include a new Article 31 which stated that the country might establish [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] (SARs) when necessary.<ref>[http://english.gov.cn/archive/laws_regulations/2014/08/23/content_281474982987458.htm Constitution of the People's Republic of China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416110047/http://english.gov.cn/archive/laws_regulations/2014/08/23/content_281474982987458.htm |date=16 April 2016 }}, State Council of the People's Republic of China</ref>\n\nThe additional Article would hold tremendous significance in settling the question of Hong Kong and later [[Macau]], putting into social consciousness the concept of \"[[One country, two systems]]\". The concept would prove useful to deploy until the territories were secured and conditions were ripe for its gradual revision.\n\n===Negotiations begin===\nA few months after Thatcher's visit to Beijing, the PRC government had yet to open negotiations with the British government regarding the sovereignty of Hong Kong.\n\nShortly before the initiation of sovereignty talks, Governor Youde declared his intention to represent the population of Hong Kong at the negotiations. This statement sparked a strong response from the PRC, prompting Deng Xiaoping to denounce talk of \"the so-called 'three-legged stool'\", which implied that Hong Kong was a party to talks on its future, alongside Beijing and London.<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/article/453465/benefits-three-legged-stool Benefits of a three-legged stool] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427121205/http://www.scmp.com/article/453465/benefits-three-legged-stool |date=27 April 2016 }}, ''[[South China Morning Post]]'', 26 April 2004</ref>\n\nAt the preliminary stage of the talks, the British government proposed an exchange of sovereignty for administration and the implementation of a British administration post-handover.<ref name=\"Cottrell\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090809225312/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/how-mrs-thatcher-lost-hong-kong-ten-years-ago-fired-up-by-her-triumph-in-the-falklands-war-margaret-thatcher-flew-to-peking-for-a-lastditch-attempt-to-keep-hong-kong-under-british-rule--only-to-meet-her-match-in-deng-xiaoping-two-years-later-she-signed-the-agreement-handing-the-territory-to-china-1543375.html How Mrs Thatcher lost Hong Kong], ''[[The Independent]]'', Robert Cottrell, 30 August 1992</ref>\n\nThe PRC government refused, contending that the notions of sovereignty and administration were inseparable, and although it recognised [[Macau]] as a \"Chinese territory under Portuguese administration\", this was only temporary.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ySvxAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA175 ''China Perspectives''], Issues 21\u201326, C.E.F.C., 1999, page 13</ref>\n\nIn fact, during informal exchanges between 1979 and 1981, the PRC had proposed a \"Macau solution\" in Hong Kong, under which it would remain under British administration at China's discretion.<ref name=\"Pepper\" />\n\nHowever, this had previously been rejected following the [[Hong Kong 1967 Leftist riots|1967 Leftist riots]], with the then Governor, [[David Trench]], claiming the leftists' aim was to leave the UK without effective control, or \"to Macau us\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Gary Ka-wai Cheung|title=Hong Kong's Watershed: The 1967 Riots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0uStp3CUaqUC&pg=PA36|year=2009|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-089-7|page=37}}</ref>\n\nThe conflict that arose at that point of the negotiations ended the possibility of further negotiation.

Furthermore, and perhaps most significantly, she expressed Britain's concession on its position of a continued British presence in the form of an administration post-handover.\n\nTwo rounds of negotiations were held in October and November. On the sixth round of talks in November, Britain formally conceded its intentions of either maintaining a British administration in Hong Kong or seeking some form of co-administration with the PRC, and showed its sincerity in discussing PRC's proposal on the 1997 issue.

The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.\n\nIn the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including [[Hong Kong Island]], Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People's Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong.\n\nIn accordance with the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would have left Hong Kong unchanged until 2047.\n\nThe Joint Declaration provided that these basic policies should be stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the [[Great Hall of the People]]. The [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]] at first proposed a list of 60\u201380 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101.\n\nThe list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] and [[Standard Chartered Bank]], prominent businessmen such as [[Li Ka-shing]], [[Pao Yue-kong]] and [[Fok Ying-tung]], and also [[Martin Lee]] Chu-ming and [[Szeto Wah]].\n\n===Universal suffrage===\n\nThe Hong Kong Basic Law ensured, among other things, that Hong Kong will retain its [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative system]], and people's rights and freedom for fifty years, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region (SAR) of China]]. The [[Government of China|central government in Beijing]] maintains control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law. The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue, after the fact,  that the territory has yet to achieve [[universal suffrage]] as promised by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], leading to [[Umbrella Revolution|mass demonstrations in 2014]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/> In 2019, demonstrations that started as a protest [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|against an extradition law]] also led to massive demonstrations (1.7 million on 11 and 18 August 2019), again demanding universal suffrage, but also the resignation of Carrie Lam (the current Chief Executive).<ref name=\"BBC19aug2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49340717|title=Hong Kong: Timeline of extradition protests |quote=What started as demonstrations against an extradition bill have since taken on a much wider scope and are now demanding full democratic rights for Hong Kongers.|work=[[BBC News]] |date=4 September 2019 |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Drafting of Basic Law==\n{{Main|Basic Law of Hong Kong}}\n\nThe [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] was drafted by a [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee|Drafting Committee]] composed of members from both Hong Kong and [[China|Mainland China]]. A [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee|Basic Law Consultative Committee]] formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts.\n\nThe first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989.\n\nThe Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the [[National People's Congress|NPC]], together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests]], after voicing views supporting the student protesters.\n\nThe Basic Law was said to be a mini-[[constitution]] drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sub-group adopted the political model put forward by [[Louis Cha]]. This \"mainstream\" proposal was criticised for being too conservative.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAccording to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] and the National People's Congress, respectively.

[2002] (2002). Discovering Hong Hong's Cultural Heritage. Central, Hong Kong: Oxford University Press. ISBN Volume One 0-19-592723-0</ref> After the ceding of [[Hong Kong Island]] to Britain in 1842 ([[Treaty of Nanjing]]), [[Manchu]] [[Qing]] Dynasty authorities of China felt it necessary for them to establish a military and administrative post to rule the area and to check further British influence in the area.\n\nThe 1898 Convention which handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the [[New Territories]]) to Britain for 99 years excluded the Walled City, with a population of roughly 700. It stated that China could continue to keep troops there, so long as they did not interfere with Britain's temporary rule.\n\nBritain quickly went back on this unofficial part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership squarely up in the air. The outpost consisted of a [[yamen]], as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.\n\nThe [[enclave]] remained part of Chinese territory despite the turbulent events of the early 20th century that saw the fall of the Qing government, the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] and later, a [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese government]] (PRC).\n\nSquatters began to occupy the Walled City, resisting several attempts by Britain in 1948 to drive them out. The Walled City became a haven for criminals and drug addicts, as the [[Hong Kong Police]] had no right to enter the City and China refused maintainability. The 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China added thousands of refugees to the population, many from [[Guangdong]]; by this time, Britain had had enough, and simply adopted a \"hands-off\" policy.\n\nA murder that occurred in Kowloon Walled City in 1959 set off a small diplomatic crisis, as the two nations each tried to get the other to accept responsibility for a vast tract of land now virtually ruled by anti-[[Qing dynasty|Manchurian]] [[Triad society|Triads]].\n\nAfter the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration|Joint Declaration in 1984]], the PRC allowed British authorities to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants.

In 1997 the colony had a population of approximately 6.5 million, which represented roughly 97% of the population of the British Dependent Territories as a whole at that time (the next largest, [[Bermuda]], having a 1997 population of approximately only 62,000).  With a [[gross domestic product]] of approximately US$180 billion in the last year of British rule,<ref>{{cite web |title=Hong Kong SAR, China  |url=https://data.worldbank.org/country/hong-kong-sar-china?view=chart |website=World Bank |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref> Hong Kong's economy was roughly 11% the size of Britain's.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Kingdom |url=https://data.worldbank.org/country/united-kingdom |website=World Bank |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>  Therefore, although the economies of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Economy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] were measured separately, the Handover did mean the British economy in its very broadest sense became substantially smaller (by comparison, the acquisition of Hong Kong boosted the size of the [[Economy of the People's Republic of China|Chinese economy]], which was then smaller than the United Kingdom's, by 18.4%).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bland and Pong |first1=Ben and Jane |title=Hong Kong since the handover in charts |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7e2422b8-5bb1-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b |accessdate=21 September 2018 |work=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref> As a comparator to Hong Kong, in 2017 Bermuda (as with population, the economically largest of Britain's remaining territories) had a GDP of only US$4.7 billion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product \u2013 2017 highlights |url=https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/GDP%202017%20annual%20publication.pdf |publisher=Government of Bermuda, Department of Statistics |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cession of Hong Kong meant that Britain's remaining territories (excepting the United Kingdom itself) henceforth consisted either of uninhabited lands (for instance the [[British Antarctic Territory]]), small islands or micro land masses (such as [[Montserrat]]), territories used as military bases (for example [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] on the island of [[Cyprus]], itself a former [[crown colony]] granted independence in 1960), or a combination of the latter two (like [[Gibraltar]]). And while many of Britain's remaining territories are significant to the global economy by virtue of being [[offshore financial centre]]s (Bermuda, the [[British Virgin Islands]], and the [[Cayman Islands]] being the most prominent of these), their economies are insubstantial.  Demographically, they are also tiny compared to Britain, with a collective population of less than 0.4% of Britain's 2017 population of 66 millions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population estimates |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref> As of 2018 the combined population of Britain's remaining fourteen Overseas Territories is only approximately 250,000, which is less than all but three [[districts of Hong Kong]], and roughly equal to that of the [[City of Westminster]]\n\nConsequently, because ceding Hong Kong came at the end of half a century of decolonisation, and because the handover meant that the United Kingdom became without significant overseas territories, [[dominions]], or [[colonies]] for the first time in its history ([[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], having been bequeathed the incipient domains of its later empire by inheriting the [[English overseas possessions|colonial possessions]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] upon the passing of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], always having been an imperial power, [[ab initio]]) the handover of Hong Kong to China is regarded by some as marking the conclusion of the [[British Empire]], with 1 July 1997 being its end date and the handover ceremony being its last diplomatic act.\n\n==In popular culture==\nScholars have begun to study the complexities of the transfer as shown in the popular media, such as films, television and video and online games.  For example, Hong Kong director [[Fruit Chan]] made a sci-fi thriller ''[[The Midnight After]]'' (2014) that stressed the sense of loss and alienation represented by survivors in an apocalyptic Hong Kong. Chan infuses a political agenda in the film by playing on Hong Kongers' collective anxiety towards communist China.<ref>Chia-rong Wu, \"Hong Kong Identity in Question: Fruit Chan's Uncanny Narrative and (Post-)97 Complex.\" ''American Journal of Chinese Studies'' (April 2017), Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 43\u201356.</ref>  Yiman Wang has argued that America has viewed China through the prisms of films from Shanghai and Hong Kong, with a recent emphasis on futuristic disaster films set in Hong Kong after the transfer goes awry.<ref>Yiman Wang, ''Remaking Chinese Cinema: Through the Prism of

[[Hong Kong]] became a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region]] and continues to maintain governing and economic systems separate from those of [[mainland China]].\n\nThis event ended 156 years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. The territory was Britain's last substantial overseas possession. With a population of about 6.5 million in 1997, Hong Kong constituted 97% of the total population of all [[British Overseas Territories|British Dependent Territories]] at the time. The retrocession is considered by some to definitively mark the end of the [[British Empire]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Acquisition of Hong Kong.svg|thumb|250px|Britain acquired [[Hong Kong Island]] in 1842, the [[Kowloon Peninsula]] in 1860, and the lease of the [[New Territories]] in 1898.]]\n\nBy the 1820s and 1830s, the British had conquered parts of India and had intentions of growing cotton in these lands to offset the amount of cotton they were buying from America. When this endeavour failed, the British realised they could grow poppies at an incredible rate. These poppies could then be turned into opium, which the Chinese highly desired, but their laws prohibited. So the British plan was grow poppies in India, convert it into opium, smuggle the opium in China and trade it for tea, and sell the tea back in Britain. The illegal opium trade was highly successful, and the drug was very profitably smuggled into China in extremely large volumes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Chinese Opium Wars|last=Beeching|first=Jack|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1975|isbn=|location=New York|pages=74}}</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom obtained control over portions of Hong Kong's territory through three treaties concluded with [[Qing dynasty|Qing China]] after the [[Opium Wars]]:\n\n* 1842 [[Treaty of Nanking]]: [[Hong Kong Island]] ceded in perpetuity\n* 1860 [[Convention of Peking]]: [[Kowloon Peninsula]] and [[Stonecutter's Island]] additionally ceded\n* 1898 [[Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory]]: the [[New Territories]] and [[Outlying Islands, Hong Kong|outlying islands]] leased for 99 years until 1997\n\nDespite the finite nature of the New Territories lease, this portion of the colony was developed just as rapidly as, and became highly integrated with, the rest of Hong Kong. As the end of the lease approached, and by the time of serious negotiations over the future status of Hong Kong in the 1980s, it was thought impractical to separate the ceded territories and return only the New Territories to China. In addition, with the scarcity of land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, large-scale [[infrastructures|infrastructure]] investments had been made in the New Territories, with break-evens lying well past 30 June 1997.<ref name=\"Akers-Jones\" />\n\nWhen the People's Republic of China obtained its seat in the United Nations as a result of the [[UN General Assembly Resolution 2758]] in 1971, it began to act diplomatically on its previously lost sovereignty over both Hong Kong and [[Macau]]. In March 1972, the Chinese UN representative, [[Huang Hua (politician)|Huang Hua]], wrote to the United Nations Decolonization Committee to state the position of the Chinese government:\n\n:\"The questions of Hong Kong and Macau belong to the category of questions resulting from the series of unequal treaties which the imperialists imposed on China. Hong Kong and Macau are part of Chinese territory occupied by the British and Portuguese authorities. The settlement of the questions of Hong Kong and Macau is entirely within China's sovereign right and do not at all fall under the ordinary category of colonial territories. Consequently they should not be included in the list of colonial territories covered by the declaration on the granting of independence to colonial territories and people.

The Declaration entered into force with the exchange of instruments of ratification on 27 May 1985 and was registered by the People's Republic of China and United Kingdom governments at the United Nations on 12 June 1985.\n\nIn the Joint Declaration, the People's Republic of China Government stated that it had decided to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong (including [[Hong Kong Island]], Kowloon, and the New Territories) with effect from 1 July 1997 and the United Kingdom Government declared that it would restore Hong Kong to the PRC with effect from 1 July 1997. In the document, the People's Republic of China Government also declared its basic policies regarding Hong Kong.\n\nIn accordance with the \"[[One country, two systems]]\" principle agreed between the United Kingdom and the People's Republic of China, the socialist system of the People's Republic of China would not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), and Hong Kong's previous capitalist system and its way of life would remain unchanged for a period of 50 years. This would have left Hong Kong unchanged until 2047.\n\nThe Joint Declaration provided that these basic policies should be stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]]. The ceremony of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration took place at 18:00, 19 December 1984 at the Western Main Chamber of the [[Great Hall of the People]]. The [[Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office]] at first proposed a list of 60\u201380 Hong Kong people to attend the ceremony. The number was finally extended to 101.\n\nThe list included Hong Kong government officials, members of the Legislative and Executive Councils, chairmen of the [[Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] and [[Standard Chartered Bank]], prominent businessmen such as [[Li Ka-shing]], [[Pao Yue-kong]] and [[Fok Ying-tung]], and also [[Martin Lee]] Chu-ming and [[Szeto Wah]].\n\n===Universal suffrage===\n\nThe Hong Kong Basic Law ensured, among other things, that Hong Kong will retain its [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative system]], and people's rights and freedom for fifty years, as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region (SAR) of China]]. The [[Government of China|central government in Beijing]] maintains control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law. The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue, after the fact,  that the territory has yet to achieve [[universal suffrage]] as promised by the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]], leading to [[Umbrella Revolution|mass demonstrations in 2014]].<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"auto2\"/> In 2019, demonstrations that started as a protest [[2019 Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests|against an extradition law]] also led to massive demonstrations (1.7 million on 11 August and 18 August 2019), again demanding universal suffrage, but also the resignation of Carrie Lam (the current Chief Executive).<ref name=\"BBC19aug2019\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49340717|title=Hong Kong: Timeline of extradition protests |quote=What started as demonstrations against an extradition bill have since taken on a much wider scope and are now demanding full democratic rights for Hong Kongers.|work=[[BBC News]] |date=4 September 2019 |access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Drafting of Basic Law==\n{{Main|Basic Law of Hong Kong}}\n\nThe [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]] was drafted by a [[Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee|Drafting Committee]] composed of members from both Hong Kong and [[China|Mainland China]]. A [[Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative Committee|Basic Law Consultative Committee]] formed purely by Hong Kong people was established in 1985 to canvas views in Hong Kong on the drafts.\n\nThe first draft was published in April 1988, followed by a five-month public consultation exercise. The second draft was published in February 1989, and the subsequent consultation period ended in October 1989.\n\nThe Basic Law was formally promulgated on 4 April 1990 by the [[National People's Congress|NPC]], together with the designs for the flag and emblem of the HKSAR. Some members of the Basic Law drafting committee were ousted by Beijing following [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests|4 June 1989 Tiananmen Square protests]], after voicing views supporting the student protesters.\n\nThe Basic Law was said to be a mini-[[constitution]] drafted with the participation of Hong Kong people. The political system had been the most controversial issue in the drafting of the Basic Law. The special issue sub-group adopted the political model put forward by [[Louis Cha]]. This \"mainstream\" proposal was criticised for being too conservative.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nAccording to Clauses 158 and 159 of the Basic Law, powers of interpretation and amendment of the Basic Law are vested in the [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] and the National People's Congress, respectively. Hong Kong's people have limited influence.\n\n==Tide of migration==\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], the [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Councillors]] and the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Councillors]] of Hong Kong unexpectedly held an urgent meeting, in which they agreed unanimously that the British Government should give the people of Hong Kong the [[Right of abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>[http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=103048&ctNode=2198&mp=9 A Rough Road ahead] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424062259/http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=103048&ctNode=2198&mp=9 |date=24 April 2016 }}, ''[[Taiwan Review]]'', 1 March 1990</ref>\n\nMore than 10,000 Hong Kong residents rushed to [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] in order to get an application form for residency in the United Kingdom.

[2002] (2002). Discovering Hong Hong's Cultural Heritage. Central, Hong Kong: Oxford University Press. ISBN Volume One 0-19-592723-0</ref> After the ceding of [[Hong Kong Island]] to Britain in 1842 ([[Treaty of Nanjing]]), [[Manchu]] [[Qing]] Dynasty authorities of China felt it necessary for them to establish a military and administrative post to rule the area and to check further British influence in the area.\n\nThe 1898 Convention which handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the [[New Territories]]) to Britain for 99 years excluded the Walled City, with a population of roughly 700. It stated that China could continue to keep troops there, so long as they did not interfere with Britain's temporary rule.\n\nBritain quickly went back on this unofficial part of the agreement, attacking Kowloon Walled City in 1899, only to find it deserted. They did nothing with it, or the outpost, and thus posed the question of Kowloon Walled City's ownership squarely up in the air. The outpost consisted of a [[yamen]], as well as buildings which grew into low-lying, densely packed neighbourhoods from the 1890s to 1940s.\n\nThe [[enclave]] remained part of Chinese territory despite the turbulent events of the early 20th century that saw the fall of the Qing government, the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]] and later, a [[People's Republic of China|Communist Chinese government]] (PRC).\n\nSquatters began to occupy the Walled City, resisting several attempts by Britain in 1948 to drive them out. The Walled City became a haven for criminals and drug addicts, as the [[Hong Kong Police]] had no right to enter the City and China refused maintainability. The 1949 foundation of the People's Republic of China added thousands of refugees to the population, many from [[Guangdong]]; by this time, Britain had had enough, and simply adopted a \"hands-off\" policy.\n\nA murder that occurred in Kowloon Walled City in 1959 set off a small diplomatic crisis, as the two nations each tried to get the other to accept responsibility for a vast tract of land now virtually ruled by anti-[[Qing dynasty|Manchurian]] [[Triad society|Triads]].\n\nAfter the [[Sino-British Joint Declaration|Joint Declaration in 1984]], the PRC allowed British authorities to demolish the City and resettle its inhabitants.

Although in statute law set down by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], British Hong Kong had no status of pre-eminence vis-a-vis the other [[British Dependent Territories]] (as they were then classified before the term British Overseas Territory was [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002|introduced in 2002]]), Hong Kong was by far the most populous and economically potent.  In 1997 the colony had a population of approximately 6.5 million, which represented roughly 97% of the population of the British Dependent Territories as a whole at that time (the next largest, [[Bermuda]], having a 1997 population of approximately only 62,000).  With a [[gross domestic product]] of approximately US$180 billion in the last year of British rule,<ref>{{cite web |title=Hong Kong SAR, China  |url=https://data.worldbank.org/country/hong-kong-sar-china?view=chart |website=World Bank |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref> Hong Kong's economy was roughly 11% the size of Britain's.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Kingdom |url=https://data.worldbank.org/country/united-kingdom |website=World Bank |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>  Therefore, although the economies of the [[Economy of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and [[Economy of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]] were measured separately, the Handover did mean the British economy in its very broadest sense became substantially smaller (by comparison, the acquisition of Hong Kong boosted the size of the [[Economy of the People's Republic of China|Chinese economy]], which was then smaller than the United Kingdom's, by 18.4%).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bland and Pong |first1=Ben and Jane |title=Hong Kong since the handover in charts |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7e2422b8-5bb1-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b |accessdate=21 September 2018 |agency=[[Financial Times]]}}</ref> As a comparator to Hong Kong, in 2017 Bermuda (as with population, the economically largest of Britain's remaining territories) had a GDP of only US$4.7 billion.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product \u2013 2017 highlights |url=https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/GDP%202017%20annual%20publication.pdf |publisher=Government of Bermuda, Department of Statistics |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cession of Hong Kong meant that Britain's remaining territories (excepting the United Kingdom itself) henceforth consisted either of uninhabited lands (for instance the [[British Antarctic Territory]]), small islands or micro land masses (such as [[Montserrat]]), territories used as military bases (for example [[Akrotiri and Dhekelia]] on the island of [[Cyprus]], itself a former [[crown colony]] granted independence in 1960), or a combination of the latter two (like [[Gibraltar]]). And while many of Britain's remaining territories are significant to the global economy by virtue of being [[offshore financial centre]]s (Bermuda, the [[British Virgin Islands]], and the [[Cayman Islands]] being the most prominent of these), their economies are insubstantial.  Demographically, they are also tiny compared to Britain, with a collective population of less than 0.4% of Britain's 2017 population of 66 millions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population estimates |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=21 December 2018}}</ref> As of 2018 the combined population of Britain's remaining fourteen Overseas Territories is only approximately 250,000, which is less than all but three [[districts of Hong Kong]], and roughly equal to that of the [[City of Westminster]]\n\nConsequently, because ceding Hong Kong came at the end of half a century of decolonisation, and because the handover meant that the United Kingdom became without significant overseas territories, [[dominions]], or [[colonies]] for the first time in its history ([[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], having been bequeathed the incipient domains of its later empire by inheriting the [[English overseas possessions|colonial possessions]] of the [[Kingdom of England]] upon the passing of the [[Acts of Union 1707]], always having been an imperial power, [[ab initio]]) the handover of Hong Kong to China is regarded by some as marking the conclusion of the [[British Empire]], with 1 July 1997 being its end date and the handover ceremony being its last diplomatic act.\n\n==In popular culture==\nScholars have begun to study the complexities of the transfer as shown in the popular media, such as films, television and video and online games.  For example, Hong Kong director [[Fruit Chan]] made a sci-fi thriller ''[[The Midnight After]]'' (2014) that stressed the sense of loss and alienation represented by survivors in an apocalyptic Hong Kong. Chan infuses a political agenda in the film by playing on Hong Kongers' collective anxiety towards communist China.<ref>Chia-rong Wu, \"Hong Kong Identity in Question: Fruit Chan's Uncanny Narrative and (Post-)97 Complex.\" ''American Journal of Chinese Studies'' (April 2017), Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 43\u201356.</ref>  Yiman Wang has argued that America has viewed China through the prisms of films from Shanghai and Hong Kong, with a recent emphasis on futuristic disaster films set in Hong Kong after the transfer goes awry.<ref>Yiman Wang, ''Remaking Chinese Cinema: Through the Prism of

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]].

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh. He organized a solo sculpture exhibition at the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Dhaka]] in 1987.\n\nKhan received his first major international recognition when he was invited by the Olympic Committee in Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1988 to install an open-air sculpture at the [[Seoul Olympic Park]]. The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university.

This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park. He created a sculpture, titled ''Muktijoddha'' for the [[Mymensingh Cantonment]] in 1999.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===From 2000 to present===\nKhan became a Professor at the Department of Sculpture, [[University of Dhaka]] in 2000. In 2001, he created a sculpture, composed of a group of freedom fighters, titled ''Bijoy Keton'' which was installed in the [[Dhaka Cantonment]].  In 2004, he created a sculpture titled ''Birds'', which was a delineation of birds in abstract forms, and was placed at the entrance of United Bhaban in [[Gulshan]], Dhaka. In the same year, the World Bank Bangladesh Country Office installed Khan\u2019s sculpture in the atrium of its office in Dhaka. The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka. The piece was titled ''Fish'', which depicts three fishes in spontaneous posture. The work remains as a popular artwork in public space in the busy neighborhood of Dhaka. Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]]. It has been installed in front of the [[Teacher-Student Centre, University of Dhaka|Teacher-Student Centre]] in 2007, and depicts a group of birds in different postures in abstract form. In 2011, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Bank]] to install a sculpture at the premises of Bangladesh Bank headquarters in [[Motijheel]]. The work was titled ''Unity''. It was a 32-feet stainless steel sculpture, featuring two hands in abstract form holding together a globe.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2010-12-05 |title=Time and Beyond |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-164736 |url-status= |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> \n\nKhan retired from the University of Dhaka in 2012.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976.

For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]].

Sajal is engaged to her cousin (Faraz) and Mohsin and Faraz's sister, Aliya is married to Nadia's brother, Fahad.\n  \nAina likes a boy named Imran (Asad Zaman Khan) who belongs to a very rich family. They both like each other and want to get married. However, Imran has a cousin named Annie who will do anything to marry him when she clearly knows that he likes Aina. Mohsin knew of Aina's affair and forbade Aina from university, since he was the eldest of all so nobody dare to disagree him. Eventually, Aina convinces her family to meet Imran's family. However, Imran's father wants him to marry Annie so that all the properties and money stays the same between the families. Imran's family manages to convince him that they are going to Aina's house for the proposal when in reality he is getting engaged to Annie. Realising that he has been fooled by his family, Imran tries to confront Aina's family but is sent away.\n\nThings take an interesting turn when Imran's father threatens to divorce his mother if he does agree to marry Annie. Aina and Imran decide to meet at a park and he tells her about the divorce and Aina leaves him. Aina brokenheartedly agreed on engagement with Noman (Arsalan Faisal). But deep inside she couldn't forget Imran and therefore she met Imran again and both of them decided to get marry secretly. Sajal and Faraz happily got married and started living a happy married life.

Aina manages to convince her fianc\u00e9 to delay the wedding because she wants to continue her studies when in reality she is also meeting Imran. Annie gets suspicious with Imran when he is always out the house. She then catches Aina and Imran red-handed. Annie told everything to Imran's father who abandoned him and Imran started living at his friend's place. Problems started arising among Imran and Aina when both of them started facing financial issues  imran started thinking that Aina is using him for granted. Later imran got pressurized from his father and he divorced aina. Soon aina found that she is pregnant. Soon Faraz discovered and reacted ao fiercely that Aina's mother had a heart attack and on her death bed she asked Faraz to take care of Aina and Sajal and not to tell about Aina to anyone. Aina's mother died. Her death was quite mysterious which provoked Mohsin and Nadia but Faraz started ignoring his brother and Nadia in order to hide Aina's pregnancy. Sajal after her mother's death turned out so cruel and venom-spewing sister to Aina. As Aina didn't want an abortion and therefore Faraz decided to end Aina's engagement with Noman and left for Islamabad along with his wife and Aina. This filled Mohsin with great rage and he abandoned Faraz, who decided that to deliver Aina's baby and pretend him as his and Sajal's. Unfortunately Sajal found her pregnant. Sajal blamed all the situation to Aina and Aina called Imran's mother to adopt his upcoming child as she can't keep him. Sajal had a miscarriage and followed barren life while Imran's mother told Imran about his child, who now is married to Annie. Meanwhile, Imran called Aina but a maid attended the call and told Imran that madam had a miscarriage. Imran assumed it for Aina and decided to forget Aina closing her chapter. Soon Aina gave birth to a baby boy whom Sajal quickly adopted and tried to keep Aina away from her son. Mohsin and Nadia were expecting twins now and Faraz decided to meet Mohsin and Nadia and to end this misunderstanding between them. Sajal and Faraz left for Karachi along with Maaz (Aina's son). Mohsin showed rude behaviour to Faraz who returned to Islamabad. Aina decided to overcome her problems and sorrows and to lead a normal life and started a job as a teacher.\n\nTheir lives were going well when suddenly Mohsin called upon Faraz to Karachi due to Nadia's bad health. Faraz decided to stay in Karachi now along with Sajal and Aina staying at Mohsin's place. Nadia died and gave birth to a daughter and a son. This left Mohsin with great sorrow who regret over his cruel and selfish behavior towards his late wife. Aina started taking care of mohsin's daughter but mohsin was the same man with great rage and ego towards everyone especially aina. Noman (aina's ex-fianc\u00e9) met aina and desired of marrying her, aina avoided noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested mohsin and sajal andboth of them wanted to get rid of aina convinced aina to marry noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to noman after knowing about aina's affair noman rejected aina. This filled mohsin and sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with sajal and maaz but kept this secret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by mohsin and sajal. Faraz's unending care for aina as a younger sister raised sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurted both faraz and aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became highly furious in the rain where she yelled at mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family.\n\nThis made Aina worried as she thought that her son maaz is going so far and how will she live with mohsin. On the other side mohsin became worried as well and requested faraz not to go and asked about aina over this faraz offered mohsin to marry aina for the sake of his children. This shocked mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that faraz would not leave for America. This left mohsin with shock as he wondered about aina's agreement over his proposal but mohsin disagreed over proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, imran and annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally annie met aina in a mall and told her that imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating  she is living a happy life as well without imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told imran sarcastically who fiercely asked annie to leave his home. On other side aina intensively asked mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to marry her. Imran managed to meet aina and asked for apology aina slapped imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Ayna \"Aani\" \n* [[Emmad Irfani]] as Mohsin  \n* [[Asad Zaman Khan]] as Imran\n* Shazia Naz as Sajal\n* Zain Mirza as Faraz \n* [[Hira Hussain]] as Annie \n* [[Maryam Nafees]] as Tabinda \"Taabi\" \n* [[Hina Altaf]] as Rania\n* Raeed Muhammed as Maaz\n* Zainab Jameel as Nadia (dead)\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Nayyara (dead)\n* [[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]] as Sohail (dead)\n* Umer Naru as Afaaq \n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Zainab\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Aliya\n* Agha Jararuddin as Aashir\n* Fouzia Mushtaq as Zubaida \n* Shahid as Noman  \n* Neema Alam\n* Zainab Fatima ([[child actor]]) as the young Tabinda \"Taabi\"\n* Rashida Tabassum\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Hum TV]]\n* [[2016 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n{{Television in Pakistan |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Pakistani English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2016}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kuch Na Kaho \n| image                    =\n| caption                  =\n| genre                    = \n* [[Drama]]\n*[[Telenovela]]\n* [[Family Drama]] \n* Romantic Drama\n| based_on                 = Sabz Ruton Ka Pehla Phool\n| writer                   = Rahat Jabeen \n| director                 = [[Ilyas Kashmiri]]\n| starring                 = [[Naveen Waqar]]<br/>[[Emmad Irfani]]<br/>[[Mariyam Nafees]]<br/>Huma Nawab<br/>Asad Zaman Khan<br/>[[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]]<br/>[[Ismat Zaidi]]<br/>[[Hira Hussain]]<br/>Zainab Jameel<br/>Shazia Naz<br/>[[Zainab Qayyum]]<br/>Umar Naru\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \"Kuch Na Kaho\" by Afshan Fawad\n| endtheme                 =   \n| composer                 = \n| country                  = Pakistan \n| language                 = [[Urdu]]\n| num_episodes             = 48 \n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = \n| producer                 = [[Momina Duraid]]\n| location                 =Karachi and Islamabad\n| cinematography           = \n| editor                   = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera setup]]\n| runtime                  =40 minutes  \n| company                  = [[MD Productions]] \n| distributor              = [[Hum TV]]\n| network                  = [[Hum TV]], [[Hum Network Limited]]\n| picture_format           = {{plainlist|\n* [[HDTV]] [[480i]]\n* [[720p]]\n}}\n| audio_format             = \n| first_run                = Pakistan  \n| first_aired              = {{Start date|df=yes|2016|10|31}}\n| last_aired               = {{End date|df=yes|2017|04|18}}\n| preceded_by =  ''[[Hatheli (TV series)|Hatheli]]'' [Moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays at 9:10pm]<br>''[[Deewana (TV series)|Deewana]]'' [Ended]\n| followed_by = ''[[Mohabbat Khawab Safar]]''\n| website                  = http://www.hum.tv\n| production_website       = \n}}\n\n'''''Kuch Na Kaho''''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''\u06a9\u0686\u06be \u0646\u06c1 \u06a9\u06c1\u0648'''}}}}; lit: ''Don't Say Anything'') is a [[Pakistani drama]] serial which is based on a novel named ''Sabz Ruton Ka Pehla Phool'' by Rahat Jabeen.

Aina manages to convince her fianc\u00e9 to delay the wedding because she wants to continue her studies when in reality she is also meeting Imran. Annie gets suspicious with Imran when he is always out the house. She then catches Aina and Imran red-handed. Annie told everything to Imran's father who abandoned him and Imran started living at his friend's place. Problems started arising among Imran and Aina when both of them started facing financial issues  imran started thinking that Aina is using him for granted. Later imran got pressurized from his father and he divorced aina. Soon aina found that she is pregnant. Soon Faraz discovered and reacted ao fiercely that Aina's mother had a heart attack and on her death bed she asked Faraz to take care of Aina and Sajal and not to tell about Aina to anyone. Aina's mother died. Her death was quite mysterious which provoked Mohsin and Nadia but Faraz started ignoring his brother and Nadia in order to hide Aina's pregnancy. Sajal after her mother's death turned out so cruel and venom-spewing sister to Aina. As Aina didn't want an abortion and therefore Faraz decided to end Aina's engagement with Noman and left for Islamabad along with his wife and Aina. This filled Mohsin with great rage and he abandoned Faraz, who decided that to deliver Aina's baby and pretend him as his and Sajal's. Unfortunately Sajal found her pregnant. Sajal blamed all the situation to Aina and Aina called Imran's mother to adopt his upcoming child as she can't keep him. Sajal had a miscarriage and followed barren life while Imran's mother told Imran about his child, who now is married to Annie. Meanwhile, Imran called Aina but a maid attended the call and told Imran that madam had a miscarriage. Imran assumed it for Aina and decided to forget Aina closing her chapter. Soon Aina gave birth to a baby boy whom Sajal quickly adopted and tried to keep Aina away from her son. Mohsin and Nadia were expecting twins now and Faraz decided to meet Mohsin and Nadia and to end this misunderstanding between them. Sajal and Faraz left for Karachi along with Maaz (Aina's son). Mohsin showed rude behaviour to Faraz who returned to Islamabad. Aina decided to overcome her problems and sorrows and to lead a normal life and started a job as a teacher.\n\nTheir lives were going well when suddenly Mohsin called upon Faraz to Karachi due to Nadia's bad health. Faraz decided to stay in Karachi now along with Sajal and Aina staying at Mohsin's place. Nadia died and gave birth to a daughter and a son. This left Mohsin with great sorrow who regret over his cruel and selfish behavior towards his late wife. Aina started taking care of mohsin's daughter but mohsin was the same man with great rage and ego towards everyone especially aina. Noman (aina's ex-fianc\u00e9) met aina and desired of marrying her, aina avoided noman since she was not able to start a normal life with anyone. Noman requested mohsin and sajal andboth of them wanted to get rid of aina convinced aina to marry noman. Aina in order to get rid of situation told about her affair to noman after knowing about aina's affair noman rejected aina. This filled mohsin and sajal with huge anger and both of them taunted and teased aina. Faraz on the other side decided to leave for America with sajal and maaz but kept this secret. Aina on the other side was constantly taunted by mohsin and sajal. Faraz's unending care for aina as a younger sister raised sajal with doubting of affair between them which hurted both faraz and aina who eventually bumped onto tears and anger and became highly furious in the rain where she yelled at mohsin as well and claimed everyone as cruel people. The next morning Sajal apologized Faraz for doubting him while faraz told everyone that he is leaving for America along with family.\n\nThis made Aina worried as she thought that her son maaz is going so far and how will she live with mohsin. On the other side mohsin became worried as well and requested faraz not to go and asked about aina over this faraz offered mohsin to marry aina for the sake of his children. This shocked mohsin and he rejected stating that this is quite impossible for him as he never considered aina in his life. Faraz and Sajal tried to convince aina who reluctantly agreed over an agreement that faraz would not leave for America. This left mohsin with shock as he wondered about aina's agreement over his proposal but mohsin disagreed over proposal.\n\nMeanwhile, imran and annie lived in devastating relationship which made realize imran that he couldn't forget Aina. Incidentally annie met aina in a mall and told her that imran has totally forgotten her and that he is happily married. Aina reacted firmly over this by stating  she is living a happy life as well without imran and that she is going to marry soon, and that she will spit on Imran's face next time she'll meet him. Annie was shocked over it and told imran sarcastically who fiercely asked annie to leave his home. On other side aina intensively asked mohsin to marry her and that she will take good care of his children but mohsin disagreed and stated that he can't start a life with her as this is quite awkward for him, but deep inside mohsin still thought that his children wants a mother's affections. Later on the nanny nafeesa whom Mohsin hired to look after his children was kidnapping his daughter and Aina saved her so Mohsin agreed to marry her. Imran managed to meet aina and asked for apology aina slapped imran claiming that he is coward. After their marriage Mohsin started thinking of her dead wife Nadia and thinks that he is doing wrong with her faraz tried to convince Mohsin that he should live a happy life with Aaina but Mohsin behaviour is rude with Aaina and he often humiliate aina for being a lazy wife and compares her to nadia. Aina tries hard to become a hardworking housewife and mother but mohsin is always unsatisfied and often loses his temper over her. He knows that not only the children need the support of Aina but he also needs as well as Aina also needs Mohsin. He doesn't want to scold her but he cannot control himself and scolds her everytime.\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz and Sajal decide to go to America knowing that Aina told them not to go and that is why she married Mohsin but Faraz tries to explain Aina that Sajal wants to live in America and he doesn't want to upset her. After so much of pressure she agrees to let them go but she is not happy about it. Since they left Aina is always thinking about Maaz and couldn't concentrate on anything and also she doesn't talks to Mohsin. Faraz calls Mohsin and asks if everything is okay he says that he doesn't know what happened to Aina Faraz then says Mohsin to take care of her and don't repeat the same mistake of the behaviour he kept with Nadia and says that if something happens to Aina he won't forgive himself. Mohsin couldn't take the behaviour of Aina anymore so he told Aina that why is she running away from him and why doesn't she accept this marriage then Aina hugs him and tells him she couldn't live like this, her loneliness will kill her. After saying that she faints and then Zubaida comes and scolds Mohsin for not taking care of Aina she tells him to call the doctor and the doctor says her blood pressure is low. After that he was remembering the old Aina that how joyful she used to be and now whatever he says to her she doesn't says a word.\n\nThe next day Mohsin prepared breakfast for Aina and took her very nicely. Mohsin brought his twin children and told Aina that he don't want a child right now from her maybe later but not that time because he doesn't want Aina to take care of her child more than his children. Aina has now too many responsibilities so she asked Mohsin that she wants a maid. At first he didn't agree because of all that Nafeesa drama he didn't want to take anymore risks but later on he accepts. The next day Aina was happy because she got support of maid and told Mohsin that she works really nicely and told that she cooks also very well and then Mohsin told that the maid prepared the food and she told yes I was checking that if she can cook or not because if there is any emergency so she will cook. Then he got angry and started shouting at her and told her this is his house and whatever he says only that will happen and he doesn't wants to eat the food if it is made by the maid and said her what does she even do everyday. After that Ayna said that yeah I am not doing anything everyday angels are coming and taking care of the house and I am doing nothing and just sleeping she said that in anger and ran furiously down the stairs and then her foot slipped and then she fell down. Then Mohsin came and helped her. After that he had to eat the food by maid the whole week. Ayna started to feel jealous seeing Nadia and Mohsin wedding picture and then she removed it from the wall and put the frame of her children. Mohsin noticed it and then got angry and said to put the frame back she said she will not put the frame and if he does she will throw the frame outside she told that I am your wife now Nadia I nowhere in her life. After a few days, Ayna went to her old home and was remembering her good old memories with Sajal and her mother. Mohsin arrived home and was waiting for Ayna when she came he told her where are you going everyday at this time and saying bad stuff to her. She then says that she doesn't want to live with her and then he says cause you want to marry I mean and then she says you are a very cheap person and then she leaves the home. She then went to Zubaida (Khala) home and said her everything what happened. After that she left her home and went again back to her old home I.e.. her mother's home and was crying there. On The other hand, Mohsin was thinking that why he scolds her every time he then was imaging a shadow of himself in which his shadow says him that he have to control himself otherwise he and his children will not be happy without her. Then he visits Zubaida's house and asked her about Ayna. She said that she went to her home and then he says she is not there. Then he thought that Ayna would must be in her old house and then he goes there and convinces her and apologize her and then she agrees to live with him.\n\nThe story then leaps 18 years. The twins (Rania (Hina Altaf) and Aasher (Agha Jarrar) and Tabinda (Mariyam Nafees) have matured.  Tabinda is shy and sweet while Rania is much the opposite and Rania is lively and confident. Tabinda wants to become an engineer and study in university however Mohsin denies as he doesn't want her end up doing the mistakes Aina did in the past when she went college. Tabinda tries to convince Mohsin but Mohsin's decision remains the same. Also Mohsin is planning to get Tabinda married but Tabinda does not agree. But as usual, what Mohsin wishes only that will happen. After few days, Mohsin and Faraz's sister Aliya (Zainab Qayyum) and her son Afaaq (Umer Naru) moved to Mohsin's house to stay there forever. Afaaq is a really selfish and irresponsible guy, Aliya is also not a really good woman. The next day, Aliya said to Mohsin that Ayna is a really good woman and she took a really good care of the kids to which Mohsin agrees then Ayna came inside and she sat on the sofa then Aliya asked Mohsin that why he didn't allow Tabinda to take admission in University. He then told her that she has grown older so he is looking for a boy to marry her. After that Aliya asked hand in marriage for Tabinda to Mohsin to which Mohsin was really happy and finally agreed. After that Ayna told Mohsin that he should have asked her point of view. Then Mohsin says I don't need to listen and that why is she not agreeing for Afaaq to which Ayna replied because he has just shifted here and they don't know him much and Tabi will also not agree. Then Mohsin says if Tabi doesn't agree then he will finish all his relations between his daughter and Ayna. Mohsin also decided that Rania will marry Maaz and Taabi will marry Afaaq to which Rania overheard and then she ran to Tabi and told her about what Mohsin says that she will marry Afaaq and when she heard that she cried a lot then Ayna was calming her down and told her not to cry. The next day, when Ayna gave tea to Mohsin, he asked how Taabi responded when she learned that she will marry Afaaq. Ayna said she was quiet. Meanwhile, Afaaq was happy to marry Taabi because he thought that then he can get money  from Mohsin because he is going to be his son-in-law.\n\nWhile, Maaz (Raees Alam) is unaware of fact that he is step-son of Sajal and Faraz. Once, he comes to Aina's home, Aina initially don't know that he is Maaz, but when he says that he is Maaz, she is surprised. He has actually come without permission of Sajal but Faraz knows. Rania and Maaz start taking interest in each other and would marry in coming episodes. Initially Mohsin was not in favour of his son to get education from abroad but when he asked Affaq about it, Affaq also favour his (Mohsin's) son because he wanted to handle all the business of his father-in-law. while on the other side Faraz and Sajjal return to Pakistan and Sajjal is not happy with the soft behavior of Maaz towards Aina. Whereas Maaz has fallen in love with Rania. Sajjal continuously insults Rania and Maaz gave her choice of court marriage. Aina listens there conversation and thought Rania is going to do same mistake as Aina did in past Faraz gave proposal of Maaz to Rania parents though which Aina rejected. Maaz and Rania are is great sorrow and Sajal is quite happy. But Maaz began to hate his own mother after this.he than was going back to America. \n \nWhen Sajal apologizes to Aina and Sajal wants Rania and Maaz to marry each other, when they found out they were so surprised, at Taabi's mehndi a girl threatens Taabi to stay away from Afaqq, she zoomed to Afaqq's prison of the house and gives him the photos, Aliya was shocked to see the photos. At the shaadi the boys were dancing (Maaz, Asher, and Afaqq) when the police arrived and took Afaq, when Mohsin blames Aliya for her sons misbehavior, they decide to replace Taabi's Shaadi With Rania's marriage. Then Mohsin finds out Maaz is not Faraz and Sajal son but does not know it is Aaina and tells Rania to divorce him. Maaz comes in and he tells Rania to go with him but Mohsin gets a gun out just to threaten Maaz but out of pressure Aaina tells Mohsin about Imran and Maaz being her son. Mohsin is shocked and Faraz tries to take the gun off and then Mohsin accidentally shoots Maaz. Aaina and Faraz take him to the hospital and gets him treated. Rania on the other hand is in a state of shock and Tabi tries to console her and says he is fine and is asking about her. Mohsin is thinking about what he has done and remembers about his past. When Aina is back to home to take Rania to hospital to see Maaz, Mohsin tells about the fact that Aina is not their mother. Despite this, they accepted her as their mother. Maaz went to meet his father and grandmother they were shocked and aina went back to Mohsin. At least Taabi and Afaq married and Rania and Maaz as well they had a family picture and that was the ending.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Naveen Waqar]] as Ayna \"Aani\" \n* [[Emmad Irfani]] as Mohsin  \n* [[Asad Zaman Khan]] as Imran\n* Shazia Naz as Sajal\n* Zain Mirza as Faraz \n* [[Hira Hussain]] as Annie \n* [[Maryam Nafees]] as Tabinda \"Taabi\" \n* [[Hina Altaf]] as Rania\n* Raeed Muhammed as Maaz\n* Zainab Jameel as Nadia (dead)\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Nayyara (dead)\n* [[Abid Ali (actor)|Abid Ali]] as Sohail (dead)\n* Umer Naru as Afaaq \n* [[Ismat Zaidi]] as Zainab\n* [[Zainab Qayyum]] as Aliya\n* Agha Jararuddin as Aashir\n* Fouzia Mushtaq as Zubaida \n* Shahid as Noman  \n* Neema Alam\n* Zainab Fatima ([[child actor]]) as the young Tabinda \"Taabi\"\n* Rashida Tabassum\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of programs broadcast by Hum TV]]\n* [[2016 in Pakistani television]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Hum TV Programs}}\n{{Television in Pakistan |state=autocollapse}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:2010s Pakistani television series]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2017 Pakistani television series endings]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Hum TV series]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuch_Na_Kaho_(TV_series)"}
