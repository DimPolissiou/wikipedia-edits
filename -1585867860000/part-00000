Armstrong had been favored to win, his competitors seen as being German [[Jan Ullrich]], Spaniards [[Roberto Heras]] and [[Iban Mayo]], and fellow Americans [[Levi Leipheimer]] and [[Tyler Hamilton]]. A major surprise in the Tour was the performance of French newcomer [[Thomas Voeckler]], who unexpectedly won the yellow jersey as leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] in the fifth stage and held onto it for ten stages before finally losing it to Armstrong.\n\nThis Tour saw the mistreatment of [[Filippo Simeoni]] by Armstrong on Stage 18. Armstrong also made a \"zip-the-lips\" gesture on camera, apparently referencing Simeoni.\n\nThe route of the 2004 Tour was remarkable.

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} Time bonuses given at the end of each [[mass start]] stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=20}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=12}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1979.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the most effort and who has demonstrated the best sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The winner wore a blue number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}} At the conclusion of the Tour, [[Richard Virenque]] ({{ct|QST|2004|nolink=yes}}) was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=95}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the [[Col de la Madeleine]] on stage 17.

Armstrong had been favored to win, his competitors seen as being German [[Jan Ullrich]], Spaniards [[Roberto Heras]] and [[Iban Mayo]], and fellow Americans [[Levi Leipheimer]] and [[Tyler Hamilton]]. A major surprise in the Tour was the performance of French newcomer [[Thomas Voeckler]], who unexpectedly won the yellow jersey as leader of the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]] in the fifth stage and held onto it for ten stages before finally losing it to Armstrong.\n\nThis Tour saw the mistreatment of [[Filippo Simeoni]] by Armstrong on Stage 18. Armstrong also made a \"zip-the-lips\" gesture on camera, apparently referencing Simeoni.\n\nThe route of the 2004 Tour was remarkable. With two [[individual time trial]]s scheduled in the last week, one of them the climb of [[Alpe d'Huez]], the directors were hoping for a close race until the end. For the first time in years, the mountains of the [[Massif Central]] made an appearance.\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 2004 Tour de France}}\n\n[[File:CSC team 2004 TDF.jpg|thumb|{{ct|CSC|2004}} during the [[team time trial]] on stage four]]\nThe first 14 teams in the [[UCI Road World Rankings]] at 31 January 2004 were automatically invited.

Armstrong also launched [[defamation]] suits against the publisher and the authors, as well as magazine ''L'Express'' and UK newspaper ''The Sunday Times'' which both referenced it.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/sports/cycling-armstrong-is-suing-accuser.html CYCLING; Armstrong Is Suing Accuser] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701005148/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/sports/cycling-armstrong-is-suing-accuser.html |date=1 July 2017 }}, By RICHARD SANDOMIR; Samuel Abt in Paris contributor, 16 June 2004, New York Times, retr 2012 10 20</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-06-19/armstrong-wants-doping-denial-in-book/1995852 Armstrong wants doping denial in book] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027200636/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2004-06-19/armstrong-wants-doping-denial-in-book/1995852 |date=27 October 2016 }}, ABC News (Australia) 19 June 2004, retr 2012 10 20</ref><ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=1825480 Judge calls Armstrong's request 'abuse' of system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113113014/http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=1825480 |date=13 January 2012 }}, Associated Press, 2004 6 21, via espn.go.com, retr 2012 10 20</ref>\n\nSubsequent to Armstrong's statement to withdraw his fight against [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]]'s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| title=Lance Armstrong will be banned from cycling by USADA after saying he won\u2019t fight doping charges| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=24 August 2012| accessdate=24 August 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160449/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| archive-date=14 October 2012| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=USADA to ban Armstrong for life, strip Tour titles|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824162637/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles/|archive-date=24 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes.<ref name=\"armstrong-usda\" /> On 22 October 2012, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.<ref name=\"armstrong-bbc\" />\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2004 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} Time bonuses given at the end of each [[mass start]] stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=20}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|3|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=12}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=18}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1979.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the most effort and who has demonstrated the best sportsmanship\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=19}} The winner wore a blue number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2004|p=8}} At the conclusion of the Tour, [[Richard Virenque]] ({{ct|QST|2004|nolink=yes}}) was given the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=95}} The [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]] was given in honour of Tour founder [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the [[Col de la Madeleine]] on stage 17. This prize was won by [[Gilberto Simoni]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maloney|first1=Tim|last2=Jones|first2=Jeff|title=\"No Gifts\": Armstrong sprints to third consecutive stage win|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2004/tour04/?id=results/stage17|access-date=2 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=22 July 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302161732/http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2004/tour04/?id=results%2Fstage17|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour de France 2004 \u2013 Leaders overview|url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2004/gc/stages/leaders-overview|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216221842/https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2004/gc/stages/leaders-overview|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 2004|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 2004|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302052716/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2004|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n!

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012. River of Hope: Forging Identity and Nation in the Rio Grande Borderlands. Duke University Press, Durham, NC, 2013;2012;.</ref> The vast majority of [[Mexican-Americans]] also suffered racial discrimination. Indeed, cultural, ethnic, and religious differences between Anglos and Hispanics persisted in the decades after the Mexican War.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 36}}</ref> Although the episodes of ethnic violence were episodic,<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 133}}</ref> the historian Alonzo argues that \"Anglo superiority also served to rationalize the very common idea in Texas that it is no wrong to kill a Mexican and, worse still, that killing an ethnic Mexican was an act to be proud of.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 134}}</ref>\n\nIn his book about Gregorio Cortez's life, Am\u00e9rico Paredes highlights the role of the Texas Rangers division in exacerbating the cultural conflicts on the border due to their alleged violent methods.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|pages= 23-32}}</ref>. An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\nThe legal plight of Gregorio Cortez lasted upwards of three years and though he was sentenced to life behind bars, the outcry for his justice and eventual [[pardon]] began as soon as the court proceedings had concluded.\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n* [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]\n* [[Manifest Destiny]]\n* [[Texas Ranger Division]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the Texas Rangers for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in one's way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring the border resident. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area comprised between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and The United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for Tejanos. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be maintained inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Sometime in this period, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting lang from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. And then Gregorio Cortez stood at the door with his pistol in his hand. The Major Sheriff fell dead at the feet of Gregorio Cortez, and it was in this way that Gregorio Cortez killed the first sheriff of many that he was to kill.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref>\nThe killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy,]] left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville,]] close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his mare jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. Suspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio.\n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The fund, largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]], saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\" (ranchers).<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, many [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe battle of the courts began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> waiting with anticipation to see Cortez sentenced to death. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. Though they originally claimed the murder to have been done by a Mrs. Robledo during the fight, Robledo was coaxed into testifying that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Sheriff of Gonzales County, Robert M. Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home, Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure, ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though Sanders later told the defense his story and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref>. The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a rushed decision emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nThe criminalization of Cortez continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris, as they understood he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, as the Columbus trial sentenced Cortez for Glover's murder assuming he had already killed Morris, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref> The defense's claim was denied by many witnesses, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\nThe legal plight of Gregorio Cortez lasted upwards of three years and though he was sentenced to life behind bars, the outcry for his justice and eventual [[pardon]] began as soon as the court proceedings had concluded.\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> At long last, in July 1913, Governor Colquitt granted Gregorio an official pardon, and he was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The particularity of the work is that it constitutes a hybrid of genres. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human.

It is based on the article \"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\" by [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]], a poet paralyzed from the neck down due to [[polio]], who hired a [[sex surrogate]] to lose his virginity. [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] and [[Helen Hunt]] star as O'Brien and sex surrogate [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]], respectively.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Award (U.S. Dramatic) and a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired the film's distribution rights and released the film in October 2012. ''The Sessions'' received highly positive reviews from critics, in particular lauding the performances of Hawkes and Hunt. Hunt was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Berkeley, California]], in 1988, Mark O'Brien is a 38 year old poet who is forced to live in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] due to complications from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a professional [[sex surrogate]]. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings.\n\nOne day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets a young woman named Susan Fernbach. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl. Father Brendan gives the homily and Susan reads the poem he had previously sent Cheryl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]]\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]]\n* [[William H.

It is based on the article \"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate\" by [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]], a poet paralyzed from the neck down due to [[polio]], who hired a [[sex surrogate]] to lose his virginity. [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] and [[Helen Hunt]] star as O'Brien and sex surrogate [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]], respectively.\n\nThe film debuted at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]], where it won the Audience Award (U.S. Dramatic) and a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] acquired the film's distribution rights and released the film in October 2012. ''The Sessions'' received highly positive reviews from critics, in particular lauding the performances of Hawkes and Hunt. Hunt was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] at the [[85th Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Berkeley, California]], in 1988, Mark O'Brien is a 38 year old poet who is forced to live in an [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] due to complications from [[Poliomyelitis|polio]]. Due to his condition, he has never had sex. After unsuccessfully proposing to his caretaker Amanda, and sensing he may be near death, he decides he wants to lose his virginity. After consulting his priest, Father Brendan, he gets in touch with Cheryl Cohen-Greene, a professional [[sex surrogate]]. She tells him they will have no more than six sessions together. They begin their sessions, but soon it is clear that they are developing romantic feelings for each other. Cheryl's husband, who loves her deeply, fights to suppress his jealousy, at first withholding a love poem that Mark has sent by mail to Cheryl, which she eventually finds. After several attempts, Mark and Cheryl are able to have mutually satisfying sex, but decide to cut the sessions short on account of their burgeoning feelings.\n\nOne day sometime later, the power goes out in the building in which Mark lives, causing the iron lung to stop functioning and making it necessary for Mark to be rushed to the hospital. However, he survives and meets a young woman named Susan Fernbach. The film then cuts to Mark's funeral, held sometime later, and attended by four of the women he came to know and care for, including Cheryl. Father Brendan gives the homily and Susan reads the poem he had previously sent Cheryl.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]] as [[Mark O'Brien (poet)|Mark O'Brien]]\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as [[Cheryl Cohen-Greene]]\n* [[William H.

This book builds upon ideas from his previous works including ''[[Fooled by Randomness]]'' (2001), [[The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|''The Black Swan'']] (2007\u20132010), and ''[[The Bed of Procrustes]]'' (2010\u20132016) and is the fourth book in the five-volume philosophical treatise on uncertainty titled ''[[Incerto]]''. Some of the ideas are expanded in Taleb\u2019s fifth book [[Skin in the Game (book)|''Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life'']] (2018).\n\n==Introduction==\nTaleb introduces the book as follows: \"Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, ''[[randomness]]'', disorder, and stressors and love adventure, [[risk]], and [[uncertainty]]. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. According to Taleb, the opposite of fragile is antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/prologue.pdf|title=Prologue|website=Fooledbyrandomness.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> \nThe phenomenon is well studied in medicine, where for example [[Wolff's law]] describes how bones grow stronger due to external load.\n[[Hormesis]] is an example of mild antifragility, where the stressor is a poisonous substance and the antifragile becomes better overall from a small dose of the stressor. This is different from robustness or resilience in that the antifragile system improves with, not withstands, stressors, where the stressors are neither too large or small. The larger point, according to Taleb, is that depriving systems of vital stressors is not necessarily a good thing and can be downright harmful.\n\nMore technically, Taleb defines antifragility as a nonlinear response: \"Simply, antifragility is defined as a [[Convex function|convex]] response to a stressor or source of harm (for some range of variation), leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility (or variability, stress, dispersion of outcomes, or uncertainty, what is grouped under the designation \"disorder cluster\"). Likewise fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors, leading a negative sensitivity to increase in volatility. The relation between fragility, convexity and sensitivity to disorder is mathematical, obtained by theorem, not derived from [[empirical research|empirical]] [[data mining]] or some historical narrative. It is [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]\".<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=1208.1189|title=Mathematical Definition, Mapping, and Detection of (Anti)Fragility|author1=N. N. Taleb|author2=R Douady|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb|class=q-fin.RM|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nAs the book progresses, Taleb covers in great depth the domain of the fragile and the opposing domain of the antifragile showing how fragility can be detected, measured, and transformed. Recurring themes throughout the book include [[Skin in the game (phrase)|Skin in the Game]], [[Via Negativa]], [[Lindy effect|Lindy Effect]], [[Barbell strategy|Barbell Strategy]] and the [[Antifragile#Green Lumber Fallacy|Green Lumber Fallacy]].\n\n==Impact ==\nThe concept of antifragility has been applied in [[physics]],<ref name=\"Naji, A. 2014\">Naji, A., Ghodrat, M., Komaie-Moghaddam, H., & Podgornik, R.

Taleb extends the definition to include any risk so that \"Every captain goes down with every ship\". This removes the [[principal\u2013agent problem|agency problem]] or in other words \"Situation in which the manager of a business is not the true owner, so he follows a strategy that cosmetically seems to be sound, but in a hidden way benefits him and makes him antifragile at the expense (fragility) of the true owners or society. When he is right, he collects large benefits; when he is wrong, others pay the price. Typically this problem leads to fragility, as it is easy to hide risks. It also affects politicians and academics. A major source of fragility.\"<ref name=\"antifragile book p430\"/>{{rp|430}}\n\n{{quotation|To me, every opinion maker needs to have \"skin in the game\" in the event of harm caused by reliance on his information or opinion (not having such persons as, say, the people who helped cause the criminal Iraq invasion come out of it completely unscathed). Further, anyone producing a forecast or making an economic analysis needs to have something to lose from it, given that others rely on those forecasts (to repeat, forecasts induce risk taking; they are more toxic to us than any other form of human pollution).<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|382}}}}\n\nTaleb's next book ''[[Skin in the Game (book)|Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life]]'' furthers the idea, asserting it is necessary for fairness, commercial efficiency, and risk management, as well as being necessary to understand the world.\n\n== Via negativa ==\n{{Main|Via negativa}}\nVia negativa is a type of theological thinking that attempts to describe God by negation or in other words, by what God is not. Taleb expanded this definition to include more generally the focus on what something is not, in action, what to avoid or what not to do. Avoiding the doctor for minor illnesses or removing certain food from one\u2019s diet to improve health are examples.\n\n{{quotation|I would add that, in my own experience, a considerable jump in my personal health has been achieved by removing offensive irritants: the morning newspapers (the mere mention of the names of the fragilista journalists [[Thomas Friedman]] or [[Paul Krugman]] can lead to explosive bouts of unrequited anger on my part), the boss, the daily commute, air-conditioning (though not heating), television, emails from documentary filmmakers, economic forecasts, news about the stock market, gym \u201cstrength training\u201d machines, and many more.<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|363}}}}\n\n== Lindy effect ==\n{{Main|Lindy effect}}\nA technology, or anything nonperishable, increases in life expectancy with every day of its life\u2014unlike perishable items (such as humans, cats, dogs, and tomatoes). So a book that has been a hundred years in print is likely to stay in print another hundred years. The opposite is Neomania, a love of change for its own sake, a form of philistinism that does not comply with the Lindy effect and that understands fragility. Forecasts the future by adding, not subtracting.<ref name=\"antifragile book p430\"/>{{rp|430}}\n\n== Barbell strategy ==\n{{Main|Barbell strategy}}\nIn finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long and short duration bonds, but does not invest in Intermediate duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value. Taleb generalizes the phenomenon and applies it to other domains.

He remarks that a fellow named Joe Siegel, one of the most successful traders in a commodity called \"green lumber,\" actually thought that it was lumber painted green (rather than freshly cut lumber, called green because it had not been dried). And he made it his profession to trade the stuff! Meanwhile the narrator was into grand intellectual theories and narratives of what caused the price of commodities to move, and went bust. It is not just that the successful expert on lumber was ignorant of central matters like the designation \"green.\" He also knew things about lumber that nonexperts think are unimportant. People we call ignorant might not be ignorant. The fact is that predicting the order flow in lumber and the usual narrative had little to do with the details one would assume from the outside are important.

[[Aristotle]] explains that Thales reserved presses ahead of the [[olive]] harvest at a discount only to [[renting|rent]] them out at a high price when [[demand]] peaked, following his predictions of a particularly good harvest. Aristotle attributes Thales\u2019 success to his ability to correctly forecast the weather. However, it was not his ability to forecast that made Thales successful but that \"Thales put himself in a position to take advantage of his lack of knowledge\u2026 that he did not need to understand too much the messages from the stars\u2026 that was the very first [[option (finance)|option]] on record\".<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Green Lumber Problem ===\nThe Green Lumber Fallacy only becomes a problem (namely, the Green Lumber Problem) when the perpetuation of the fallacy has a high, and opaque, negative impact.

In the last chapter (p.&nbsp;412), for example, Taleb criticizes [[Alan Blinder]], the former vice chairman of the board of governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]] for trying to sell him an investment product at [[World Economic Forum|Davos]] in 2008 which would allow an investor to circumvent the regulations limiting [[deposit insurance]] and to benefit from coverage for near unlimited amounts. Taleb commented that the scheme \"would allow the super-rich to scam taxpayers by getting free government-sponsored insurance\". He also criticized Blinder for using ex-regulators to game the system which they built in the first place and for voicing his opposition to policies of bank insurance that would hurt his business, i.e., claiming that what is good for his business is \"for the public good\". The event has been discussed in the media, but not denied by Blinder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nassim-nicholas-taleb/the-regulator-franchise-o_b_667967.html|title=The Regulator Franchise, or the Alan Blinder Problem|first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |date=2 August 2010|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://regator.com/p/244047854/taleb_calls_out_alan_blinder_for_questionable_ethics/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103914/http://regator.com/p/244047854/taleb_calls_out_alan_blinder_for_questionable_ethics/# |archive-date=2015-05-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Antifragile'' was a [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Bestseller]] and praised by critics in a litany of notable periodicals including the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/11/nassim-talebs-cure-for-fragili|title=Nassim Taleb's Cure for Fragility|website=Hbr.org|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2012-11-29}}</ref> ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2012/12/14/antifragility-how-disorder-makes-us-stronger/?iid=sr-link1|title=Antifragility: How disorder makes us stronger|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> the ''[[New Statesman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fooledbyrandomness.com/clergyman.pdf|author=Ed Smith |title=Left Field From Michael Lewis to Montaigne, the best writers first live an interesting life| website=Fooledbyrandomness.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> and ''[[The Economist]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21566619-how-surprises-make-you-stronger-stress-best| title=Stress best| work=[[The Economist]]| accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> and Forbes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2013/01/23/nassim-talebs-antifragile-celebrates-randomness-in-people-markets/ |title=Nassim Taleb's 'Antifragile' Celebrates Randomness In People, Markets| first=Charles |last=Sizemore |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> Although Boyd Tonkin of ''[[The Independent]]'' criticized Taleb\u2019s style as \"vulgar, silly, slapdash and infuriating\", of the ideas in the book he remarked \"time and again I returned to two questions about his core ideas: Is he right, and does it matter?

This book builds upon ideas from his previous works including ''[[Fooled by Randomness]]'' (2001), [[The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable|''The Black Swan'']] (2007\u20132010), and ''[[The Bed of Procrustes]]'' (2010\u20132016) and is the fourth book in the five-volume philosophical treatise on uncertainty titled ''[[Incerto]]''. Some of the ideas are expanded in Taleb\u2019s fifth book [[Skin in the Game (book)|''Skin in the Game: Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life'']] (2018).\n\n==Introduction==\nTaleb introduces the book as follows: \"Some things benefit from shocks; they thrive and grow when exposed to volatility, ''[[randomness]]'', disorder, and stressors and love adventure, [[risk]], and [[uncertainty]]. Yet, in spite of the ubiquity of the phenomenon, there is no word for the exact opposite of fragile. According to Taleb, the opposite of fragile is antifragile. Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/prologue.pdf|title=Prologue|website=Fooledbyrandomness.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> \nThe phenomenon is well studied in medicine, where for example [[Wolff's law]] describes how bones grow stronger due to external load.\n[[Hormesis]] is an example of mild antifragility, where the stressor is a poisonous substance and the antifragile becomes better overall from a small dose of the stressor. This is different from robustness or resilience in that the antifragile system improves with, not withstands, stressors, where the stressors are neither too large or small. The larger point, according to Taleb, is that depriving systems of vital stressors is not necessarily a good thing and can be downright harmful.\n\nMore technically, Taleb defines antifragility as a nonlinear response: \"Simply, antifragility is defined as a [[Convex function|convex]] response to a stressor or source of harm (for some range of variation), leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility (or variability, stress, dispersion of outcomes, or uncertainty, what is grouped under the designation \"disorder cluster\"). Likewise fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors, leading a negative sensitivity to increase in volatility. The relation between fragility, convexity and sensitivity to disorder is mathematical, obtained by theorem, not derived from [[empirical research|empirical]] [[data mining]] or some historical narrative. It is [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]\".<ref>{{cite arxiv |eprint=1208.1189|title=Mathematical Definition, Mapping, and Detection of (Anti)Fragility|author1=N. N. Taleb|author2=R Douady|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb|class=q-fin.RM|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nAs the book progresses, Taleb covers in great depth the domain of the fragile and the opposing domain of the antifragile showing how fragility can be detected, measured, and transformed. Recurring themes throughout the book include [[Skin in the game (phrase)|Skin in the Game]], [[Via Negativa]], [[Lindy effect|Lindy Effect]], [[Barbell strategy|Barbell Strategy]] and the [[Antifragile#Green Lumber Fallacy|Green Lumber Fallacy]].\n\n==Impact ==\nThe concept of antifragility has been applied in [[physics]],<ref name=\"Naji, A. 2014\">Naji, A., Ghodrat, M., Komaie-Moghaddam, H., & Podgornik, R.

Avoiding the doctor for minor illnesses or removing certain food from one\u2019s diet to improve health are examples.\n\n{{quotation|I would add that, in my own experience, a considerable jump in my personal health has been achieved by removing offensive irritants: the morning newspapers (the mere mention of the names of the fragilista journalists [[Thomas Friedman]] or [[Paul Krugman]] can lead to explosive bouts of unrequited anger on my part), the boss, the daily commute, air-conditioning (though not heating), television, emails from documentary filmmakers, economic forecasts, news about the stock market, gym \u201cstrength training\u201d machines, and many more.<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|363}}}}\n\n== Lindy effect ==\n{{Main|Lindy effect}}\nA technology, or anything nonperishable, increases in life expectancy with every day of its life\u2014unlike perishable items (such as humans, cats, dogs, and tomatoes). So a book that has been a hundred years in print is likely to stay in print another hundred years. The opposite is Neomania, a love of change for its own sake, a form of philistinism that does not comply with the Lindy effect and that understands fragility. Forecasts the future by adding, not subtracting.<ref name=\"antifragile book p430\"/>{{rp|430}}\n\n== Barbell strategy ==\n{{Main|Barbell strategy}}\nIn finance, a barbell strategy is formed when a trader invests in long and short duration bonds, but does not invest in Intermediate duration bonds. This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value. Taleb generalizes the phenomenon and applies it to other domains. Essentially it is the transformation of anything from fragile to antifragile.\n\n{{quotation | A dual strategy, a combination of two extremes, one safe and one speculative, deemed more robust than a \u201cmonomodal\u201d strategy; often a necessary condition for antifragility. For instance, in biological systems, the equivalent of marrying an accountant (stable life) and having an occasional fling with a rock star (good fun); for a writer, getting a stable sinecure and writing without the pressures of the market during spare time. Even trial and error are a form of barbell.<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|428}}}}\n\n== Green Lumber Fallacy ==\nThe Green Lumber Fallacy refers to a kind of [[fallacy]] where one mistakes one important kind of knowledge for another; in other words, \"mistaking the source of important or even necessary knowledge, for another less visible from the outside, less tractable one... how many things we call 'relevant knowledge' aren\u2019t so much so\".<ref name=\"antifragile book p430\">{{cite book |author=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |year=2012 |title=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781400067824/page/430 430] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781400067824 |url-access=registration |quote=antifragile Mistaking the source of important or even necessary. |isbn=9781400067824}}</ref>{{rp|430}} The root of the fallacy is that although people may be focusing on the right things, due to complexity of the thing, they are not good enough to figure it out intellectually.\n\nThe term ''green lumber'' refers to a story by authors Jim Paul and Brendan Moynihan in their book ''What I Learned Losing A Million Dollars'', where a trader made a fortune trading lumber he thought was literally \"green\" rather than fresh cut.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Jim Paul |author2=Brendan Moynihan |year=2013 |title=What I Learned Losing a Million Dollars |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGowrCKiX24C&q=one+morning+joe#v=snippet&q=one%20morning%20joe&f=false |isbn=9780231535236}}</ref> \"This gets at the idea that a supposed understanding of an investment rationale, a narrative or a theoretical model is unhelpful in practical trading.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/michael-santoli/gold-not-antifragile-enough-black-swan-author-141516155.html|title=Gold Not 'Antifragile' Enough for 'Black Swan' Author|website=Finance.yahoo.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|The protagonist makes a big discovery. He remarks that a fellow named Joe Siegel, one of the most successful traders in a commodity called \"green lumber,\" actually thought that it was lumber painted green (rather than freshly cut lumber, called green because it had not been dried). And he made it his profession to trade the stuff! Meanwhile the narrator was into grand intellectual theories and narratives of what caused the price of commodities to move, and went bust. It is not just that the successful expert on lumber was ignorant of central matters like the designation \"green.\" He also knew things about lumber that nonexperts think are unimportant. People we call ignorant might not be ignorant. The fact is that predicting the order flow in lumber and the usual narrative had little to do with the details one would assume from the outside are important. People who do things in the field are not subjected to a set exam; they are selected in the most nonnarrative manner\u2014nice arguments don\u2019t make much difference.<ref name=\"antifragile book np\">{{cite book |author=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |year=2012 |title=Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781400067824 |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Random House]]}}</ref>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}}}\n\n=== Early occurrences ===\nAn early occurrence of this fallacy is found in the ancient story of [[Thales]]. [[Aristotle]] explains that Thales reserved presses ahead of the [[olive]] harvest at a discount only to [[renting|rent]] them out at a high price when [[demand]] peaked, following his predictions of a particularly good harvest. Aristotle attributes Thales\u2019 success to his ability to correctly forecast the weather. However, it was not his ability to forecast that made Thales successful but that \"Thales put himself in a position to take advantage of his lack of knowledge\u2026 that he did not need to understand too much the messages from the stars\u2026 that was the very first [[option (finance)|option]] on record\".<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Green Lumber Problem ===\nThe Green Lumber Fallacy only becomes a problem (namely, the Green Lumber Problem) when the perpetuation of the fallacy has a high, and opaque, negative impact. For example:\n* Green Lumber Fallacy and a Green Lumber Problem: \"[[James Le Fanu]] showed how our understanding of the biological processes was coupled with a decline of pharmaceutical discoveries, as if rationalistic theories were blinding and somehow a handicap\".<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}\n* Green Lumber Fallacy only: \"The same holds for the statement {{'}}''[[weight training|lifting weights]] increases your [[muscle mass]]''{{'}}. In the past they used to say that weight lifting caused the 'micro-tearing of muscles', with subsequent healing and increase in size. Today some people discuss [[hormonal]] [[endocrine system|signaling]] or genetic mechanisms, tomorrow they will discuss something else. But the effect has held forever and will continue to do so.\"<ref name=\"antifragile book np\"/>{{rp|needed=y|date=March 2018}}\n\n== The Alan Blinder problem ==\nToward the end of the book Taleb provides examples of the problems of agency and cherry-picking, calling them the [[Robert Rubin]] problem, the [[Joseph Stiglitz]] problem, and the Alan Blinder problem. In the last chapter (p.&nbsp;412), for example, Taleb criticizes [[Alan Blinder]], the former vice chairman of the board of governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]] for trying to sell him an investment product at [[World Economic Forum|Davos]] in 2008 which would allow an investor to circumvent the regulations limiting [[deposit insurance]] and to benefit from coverage for near unlimited amounts. Taleb commented that the scheme \"would allow the super-rich to scam taxpayers by getting free government-sponsored insurance\". He also criticized Blinder for using ex-regulators to game the system which they built in the first place and for voicing his opposition to policies of bank insurance that would hurt his business, i.e., claiming that what is good for his business is \"for the public good\". The event has been discussed in the media, but not denied by Blinder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/nassim-nicholas-taleb/the-regulator-franchise-o_b_667967.html|title=The Regulator Franchise, or the Alan Blinder Problem|first=Nassim Nicholas|last=Taleb|authorlink=Nassim Nicholas Taleb |date=2 August 2010|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://regator.com/p/244047854/taleb_calls_out_alan_blinder_for_questionable_ethics/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507103914/http://regator.com/p/244047854/taleb_calls_out_alan_blinder_for_questionable_ethics/# |archive-date=2015-05-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Critical reception ==\n''Antifragile'' was a [[New York Times Bestseller|''New York Times'' Bestseller]] and praised by critics in a litany of notable periodicals including the ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2012/11/nassim-talebs-cure-for-fragili|title=Nassim Taleb's Cure for Fragility|website=Hbr.org|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2012-11-29}}</ref> ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2012/12/14/antifragility-how-disorder-makes-us-stronger/?iid=sr-link1|title=Antifragility: How disorder makes us stronger|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> the ''[[New Statesman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fooledbyrandomness.com/clergyman.pdf|author=Ed Smith |title=Left Field From Michael Lewis to Montaigne, the best writers first live an interesting life| website=Fooledbyrandomness.com|accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> and ''[[The Economist]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/news/books-and-arts/21566619-how-surprises-make-you-stronger-stress-best| title=Stress best| work=[[The Economist]]| accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> and Forbes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/moneybuilder/2013/01/23/nassim-talebs-antifragile-celebrates-randomness-in-people-markets/ |title=Nassim Taleb's 'Antifragile' Celebrates Randomness In People, Markets| first=Charles |last=Sizemore |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=3 November 2017}}</ref> Although Boyd Tonkin of ''[[The Independent]]'' criticized Taleb\u2019s style as \"vulgar, silly, slapdash and infuriating\", of the ideas in the book he remarked \"time and again I returned to two questions about his core ideas: Is he right, and does it matter?

It premiered on June 13, 2008 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]] and was later released in the [[United States]] on October 29, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n15-year-old orphan Jolene breaks free from foster care, marrying Mickey, a nerdy 20-year-old. They live with Mickey's Uncle Phil and Aunt Kay. On the night before her sixteenth birthday, Jolene asks Mickey about his mother, but he rebuffs her and starts crying. To make him feel better, she seduces him, but Mickey's inexperience leads to uncomfortable and joyless sex. The next day, Mickey and Uncle Phil wish Jolene a \"Happy Birthday\" with Aunt Kay asking Jolene to clean the floor. Uncle Phil later walks in as Jolene is cleaning the floors, is aroused and they have sex. They start a passionate affair, and Phil promises to build a house for the two of them, but asks Jolene to keep their relationship secret. Upon catching Phil and Jolene in bed, Aunt Kay throws Jolene out of the house. Mickey, Phil and Kay argue violently, and Mickey later commits suicide by jumping off a bridge.\n\nAunt Kay has Jolene placed in a juvenile mental institution, where she meets Cindy, a psychiatric nurse. Jolene, a talented artist, asks for paper and colored pencils to draw. Her request is denied, but she is allowed crayons, and she starts a small business selling crayon portraits to her fellow patients. Jolene is called to testify against Uncle Phil, and he is sentenced to eighteen months in prison for statutory rape. Cindy, a lesbian, is immediately infatuated with Jolene and this culminates in another affair. Cindy breaks Jolene out of the mental hospital and hides her in her apartment. Using the money from her portraits, Jolene leaves and boards a bus west out of South Carolina. Jolene resorts to hitchhiking further west, supporting herself by prostitution.\n\nJolene ends up in Arizona, working as a waitress at an outdoor diner. There, she meets Coco Leger, an aspiring musician and tattoo artist. A relationship blooms between them and Jolene becomes a tattoo artist at Coco's parlor. After two weeks of dating, Jolene moves in with Coco and he convinces her to get married. After he passes out during sex, Coco is revealed to have a cocaine addiction, supporting his habit and the parlor by dealing cocaine. One evening, a young woman enters the parlor and declares herself to be his wife, Marin. She introduces his son, Coco Jr. Coco returns and is confronted by both women before he walks out with Marin and the baby. Jolene destroys the parlor, dumps the cocaine on a table, steals the drug money and dumps her ring in the center of the cocaine, before dialing 911 and fleeing the scene.\n\nJolene later is in Las Vegas, working as an erotic dancer when she meets Sal Fontaine, a mobster. He takes a liking to her and invites her to quit dancing and move into his high rise condo. Jolene enjoys a life of luxury with Sal, going to fancy dinners and exploring her talent as an artist. One night, Sal demands that Jolene get dressed, go downstairs and wait for him. She falls asleep in the restaurant and quietly returns to the condo to find Sal dead and the mob looking for her. Jolene escapes and ends up hitchhiking on a truck to Tulsa.\n\nIn Tulsa, Jolene finds work as a receptionist and banquet server. She meets Brad Benton, the son of a wealthy family. He relentlessly pursues her, sending flowers to her workplace and charming her into dates. Outwardly religious but obnoxiously arrogant, he is rude, entitled and demanding to everyone. Brad pressures Jolene into quickly getting married and anally rapes her on their wedding night. When Jolene becomes pregnant, Brad interrogates her on how many people she has had sex with; when she refuses to comply, he slaps her across the face. After the baby is born, Brad's parents investigate Jolene's past and inform him. He then brutally attacks her, permanently damaging her vocal cords. She tries to leave and take Brad Jr., but a domestic violence lawyer refuses to take her case due to her past. While staying in a shelter for battered women, the police come and arrest Jolene for kidnapping and Brad is granted an annulment. Jolene is convicted of the kidnapping and is allowed supervised visits. She decides to exit her baby's life while he is an infant, reasoning that he can imagine his mother to be anybody.\n\nFinally, Jolene ends up in Los Angeles, working as a comic illustrator for a graphic novel company, where she incorporates events from her life into her work. In her final narration, she reveals that she has dreams to be an actress and that a film studio might want to use her. Seeing a woman walking her young son up the street, Jolene imagines herself a famous actress returning to Tulsa in a limousine to visit her son and happily walks out of frame.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Jolene\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Cindy\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as Coco Leger\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Uncle Phil\n* Zeb Newman as Mickey\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Sal Fontaine\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Marin\n* [[Theresa Russell]] as Aunt Kay\n* [[Michael Vartan]] as Brad\n\nBrothers Avi Angel and [[Asher Angel]] appeared briefly as Brad Jr. at 7 months and 5 years old, respectively.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received a mixed critical reaction.

He relentlessly pursues her, sending flowers to her workplace and charming her into dates. Outwardly religious but obnoxiously arrogant, he is rude, entitled and demanding to everyone. Brad pressures Jolene into quickly getting married and anally rapes her on their wedding night. When Jolene becomes pregnant, Brad interrogates her on how many people she has had sex with; when she refuses to comply, he slaps her across the face. After the baby is born, Brad\u2019s parents investigate Jolene's past and inform him. He then brutally attacks her, permanently damaging her vocal cords. She tries to leave and take Brad Jr., but a domestic violence lawyer refuses to take her case due to her past. While staying in a shelter for battered women, the police come and arrest Jolene for kidnapping and Brad is granted an annulment. Jolene is convicted of the kidnapping and is allowed supervised visits. She decides to exit her baby's life while he is an infant, reasoning that he can imagine his mother to be anybody.\n\nFinally, Jolene ends up in Los Angeles, working as a comic illustrator for a graphic novel company, where she incorporates events from her life into her work. In her final narration, she reveals that she has dreams to be an actress and that a film studio might want to use her. Seeing a woman walking her young son up the street, Jolene imagines herself a famous actress returning to Tulsa in a limousine to visit her son and happily walks out of frame.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jessica Chastain]] as Jolene\n* [[Frances Fisher]] as Cindy\n* [[Rupert Friend]] as Coco Leger\n* [[Dermot Mulroney]] as Uncle Phil\n* Zeb Newman as Mickey\n* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Sal Fontaine\n* [[Denise Richards]] as Marin\n* [[Theresa Russell]] as Aunt Kay\n* [[Michael Vartan]] as Brad\n\nBrothers Avi Angel and [[Asher Angel]] appeared briefly as Brad Jr. at 7 months and 5 years old, respectively.\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received a mixed critical reaction.

It has no overall winner\u2014although American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] originally won the event, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]]; the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] has confirmed this verdict.\n\nThe event started and ended in Paris, covering {{convert|3427|km|0|abbr=on}} proceeding clockwise in twenty stages around France, including six major mountain stages. Due to the centennial celebration, this edition of the tour was raced entirely in France and did not enter neighboring countries.\n\nIn the centenary year of the race the route recreated, in part, that of 1903. There was a special ''Centenaire Classement'' prize for the best-placed in each of the six stage finishes which match the 1903 tour - [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Toulouse]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Nantes]] and Paris. It was won by [[Stuart O'Grady]], with [[Thor Hushovd]] in second place. The 2003 Tour was honored with the [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for Sport.\n\nOf the 198 riders the favourite was again Armstrong, aiming for a record equalling fifth win. Before the race, it was believed that his main rivals would include [[Iban Mayo]], [[Aitor Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Tyler Hamilton]], [[Ivan Basso]], [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Jan Ullrich]], and [[Joseba Beloki]] but Armstrong was the odds-on favourite.

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=20\u201321}} There were time bonuses given at the end of each [[mass start]] stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=22}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=13}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]]. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1977.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}} The leader wore a white jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe final classification was a [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}}\n\nThere was special classification, the ''Centenaire'', which combined times of riders across the six stages involving cities visited during [[1903 Tour de France|1903 Tour]]. The cities were: Lyon, on stage 6; Marseille, on stage 10; Toulouse, on stage 11; Bordeaux, on stage 17; Nantes, on stage 19; and Paris, on stage 20.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=22}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each mass start stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"shown the greatest effort and demonstrated the greatest sporting spirit\".{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=21\u201322}} The winner wore a red number bib the following stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}} At the conclusion of the Tour, [[Alexander Vinokourov]] ({{ct|THR|2003|no-link=yes}}) won the overall super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=94}}\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of \u20ac5000, the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]] on stage 8, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Tourmalet]] on stage 15.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=35}} Stefano Garzelli won the Henri Desgrange and [[Sylvain Chavanel]] won the Jacques Goddet.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hood|first=Andrew|title=Mayo wins, Armstrong in yellow after epic day at Tour|url=https://www.velonews.com/2003/07/news/mayo-wins-armstrong-in-yellow-after-epic-day-at-tour_4505|access-date=2 March 2019|work=[[VeloNews]]|publisher=Pocket Outdoor Media|date=13 July 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302210309/https://www.velonews.com/2003/07/news/mayo-wins-armstrong-in-yellow-after-epic-day-at-tour_4505|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Maloney|first=Tim|title=Armstrong wins stage & makes miracle comeback|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2003/tour03/?id=results/stage15|access-date=4 March 2019|work=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|publisher=[[Immediate Media Company]]|date=21 July 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005103953/http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2003/tour03/?id=results%2Fstage15|archive-date=2018-10-05|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:smaller; clear:both;\"\n|+Classification leadership by stage<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour de France 2003 \u2013 Leaders overview|url=https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2003/gc/stages/leaders-overview|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=16 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216221900/https://www.procyclingstats.com/race/tour-de-france/2003/gc/stages/leaders-overview|archive-date=16 February 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"tdf-statistics\">{{cite web|last=van den Akker|first=Pieter|title=Informatie over de Tour de France van 2003|trans-title=Information about the Tour de France from 2003|url=http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2003|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302052713/http://www.tourdefrancestatistieken.nl/tour.php?jaar=2003|archivedate=2 March 2019|language=Dutch|website=TourDeFranceStatistieken.nl|accessdate=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n!

de France''' was a [[stage race|multiple stage]] [[bicycle racing|bicycle race]] held from 5 to 27 July, and the 90th edition of the [[Tour de France]]. It has no overall winner\u2014although American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] originally won the event, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]]; the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] has confirmed this verdict.\n\nThe event started and ended in Paris, covering {{convert|3427|km|0|abbr=on}} proceeding clockwise in twenty stages around France, including six major mountain stages. Due to the centennial celebration, this edition of the tour was raced entirely in France and did not enter neighboring countries.\n\nIn the centenary year of the race the route recreated, in part, that of 1903. There was a special ''Centenaire Classement'' prize for the best-placed in each of the six stage finishes which match the 1903 tour - [[Lyon]], [[Marseille]], [[Toulouse]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Nantes]] and Paris. It was won by [[Stuart O'Grady]], with [[Thor Hushovd]] in second place.

The most important was the [[General classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=20\u201321}} There were time bonuses given at the end of each [[mass start]] stage.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=22}} If a crash had happened within the final {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=13}} The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe second classification was the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]]. Riders received points for finishing in the highest positions in a stage finish, or in [[intermediate sprint]]s during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}} The leader was identified by a green jersey.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe third classification was the [[Mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', with the more difficult climbs rated lower.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|p=21}} The leader wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|''Race regulations''|2003|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe final individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]].

Primarily used by the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]], it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations. The Humvee saw widespread use in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, where it navigated the treacherous desert terrain; this usage helped to inspire civilian [[Hummer]] versions. After going through a [[Humvee replacement process|replacement process]], the [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]] (JLTV) was chosen as its successor.\n\n==History==\nSince the [[World War II]] [[Willys MB|\u00bc-ton reconnaissance truck]] was green-lit for mass-deployment, and became known as the \"jeep\", the [[United States military]] had continued to rely heavily on jeeps as general utility vehicles, and as a mass-transport for soldiers in small groups. Although the US Army had let Ford redesign the jeep from the ground up during the 1950s, and the resulting [[M151 jeep]] incorporated significant innovations, it firmly adhered to the original concept\u2014a very compact, lightweight, low profile vehicle, with a folding windshield, that a layman could barely distinguish from the preceding Willys jeeps. The jeeps were shorter than a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and weighed just over one metric ton, seating three with an {{convert|800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} payload. During and after the war, the very light, {{frac|1|4}}-ton jeeps were complemented by the {{frac|3|4}}-ton [[Dodge WC series|Dodge WC]] and Korea War [[Dodge M37|M37 models]].\n\nBy the mid-1960s, the U.S. military clearly felt a need to reevaluate their aging light vehicle fleet.<ref name=WHNhumV>{{cite web |url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-u-s-armys-humvee/ |title=The U.S. Army\u2019s Humvee |last=Mroz |first=Albert |date=16 June 2016 |website=Warfare History Network |publisher=Sovereign Media |access-date=2018-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618203631/http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-u-s-armys-humvee/ |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> For starters, from the mid 1960s, the U.S. Army had tried to modernize, through replacing the larger, purpose-built [[Dodge M37]]s by militarized, \"commercial off the shelf\" (COTS) 4\u00d74 trucks\u2014initially the [[Kaiser Jeep M715|M715 Jeep trucks]], succeeded in the later 1970s by the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle#Dodge M8XX Series|Dodge M880]] series, but these didn't satisfy newer requirements either\u2014what was wanted was a truly versatile light military truck, that could replace multiple outdated vehicles. When becoming aware of the U.S. Army's desire for a versatile new light weapons carrier / reconnaissance vehicle, as early as 1969 [[FMC Corporation#FMC|FMC Corporation]] started development on their [[FMC XR311|XR311 prototype]], and offered it for testing in 1970.<ref name=WHNhumV /> At least a dozen of these were built for testing under the ''High Mobility Combat Vehicle'', or HMCV program, initially much more as an enhanced capability successor to the M151 jeep, than as a general purpose load lugger.

The radiator was to be mounted high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood.\n\nOut of 61 companies that showed interest, only three submitted prototypes.<ref name=\"telegraph14march14\" /> In July 1979, [[AM General]], a subsidiary of [[American Motors Corporation]] began preliminary design work. Less than a year later, the first prototype was in testing. Chrysler Defense and Teledyne Continental also produced competing designs. In June 1981, the Army awarded AM General a contract for development of several more prototype vehicles to be delivered to the government for another series of tests. The original M998 A0 series had a curb weight of {{convert|5200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, a payload of {{convert|2500|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|6.2|L|cuin|abbr=on}} V-8 diesel engine and 6.3 L gasoline, and a three-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe three companies were chosen to design and build eleven HMMWV prototypes, which covered over 600,000 miles in trials which included off-road courses in desert and arctic conditions.  AM General was awarded an initial contract in 1983 for 2,334 vehicles, the first batch of a five-year contract that would see 55,000 vehicles delivered to the U.S. military, including 39,000 vehicles for the Army; 72,000 vehicles had been delivered to U.S. and foreign customers by the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and 100,000 were delivered by the Humvee's 10th anniversary in 1995.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" /> Ft. Lewis, Washington and the 2nd Battalion 1st Infantry,  9th Infantry Division was the testing unit to employ HMMWV in the new concept of a motorized division. Yakima Training Center in Yakima, Washington was the main testing grounds for HMMWVs from 1985 through December 1991, when the motorized concept was abandoned and the division inactivated.\n\n===Usage in combat===\nHMMWVs first saw combat in [[Operation Just Cause]], the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]] in 1989.\n\nThe HMMWV was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines, not as a front line fighting vehicle. Like the previous jeep, the basic HMMWV has no armor or protection against [[Weapon of mass destruction|chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats]]. Nevertheless, losses were relatively low in [[conventional warfare|conventional operations]], such as the [[Gulf War]]. Vehicles and crews suffered considerable damage and losses during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993 due to the nature of the urban engagement. However, the chassis survivability allowed the majority of those crews to return to safety, though the HMMWV was never designed to offer protection against intense small arms fire, much less [[machine gun]]s and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. With the rise of [[asymmetric warfare]] and [[low intensity conflict]]s, the HMMWV was pressed into service in urban combat roles for which it was not originally intended.<ref>[http://www.museum-mm.org/high-mobility-multipurpose-wheeled-vehicle-hmmwv/ HMMWV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306035417/http://www.museum-mm.org/high-mobility-multipurpose-wheeled-vehicle-hmmwv/ |date=6 March 2017 }} museum-mm.org</ref>\n\nAfter [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] in [[Somalia]], the military recognized a need for a more protected HMMWV and AM General developed the M1114, an armored HMMWV to withstand small arms fire. The M1114 has been in production since 1996, seeing limited use in the [[Balkans]] before deployment to the [[Middle East]]. This design is superior to the M998 with a larger, more powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, [[air conditioning]], and a strengthened [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. More importantly, it boasts a fully [[vehicle armor|armored]] passenger area protected by hardened steel and [[Bulletproof glass|bullet-resistant glass]]. With the increase in direct attacks and guerrilla warfare in Iraq, AM General diverted the majority of its manufacturing power to producing these vehicles.\n\nHumvees were sent into [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] following the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]], where they proved invaluable during initial operations. In the early years before IEDs became prevalent, the vehicle was liked by troops for its ability to access rough, mountainous terrain. Some soldiers would remove features from Humvees, including what little armor it had and sometimes even entire doors, to make them lighter and more maneuverable for off-road conditions and to increase visibility. With the onset of the [[Iraq War]], Humvees proved very vulnerable to IEDs; in the first four months of 2006, 67 U.S. troops died in Humvees. To increase protection, the U.S. military hastily added-on armor kits to the vehicles. Although this somewhat improved survivability, bolting on armor made the Humvee an \"ungainly beast\", increasing weight and putting strain on the chassis, which led to unreliability. Armored doors that weighed hundreds of pounds were difficult for troops to open and the newly armored turret made Humvees top heavy and increased the danger of rollovers. The U.S. Marine Corps decided to start replacing Humvees in combat with Mine-Resistant, Ambush Protected ([[MRAP]]) vehicles in 2007, and the U.S. Army stated that the vehicle was \"no longer feasible for combat\" in 2012.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" /><ref name=\"telegraph14march14\" />\n\nThe HMMWV has become the vehicular backbone of U.S. forces around the world.

The HMMWV has evolved several times since its introduction and was used in tactical roles for which it was never originally intended. The military pursued several initiatives to replace it, both in the short and long terms. The short term replacement efforts utilized [[commercial off-the-shelf]] vehicles as part of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) program. These vehicles were procured to replace Humvees in combat theaters. The long term replacement for the Humvee is the JLTV which is designed from the ground up.  The [[Future Tactical Truck Systems]] (FTTS) program was initiated to make an analysis of potential requirements for a Humvee replacement. Various prototype vehicles such as the [[MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle]], and the [[ULTRA AP]] have been constructed as part of these efforts.

The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through [[foreign military sales]] and transfers. By 2017, the Marines' light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total.

Autonomy features would allow the Humvees to drive themselves and one soldier to control a \"swarm\" of several vehicles.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" />\n\nAlthough the Army plans to buy 49,100 JLTVs and the Marine Corps 5,500, they are not a one-for-one replacement for the Humvee and both services will still be left operating large fleets.  For the Marines, 69 JLTVs will replace the 74 Humvees in all active infantry battalions to cover its expeditionary forces. The Marine JLTV order is planned to be completed by 2022, leaving the remainder of the Corps' 13,000-strong Humvee force scattered around support organizations while soft-skinned Humvees will provide support behind the forward deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]. The Army does not plan to replace Humvees in the [[Army National Guard]], and is considering options on how many of its 120,000 vehicles will be replaced, sustained, or modernized. Even if half of the force is replaced by JLTVs, the entire planned order will not be complete until 2040. If upgrades are chosen for the remaining Humvees, the cost would likely have to not exceed $100,000 per vehicle.<ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/land/vehicles/2015/08/29/oshkosh-awaits-protests-jltv-win/71325838/ Oshkosh Awaits Protests After JLTV Win] \u2013  Defensenews.com, 29 August 2015</ref> The Humvee is expected to remain in U.S. military service until at least 2050.<ref>[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/am-general-secures-six-year-4283-million-contract-to-provide-the-army-with-m997a3-hmmwv-configured-ambulances-300139298.html AM General Secures Six-Year, $428.3 Million Contract To Provide The Army With M997A3 HMMWV Configured Ambulances] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205135716/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/am-general-secures-six-year-4283-million-contract-to-provide-the-army-with-m997a3-hmmwv-configured-ambulances-300139298.html |date=5 February 2016 }} \u2013 PRNewswiew.com, 8 September 2015</ref> Ambulance variants of the Humvee will especially remain in active use, as the JLTV could not be modified to serve as one due to weight issues.<ref>[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/14/pentagon-selects-1st-army-marine-units-receive-jltv.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm Pentagon Selects 1st Army, Marine Units to Receive JLTV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170618210639/http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/06/14/pentagon-selects-1st-army-marine-units-receive-jltv.html?ESRC=todayinmil.sm |date=18 June 2017 }} \u2013 Military.com, 14 June 2017</ref>\n\n==Design features==\n[[File:USAFHMMWV.jpg|thumb|left|A [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] airman in [[Southwest Asia]] stands in the ringmount of a FRAG 6-reinforced HMMWV, 2010]]\n\nThe Humvee seats 4 with an available fully enclosed metal cabin with vertical windshield.

In combat conditions, the HMMWV can be delivered by the [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]] which pulls the vehicle out of the open rear ramp just above the ground without the aircraft having to land.\n\n[[File:US Navy 111114-N-KA046-134 A Humvee launches from a landing craft utility (LCU) assigned to the amphibious dock landing ship USS Whidbey Island (LS.jpg|thumb|Humvee fording]]\nThere are at least 17 variants of the HMMWV in service with the U.S. military. HMMWVs serve as cargo/troop carriers, automatic weapons platforms, [[ambulance]]s (four litter patients or eight ambulatory patients), M220 [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missile]] carriers, [[M119 howitzer]] prime movers, [[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger|M1097 Avenger]] Pedestal Mounted Stinger platforms, MRQ-12 direct [[air support]] vehicles, S250 shelter carriers, and other roles.

Recent improvements have also led to the development of the M1151 model, which quickly rendered the previous models obsolete. By replacing the M1114, M1116, and earlier armored HMMWV types with a single model, the U.S. Army hopes to lower maintenance costs.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Humvee series can be seen in the M1151A1 and later up-armored A1-versions.  It has a stronger suspension and larger 6.5 liter turbo-diesel engine to accommodate the weight of up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of additional armor.  The armor protection can be installed or taken off depending on the operating environment, so the vehicles can move more efficiently without armor when there is no threat of attack.  There is some underbody armor that moderately protects against mines and roadside bombs.  Other improvements include Vehicle Emergency Escape (VEE) windows that can be quickly removed so troops inside can escape in the event of a rollover, jammed door, or the vehicle catching fire, and a blast chimney that vents the force of a bomb blast upwards and away from the occupants.  The M1151A1 has a crew of four, can carry {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of payload, and can tow a {{convert|4,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} load.

The vehicle features a [[monocoque]] [[V-hull|V-shaped hull]] and angled sides to help deflect [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) with scalable levels of protection.  It has greater engine power, replacing the 6.5 liter diesel engine with a [[Cummins]] 6.7 liter diesel and [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] 6-speed transmission, as well as a stronger suspension, improved brakes, higher ground clearance, and new onboard instrumentation.  Fuel capacity is increased from 27 gallons to 40 and the battery and fuel cells are moved from under the rear seat to the rear of the vehicle.  Also included are a powerful air conditioner and heating system, [[run-flat tire]]s, a thermal guard liner under the roof, sharp edges removed from inside the cabin, blast attenuating seats, and a folding gunner's turret allowing rapid deployment from a cargo aircraft or shipboard below deck.  Although heavier than the Humvee, the SCTV is half the weight and costs $150,000 less than a comparably survivable MRAP.  The basic version is a four-passenger armament carrier, but it can be configured as a nine-passenger troop carrier, air-defense vehicle, flatbed cargo truck, or field ambulance depending on the type of Humvee it is converted from.<ref name=\"armyreco21oct14\"/><ref name=\"defensenews13oct15\">[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/show-daily/ausa/2015/10/13/textron-pitches-upgrade-extend-life-surplus-humvees/73889414/ Textron Pitches Upgrade To Extend Life of Surplus Humvees] \u2013 Defensenews.com, 13 October 2015</ref><ref name=\"defenseone13oct15\">[http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/10/ukraines-humvees-are-about-get-more-armor/122772/?oref=d-skybox In a Groundbreaking Deal, Ukraine May Buy US Armor for Its Humvees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015234334/http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/10/ukraines-humvees-are-about-get-more-armor/122772/?oref=d-skybox |date=15 October 2015 }} \u2013 Defenseone.com, 13 October 2015</ref>\n\nWork began on the SCTV in 2008 in anticipation of U.S. military upgrades, but it was shelved once they made the JLTV a priority.

While some have been transferred to domestic law enforcement agencies, this is the first time the military vehicles have been made available for civilian ownership. The idea is to sell them with starting bids at $10,000 each, for off-road use only, rather than simply scrapping them as a way to save money and repurpose them.  M998, M998A1, M1038, and M1038A1 model Humvees are available, which are out of U.S. service and lack armor.  AM General has been opposed to resale of military Humvees to the general public, primarily because surplus government vehicles would have cut into sales related to the civilian Hummer model, whose production ended in 2010.<ref>[http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/tech/2014/12/12/humvee-auctions-to-public-a-first/20300263/ Surplus Humvee auctions to public a first for DoD] \u2013 Armytimes.com, 12 December 2014</ref> The first sales from auction occurred on 17 December 2014 for 25 of the Humvees.

Primarily used by the [[United States Armed Forces|United States military]], it is also used by numerous other countries and organizations and even in civilian adaptations. The Humvee saw widespread use in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, where it navigated the treacherous desert terrain; this usage helped to inspire civilian [[Hummer]] versions. After going through a [[Humvee replacement process|replacement process]], the [[Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]] (JLTV) was chosen as its successor.\n\n==History==\nSince the [[World War II]] [[Willys MB|\u00bc-ton reconnaissance truck]] was green-lit for mass-deployment, and became known as the \"jeep\", the [[United States military]] had continued to rely heavily on jeeps as general utility vehicles, and as a mass-transport for soldiers in small groups. Although the US Army had let Ford redesign the jeep from the ground up during the 1950s, and the resulting [[M151 jeep]] incorporated significant innovations, it firmly adhered to the original concept\u2014a very compact, lightweight, low profile vehicle, with a folding windshield, that a layman could barely distinguish from the preceding Willys jeeps. The jeeps were shorter than a [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and weighed just over one metric ton, seating three with an {{convert|800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} payload. During and after the war, the very light, {{frac|1|4}}-ton jeeps were complemented by the {{frac|3|4}}-ton [[Dodge WC series|Dodge WC]] and Korea War [[Dodge M37|M37 models]].\n\nBy the mid-1960s, the U.S. military clearly felt a need to reevaluate their aging light vehicle fleet.<ref name=WHNhumV>{{cite web |url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-u-s-armys-humvee/ |title=The U.S. Army\u2019s Humvee |last=Mroz |first=Albert |date=16 June 2016 |website=Warfare History Network |publisher=Sovereign Media |access-date=2018-06-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618203631/http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-u-s-armys-humvee/ |archive-date=18 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> For starters, from the mid 1960s, the U.S. Army had tried to modernize, through replacing the larger, purpose-built [[Dodge M37]]s by militarized, \"commercial off the shelf\" (COTS) 4\u00d74 trucks\u2014initially the [[Kaiser Jeep M715|M715 Jeep trucks]], succeeded in the later 1970s by the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle#Dodge M8XX Series|Dodge M880]] series, but these didn't satisfy newer requirements either\u2014what was wanted was a truly versatile light military truck, that could replace multiple outdated vehicles.

The radiator was to be mounted high, sloping over the engine on a forward-hinged hood.\n\nOut of 61 companies that showed interest, only three submitted prototypes.<ref name=\"telegraph14march14\" /> In July 1979, [[AM General]], a subsidiary of [[American Motors Corporation]] began preliminary design work. Less than a year later, the first prototype was in testing. Chrysler Defense and Teledyne Continental also produced competing designs. In June 1981, the Army awarded AM General a contract for development of several more prototype vehicles to be delivered to the government for another series of tests. The original M998 A0 series had a curb weight of {{convert|5200|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, a payload of {{convert|2500|lbs|kg|abbr=on}}, a {{convert|6.2|L|cuin|abbr=on}} V-8 diesel engine and 6.3 L gasoline, and a three-speed automatic transmission.\n\nThe three companies were chosen to design and build eleven HMMWV prototypes, which covered over 600,000 miles in trials which included off-road courses in desert and arctic conditions.  AM General was awarded an initial contract in 1983 for 2,334 vehicles, the first batch of a five-year contract that would see 55,000 vehicles delivered to the U.S. military, including 39,000 vehicles for the Army; 72,000 vehicles had been delivered to U.S. and foreign customers by the Persian Gulf War of 1991, and 100,000 were delivered by the Humvee's 10th anniversary in 1995.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" /> Ft. Lewis, Washington and the 2nd Battalion 1st Infantry,  9th Infantry Division was the testing unit to employ HMMWV in the new concept of a motorized division. Yakima Training Center in Yakima, Washington was the main testing grounds for HMMWVs from 1985 through December 1991, when the motorized concept was abandoned and the division inactivated.\n\n===Usage in combat===\nHMMWVs first saw combat in [[Operation Just Cause]], the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]] in 1989.\n\nThe HMMWV was designed primarily for personnel and light cargo transport behind front lines, not as a front line fighting vehicle. Like the previous jeep, the basic HMMWV has no armor or protection against [[Weapon of mass destruction|chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear threats]]. Nevertheless, losses were relatively low in [[conventional warfare|conventional operations]], such as the [[Gulf War]]. Vehicles and crews suffered considerable damage and losses during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993 due to the nature of the urban engagement. However, the chassis survivability allowed the majority of those crews to return to safety, though the HMMWV was never designed to offer protection against intense small arms fire, much less [[machine gun]]s and [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s. With the rise of [[asymmetric warfare]] and [[low intensity conflict]]s, the HMMWV was pressed into service in urban combat roles for which it was not originally intended.<ref>[http://www.museum-mm.org/high-mobility-multipurpose-wheeled-vehicle-hmmwv/ HMMWV] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306035417/http://www.museum-mm.org/high-mobility-multipurpose-wheeled-vehicle-hmmwv/ |date=6 March 2017 }} museum-mm.org</ref>\n\nAfter [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] in [[Somalia]], the military recognized a need for a more protected HMMWV and AM General developed the M1114, an armored HMMWV to withstand small arms fire. The M1114 has been in production since 1996, seeing limited use in the [[Balkans]] before deployment to the [[Middle East]]. This design is superior to the M998 with a larger, more powerful [[turbocharger|turbocharged]] engine, [[air conditioning]], and a strengthened [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system. More importantly, it boasts a fully [[vehicle armor|armored]] passenger area protected by hardened steel and [[Bulletproof glass|bullet-resistant glass]]. With the increase in direct attacks and guerrilla warfare in Iraq, AM General diverted the majority of its manufacturing power to producing these vehicles.\n\nHumvees were sent into [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] following the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]], where they proved invaluable during initial operations. In the early years before IEDs became prevalent, the vehicle was liked by troops for its ability to access rough, mountainous terrain. Some soldiers would remove features from Humvees, including what little armor it had and sometimes even entire doors, to make them lighter and more maneuverable for off-road conditions and to increase visibility. With the onset of the [[Iraq War]], Humvees proved very vulnerable to IEDs; in the first four months of 2006, 67 U.S. troops died in Humvees. To increase protection, the U.S. military hastily added-on armor kits to the vehicles. Although this somewhat improved survivability, bolting on armor made the Humvee an \"ungainly beast\", increasing weight and putting strain on the chassis, which led to unreliability. Armored doors that weighed hundreds of pounds were difficult for troops to open and the newly armored turret made Humvees top heavy and increased the danger of rollovers. The U.S. Marine Corps decided to start replacing Humvees in combat with Mine-Resistant, Ambush Protected ([[MRAP]]) vehicles in 2007, and the U.S. Army stated that the vehicle was \"no longer feasible for combat\" in 2012.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" /><ref name=\"telegraph14march14\" />\n\nThe HMMWV has become the vehicular backbone of U.S. forces around the world.

The [[Boomerang (mobile shooter detection system)|Boomerang]] anti-[[sniper]] system was also fielded by some HMMWVs in Iraq to immediately give troops the location of insurgents firing on them.\n\nAnother weakness for the HMMWV has proven to be its size, which limited its deployment in [[Afghanistan]] because it is too wide for the smallest roads and too large for many forms of air transport compared to jeep or Land Rover-sized vehicles (which are nearly two feet narrower).

The HMMWV has evolved several times since its introduction and was used in tactical roles for which it was never originally intended. The military pursued several initiatives to replace it, both in the short and long terms. The short term replacement efforts utilized [[commercial off-the-shelf]] vehicles as part of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) program. These vehicles were procured to replace Humvees in combat theaters. The long term replacement for the Humvee is the JLTV which is designed from the ground up.  The [[Future Tactical Truck Systems]] (FTTS) program was initiated to make an analysis of potential requirements for a Humvee replacement. Various prototype vehicles such as the [[MillenWorks Light Utility Vehicle]], and the [[ULTRA AP]] have been constructed as part of these efforts. The JLTV contract was awarded to Oshkosh in August 2015.<ref name=\"Oshkosh JLTV Win\">{{cite web|publisher= Breaking Defense|url= http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/oshkosh-beats-lockheed-am-general-for-historic-jltv-win/|title= Oshkosh Beats Lockheed, AM General For Historic JLTV Win|accessdate= 26 August 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826062149/http://breakingdefense.com/2015/08/oshkosh-beats-lockheed-am-general-for-historic-jltv-win/|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Marine Corps issued a [[request for proposal]]s (RFP) in 2013 for its Humvee sustainment modification initiative to upgrade 6,700 expanded capacity vehicles (ECVs). The Marines plan to field the JLTV, but do not have enough funding to completely replace all Humvees, so they decided to continue sustaining their fleet. Key areas of improvement include upgrades to the suspension to reduce the amount of force transferred to the chassis, upgrading the engine and transmission for better fuel efficiency, enhancements to the cooling system to prevent overheating, a central tire inflation system to improve off-road mobility and ride quality, and increased underbody survivability. Testing of upgraded Humvees was to occur in 2014, with production and installation occurring from 2015 through 2018. Older A2 series Humvees make up half the current fleet, and 4,000 are to be disposed of through [[foreign military sales]] and transfers. By 2017, the Marines' light tactical vehicle fleet is to consist of 3,500 A2 series Humvees, 9,500 ECV Humvees, and 5,000 JLTVs, with 18,000 vehicles in total.

If converted to a UGV, the vehicle could serve as a mobile scout vehicle with armor features removed to enhance mobility and terrain accessibility, since there would be no occupants needed to protect.  Because there will still be tens of thousands of Humvees in the U.S. inventory after the JLTV enters service, it could be a low-cost way to build an unmanned combat vehicle fleet.  Autonomy features would allow the Humvees to drive themselves and one soldier to control a \"swarm\" of several vehicles.<ref name=\"army-tech30sep14\" />\n\nAlthough the Army plans to buy 49,100 JLTVs and the Marine Corps 5,500, they are not a one-for-one replacement for the Humvee and both services will still be left operating large fleets.  For the Marines, 69 JLTVs will replace the 74 Humvees in all active infantry battalions to cover its expeditionary forces. The Marine JLTV order is planned to be completed by 2022, leaving the remainder of the Corps' 13,000-strong Humvee force scattered around support organizations while soft-skinned Humvees will provide support behind the forward deployed [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]]. The Army does not plan to replace Humvees in the [[Army National Guard]], and is considering options on how many of its 120,000 vehicles will be replaced, sustained, or modernized.

In combat conditions, the HMMWV can be delivered by the [[Low Altitude Parachute Extraction System]] which pulls the vehicle out of the open rear ramp just above the ground without the aircraft having to land.\n\n[[File:US Navy 111114-N-KA046-134 A Humvee launches from a landing craft utility (LCU) assigned to the amphibious dock landing ship USS Whidbey Island (LS.jpg|thumb|Humvee fording]]\nThere are at least 17 variants of the HMMWV in service with the U.S. military. HMMWVs serve as cargo/troop carriers, automatic weapons platforms, [[ambulance]]s (four litter patients or eight ambulatory patients), M220 [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW missile]] carriers, [[M119 howitzer]] prime movers, [[AN/TWQ-1 Avenger|M1097 Avenger]] Pedestal Mounted Stinger platforms, MRQ-12 direct [[air support]] vehicles, S250 shelter carriers, and other roles. The HMMWV is capable of [[Wiktionary:ford|fording]] 2.5&nbsp;ft (76&nbsp;cm) normally, or 5&nbsp;ft (1.5&nbsp;m) with the deep-water fording kits installed.\n\n[[File:Hmmwv-036.jpg|thumb|left|A U.S. Army HMMWV firing a [[BGM-71 TOW]] missile.]]\nOptional equipment includes a winch (maximum load capacity {{convert|6000|lbs|kg|abbr=on}} and supplemental armor.

Recent improvements have also led to the development of the M1151 model, which quickly rendered the previous models obsolete. By replacing the M1114, M1116, and earlier armored HMMWV types with a single model, the U.S. Army hopes to lower maintenance costs.\n\nThe latest iteration of the Humvee series can be seen in the M1151A1 and later up-armored A1-versions.  It has a stronger suspension and larger 6.5 liter turbo-diesel engine to accommodate the weight of up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of additional armor.  The armor protection can be installed or taken off depending on the operating environment, so the vehicles can move more efficiently without armor when there is no threat of attack.  There is some underbody armor that moderately protects against mines and roadside bombs.  Other improvements include Vehicle Emergency Escape (VEE) windows that can be quickly removed so troops inside can escape in the event of a rollover, jammed door, or the vehicle catching fire, and a blast chimney that vents the force of a bomb blast upwards and away from the occupants.  The M1151A1 has a crew of four, can carry {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of payload, and can tow a {{convert|4,000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} load.

The vehicle features a [[monocoque]] [[V-hull|V-shaped hull]] and angled sides to help deflect [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s (RPGs) with scalable levels of protection.  It has greater engine power, replacing the 6.5 liter diesel engine with a [[Cummins]] 6.7 liter diesel and [[Allison Transmission|Allison]] 6-speed transmission, as well as a stronger suspension, improved brakes, higher ground clearance, and new onboard instrumentation.  Fuel capacity is increased from 27 gallons to 40 and the battery and fuel cells are moved from under the rear seat to the rear of the vehicle.  Also included are a powerful air conditioner and heating system, [[run-flat tire]]s, a thermal guard liner under the roof, sharp edges removed from inside the cabin, blast attenuating seats, and a folding gunner's turret allowing rapid deployment from a cargo aircraft or shipboard below deck.  Although heavier than the Humvee, the SCTV is half the weight and costs $150,000 less than a comparably survivable MRAP.  The basic version is a four-passenger armament carrier, but it can be configured as a nine-passenger troop carrier, air-defense vehicle, flatbed cargo truck, or field ambulance depending on the type of Humvee it is converted from.<ref name=\"armyreco21oct14\"/><ref name=\"defensenews13oct15\">[http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/show-daily/ausa/2015/10/13/textron-pitches-upgrade-extend-life-surplus-humvees/73889414/ Textron Pitches Upgrade To Extend Life of Surplus Humvees] \u2013 Defensenews.com, 13 October 2015</ref><ref name=\"defenseone13oct15\">[http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/10/ukraines-humvees-are-about-get-more-armor/122772/?oref=d-skybox In a Groundbreaking Deal, Ukraine May Buy US Armor for Its Humvees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015234334/http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2015/10/ukraines-humvees-are-about-get-more-armor/122772/?oref=d-skybox |date=15 October 2015 }} \u2013 Defenseone.com, 13 October 2015</ref>\n\nWork began on the SCTV in 2008 in anticipation of U.S. military upgrades, but it was shelved once they made the JLTV a priority.

The upgrade can enhance survivability of previously soft-skinned versions, sometimes sold by the U.S. as Excess Defense Articles, while costing and weighing less than a comparable MRAP.

While some have been transferred to domestic law enforcement agencies, this is the first time the military vehicles have been made available for civilian ownership. The idea is to sell them with starting bids at $10,000 each, for off-road use only, rather than simply scrapping them as a way to save money and repurpose them.  M998, M998A1, M1038, and M1038A1 model Humvees are available, which are out of U.S. service and lack armor.

Helen Hayes is regarded as one of the greatest leading ladies of the 20th-century theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theatrewashington.org/content/helen-hayes-remembrance|title=Helen Hayes: A Remembrance \u2013  Washington Theatre Guide \u2013 TheatreWashington \u2013 Helen Hayes Awards|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHelen Hayes Brown was born in Washington, D.C., on October 10, 1900.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor. She has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6220 Hollywood Blvd. Hayes is also in the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaterhalloffame.org/members.html#H|title=Members of the American Theater Hall of Fame|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHayes was a Catholic<ref>Hayes, Helen.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

It has no overall winner\u2014although American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] originally won the event, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]]; the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] has confirmed this verdict.\n\nThe favourite was Armstrong, at the time, winner in 1999, 2000 and [[2001 Tour de France|2001]]. The main opposition would probably come from the ONCE team with [[Joseba Beloki]] (3rd last year), [[Igor Gonz\u00e1lez de Galdeano]] (5th last year) and [[Marcos Serrano]] (9th last year), and from the Kelme riders [[\u00d3scar Sevilla]] (7th last year, 2nd in last year's [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]) and [[Santiago Botero]] (8th last year). Other riders to keep in account for a high place in the final rankings were [[Tyler Hamilton]] (2nd Giro 2002), [[Levi Leipheimer]] (3rd Vuelta 2001), [[Christophe Moreau]] (4th Tour 2000) and Armstrong's teammate [[Roberto Heras]] (4th Vuelta 2001).

Armstrong and his incredibly dominant US Postal team were not concerned with defending the [[Yellow Jersey]] in the early flat stages and it changed hands a few times. First it went to [[Rubens Bertogliati]] who wore it during Stage 2 and Stage 3, where [[Robbie McEwen]] defeated [[Erik Zabel]] in the sprint gaining enough time for the latter to wear the Maillot Jaune in Stage 4, which was a Team Time Trial. Team [[ONCE-Eroski]] won the TTT and their rider [[Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano]] took over the overall lead. At this point in the Tour all of the Top 10 overall riders were either members of team ONCE or US Postal Cycling Team, but with two more ITT's and the Mountain stages to come this meant nothing as far as the overall standings, although it did make clear the fact that these two teams were in command within the [[Peloton]].\n\nThe ensuing flat stages were won by [[Jaan Kirsipuu]], Erik Zabel, [[Bradley McGee]] and [[Karsten Kroon]] and by the end of Stage 8 places 1-7 were all riders for ONCE with Gonzalez leading his teammate [[Joseba Beloki]] by :04 for the overall lead as the next riders from other teams were Armstrong in 8th and [[Tyler Hamilton]] of team CSC in 9th.\n\nStage 9 was an Individual Time Trial won by [[Santiago Botero]] and perhaps surprisingly seven riders finished within one minute of the stage winner when it was assumed by pundits that very few riders would keep Armstrong (who finished 2nd) that close and nobody would beat him. Following the ITT Gonzalez was still in Yellow leading the GC with Armstrong in 2nd overall, Beloki in 3rd and because of their strong performances in the ITT [[Serhiy Gonchar]] and Botero moved into 4th and 5th place in the General Classification.\n\nStage 10 was a hilly stage with a sprint finish won by [[Patrice Halgand]] of team Jean Latour. In places 2-11 were [[Jerome Pineau]] of team Bonjour, [[Stuart O\u2019Grady]] of Credit Agricole, [[Ludo Dierckxsens]] of Lampre, [[Pedro Horrillo]] of Mapei, [[Andy Flickinger]] of AG2R, [[Nicolas Vogondy]] of FDJ, [[Nico Mattan]] of Cofidis, [[Constantino Zaballa]] of Kelme, [[Enrico Cassani]] of Domo and [[Unai Extebarria]] of Euskadel.\n\nSpanish team ONCE with Beloki, Gonzalez and [[Abraham Olano]], and American team US Postal with Armstrong, a young [[Floyd Landis]], [[Viatcheslav Ekimov]] and the dominant Spanish rider [[Roberto Heras]], a former [[Vuelta a Espana]] champion, would have the battle for the 2002 Tour de France in the mountains.\n\nIn Stage 11 [[Laurent Jalabert]] lead the stage from kilometer 6 all the way until kilometer 155 when Armstrong caught and dropped him 3&nbsp;km from the finish. US Postal controlled the pace of the Peloton for most of the race. Heras lead the way setting such a high pace that most of Armstrong's rivals were dropped before Armstrong even had to put in any work of his own, but when Armstrong finally did attack only his own teammate Heras and Beloki could stay with him, but before long Armstrong was on his own headed for the Yellow Jersey.\n\nIn Stage 12 Jalabert attacked early again with [[Isidro Nozal]] and [[Laurent Dufaux]] going with him. About halfway through the stage the chase-1 group was about 3:00 behind with [[Richard Virenque]], [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] and [[Alexandre Botcharov]] while once again US Postal with [[George Hincapie]] at the front dictated the pursuit of the main field/peloton just over 4:00 behind Jalabert, who was once again caught less than 10&nbsp;km from the finish after leading the race for most of the day.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf2002.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617065855/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf2002.html|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOnce again Heras fractured the group of the final ten elite riders left with only Armstrong and Beloki able to match his pace and once again when Armstrong launched his attack neither Heras or Beloki could go with him as they finished 2nd and 3rd to him 1:04 behind. Botero and Gonzalez were able to get within seven seconds of Heras and Beloki while Rumsas and [[Carlos Sastre]] finished about a minute and a half behind Armstrong.\n\nStage 13 was an intermediate stage and in the [[Green Jersey]] sprinters competition Erik Zabel and Robbie McEwen were only separated by one point. Laurent Jalabert's relentless attacks and combative riding was paying off as not only was he in the Polka Dot Jersey as [[King of the Mountains]] but he had also moved into a top 10 position in the overall standings. The stage was won by [[David Millar]] as the GC situation remained the same.\n\nArmstrong would only build on his lead as the race progressed and by the time the Tour crossed [[Mont Ventoux]], the [[Alps]] and arrived in [[Paris]] Beloki was still 2nd more than 7:00 behind as Rumsas completed the podium with Colombian rider Botero in 4th and Gonzalez in 5th. [[White Jersey]] winner [[Ivan Basso]] would finish 11th overall and would become one of the only serious challengers to [[Lance Armstrong]] in the coming Tours.\n\nFollowing the [[USADA]] decision ten years later, which was confirmed by the UCI, Armstrong had this, and every result after 1998 vacated. It was also decided it was best for the sport and as an example to riders of future generations that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place riders would not be moved up to 1st, 2nd and 3rd.\n\n===Doping===\n\n{{see also|Lance Armstrong doping case}}\n\nSubsequent to Armstrong's statement to withdraw his fight against [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]]'s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| title=Lance Armstrong will be banned from cycling by USADA after saying he won\u2019t fight doping charges| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=24 August 2012| accessdate=24 August 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160449/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| archive-date=14 October 2012| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=USADA to ban Armstrong for life, strip Tour titles|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824162637/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles/|archive-date=24 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes.<ref name=\"armstrong-usda\" /> On 22 October 2012, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.<ref name=\"armstrong-bbc\" />\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were several classifications in the 2002 Tour de France.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]], which was marked by the white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Laurent Jalabert won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=93}}\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of \u20ac3000, the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]] on stage 16, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col d'Aubisque]] on stage 11.

a [[race stage|multiple-stage]] [[bicycle racing|bicycle race]] held from 6 to 28 July, and the 89th edition of the [[Tour de France]]. The event started in [[Luxembourg City, Luxembourg|Luxembourg]] and ended in Paris. The Tour circled France counter-clockwise, visiting the [[Pyrenees]] before the [[Alps]]. It has no overall winner\u2014although American cyclist [[Lance Armstrong]] originally won the event, the [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]] announced in August 2012 that they had disqualified Armstrong from all his results since 1998, including his seven Tour de France wins from [[1999 Tour de France|1999]] to [[2005 Tour de France|2005]]; the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] has confirmed this verdict.\n\nThe favourite was Armstrong, at the time, winner in 1999, 2000 and [[2001 Tour de France|2001]]. The main opposition would probably come from the ONCE team with [[Joseba Beloki]] (3rd last year), [[Igor Gonz\u00e1lez de Galdeano]] (5th last year) and [[Marcos Serrano]] (9th last year), and from the Kelme riders [[\u00d3scar Sevilla]] (7th last year, 2nd in last year's [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]) and [[Santiago Botero]] (8th last year). Other riders to keep in account for a high place in the final rankings were [[Tyler Hamilton]] (2nd Giro 2002), [[Levi Leipheimer]] (3rd Vuelta 2001), [[Christophe Moreau]] (4th Tour 2000) and Armstrong's teammate [[Roberto Heras]] (4th Vuelta 2001). Important riders who were not present were [[Jan Ullrich]] (2nd last year, injury) and [[Gilberto Simoni]] (winner 2001 Giro).\n\n==Teams==\n{{main list|List of teams and cyclists in the 2002 Tour de France}}\n\nTeams qualified for the 2002 Tour de France by various methods.<ref name=\"cnpreview\"/> {{ct|USP|2002}} was selected because it included the winner of the previous edition, [[Lance Armstrong]]. {{ct|RAB|2002}} was selected because it included the winner of the [[2001 UCI Road World Cup]], [[Erik Dekker]]. {{ct|ALB|2002}}, {{ct|KEL|2002}} and {{ct|GCE|2002}} were selected because they won the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]]s in respectively the [[2001 Giro d'Italia]], [[2001 Tour de France]] and [[2001 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]].

Armstrong and his incredibly dominant US Postal team were not concerned with defending the [[Yellow Jersey]] in the early flat stages and it changed hands a few times. First it went to [[Rubens Bertogliati]] who wore it during Stage 2 and Stage 3, where [[Robbie McEwen]] defeated [[Erik Zabel]] in the sprint gaining enough time for the latter to wear the Maillot Jaune in Stage 4, which was a Team Time Trial. Team [[ONCE-Eroski]] won the TTT and their rider [[Igor Gonzalez de Galdeano]] took over the overall lead. At this point in the Tour all of the Top 10 overall riders were either members of team ONCE or US Postal Cycling Team, but with two more ITT's and the Mountain stages to come this meant nothing as far as the overall standings, although it did make clear the fact that these two teams were in command within the [[Peloton]].\n\nThe ensuing flat stages were won by [[Jaan Kirsipuu]], Erik Zabel, [[Bradley McGee]] and [[Karsten Kroon]] and by the end of Stage 8 places 1-7 were all riders for ONCE with Gonzalez leading his teammate [[Joseba Beloki]] by :04 for the overall lead as the next riders from other teams were Armstrong in 8th and [[Tyler Hamilton]] of team CSC in 9th.\n\nStage 9 was an Individual Time Trial won by [[Santiago Botero]] and perhaps surprisingly seven riders finished within one minute of the stage winner when it was assumed by pundits that very few riders would keep Armstrong (who finished 2nd) that close and nobody would beat him. Following the ITT Gonzalez was still in Yellow leading the GC with Armstrong in 2nd overall, Beloki in 3rd and because of their strong performances in the ITT [[Serhiy Gonchar]] and Botero moved into 4th and 5th place in the General Classification.\n\nStage 10 was a hilly stage with a sprint finish won by [[Patrice Halgand]] of team Jean Latour. In places 2-11 were [[Jerome Pineau]] of team Bonjour, [[Stuart O\u2019Grady]] of Credit Agricole, [[Ludo Dierckxsens]] of Lampre, [[Pedro Horrillo]] of Mapei, [[Andy Flickinger]] of AG2R, [[Nicolas Vogondy]] of FDJ, [[Nico Mattan]] of Cofidis, [[Constantino Zaballa]] of Kelme, [[Enrico Cassani]] of Domo and [[Unai Extebarria]] of Euskadel.\n\nSpanish team ONCE with Beloki, Gonzalez and [[Abraham Olano]], and American team US Postal with Armstrong, a young [[Floyd Landis]], [[Viatcheslav Ekimov]] and the dominant Spanish rider [[Roberto Heras]], a former [[Vuelta a Espana]] champion, would have the battle for the 2002 Tour de France in the mountains.\n\nIn Stage 11 [[Laurent Jalabert]] lead the stage from kilometer 6 all the way until kilometer 155 when Armstrong caught and dropped him 3&nbsp;km from the finish. US Postal controlled the pace of the Peloton for most of the race. Heras lead the way setting such a high pace that most of Armstrong's rivals were dropped before Armstrong even had to put in any work of his own, but when Armstrong finally did attack only his own teammate Heras and Beloki could stay with him, but before long Armstrong was on his own headed for the Yellow Jersey.\n\nIn Stage 12 Jalabert attacked early again with [[Isidro Nozal]] and [[Laurent Dufaux]] going with him. About halfway through the stage the chase-1 group was about 3:00 behind with [[Richard Virenque]], [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] and [[Alexandre Botcharov]] while once again US Postal with [[George Hincapie]] at the front dictated the pursuit of the main field/peloton just over 4:00 behind Jalabert, who was once again caught less than 10&nbsp;km from the finish after leading the race for most of the day.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf2002.html|title=Archived copy|access-date=17 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617065855/http://www.bikeraceinfo.com/tdf/tdf2002.html|archive-date=17 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOnce again Heras fractured the group of the final ten elite riders left with only Armstrong and Beloki able to match his pace and once again when Armstrong launched his attack neither Heras or Beloki could go with him as they finished 2nd and 3rd to him 1:04 behind. Botero and Gonzalez were able to get within seven seconds of Heras and Beloki while Rumsas and [[Carlos Sastre]] finished about a minute and a half behind Armstrong.\n\nStage 13 was an intermediate stage and in the [[Green Jersey]] sprinters competition Erik Zabel and Robbie McEwen were only separated by one point. Laurent Jalabert's relentless attacks and combative riding was paying off as not only was he in the Polka Dot Jersey as [[King of the Mountains]] but he had also moved into a top 10 position in the overall standings. The stage was won by [[David Millar]] as the GC situation remained the same.\n\nArmstrong would only build on his lead as the race progressed and by the time the Tour crossed [[Mont Ventoux]], the [[Alps]] and arrived in [[Paris]] Beloki was still 2nd more than 7:00 behind as Rumsas completed the podium with Colombian rider Botero in 4th and Gonzalez in 5th. [[White Jersey]] winner [[Ivan Basso]] would finish 11th overall and would become one of the only serious challengers to [[Lance Armstrong]] in the coming Tours.\n\nFollowing the [[USADA]] decision ten years later, which was confirmed by the UCI, Armstrong had this, and every result after 1998 vacated. It was also decided it was best for the sport and as an example to riders of future generations that the 2nd, 3rd and 4th place riders would not be moved up to 1st, 2nd and 3rd.\n\n===Doping===\n\n{{see also|Lance Armstrong doping case}}\n\nSubsequent to Armstrong's statement to withdraw his fight against [[United States Anti-Doping Agency]]'s (USADA) charges, on 24 August 2012, the USADA said it would ban Armstrong for life and stripped him of his record seven Tour de France titles.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| title=Lance Armstrong will be banned from cycling by USADA after saying he won\u2019t fight doping charges| work=[[The Washington Post]]| date=24 August 2012| accessdate=24 August 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014160449/http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/othersports/lance-armstrong-faces-lifetime-ban-from-usada-tour-de-france-titles-in-jeopardy/2012/08/24/053a2320-ed98-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html| archive-date=14 October 2012| url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=USADA to ban Armstrong for life, strip Tour titles|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles|work=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=24 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824162637/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57499550/usada-to-ban-armstrong-for-life-strip-tour-titles/|archive-date=24 August 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Later that day it was confirmed in a USADA statement that Armstrong was banned for life and would be disqualified from any and all competitive results obtained on and subsequent to 1 August 1998, including forfeiture of any medals, titles, winnings, finishes, points and prizes.<ref name=\"armstrong-usda\" /> On 22 October 2012, the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] endorsed the USADA sanctions, and decided not to award victories to any other rider or upgrade other placings in any of the affected events.<ref name=\"armstrong-bbc\" />\n\n==Classification leadership and minor prizes==\n\nThere were several classifications in the 2002 Tour de France.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013455}} The most important was the [[general classification in the Tour de France|general classification]], calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=452\u2013453}}\n\nAdditionally, there was a [[points classification in the Tour de France|points classification]], which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=453\u2013454}}\n\nThere was also a [[mountains classification in the Tour de France|mountains classification]]. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either ''[[hors cat\u00e9gorie]]'', first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and wore a white jersey with red [[polka dot]]s.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=454}}\n\nThe fourth individual classification was the [[Young rider classification in the Tour de France|young rider classification]], which was marked by the white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|pp=454\u2013455}}\n\nFor the [[Team classification in the Tour de France|team classification]], the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.{{sfn|Nauright|Parrish|2012|p=455}}\n\nIn addition, there was a [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] given after each [[Mass start|mass-start]] stage to the cyclist considered most combative, who wore a red number bib the next stage. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification.{{sfn|van den Akker|2018|pp=211\u2013216}} Laurent Jalabert won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award.{{sfn|Augendre|2016|p=93}}\n\nThere were also two special awards each with a prize of \u20ac3000, the [[Souvenir Henri Desgrange]], given in honour of Tour founder and first race director [[Henri Desgrange]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col du Galibier]] on stage 16, and the [[Souvenir Jacques Goddet]], given in honour of the second director [[Jacques Goddet]] to the first rider to pass the summit of the [[Col d'Aubisque]] on stage 11.
