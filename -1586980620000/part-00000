Boosting can more than double the weapon's fission energy yield.\n* '''[[thermonuclear weapon|staged thermonuclear weapons]]''' are essentially arrangements of two or more \"stages\", most usually two. The first stage is always a boosted fission weapon as above. Its detonation causes it to shine intensely with x-radiation, which illuminates and implodes the second stage filled with a large quantity of fusion fuel. This sets in motion a sequence of events which results in a thermonuclear, or fusion, burn. This process affords potential yields up to hundreds of times those of fission weapons.<ref>\n{{Citation\n|last = Life Editors\n|year = 1961\n|title = To the Outside World, a Superbomb more Bluff than Bang\n|periodical = [[Life (magazine)|Life]]\n|location = New York\n|issue = Vol. 51, No. 19, November 10, 1961\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=4VMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|pages = 34\u201337\n|accessdate = 2010-06-28\n}}. Article on the Soviet [[Tsar Bomba]] test. Because explosions are spherical in shape and targets are spread out on the relatively flat surface of the earth, numerous smaller weapons cause more destruction. From page 35: \"... five five-megaton weapons would demolish a greater area than a single 50-megatonner.\"</ref>\n\nA fourth type, '''[[pure fusion weapon]]s''', is a purely theoretical possibility. Such weapons would produce far fewer radioactive byproducts than current designs, although they would release huge numbers of neutrons.\n\nPure fission weapons historically have been the first type to be built by new nuclear powers. Large industrial states with well-developed nuclear arsenals have two-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost effective option once the necessary technical base and industrial infrastructure are built.\n\nMost known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States, although some were later developed independently by other states.<ref>The United States and the Soviet Union were the only nations to build large nuclear arsenals with every possible type of nuclear weapon. The U.S. had a four-year head start and was the first to produce fissile material and fission weapons, all in 1945. The only Soviet claim for a design first was the [[Joe 4]] detonation on August 12, 1953, said to be the first deliverable hydrogen bomb. However, as Herbert York first revealed in ''The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the Superbomb'' (W.H. Freeman, 1976), it was not a true hydrogen bomb (it was a boosted fission weapon of the Sloika/Alarm Clock type, not a two-stage thermonuclear). Soviet dates for the essential elements of warhead miniaturization \u2013 boosted, hollow-pit, two-point, air lens primaries \u2013 are not available in the open literature, but the larger size of Soviet ballistic missiles is often explained as evidence of an initial Soviet difficulty in miniaturizing warheads.</ref> \n\nIn early news accounts, pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or '''A-bombs''' and weapons involving fusion were called '''hydrogen bombs''' or '''H-bombs'''. Practitioners, however, favor the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.\n\n{{nuclear weapons}}\n\n==Nuclear reactions==\nNuclear fission separates or splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms. Nuclear fusion combines lighter atoms to form heavier atoms. Both reactions generate roughly a million times more energy than comparable chemical reactions, making nuclear bombs a million times more powerful than non-nuclear bombs, which a French patent claimed in May 1939.<ref>{{cite patent\n |title            = Perfectionnements aux charges explosives (Improvements to explosive charges)\n |url              = http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC%3DFR&NR%3D971324&KC%3D&FT%3DE\n |inventor1-last   = [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Caisse Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (National Fund for Scientific Research)]]\n |date = 16 January 1951\n |issue-date       = 12 July 1950\n |country-code     = fr\n |description      = \n |patent-number    = 971324\n}}.{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn some ways, fission and fusion are opposite and complementary reactions, but the particulars are unique for each. To understand how nuclear weapons are designed, it is useful to know the important similarities and differences between fission and fusion. The following explanation uses rounded numbers and approximations.<ref>The main source for this section is Samuel Glasstone and Philip Dolan, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Third Edition, 1977, U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of Energy (see links in General References, below), with the same information in more detail in Samuel Glasstone, ''Sourcebook on Atomic Energy'', Third Edition, 1979, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Krieger Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Fission===\n{{Main|Nuclear fission}}\nWhen a free neutron hits the nucleus of a fissile atom like [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U), the uranium nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei called fission fragments, plus more neutrons. Fission can be self-sustaining because it produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions.\n\nThe U-235 nucleus can split in many ways, provided the atomic numbers add up to 92 and the atomic masses add to 236 (uranium plus the extra neutron). The following equation shows one possible split, namely into [[strontium|strontium-95]] (<sup>95</sup>Sr), [[xenon|xenon-139]] (<sup>139</sup>Xe), and two neutrons (n), plus energy:<ref>Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', p. 12.</ref>\n:::<math>\\ {}^{235}\\mathrm{U} + \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow {}^{95}\\mathrm{Sr} + {}^{139}\\mathrm{Xe} + 2\\ \\mathrm{n} + 180\\ \\mathrm{MeV}</math>\n\nThe immediate energy release per atom is about 180 million [[electron volt]]s (MeV); i.e., 74 TJ/kg. Only 7% of this is gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons. The remaining 93% is kinetic energy (or energy of motion) of the charged fission fragments, flying away from each other mutually repelled by the positive charge of their protons (38 for strontium, 54 for xenon). This initial kinetic energy is 67 TJ/kg, imparting an initial speed of about 12,000 kilometers per second. The charged fragments' high electric charge causes many inelastic collisions with nearby atoms, and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb's uranium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] and [[neutron reflector|tamper]] until their motion is converted into heat. This takes about a millionth of a second (a microsecond), by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius.\n\nThis is hot enough to emit [[black-body radiation]] in the X-ray spectrum. These X-rays are absorbed by the surrounding air, producing the fireball and blast of a nuclear explosion.\n\nMost fission products have too many neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by [[beta decay]], converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons) and gamma rays. Their half lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays may be required to reach stability.<ref>Glasstone, ''Sourcebook'', p. 503.</ref> In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become radioactive fallout, both local and global.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the exploding bomb, the free neutrons released by fission carry away about 3% of the initial fission energy. Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb, but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments, since neutrons are not slowed as quickly. The main contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb's power is the initiation of other fissions. Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core, but the rest strike U-235 nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Starting from one atom, the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond, which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain. In practice, bombs do not contain hundreds of tons of uranium or plutonium. Instead, typically (in a modern weapon) the core of a weapon contains only about 5 kilograms of plutonium, of which only 2 to 2.5 kilograms, representing 40 to 50 kilotons of energy, undergoes fission before the core blows itself apart.\n\nHolding an exploding bomb together is the greatest challenge of fission weapon design. The heat of fission rapidly expands the fission core, spreading apart the target nuclei and making space for the neutrons to escape without being captured. The chain reaction stops.\n\nMaterials which can sustain a chain reaction are called [[fissile]]. The two fissile materials used in nuclear weapons are: U-235, also known as [[highly enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium (HEU)|highly enriched uranium]] (HEU), oralloy (Oy) meaning Oak Ridge Alloy, or 25 (the last digits of the atomic number, which is 92 for uranium, and the atomic weight, here 235, respectively); and Pu-239, also known as plutonium, or 49 (from 94 and 239).\n\nUranium's most common isotope, U-238, is fissionable but not fissile (meaning that it cannot sustain a chain reaction by itself but can be made to fission with fast neutrons). Its aliases include natural or unenriched uranium, [[depleted uranium]] (DU), [[Tube Alloys|tubealloy (Tu)]], and 28. It cannot sustain a chain reaction, because its own fission neutrons are not powerful enough to cause more U-238 fission. The neutrons released by fusion will fission U-238. This U-238 fission reaction produces most of the energy in a typical two-stage thermonuclear weapon.\n\n===Fusion===\n{{Main|Nuclear fusion}}\nFusion produces neutrons which dissipate energy from the reaction.<ref>\"neutrons carry off most of the reaction energy\", Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', p. 21.</ref> In weapons, the most important fusion reaction is called the D-T reaction. Using the heat and pressure of fission, hydrogen-2, or deuterium (<sup>2</sup>D), fuses with hydrogen-3, or tritium (<sup>3</sup>T), to form helium-4 (<sup>4</sup>He) plus one neutron (n) and energy:<ref name=\"fusionmath\"/>\n:::<math>{}^2\\mathrm{D} + {}^3\\mathrm{T} \\longrightarrow {}^4\\mathrm{He} + n + 17.6\\ \\mathrm{MeV} </math>\n\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|right|200 px]]\nThe total energy output, 17.6 MeV, is one tenth of that with fission, but the ingredients are only one-fiftieth as massive, so the energy output per unit mass is approximately five times as great. In this fusion reaction, 14 of the 17.6 MeV (80% of the energy released in the reaction) shows up as the kinetic energy of the neutron, which, having no electric charge and being almost as massive as the hydrogen nuclei that created it, can escape the scene without leaving its energy behind to help sustain the reaction \u2013 or to generate x-rays for blast and fire.\n\nThe only practical way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough to fission both <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U) or plutonium, the result is fission and the release of 180 MeV of fission energy, multiplying the energy output tenfold.\n\nFor weapon use, fission is necessary to start fusion, helps to sustain fusion, and captures and multiplies the energy carried by the fusion neutrons. In the case of a neutron bomb (see below), the last-mentioned factor does not apply, since the objective is to facilitate the escape of neutrons, rather than to use them to increase the weapon's raw power.\n\n===Tritium production===\nA third important nuclear reaction is the one that creates [[tritium]], essential to the type of fusion used in weapons. Tritium, or hydrogen-3, is made by bombarding [[isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]] (<sup>6</sup>Li) with a [[neutron]] (n). This neutron bombardment will cause the lithium-6 nucleus to split, producing [[helium]]-4 (<sup>4</sup>He) plus tritium (<sup>3</sup>T) and energy:<ref name=\"fusionmath\"/>\n:::<math>{}^6\\mathrm{Li} + n \\longrightarrow {}^4\\mathrm{He} + {}^3\\mathrm{T} + 5\\ \\mathrm{MeV} </math>\n\nA nuclear reactor is necessary to provide the neutrons if the tritium is to be provided before the weapon is used. The industrial-scale conversion of lithium-6 to tritium is very similar to the conversion of uranium-238 into plutonium-239. In both cases the feed material is placed inside a nuclear reactor and removed for processing after a period of time.\n\nAlternatively, neutrons from earlier stage fusion reactions can be used to [[nuclear fission|fission]] lithium-6 (in the form of [[lithium deuteride]] for example) and form tritium during detonation. This approach reduces the amount of tritium-based fuel in a weapon.<ref>Martin, James E. ''Physics for Radiation Protection''. WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, 2006, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe fission of one plutonium atom releases ten times more total energy than the fusion of one tritium atom. For this reason, tritium is included in nuclear weapon components only when it causes more fission than its production sacrifices, namely in the case of fusion-boosted fission.\n\nOf the four basic types of nuclear weapon, the first, pure fission, uses the first of the three nuclear reactions above. The second, fusion-boosted fission, uses the first two. The third, two-stage thermonuclear, uses all three.\n\n==Pure fission weapons==\n\nThe first task of a nuclear weapon design is to rapidly assemble a [[critical mass|supercritical mass]] of fissile uranium or plutonium. A supercritical mass is one in which the percentage of fission-produced neutrons captured by another fissile nucleus is large enough that each fission event, on average, causes more than one additional fission event.\n\nOnce the critical mass is assembled, at maximum density, a burst of neutrons is supplied to start as many chain reactions as possible. Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator codenamed \"[[Urchin (detonator)|Urchin]]\" inside the pit containing [[polonium]]-210 and [[beryllium]] separated by a thin barrier. Implosion of the pit crushed the neutron generator, mixing the two metals, thereby allowing alpha particles from the polonium to interact with beryllium to produce free neutrons. In modern weapons, the [[neutron generator]] is a high-voltage vacuum tube containing a [[particle accelerator]] which bombards a deuterium/tritium-metal hydride target with deuterium and tritium [[ion]]s. The resulting small-scale fusion produces neutrons at a protected location outside the physics package, from which they penetrate the pit. This method allows better control of the timing of chain reaction initiation.\n\nThe critical mass of an uncompressed sphere of bare metal is {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for uranium-235 and {{convert|16|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for delta-phase plutonium-239. In practical applications, the amount of material required for criticality is modified by shape, purity, density, and the proximity to [[neutron reflector|neutron-reflecting material]], all of which affect the escape or capture of neutrons.\n\nTo avoid a chain reaction during handling, the fissile material in the weapon must be sub-critical before detonation. It may consist of one or more components containing less than one uncompressed critical mass each. A thin hollow shell can have more than the bare-sphere critical mass, as can a cylinder, which can be arbitrarily long without ever reaching criticality.\n\nA ''tamper'' is an optional layer of dense material surrounding the fissile material. Due to its [[inertia]] it delays the expansion of the reacting material, increasing the efficiency of the weapon. Often the same layer serves both as tamper and as neutron reflector.\n\n===Gun-type assembly weapon===\n[[File:Gun-type fission weapon en-labels thin lines.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram of a gun-type fission weapon]]\n{{Main|Gun-type fission weapon}}\n[[Little Boy]], the Hiroshima bomb, used {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of uranium with an average enrichment of around 80%, or {{convert|51|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of U-235, just about the bare-metal critical mass. (See [[Little Boy#Assembly details|Little Boy]] article for a detailed drawing.) When assembled inside its tamper/reflector of [[tungsten carbide]], the {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was more than twice critical mass. Before the detonation, the uranium-235 was formed into two sub-critical pieces, one of which was later fired down a gun barrel to join the other, starting the nuclear explosion. Analysis shows that less than 2% of the uranium mass underwent fission;<ref>Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', pp. 12\u201313. When 454 g (one pound) of U-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 13 to 16-kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than {{convert|2|lb|g}} of U-235, out of the {{convert|141|lb|g}} in the pit. Thus, the remaining {{convert|139|lb|kg}}, 98.5% of the total, contributed nothing to the energy yield.</ref> the remainder, representing most of the entire wartime output of the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|giant Y-12 factories]] at Oak Ridge, scattered uselessly.<ref>Compere, A.L., and Griffith, W.L. 1991. \"The U.S. Calutron Program for Uranium Enrichment: History,.

The total wartime output of Oralloy produced at Oak Ridge by July 28, 1945 was 165 pounds (74.68 kg). Of this amount, 84% was scattered over Hiroshima (see previous footnote).</ref>\n\nThe inefficiency was caused by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a [[gun-type fission weapon#US nuclear artillery|gun-type warhead]] fired from the barrel of a much larger gun). Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for a significant fraction of the U-235 in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers. The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun-type design.\n\n===Implosion-type weapon===\n[[File:Implosion Nuclear weapon.svg|right|350px]]\nFor both the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity device]] and the [[Fat Man]], the Nagasaki bomb, nearly identical plutonium fission through implosion designs were used. The Fat Man device specifically used {{convert|6.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|350|ml|usoz|abbr=on|disp=or}} in volume, of [[Pu-239]], which is only 41% of bare-sphere critical mass. (See [[Fat Man#Interior of bomb|Fat Man]] article for a detailed drawing.) Surrounded by a [[uranium-238|U-238]] reflector/tamper, the Fat Man's pit was brought close to critical mass by the neutron-reflecting properties of the U-238. During detonation, criticality was achieved by implosion. The plutonium pit was squeezed to increase its density by simultaneous detonation, as with the \"Trinity\" test detonation three weeks earlier, of the conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The explosives were detonated by multiple [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. It is estimated that only about 20% of the plutonium underwent fission; the rest, about {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, was scattered.\n\n[[File:Implosion bomb animated.gif|left|175px]]\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|right|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high explosive lens system.]]\n\nAn implosion shock wave might be of such short duration that only part of the pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the explosive lens and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low [[density]] [[metal]] \u2013 such as [[aluminium]], [[beryllium]], or an [[alloy]] of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium pusher.\n\nThe series of [[RaLa Experiment]] tests of implosion-type fission weapon design concepts, carried out from July 1944 through February 1945 at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] and a remote site 14.3&nbsp;km (9 miles) east of it in Bayo Canyon, proved the practicality of the implosion design for a fission device, with the February 1945 tests positively determining its usability for the final Trinity/Fat Man plutonium implosion design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoddeson |first=Lillian |date=2004 |title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years, 1943\u20131945 |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=271 |isbn=978-0-521-54117-6|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe key to Fat Man's greater efficiency was the inward momentum of the massive U-238 tamper. (The natural uranium tamper did not undergo fission from thermal neutrons, but did contribute perhaps 20% of the total yield from fission by fast neutrons). Once the chain reaction started in the plutonium, the momentum of the implosion had to be reversed before expansion could stop the fission. By holding everything together for a few hundred nanoseconds more, the efficiency was increased.\n\n====Plutonium pit====\n{{Main|Pit (nuclear weapon)}}\nThe core of an implosion weapon \u2013 the fissile material and any reflector or tamper bonded to it \u2013 is known as the ''pit''. Some weapons tested during the 1950s used pits made with [[uranium-235|U-235]] alone, or in [[composite material|composite]] with [[plutonium]],<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html \"Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1945 until Present\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423121258/https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html |date=April 23, 2016}} \u2013 \"Fact that plutonium and uranium may be bonded to each other in unspecified pits or weapons.\"</ref> but all-plutonium pits are the smallest in diameter and have been the standard since the early 1960s.\n\nCasting and then machining plutonium is difficult not only because of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different [[allotropes of plutonium|metallic phases]]. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30\u201335 mMol (0.9\u20131.0% by weight) [[gallium]], forming a [[plutonium-gallium alloy]], which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range.<ref name=\"RDD-7\"/> When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] [[metal]]s would also work, but gallium has a small neutron [[absorption cross section]] and helps protect the plutonium against [[corrosion]]. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to [[plutonium dioxide]] for [[nuclear reactor|power reactors]], there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.\n\nBecause plutonium is chemically reactive it is common to plate the completed pit with a thin layer of inert metal, which also reduces the toxic hazard.<ref name=\"NWFAQ-6.2\"/> [[The gadget]] used galvanic silver plating; afterwards, [[nickel]] deposited from [[nickel tetracarbonyl]] vapors was used,<ref name=\"NWFAQ-6.2\"/> [[gold]] was preferred for many years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009|reason=not found in nuclearweaponarchive.org cite}} Recent designs improve safety by plating pits with [[vanadium]] to make the pits more fire-resistant.\n\n===Levitated-pit implosion===\nThe first improvement on the Fat Man design was to put an air space between the tamper and the pit to create a hammer-on-nail impact. The pit, supported on a hollow cone inside the tamper cavity, was said to be levitated. The three tests of [[Operation Sandstone]], in 1948, used Fat Man designs with levitated pits. The largest yield was 49 kilotons, more than twice the yield of the unlevitated Fat Man.<ref>All information on nuclear weapon tests comes from Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development since 1945'', October 1995, Chucklea Productions, Volume VIII, p. 154, Table A-1, \"U.S. Nuclear Detonations and Tests, 1945\u20131962\".</ref>\n\nIt was immediately clear that implosion was the best design for a fission weapon. Its only drawback seemed to be its diameter. Fat Man was {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} wide vs {{convert|61|cm|ft|0}} for Little Boy.\n\nEleven years later, implosion designs had advanced sufficiently that the {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on|0}}-diameter sphere of Fat Man had been reduced to a {{convert|0.3|m|ft|adj=on|0}}-diameter cylinder {{convert|0.61|m|ft|0}} long, the [[Swan (nuclear explosive)|Swan]] device.\n\nThe Pu-239 pit of Fat Man was only {{convert|9.1|cm|in}} in diameter, the size of a softball. The bulk of Fat Man's girth was the implosion mechanism, namely concentric layers of U-238, aluminium, and high explosives. The key to reducing that girth was the two-point implosion design.\n\n===Two-point linear implosion===\n[[File:Linear implosion schematic.svg|right|350 px]]\nIn the two-point linear implosion, the nuclear fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within the center of a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed at either end of the explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or ''shaper'', is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inwards from the shaper.<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.3 Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 4.1.6.3 Hybrid Assembly Techniques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419071500/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.3 |date=April 19, 2016}}, accessed December 1, 2007. Drawing adapted from the same source.</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of a tamper or lenses to shape the progression, the detonation does not reach the pit in a spherical shape. To produce the desired spherical implosion, the fissile material itself is shaped to produce the same effect. Due to the physics of the shock wave propagation within the explosive mass, this requires the pit to be an oblong shape, roughly egg shaped. The shock wave first reaches the pit at its tips, driving them inward and causing the mass to become spherical. The shock may also change plutonium from delta to alpha phase, increasing its density by 23%, but without the inward momentum of a true implosion.\n\nThe lack of compression makes such designs inefficient, but the simplicity and small diameter make it suitable for use in artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions \u2013 ADMs \u2013 also known as backpack or [[suitcase nuke]]s; an example is the [[W48]] artillery shell, the smallest nuclear weapon ever built or deployed. All such low-yield battlefield weapons, whether gun-type U-235 designs or linear implosion Pu-239 designs, pay a high price in fissile material in order to achieve diameters between six and ten inches (15 and 25&nbsp;cm).\n\n====List of US linear implosion weapons====\nArtillery\n*[[W48]] (1963\u20131992)\n*[[W74]] (cancelled)\n*[[W74|W75]] (cancelled)\n*[[W79]] Mod 1 (1976\u20131992)\n*[[W82]] Mod 1 (cancelled)\n\n===Two-point hollow-pit implosion===\nA more efficient two-point implosion system uses two high explosive lenses and a hollow pit.\n\nA hollow plutonium pit was the original plan for the 1945 Fat Man bomb, but there was not enough time to develop and test the implosion system for it. A simpler solid-pit design was considered more reliable, given the time constraints, but it required a heavy U-238 tamper, a thick aluminium pusher, and three tons of high explosives.\n\nAfter the war, interest in the hollow pit design was revived. Its obvious advantage is that a hollow shell of plutonium, shock-deformed and driven inward toward its empty center, would carry momentum into its violent assembly as a solid sphere. It would be self-tamping, requiring a smaller U-238 tamper, no aluminium pusher and less high explosive.\n\nThe Fat Man bomb had two concentric, spherical shells of high explosives, each about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} thick. The inner shell drove the implosion. The outer shell consisted of a [[truncated icosahedron|soccer-ball pattern]] of 32 high explosive lenses, each of which converted the convex wave from its detonator into a concave wave matching the contour of the outer surface of the inner shell. If these 32 lenses could be replaced with only two, the high explosive sphere could become an ellipsoid (prolate spheroid) with a much smaller diameter.\n\nA good illustration of these two features is a 1956 drawing from the [[Swedish nuclear weapons program]] (which was terminated before it produced a test explosion). The drawing shows the essential elements of the two-point hollow-pit design.{{Citation needed|reason=Given the state of the SV weapons programme at this date, the diagram seems not to be indicative of the actual modalities, if any, of two-point designs.|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Swedish Atomic Bomb.png|center]]\n\nThere are similar drawings in the open literature from the French program, which produced an arsenal.{{Citation needed|reason=If it is open, all the reason to cite it|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe mechanism of the high explosive lens (diagram item #6) is not shown in the Swedish drawing, but a standard lens made of fast and slow high explosives, as in Fat Man, would be much longer than the shape depicted. For a single high explosive lens to generate a concave wave that envelops an entire hemisphere, it must either be very long or the part of the wave on a direct line from the detonator to the pit must be slowed dramatically.\n\nA slow high explosive is too fast, but the flying plate of an \"air lens\" is not. A metal plate, shock-deformed and pushed across an empty space, can be designed to move slowly enough.<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.2 Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 4.1.6.2.2.4 Cylindrical and Planar Shock Techniques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419071500/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.2 |date=April 19, 2016}}, accessed December 1, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html#I48 \"Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1946 until Present\", Section V.B.2.k] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423121258/https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html#I48 |date=April 23, 2016}} \"The fact of use in high explosive assembled (HEA) weapons of spherical shells of fissile materials, sealed pits; air and ring HE lenses\", declassified November 1972.</ref> A two-point implosion system using air lens technology can have a length no more than twice its diameter, as in the Swedish diagram above.\n\n==Fusion-boosted fission weapons==\n{{Main|Boosted fission weapon}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nThe next step in miniaturization was to speed up the fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy in the case of a hollow pit.\n\nThe easiest fusion reaction to achieve is found in a 50\u201350 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For [[fusion power]] experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times in order to have an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the goal is not to produce efficient fusion, but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the final outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times (in fusion terms) found in the center of a hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.\n\nIn the boosted design, the fusion fuel in gas form is pumped into the pit during arming. This will fuse into helium and release free neutrons soon after fission begins. The neutrons will start a large number of new chain reactions while the pit is still critical or nearly critical. Once the hollow pit is perfected, there is little reason not to boost; deuterium and tritium are easily produced in the small quantities needed, and the technical aspects are trivial.\n\nThe concept of fusion-boosted fission was first tested on May 25, 1951, in the [[Greenhouse Item|Item]] shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], [[Enewetak Atoll|Eniwetok]], yield 45.5 kilotons.\n\nBoosting reduces diameter in three ways, all the result of faster fission:\n* Since the compressed pit does not need to be held together as long, the massive U-238 tamper can be replaced by a light-weight beryllium shell (to reflect escaping neutrons back into the pit). The diameter is reduced.\n* The mass of the pit can be reduced by half, without reducing yield. Diameter is reduced again.\n* Since the mass of the metal being imploded (tamper plus pit) is reduced, a smaller charge of high explosive is needed, reducing diameter even further.\n\nSince boosting is required to attain full design yield, any reduction in boosting reduces yield. Boosted weapons are thus [[variable yield|variable-yield]] weapons (also known as dial-a-yield); yield can be reduced any time before detonation simply by reducing the amount of deuterium/tritium inserted into the pit during the arming procedure.\n\n[[File:U.S. Swan Device.svg|center]]\n\nThe first device whose dimensions suggest employment of all these features (two-point, hollow-pit, fusion-boosted implosion) was the [[Swan (nuclear primary)|Swan]] device. It had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of {{convert|11.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} and a length of {{convert|22.8|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nIt was first tested standalone and then as the primary of a two-stage thermonuclear device during [[Operation Redwing]]. It was weaponized as the [[Robin primary]] and became the first off-the-shelf, multi-use primary, and the prototype for all that followed.\n\n[[File:Nuclear Weapon Miniaturization.png|400px|right]]\n\nAfter the success of Swan, {{convert|11|or|12|in|cm}} seemed to become the standard diameter of boosted single-stage devices tested during the 1950s. Length was usually twice the diameter, but one such device, which became the [[W54]] warhead, was closer to a sphere, only {{convert|15|in|cm}} long. It was tested two dozen times in the 1957\u201362 period before being deployed. No other design had such a long string of test failures.\n\nOne of the applications of the W54 was the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett XM-388 recoilless rifle projectile]]. It had a dimension of just {{convert|11|in|cm}}, and is shown here in comparison to its Fat Man predecessor ({{convert|60|in|cm}}).\n\nAnother benefit of boosting, in addition to making weapons smaller, lighter, and with less fissile material for a given yield, is that it renders weapons immune to radiation interference (RI). It was discovered in the mid-1950s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial [[predetonation]] if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion (electronics might also be damaged, but this was a separate problem). RI was a particular problem before effective [[early warning radar]] systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless. Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in a weapon to below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect.\n\n==Two-stage thermonuclear weapons==\n{{Main|Thermonuclear weapon}}\n\nPure fission or fusion-boosted fission weapons can be made to yield hundreds of kilotons, at great expense in fissile material and tritium, but by far the most efficient way to increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so kilotons is to add a second independent stage, called a secondary.\n\n[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ivy Mike]], the first two-stage thermonuclear detonation, 10.4 megatons, November 1, 1952.]]\n\nIn the 1940s, bomb designers at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] thought the secondary would be a canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form. The fusion reaction would be D-D, harder to achieve than D-T, but more affordable. A fission bomb at one end would shock-compress and heat the near end, and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end. Mathematical simulations showed it would not work, even with large amounts of expensive tritium added.\n\nThe entire fusion fuel canister would need to be enveloped by fission energy, to both compress and heat it, as with the booster charge in a boosted primary. The design breakthrough came in January 1951, when [[Edward Teller]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented radiation implosion \u2013 for nearly three decades known publicly only as the [[Teller-Ulam]] H-bomb secret.<ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/35680 So I pieced together from Edward's testament and from his memoir that Stan had come to him in February of 1951] American Institute of Physics interview with Richard Garwin by Ken Ford, dated December 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/28636-1 he was going to use first hydrodynamics and just the shockwaves and then neutron heating, which would have been a disaster.

The first full test was on November 1, 1952, the [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] shot of [[Operation Ivy]], Eniwetok, yield 10.4 megatons.\n\nIn radiation implosion, the burst of X-ray energy coming from an exploding primary is captured and contained within an opaque-walled radiation channel which surrounds the nuclear energy components of the secondary. The radiation quickly turns the plastic foam that had been filling the channel into a plasma which is mostly transparent to X-rays, and the radiation is absorbed in the outermost layers of the pusher/tamper surrounding the secondary, which ablates and applies a massive force<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-4.html#Nfaq4.4.3.3 4.4 Elements of Thermonuclear Weapon Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311152031/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-4.html#Nfaq4.4.3.3 |date=March 11, 2016}}.

As the secondary implodes a fissile \"spark plug\" at its center ignites and provides neutrons and heat which enable the lithium deuteride fusion fuel to produce tritium and ignite as well. The fission and fusion chain reactions exchange neutrons with each other and boost the efficiency of both reactions. The greater implosive force, enhanced efficiency of the fissile \"spark plug\" due to boosting via fusion neutrons, and the fusion explosion itself provide significantly greater explosive yield from the secondary despite often not being much larger than the primary.\n\n[[File:TellerUlamAblation.png|center|thumb|700px|Ablation mechanism firing sequence.\n{{Ordered list\n|Warhead before firing.

The Flute was {{convert|15|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|23.4|in|cm}} long, about the size of the Swan. But it weighed ten times as much and yielded 24 times as much energy (355 kilotons, vs 15 kilotons).\n\nEqually important, the active ingredients in the Flute probably cost no more than those in the Swan. Most of the fission came from cheap U-238, and the tritium was manufactured in place during the explosion. Only the spark plug at the axis of the secondary needed to be fissile.\n\nA spherical secondary can achieve higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes in from all directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one megaton, the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications. A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases. The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields of a few hundred kilotons.\n\nAs with boosting, the advantages of the two-stage thermonuclear design are so great that there is little incentive not to use it, once a nation has mastered the technology.\n\nIn engineering terms, radiation implosion allows for the exploitation of several known features of nuclear bomb materials which heretofore had eluded practical application. For example:\n* The optimal way to store deuterium in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope is also the raw material for tritium production, and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D-T fusion reaction without any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.\n* For the secondary to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool for the first microsecond, i.e., it must be encased in a massive radiation (heat) shield. The shield's massiveness allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D-T fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep the secondary cool; to hold it, inertially, in a highly compressed state; and, finally, to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb. Insiders never used the term \"hydrogen bomb\".<ref>Until a reliable design was worked out in the early 1950s, the hydrogen bomb (public name) was called the superbomb by insiders. After that, insiders used a more descriptive name: two-stage thermonuclear. Two examples. From Herb York, ''The Advisors'', 1976, \"This book is about ... the development of the H-bomb, or the superbomb as it was then called.\" p. ix, and \"The rapid and successful development of the superbomb (or super as it came to be called) ...\" p. 5. From National Public Radio Talk of the Nation, November 8, 2005, Siegfried Hecker of Los Alamos, \"the hydrogen bomb \u2013 that is, a two-stage thermonuclear device, as we referred to it \u2013 is indeed the principal part of the US arsenal, as it is of the Russian arsenal.\"</ref>\n* Finally, the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded in the heart of the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.<ref name=\"CLR\"/>\n\nThe initial impetus behind the two-stage weapon was President Truman's 1950 promise to build a 10-megaton hydrogen superbomb as the U.S. response to the 1949 test of the first Soviet fission bomb. But the resulting invention turned out to be the cheapest and most compact way to build small nuclear bombs as well as large ones, erasing any meaningful distinction between A-bombs and H-bombs, and between boosters and supers. All preferred techniques for fission and fusion explosions are incorporated into one all-encompassing, fully scalable design principle. Even {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter nuclear artillery shells can be two-stage thermonuclears.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn the ensuing fifty years, nobody has come up with a more efficient way to build a nuclear bomb. It is the design of choice for the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and France, the five thermonuclear powers.

Examples:\n\n===Hydrogen bombs===\n{{Main|Thermonuclear weapon}}\nWhile all modern nuclear weapons (fission and fusion alike) make some use of D-T fusion, in the public perception hydrogen bombs are multi-megaton devices a thousand times more powerful than Hiroshima's Little Boy. Such high-yield bombs are actually two-stage thermonuclears, scaled up to the desired yield, with uranium fission, as usual, providing most of their energy.\n\nThe idea of the hydrogen bomb first came to public attention in 1949, when prominent scientists openly recommended against building nuclear bombs more powerful than the standard pure-fission model, on both moral and practical grounds. Their assumption was that critical mass considerations would limit the potential size of fission explosions, but that a fusion explosion could be as large as its supply of fuel, which has no critical mass limit. In 1949, the Soviets exploded their first fission bomb, and in 1950 U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ended the H-bomb debate by ordering the Los Alamos designers to build one.\n\nIn 1952, the 10.4-megaton [[Ivy Mike]] explosion was announced as the first hydrogen bomb test, reinforcing the idea that hydrogen bombs are a thousand times more powerful than fission bombs.\n\nIn 1954, [[Robert Oppenheimer|J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was labeled a hydrogen bomb opponent. The public did not know there were two kinds of hydrogen bomb (neither of which is accurately described as a hydrogen bomb). On May 23, when his security clearance was revoked, item three of the four public findings against him was \"his conduct in the hydrogen bomb program.\" In 1949, Oppenheimer had supported single-stage fusion-boosted fission bombs, to maximize the explosive power of the arsenal given the trade-off between plutonium and tritium production. He opposed two-stage thermonuclear bombs until 1951, when radiation implosion, which he called \"technically sweet\", first made them practical. The complexity of his position was not revealed to the public until 1976, nine years after his death.<ref>Herbert York, ''The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the Superbomb'' (1976).</ref>\n\nWhen ballistic missiles replaced bombers in the 1960s, most multi-megaton bombs were replaced by missile warheads (also two-stage thermonuclears) scaled down to one megaton or less.\n\n==={{Anchor|Alarm Clock}}Alarm Clock/Sloika===\n\nThe first effort to exploit the symbiotic relationship between fission and fusion was a 1940s design that mixed fission and fusion fuel in alternating thin layers. As a single-stage device, it would have been a cumbersome application of boosted fission. It first became practical when incorporated into the secondary of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon.<ref>\"The 'Alarm Clock' ... became practical only by the inclusion of Li6 (in 1950) and its combination with the radiation implosion.\" Hans A. Bethe, [https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm Memorandum on the History of Thermonuclear Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030002/https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm |date=March 4, 2016}}, May 28, 1952.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. name, Alarm Clock, came from Teller: he called it that because it might \"wake up the world\" to the possibility of the potential of the Super.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=256}} The Russian name for the same design was more descriptive: Sloika ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430}}), a layered pastry cake. A single-stage Soviet Sloika was tested on August 12, 1953. No single-stage U.S. version was tested, but the [[Castle Union|Union]] shot of [[Operation Castle]], April 26, 1954, was a two-stage thermonuclear device code-named Alarm Clock. Its yield, at [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]], was 6.9 megatons.\n\nBecause the Soviet Sloika test used dry lithium-6 deuteride eight months before the first U.S. test to use it (Castle Bravo, March 1, 1954), it was sometimes claimed that the USSR won the H-bomb race, even though the United States tested and developed the first hydrogen bomb: the Ivy Mike H-bomb test. The 1952 U.S. Ivy Mike test used cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel in the secondary, and employed the D-D fusion reaction. However, the first Soviet test to use a radiation-imploded secondary, the essential feature of a true H-bomb, was on November 23, 1955, three years after Ivy Mike. In fact, real work on the implosion scheme in the Soviet Union only commenced in the very early part of 1953, several months after the successful testing of Sloika.\n\n===Clean bombs===\n[[File:Bassoon Prime.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Bassoon, the prototype for a 9.3-megaton clean bomb or a 25-megaton dirty bomb. Dirty version shown here, before its 1956 test. The two attachments on the left are ''light pipes'' - see below for elaboration.]]\nOn March 1, 1954, the largest-ever U.S. nuclear test explosion, the 15-megaton [[Castle Bravo|Bravo]] shot of Operation Castle at Bikini Atoll, delivered a promptly lethal dose of fission-product fallout to more than {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2}} of Pacific Ocean surface.<ref>See [[:File:Bravo fallout2.png|map]].</ref> Radiation injuries to Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen made that fact public and revealed the role of fission in hydrogen bombs.\n\nIn response to the public alarm over fallout, an effort was made to design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of [[uranium-238|unenriched natural uranium]], when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can far exceed the energy released by fusion, as was the case in the [[Castle Bravo]] test. Replacing the [[fissionable]] material in the tamper with another material is essential to producing a \"clean\" bomb. In such a device, the tamper no longer contributes energy, so for any given weight, a clean bomb will have less yield. The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956 in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of [[Operation Redwing]]. This shot used non-fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.\n\nThe public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion reactions are the [[peaceful nuclear explosion]]s of the 1970s, with the 3 detonations that excavated part of [[Pechora\u2013Kama Canal]] being cited as 98% fusion each in the ''Taiga'' test's 15 [[kiloton]] explosive yield devices; that is, a total fission fraction of 0.3 [[kiloton]]s in a 15 kt device.<ref>[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313100251/http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm |date=March 13, 2016}} by Milo D.

The Bassoon Prime produced a 5-megaton yield, of which 87% came from fission. Data obtained from this test, and others, culminated in the eventual deployment of the highest yielding US nuclear weapon known, and the highest [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield-to-weight weapon ever made]], a three-stage thermonuclear weapon with a maximum \"dirty\" yield of 25 megatons, designated as the [[B41 nuclear bomb]], which was to be carried by U.S. Air Force bombers until it was decommissioned; this weapon was never fully tested.\n\nAs such, high-yield clean bombs appear to have been of little value from a military standpoint. The actual deployed weapons were the dirty versions, which maximized yield for the same size device. The need for low fission fraction nuclear devices was driven only by the likes of [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] and [[peaceful nuclear explosion]]s - for earth excavation with little contamination of the resulting excavated area.\n\n===Third generation nuclear weapons===\nFirst and second generation nuclear weapons release energy as omnidirectional blasts.

The neutron-activated cobalt would have maximized the environmental damage from radioactive fallout. These bombs were popularized in the 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]''; the material added to the bombs is referred to in the film as 'cobalt-thorium G'.\n\nSuch \"salted\" weapons were requested by the U.S. Air Force and seriously investigated, possibly built and tested, but not deployed. In the 1964 edition of the DOD/AEC book ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons,'' a new section titled Radiological Warfare clarified the issue.<ref>Samuel Glasstone, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', 1962, Revised 1964, U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of Energy, pp.464\u20135. This section was removed from later editions, but, according to Glasstone in 1978, not because it was inaccurate or because the weapons had changed.</ref> Fission products are as deadly as neutron-activated cobalt. The standard high-fission thermonuclear weapon is automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, as dirty as a cobalt bomb.\n\nInitially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than [[cobalt-60|Co-60]]: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years.

The stages of a nuclear weapon are not fission, fusion, and fission. They are the primary, the secondary, and, in a very few exceptional and powerful weapons no longer in service, the tertiary. Tertiary (three-stage) designs, such as the U.S. [[B41 nuclear bomb]] and the Soviet [[Tsar Bomba]] (discussed above), were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; all have since been retired, as the typical multi-megaton yields of tertiary bombs do not destroy targets efficiently, since they waste energy in a sphere above and below an area of land. For this reason, all tertiary bombs have given way in modern nuclear arsenals to multiple smaller two-stage bomb tactics (see for example, [[MIRV]]). Such two-stage bombs, even though less efficient in yield, are nevertheless more destructive for their total bomb weight, because they can be distributed over a roughly two-dimensional area of land at the target.\n\nAll so-called \"fission-fusion-fission\" weapons (i.e., all conventional modern thermonuclear warheads) employ the additional step of \"jacket fissioning\", using fusion neutrons. This works as follows: the high-energy or \"fast\" neutrons generated by fusion are used to fission a fissionable jacket located around the fusion stage. In the past this jacket was often made of natural or depleted uranium; but today's weapons in which there is a premium on weight and size (i.e., virtually all modern strategic weapons) use moderately-to-highly enriched uranium as the jacketing material (see [[nuclear weapon design#Oralloy thermonuclear warheads|Oralloy thermonuclear warheads]] section below). The [[fast fission]] of the secondary jacket in fission-fusion-fission bombs is sometimes referred to as a \"third stage\" in the bomb, but it should not be confused with the obsolete true three-stage thermonuclear design, in which there existed another complete tertiary fusion stage.\n\nIn the era of open-air atomic testing, the fission jacket was sometimes omitted, in order to create so-called \"clean bombs\" (see above), or to reduce the amount of radioactive fallout from [[fission product]]s in very large multi-megaton blasts. This was done most often in the testing of very large tertiary bomb designs, such as the Tsar Bomba and the Zuni test shot of [[Operation Redwing]], as discussed above. In the testing of such weapons, it was assumed (and sometimes shown operationally) that a jacket of natural uranium or [[enriched uranium]] could always be added to a given unjacketed bomb, if desired, to increase the yield from two to five times.\n\nThe fission jacket is not used in the [[enhanced radiation weapon]], or [[neutron bomb]], discussed later.\n\n===Arbitrarily large multi-staged devices===\nThe idea of a device which has an arbitrarily large number of Teller-Ulam stages, with each driving a larger radiation-driven implosion than the preceding stage, is frequently suggested,<ref>{{cite book\n| last1  = Winterberg\n| first1 = Friedwardt\n| title  = The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement: Ways Towards Ignition\n| publisher = World Scientific\n| date   = 2010\n| location =\n| pages  = 192\u2013193\n| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=B7RV_vASz0EC&pg=PA192&dq=arbitrarily+large+gains%22staged+Teller-Ulam\n| doi    =\n| id     =\n| isbn   = 978-9814295918\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last1  = Croddy\n| first1 = Eric A.\n| last2  = Wirtz\n| first2 = James J.\n| last3  = Larsen\n| first3 = Jeffrey, Eds.\n| title  = Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History\n| publisher = ABC-CLIO, Inc.\n| date   = 2005\n| location =\n| pages  = 376\n| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=RA1-PA376&dq=almost+unlimited+yield\n| doi    =\n| id     =\n| isbn   = 978-1-85109-490-5\n}}</ref> but technically disputed.<ref name=\"ieri.be\">''How much large can bombs be made through staging?

This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).\n\nERWs are more accurately described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield of a nuclear weapon is less than one kiloton, its lethal radius from blast, {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of 20 PSI are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only 5 PSI.\n\nCommonly misconceived as a weapon designed to kill populations and leave infrastructure intact, these bombs (as mentioned above) are still very capable of leveling buildings over a large radius. The intent of their design was to kill tank crews \u2013 tanks giving excellent protection against blast and heat, surviving (relatively) very close to a detonation. Given the Soviets' vast tank forces during the Cold War, this was the perfect weapon to counter them. The neutron radiation could instantly incapacitate a tank crew out to roughly the same distance that the heat and blast would incapacitate an unprotected human (depending on design). The tank chassis would also be rendered highly radioactive, temporarily preventing its re-use by a fresh crew.\n\nNeutron weapons were also intended for use in other applications, however. For example, they are effective in anti-nuclear defenses \u2013 the neutron flux being capable of neutralising an incoming warhead at a greater range than heat or blast. Nuclear warheads are very resistant to physical damage, but are very difficult to harden against extreme neutron flux.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Energy distribution of weapon\n|-\n! !!

Fusion provided the neutrons. Developed in the 1950s, they were first deployed in the 1970s, by U.S. forces in Europe. The last ones were retired in the 1990s.\n\nA neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1\u201310 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10\u201315 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a [[W87]] or [[W88]].<ref name=\"Neutron bomb: Why 'clean' is deadly\"/>\n\n===Oralloy thermonuclear warheads===\n[[File:W-88 warhead detail.png|thumb|drawing of W-88]]\n\nIn 1999, nuclear weapon design was in the news again, for the first time in decades. In January, the U.S. House of Representatives released the [[Cox Report]] ([[Christopher Cox]] R-CA) which alleged that China had somehow acquired classified information about the U.S. W88 warhead. Nine months later, [[Wen Ho Lee]], a Taiwanese immigrant working at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], was publicly accused of [[espionage|spying]], arrested, and served nine months in [[detention of suspects|pre-trial detention]], before the case against him was dismissed. It is not clear that there was, in fact, any espionage.\n\nIn the course of eighteen months of news coverage, the W88 warhead was described in unusual detail. ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed a schematic diagram on its front page.<ref>Broad, William J. (7 September 1999), \"Spies versus sweat, the debate over China's nuclear advance\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p 1. The front page [https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/morlan2.gif drawing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505191759/https://fas.org/sgp/eprint/morlan2.gif |date=May 5, 2016}} was similar to one that appeared four months earlier in the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''.</ref> The most detailed drawing appeared in ''A Convenient Spy'', the 2001 book on the Wen Ho Lee case by Dan Stober and Ian Hoffman, adapted and shown here with permission.\n\nDesigned for use on [[Trident II]] (D-5) [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, the W88 entered service in 1990 and was the last warhead designed for the U.S. arsenal. It has been described as the most advanced, although open literature accounts do not indicate any major design features that were not available to U.S. designers in 1958.\n\nThe above diagram shows all the standard features of ballistic missile warheads since the 1960s, with two exceptions that give it a higher yield for its size.\n* The outer layer of the secondary, called the \"pusher\", which serves three functions: [[heat shield]], tamper, and [[nuclear fuel|fission fuel]], is made of U-235 instead of U-238, hence the name [[Oralloy]] (U-235) Thermonuclear. Being fissile, rather than merely fissionable, allows the pusher to fission faster and more completely, increasing yield. This feature is available only to nations with a great wealth of fissile uranium. The United States is estimated to have 500 tons.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n* The secondary is located in the wide end of the re-entry cone, where it can be larger, and thus more powerful. The usual arrangement is to put the heavier, denser secondary in the narrow end for greater aerodynamic stability during re-entry from outer space, and to allow more room for a bulky primary in the wider part of the cone. (The W87 warhead drawing in the [[W87|W87 article]] shows the usual arrangement.) Because of this new geometry, the W88 primary uses compact conventional high explosives (CHE) to save space,<ref>Jonathan Medalia, \"The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program: Background and Current Developments\", [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32929.pdf CRS Report RL32929] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184154/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32929.pdf |date=March 11, 2016}}, Dec 18, 2007, p CRS-11.</ref> rather than the more usual, and bulky but safer, insensitive high explosives (IHE).

Other nuclear weapon design labs in other countries duplicated those design innovations independently, reverse-engineered them from fallout analysis, or acquired them by espionage.<ref>William J. Broad, \"The Hidden Travels of The Bomb: Atomic insiders say the weapon was invented only once, and its secrets were spread around the globe by spies, scientists and the covert acts of nuclear states\", ''New York Times'', December 9, 2008, p D1.</ref>\n\n===Berkeley===\n{{Main|Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}}\nThe first systematic exploration of nuclear weapon design concepts took place in mid-1942 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Important early discoveries had been made at the adjacent [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]], such as the 1940 cyclotron-made production and isolation of plutonium. A Berkeley professor, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], had just been hired to run the nation's secret bomb design effort. His first act was to convene the 1942 summer conference.\n\nBy the time he moved his operation to the new secret town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the spring of 1943, the accumulated wisdom on nuclear weapon design consisted of five lectures by Berkeley professor [[Robert Serber]], transcribed and distributed as the [[Los Alamos Primer]].<ref name=\"Primer\">{{cite book|last1=Server|first1=Robert|title=The Los Alamos Primer|date=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9780520075764|edition=1st}}</ref> The Primer addressed fission energy, [[neutron]] production and [[neutron capture|capture]], [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, [[critical mass]], tampers, predetonation, and three methods of assembling a bomb: gun assembly, implosion, and \"autocatalytic methods\", the one approach that turned out to be a dead end.\n\n===Los Alamos===\n{{Main|Los Alamos National Laboratory}}\nAt Los Alamos, it was found in April 1944 by [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] that the proposed [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]] Gun assembly type bomb would not work for plutonium because of predetonation problems caused by [[Pu-240]] impurities. So Fat Man, the implosion-type bomb, was given high priority as the only option for plutonium. The Berkeley discussions had generated theoretical estimates of critical mass, but nothing precise. The main wartime job at Los Alamos was the experimental determination of critical mass, which had to wait until sufficient amounts of fissile material arrived from the production plants: uranium from [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and plutonium from the [[Hanford Site]] in Washington.\n\nIn 1945, using the results of critical mass experiments, Los Alamos technicians fabricated and assembled components for four bombs: the ''[[Trinity test|Trinity]]'' [[the gadget|Gadget]], Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused spare Fat Man. After the war, those who could, including Oppenheimer, returned to university teaching positions. Those who remained worked on levitated and hollow pits and conducted weapon effects tests such as [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] Able and Baker at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946.\n\nAll of the essential ideas for incorporating fusion into nuclear weapons originated at Los Alamos between 1946 and 1952. After the [[Teller-Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] radiation implosion breakthrough of 1951, the technical implications and possibilities were fully explored, but ideas not directly relevant to making the largest possible bombs for long-range Air Force bombers were shelved.\n\nBecause of Oppenheimer's initial position in the H-bomb debate, in opposition to large thermonuclear weapons, and the assumption that he still had influence over Los Alamos despite his departure, political allies of [[Edward Teller]] decided he needed his own laboratory in order to pursue H-bombs. By the time it was opened in 1952, in [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]], California, Los Alamos had finished the job Livermore was designed to do.\n\n===Livermore===\n{{Main|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}\nWith its original mission no longer available, the Livermore lab tried radical new designs that failed. Its first three nuclear tests were [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzles]]: in 1953, two single-stage [[uranium hydride bomb|fission devices with uranium hydride pits]], and in 1954, a two-stage thermonuclear device in which the secondary heated up prematurely, too fast for radiation implosion to work properly.\n\nShifting gears, Livermore settled for taking ideas Los Alamos had shelved and developing them for the Army and Navy. This led Livermore to specialize in small-diameter tactical weapons, particularly ones using two-point implosion systems, such as the Swan. Small-diameter tactical weapons became primaries for small-diameter secondaries. Around 1960, when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race, Livermore warheads were more useful than the large, heavy Los Alamos warheads. Los Alamos warheads were used on the first [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s, IRBMs, but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, ICBMs, and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, SLBMs, as well as on the first [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple warhead]] systems on such missiles.<ref>Sybil Francis, ''Warhead Politics: Livermore and the Competitive System of Nuclear Warhead Design'', UCRL-LR-124754, June 1995, Ph.D. Dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, available from National Technical Information Service. This 233-page thesis was written by a weapons-lab outsider for public distribution. The author had access to all the classified information at Livermore that was relevant to her research on warhead design; consequently, she was required to use non-descriptive code words for certain innovations.</ref>\n\nIn 1957 and 1958, both labs built and tested as many designs as possible, in anticipation that a planned 1958 test ban might become permanent. By the time testing resumed in 1961 the two labs had become duplicates of each other, and design jobs were assigned more on workload considerations than lab specialty. Some designs were horse-traded. For example, the [[W38]] warhead for the [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] I missile started out as a Livermore project, was given to Los Alamos when it became the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] missile warhead, and in 1959 was given back to Livermore, in trade for the [[W54]] [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett]] warhead, which went from Livermore to Los Alamos.\n\nWarhead designs after 1960 took on the character of model changes, with every new missile getting a new warhead for marketing reasons. The chief substantive change involved packing more fissile uranium-235 into the secondary, as it became available with continued [[uranium enrichment]] and the dismantlement of the large high-yield bombs.\n\nStarting with the [[Nova (laser)#Fusion in Nova|Nova]] facility at Livermore in the mid-1980s, nuclear design activity pertaining to radiation-driven implosion was informed by research with ''indirect drive'' laser fusion. This work was part of the effort to investigate [[Inertial confinement fusion#Nuclear weapons program|Inertial Confinement Fusion]]. Similar work continues at the more powerful [[National Ignition Facility]]. The [[Stockpile stewardship#Stockpile Stewardship  Management Program|Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] also benefitted from research performed at [[National Ignition Facility#Stockpile experiments|NIF]].\n\n==Explosive testing==\nNuclear weapons are in large part designed by trial and error. The trial often involves test explosion of a prototype.\n\nIn a nuclear explosion, a large number of discrete events, with various probabilities, aggregate into short-lived, chaotic energy flows inside the device casing. Complex mathematical models are required to approximate the processes, and in the 1950s there were no computers powerful enough to run them properly. Even today's computers and simulation software are not adequate.<ref>Walter Goad, [https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/goad.html Declaration for the Wen Ho Lee case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308031512/https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/goad.html |date=March 8, 2016}}, May 17, 2000. Goad began thermonuclear weapon design work at Los Alamos in 1950. In his Declaration, he mentions \"basic scientific problems of computability which cannot be solved by more computing power alone. These are typified by the problem of long range predictions of weather and climate, and extend to predictions of nuclear weapons behavior. This accounts for the fact that, after the enormous investment of effort over many years, weapons codes can still not be relied on for significantly new designs.\"</ref>\n\nIt was easy enough to design reliable weapons for the stockpile. If the prototype worked, it could be weaponized and mass-produced.\n\nIt was much more difficult to understand how it worked or why it failed. Designers gathered as much data as possible during the explosion, before the device destroyed itself, and used the data to calibrate their models, often by inserting [[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]] into equations to make the simulations match experimental results. They also analyzed the weapon debris in fallout to see how much of a potential nuclear reaction had taken place.\n\n===Light pipes===\nAn important tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe. A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating a plate of metal to incandescence, an event that could be recorded by instruments located at the far end of a long, very straight pipe.\n\nThe picture below shows the Shrimp device, detonated on March 1, 1954 at Bikini, as the [[Castle Bravo]] test. Its 15-megaton explosion was the largest ever by the United States. The silhouette of a man is shown for scale. The device is supported from below, at the ends. The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling, which appear to be supports, are actually diagnostic light pipes. The eight pipes at the right end (1) sent information about the detonation of the primary. Two in the middle (2) marked the time when x-radiation from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary. The last two pipes (3) noted the time radiation reached the far end of the radiation channel, the difference between (2) and (3) being the radiation transit time for the channel.<ref>Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon'', Volume IV, pp. 211\u2013212, 284.</ref>\n[[File:Castle Bravo Shrimp composite.png|600 px|centre]]\n\nFrom the shot cab, the pipes turned horizontally and traveled 7500&nbsp;ft (2.3&nbsp;km) along a causeway built on the Bikini reef to a remote-controlled data collection bunker on Namu Island.\n\nWhile x-rays would normally travel at the speed of light through a low-density material like the plastic foam channel filler between (2) and (3), the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy. While the secondary is being compressed via radiation-induced ablation, neutrons from the primary catch up with the x-rays, penetrate into the secondary, and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above. This Li-6 + n reaction is exothermic, producing 5 MeV per event. The spark plug has not yet been compressed, and, thus, remains subcritical, so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result. If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete, though, the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded, potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite. The first Livermore-designed thermonuclear weapon, the Morgenstern device, failed in this manner when it was tested as [[Castle Koon]] on April 7, 1954. The primary ignited, but the secondary, preheated by the primary's neutron wave, suffered what was termed as an ''inefficient detonation'';<ref name=\"swordsIV\">{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=IV |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>{{refpage|165}} thus, a weapon with a predicted one-megaton yield produced only 110 kilotons, of which merely 10 kt were attributed to fusion.<ref name=\"swordsIII\">{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>{{refpage|316}}\n\nThese timing effects, and any problems they cause, are measured by light-pipe data. The mathematical simulations which they calibrate are called radiation flow hydrodynamics codes, or channel codes. They are used to predict the effect of future design modifications.\n\nIt is not clear from the public record how successful the Shrimp light pipes were. The unmanned data bunker was far enough back to remain outside the mile-wide crater, but the 15-megaton blast, two and a half times as powerful as expected, breached the bunker by blowing its 20-ton door off the hinges and across the inside of the bunker. (The nearest people were twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) farther away, in a bunker that survived intact.)<ref>Dr. John C. Clark, as told to Robert Cahn, \"We Were Trapped by Radioactive Fallout\", ''The Saturday Evening Post'', July 20, 1957, pp. 17\u201319, 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Fallout analysis===\n{{See also|Nuclear forensics}}\nThe most interesting data from Castle Bravo came from radio-chemical analysis of weapon debris in fallout. Because of a shortage of enriched lithium-6, 60% of the lithium in the Shrimp secondary was ordinary lithium-7, which doesn't breed tritium as easily as lithium-6 does. But it does breed lithium-6 as the product of an (n, 2n) reaction (one neutron in, two neutrons out), a known fact, but with unknown probability. The probability turned out to be high.\n\nFallout analysis revealed to designers that, with the (n, 2n) reaction, the Shrimp secondary effectively had two and half times as much lithium-6 as expected. The tritium, the fusion yield, the neutrons, and the fission yield were all increased accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Rhodes |title=Dark Sun; the Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=541 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAs noted above, Bravo's fallout analysis also told the outside world, for the first time, that thermonuclear bombs are more fission devices than fusion devices. A Japanese fishing boat, ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'', sailed home with enough fallout on her decks to allow scientists in Japan and elsewhere to determine, and announce, that most of the fallout had come from the fission of U-238 by fusion-produced 14 MeV neutrons.\n\n===Underground testing===\n{{Main|Underground nuclear weapons testing}}\n[[File:Nevada Test Site craters.jpg|thumb|right|Subsidence Craters at Yucca Flat, Nevada Test Site.]]\nThe global alarm over radioactive fallout, which began with the Castle Bravo event, eventually drove nuclear testing literally underground. The last U.S. above-ground test took place at [[Johnston Island]] on November 4, 1962. During the next three decades, until September 23, 1992, the United States conducted an average of 2.4 underground nuclear explosions per month, all but a few at the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS) northwest of Las Vegas.\n\nThe [[Yucca Flat]] section of the NTS is covered with subsidence craters resulting from the collapse of terrain over radioactive caverns created by nuclear explosions (see photo).\n\nAfter the 1974 [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] (TTBT), which limited underground explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads like the half-megaton W88 had to be tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the reduction in yield had to come from the secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the overall yield, without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation.\n\n==Production facilities==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2014}}\nWhen two-stage weapons became standard in the early 1950s, weapon design determined the layout of the new, widely dispersed U.S. production facilities, and vice versa.\n\nBecause primaries tend to be bulky, especially in diameter, plutonium is the fissile material of choice for pits, with beryllium reflectors. It has a smaller critical mass than uranium. The [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]] plant near Boulder, Colorado, was built in 1952 for pit production and consequently became the plutonium and beryllium fabrication facility.\n\nThe Y-12 plant in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]], where [[mass spectrometer]]s called [[calutron]]s had enriched uranium for the [[Manhattan Project]], was redesigned to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 makes the best spark plugs because its critical mass is larger, especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and spark plugs, but for mass production, it was easier to let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries.\n\nY-12 made lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel and U-238 parts, the other two ingredients of secondaries.\n\nThe Hanford Site near Richland WA operated Plutonium production nuclear reactors and separations facilities during World War 2 and the Cold War. Nine Plutonium production reactors were built and operated there. The first being the B-Reactor which began operations in September 1944 and the last being the N-Reactor which ceased operations in January 1987.\n\nThe [[Savannah River Site]] in [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[South Carolina]], also built in 1952, operated [[nuclear reactor]]s which converted U-238 into Pu-239 for pits, and converted lithium-6 (produced at Y-12) into tritium for booster gas. Since its reactors were moderated with heavy water, deuterium oxide, it also made deuterium for booster gas and for Y-12 to use in making lithium-6 deuteride.\n\n==Warhead design safety==\nBecause even low-yield nuclear warheads have astounding destructive power, weapon designers have always recognised the need to incorporate mechanisms and associated procedures intended to prevent accidental detonation.\n\n[[File:Steel balls.png|thumb|right|300px|A diagram of the ''[[Green Grass (nuclear warhead)|Green Grass]]'' warhead's steel ball safety device, shown left, filled (safe) and right, empty (live). The steel balls were emptied into a hopper underneath the aircraft before flight, and could be re-inserted using a funnel by rotating the bomb on its trolley and raising the hopper.]]\n\n===Gun-type weapons===\nIt is inherently dangerous to have a weapon containing a quantity and shape of fissile material which can form a critical mass through a relatively simple accident. Because of this danger, the propellant in Little Boy (four bags of [[cordite]]) was inserted into the bomb in flight, shortly after takeoff on August 6, 1945. This was the first time a gun-type nuclear weapon had ever been fully assembled.\n\nIf the weapon falls into water, the [[neutron moderator|moderating]] effect of the [[light-water reactor|water]] can also cause a [[criticality accident]], even without the weapon being physically damaged. Similarly, a fire caused by an aircraft crashing could easily ignite the propellant, with catastrophic results. Gun-type weapons have always been inherently unsafe.\n\n===In-flight pit insertion===\nNeither of these effects is likely with implosion weapons since there is normally insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses. However, the earliest implosion weapons had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some nuclear yield was a concern.\n\nOn August 9, 1945, Fat Man was loaded onto its airplane fully assembled, but later, when levitated pits made a space between the pit and the tamper, it was feasible to use in-flight pit insertion. The bomber would take off with no fissile material in the bomb. Some older implosion-type weapons, such as the US [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark 4]] and [[Mark 5 nuclear bomb|Mark 5]], used this system.\n\nIn-flight pit insertion will not work with a hollow pit in contact with its tamper.\n\n===Steel ball safety method===\nAs shown in the diagram above, one method used to decrease the likelihood of accidental detonation employed [[ball (bearing)|metal balls]]. The balls were emptied into the pit: this prevented detonation by increasing the density of the hollow pit, thereby preventing symmetrical implosion in the event of an accident. This design was used in the Green Grass weapon, also known as the Interim Megaton Weapon, which was used in the [[Violet Club]] and [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun Mk.1]] bombs.\n\n[[File:One-Point Safety Test.svg|right]]\n\n===Chain safety method===\nAlternatively, the pit can be \"safed\" by having its normally hollow core filled with an inert material such as a fine metal chain, possibly made of [[cadmium]] to absorb neutrons. While the chain is in the center of the pit, the pit can not be compressed into an appropriate shape to fission; when the weapon is to be armed, the chain is removed. Similarly, although a serious fire could detonate the explosives, destroying the pit and spreading plutonium to contaminate the surroundings as has happened in [[list of military nuclear accidents|several weapons accidents]], it could not cause a nuclear explosion.\n\n===One-point safety===\nWhile the firing of one detonator out of many will not cause a hollow pit to go critical, especially a low-mass hollow pit that requires boosting, the introduction of two-point implosion systems made that possibility a real concern.\n\nIn a two-point system, if one detonator fires, one entire hemisphere of the pit will implode as designed. The high-explosive charge surrounding the other hemisphere will explode progressively, from the equator toward the opposite pole. Ideally, this will pinch the equator and squeeze the second hemisphere away from the first, like toothpaste in a tube. By the time the explosion envelops it, its implosion will be separated both in time and space from the implosion of the first hemisphere. The resulting dumbbell shape, with each end reaching maximum density at a different time, may not become critical.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to tell on the drawing board how this will play out. Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.\n\nOut of 25 one-point safety tests conducted in 1957 and 1958, seven had zero or slight nuclear yield (success), three had high yields of 300 t to 500 t (severe failure), and the rest had unacceptable yields between those extremes.\n\nOf particular concern was Livermore's [[W47]], which generated unacceptably high yields in one-point testing. To prevent an accidental detonation, Livermore decided to use mechanical safing on the W47. The wire safety scheme described below was the result.\n\nWhen testing resumed in 1961, and continued for three decades, there was sufficient time to make all warhead designs inherently one-point safe, without need for mechanical safing.\n\n===Wire safety method===\nIn the last test before the 1958 moratorium the W47 warhead for the Polaris SLBM was found to not be one-point safe, producing an unacceptably high nuclear yield of {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}} of TNT equivalent (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, there was no way to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. A solution was devised consisting of a [[boron]]-coated wire inserted into the weapon's hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted.<ref>Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon'', Volume VII, pp. 396\u2013397.</ref> The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud.<ref name=\"dud\"/> It was estimated that 50-75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of all W47 primaries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John R.|last2=Michalowski|first2=Stefan|date=1994|title=Nuclear Weapons Safety:The Case of Trident|url=http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/4_3harvey.pdf|journal=Science & Global Security|volume=4}}</ref> The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.<ref>{{cite book|isbn = 978-0521054010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=95eoQSNDp6gC&pg=PA214&dq=warhead+corrosion&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}.{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Strong link/weak link===\n{{See also|Strong link/weak link}}\nUnder the strong link/weak link system, \"weak links\" are constructed between critical nuclear weapon components (the \"hard links\"). In the even of an accident the weak links are designed to fail first in a manner that precludes energy transfer between them. Then, if a hard link fails in a manner that transfers or release energy, energy can't be transferred into other weapon systems, potentially starting a nuclear detonation. Hard links are usually critical weapon components that have been hardened to survive extreme environments, while weak links can be both components deliberately inserted into the system to act as a weak link and critical nuclear components that can fail predictably.\n\nAn example of a weak link would be an electrical connector that contains electrical wires made from a low melting point alloy. During a fire, those wires would melt breaking any electrical connection.\n\n===Permissive Action Link===\n{{See also|Permissive Action Link}}\nA ''Permissive Action Link'' is an [[access control]] device designed to prevent unauthorised use of a nuclear weapons. Early PALs were simple electromechanical switches and have evolved into complex arming systems that include integrated yield control options, lockout devices and anti-tamper devices.\n\n==References==\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Samuel T.

The first stage is always a boosted fission weapon as above. Its detonation causes it to shine intensely with x-radiation, which illuminates and implodes the second stage filled with a large quantity of fusion fuel. This sets in motion a sequence of events which results in a thermonuclear, or fusion, burn. This process affords potential yields up to hundreds of times those of fission weapons.<ref>\n{{Citation\n|last = Life Editors\n|year = 1961\n|title = To the Outside World, a Superbomb more Bluff than Bang\n|periodical = [[Life (magazine)|Life]]\n|location = New York\n|issue = Vol. 51, No. 19, November 10, 1961\n|url = https://books.google.com/?id=4VMEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34#v=onepage&q&f=false\n|pages = 34\u201337\n|accessdate = 2010-06-28\n}}. Article on the Soviet [[Tsar Bomba]] test. Because explosions are spherical in shape and targets are spread out on the relatively flat surface of the earth, numerous smaller weapons cause more destruction. From page 35: \"... five five-megaton weapons would demolish a greater area than a single 50-megatonner.\"</ref>\n\nA fourth type, '''[[pure fusion weapon]]s''', is a purely theoretical possibility. Such weapons would produce far fewer radioactive byproducts than current designs, although they would release huge numbers of neutrons.\n\nPure fission weapons historically have been the first type to be built by new nuclear powers. Large industrial states with well-developed nuclear arsenals have two-stage thermonuclear weapons, which are the most compact, scalable, and cost effective option once the necessary technical base and industrial infrastructure are built.\n\nMost known innovations in nuclear weapon design originated in the United States, although some were later developed independently by other states.<ref>The United States and the Soviet Union were the only nations to build large nuclear arsenals with every possible type of nuclear weapon. The U.S. had a four-year head start and was the first to produce fissile material and fission weapons, all in 1945. The only Soviet claim for a design first was the [[Joe 4]] detonation on August 12, 1953, said to be the first deliverable hydrogen bomb. However, as Herbert York first revealed in ''The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the Superbomb'' (W.H. Freeman, 1976), it was not a true hydrogen bomb (it was a boosted fission weapon of the Sloika/Alarm Clock type, not a two-stage thermonuclear). Soviet dates for the essential elements of warhead miniaturization \u2013 boosted, hollow-pit, two-point, air lens primaries \u2013 are not available in the open literature, but the larger size of Soviet ballistic missiles is often explained as evidence of an initial Soviet difficulty in miniaturizing warheads.</ref> \n\nIn early news accounts, pure fission weapons were called atomic bombs or '''A-bombs''' and weapons involving fusion were called '''hydrogen bombs''' or '''H-bombs'''. Practitioners, however, favor the terms nuclear and thermonuclear, respectively.\n\n{{nuclear weapons}}\n\n==Nuclear reactions==\nNuclear fission separates or splits heavier atoms to form lighter atoms. Nuclear fusion combines lighter atoms to form heavier atoms. Both reactions generate roughly a million times more energy than comparable chemical reactions, making nuclear bombs a million times more powerful than non-nuclear bombs, which a French patent claimed in May 1939.<ref>{{cite patent\n |title            = Perfectionnements aux charges explosives (Improvements to explosive charges)\n |url              = http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/originalDocument?CC%3DFR&NR%3D971324&KC%3D&FT%3DE\n |inventor1-last   = [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Caisse Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique (National Fund for Scientific Research)]]\n |date = 16 January 1951\n |issue-date       = 12 July 1950\n |country-code     = fr\n |description      = \n |patent-number    = 971324\n}}.{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn some ways, fission and fusion are opposite and complementary reactions, but the particulars are unique for each. To understand how nuclear weapons are designed, it is useful to know the important similarities and differences between fission and fusion. The following explanation uses rounded numbers and approximations.<ref>The main source for this section is Samuel Glasstone and Philip Dolan, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', Third Edition, 1977, U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of Energy (see links in General References, below), with the same information in more detail in Samuel Glasstone, ''Sourcebook on Atomic Energy'', Third Edition, 1979, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Krieger Publishing.</ref>\n\n===Fission===\n{{Main|Nuclear fission}}\nWhen a free neutron hits the nucleus of a fissile atom like [[uranium-235]] (<sup>235</sup>U), the uranium nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei called fission fragments, plus more neutrons. Fission can be self-sustaining because it produces more neutrons of the speed required to cause new fissions.\n\nThe U-235 nucleus can split in many ways, provided the atomic numbers add up to 92 and the atomic masses add to 236 (uranium plus the extra neutron). The following equation shows one possible split, namely into [[strontium|strontium-95]] (<sup>95</sup>Sr), [[xenon|xenon-139]] (<sup>139</sup>Xe), and two neutrons (n), plus energy:<ref>Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', p. 12.</ref>\n:::<math>\\ {}^{235}\\mathrm{U} + \\mathrm{n} \\longrightarrow {}^{95}\\mathrm{Sr} + {}^{139}\\mathrm{Xe} + 2\\ \\mathrm{n} + 180\\ \\mathrm{MeV}</math>\n\nThe immediate energy release per atom is about 180 million [[electron volt]]s (MeV); i.e., 74 TJ/kg. Only 7% of this is gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons. The remaining 93% is kinetic energy (or energy of motion) of the charged fission fragments, flying away from each other mutually repelled by the positive charge of their protons (38 for strontium, 54 for xenon). This initial kinetic energy is 67 TJ/kg, imparting an initial speed of about 12,000 kilometers per second. The charged fragments' high electric charge causes many inelastic collisions with nearby atoms, and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb's uranium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] and [[neutron reflector|tamper]] until their motion is converted into heat. This takes about a millionth of a second (a microsecond), by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius.\n\nThis is hot enough to emit [[black-body radiation]] in the X-ray spectrum. These X-rays are absorbed by the surrounding air, producing the fireball and blast of a nuclear explosion.\n\nMost fission products have too many neutrons to be stable so they are radioactive by [[beta decay]], converting neutrons into protons by throwing off beta particles (electrons) and gamma rays. Their half lives range from milliseconds to about 200,000 years. Many decay into isotopes that are themselves radioactive, so from 1 to 6 (average 3) decays may be required to reach stability.<ref>Glasstone, ''Sourcebook'', p. 503.</ref> In reactors, the radioactive products are the nuclear waste in spent fuel. In bombs, they become radioactive fallout, both local and global.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the exploding bomb, the free neutrons released by fission carry away about 3% of the initial fission energy. Neutron kinetic energy adds to the blast energy of a bomb, but not as effectively as the energy from charged fragments, since neutrons are not slowed as quickly. The main contribution of fission neutrons to the bomb's power is the initiation of other fissions. Over half of the neutrons escape the bomb core, but the rest strike U-235 nuclei causing them to fission in an exponentially growing chain reaction (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). Starting from one atom, the number of fissions can theoretically double a hundred times in a microsecond, which could consume all uranium or plutonium up to hundreds of tons by the hundredth link in the chain. In practice, bombs do not contain hundreds of tons of uranium or plutonium. Instead, typically (in a modern weapon) the core of a weapon contains only about 5 kilograms of plutonium, of which only 2 to 2.5 kilograms, representing 40 to 50 kilotons of energy, undergoes fission before the core blows itself apart.\n\nHolding an exploding bomb together is the greatest challenge of fission weapon design. The heat of fission rapidly expands the fission core, spreading apart the target nuclei and making space for the neutrons to escape without being captured. The chain reaction stops.\n\nMaterials which can sustain a chain reaction are called [[fissile]]. The two fissile materials used in nuclear weapons are: U-235, also known as [[highly enriched uranium#Highly enriched uranium (HEU)|highly enriched uranium]] (HEU), oralloy (Oy) meaning Oak Ridge Alloy, or 25 (the last digits of the atomic number, which is 92 for uranium, and the atomic weight, here 235, respectively); and Pu-239, also known as plutonium, or 49 (from 94 and 239).\n\nUranium's most common isotope, U-238, is fissionable but not fissile (meaning that it cannot sustain a chain reaction by itself but can be made to fission with fast neutrons). Its aliases include natural or unenriched uranium, [[depleted uranium]] (DU), [[Tube Alloys|tubealloy (Tu)]], and 28. It cannot sustain a chain reaction, because its own fission neutrons are not powerful enough to cause more U-238 fission. The neutrons released by fusion will fission U-238. This U-238 fission reaction produces most of the energy in a typical two-stage thermonuclear weapon.\n\n===Fusion===\n{{Main|Nuclear fusion}}\nFusion produces neutrons which dissipate energy from the reaction.<ref>\"neutrons carry off most of the reaction energy\", Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', p. 21.</ref> In weapons, the most important fusion reaction is called the D-T reaction. Using the heat and pressure of fission, hydrogen-2, or deuterium (<sup>2</sup>D), fuses with hydrogen-3, or tritium (<sup>3</sup>T), to form helium-4 (<sup>4</sup>He) plus one neutron (n) and energy:<ref name=\"fusionmath\"/>\n:::<math>{}^2\\mathrm{D} + {}^3\\mathrm{T} \\longrightarrow {}^4\\mathrm{He} + n + 17.6\\ \\mathrm{MeV} </math>\n\n[[File:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|right|200 px]]\nThe total energy output, 17.6 MeV, is one tenth of that with fission, but the ingredients are only one-fiftieth as massive, so the energy output per unit mass is approximately five times as great. In this fusion reaction, 14 of the 17.6 MeV (80% of the energy released in the reaction) shows up as the kinetic energy of the neutron, which, having no electric charge and being almost as massive as the hydrogen nuclei that created it, can escape the scene without leaving its energy behind to help sustain the reaction \u2013 or to generate x-rays for blast and fire.\n\nThe only practical way to capture most of the fusion energy is to trap the neutrons inside a massive bottle of heavy material such as lead, uranium, or plutonium. If the 14 MeV neutron is captured by uranium (of either isotope; 14 MeV is high enough to fission both <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U) or plutonium, the result is fission and the release of 180 MeV of fission energy, multiplying the energy output tenfold.\n\nFor weapon use, fission is necessary to start fusion, helps to sustain fusion, and captures and multiplies the energy carried by the fusion neutrons. In the case of a neutron bomb (see below), the last-mentioned factor does not apply, since the objective is to facilitate the escape of neutrons, rather than to use them to increase the weapon's raw power.\n\n===Tritium production===\nA third important nuclear reaction is the one that creates [[tritium]], essential to the type of fusion used in weapons. Tritium, or hydrogen-3, is made by bombarding [[isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]] (<sup>6</sup>Li) with a [[neutron]] (n). This neutron bombardment will cause the lithium-6 nucleus to split, producing [[helium]]-4 (<sup>4</sup>He) plus tritium (<sup>3</sup>T) and energy:<ref name=\"fusionmath\"/>\n:::<math>{}^6\\mathrm{Li} + n \\longrightarrow {}^4\\mathrm{He} + {}^3\\mathrm{T} + 5\\ \\mathrm{MeV} </math>\n\nA nuclear reactor is necessary to provide the neutrons if the tritium is to be provided before the weapon is used. The industrial-scale conversion of lithium-6 to tritium is very similar to the conversion of uranium-238 into plutonium-239. In both cases the feed material is placed inside a nuclear reactor and removed for processing after a period of time.\n\nAlternatively, neutrons from earlier stage fusion reactions can be used to [[nuclear fission|fission]] lithium-6 (in the form of [[lithium deuteride]] for example) and form tritium during detonation. This approach reduces the amount of tritium-based fuel in a weapon.<ref>Martin, James E. ''Physics for Radiation Protection''. WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim, 2006, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe fission of one plutonium atom releases ten times more total energy than the fusion of one tritium atom. For this reason, tritium is included in nuclear weapon components only when it causes more fission than its production sacrifices, namely in the case of fusion-boosted fission.\n\nOf the four basic types of nuclear weapon, the first, pure fission, uses the first of the three nuclear reactions above. The second, fusion-boosted fission, uses the first two. The third, two-stage thermonuclear, uses all three.\n\n==Pure fission weapons==\n\nThe first task of a nuclear weapon design is to rapidly assemble a [[critical mass|supercritical mass]] of fissile uranium or plutonium. A supercritical mass is one in which the percentage of fission-produced neutrons captured by another fissile nucleus is large enough that each fission event, on average, causes more than one additional fission event.\n\nOnce the critical mass is assembled, at maximum density, a burst of neutrons is supplied to start as many chain reactions as possible. Early weapons used a modulated neutron generator codenamed \"[[Urchin (detonator)|Urchin]]\" inside the pit containing [[polonium]]-210 and [[beryllium]] separated by a thin barrier. Implosion of the pit crushed the neutron generator, mixing the two metals, thereby allowing alpha particles from the polonium to interact with beryllium to produce free neutrons. In modern weapons, the [[neutron generator]] is a high-voltage vacuum tube containing a [[particle accelerator]] which bombards a deuterium/tritium-metal hydride target with deuterium and tritium [[ion]]s. The resulting small-scale fusion produces neutrons at a protected location outside the physics package, from which they penetrate the pit. This method allows better control of the timing of chain reaction initiation.\n\nThe critical mass of an uncompressed sphere of bare metal is {{convert|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for uranium-235 and {{convert|16|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for delta-phase plutonium-239. In practical applications, the amount of material required for criticality is modified by shape, purity, density, and the proximity to [[neutron reflector|neutron-reflecting material]], all of which affect the escape or capture of neutrons.\n\nTo avoid a chain reaction during handling, the fissile material in the weapon must be sub-critical before detonation. It may consist of one or more components containing less than one uncompressed critical mass each. A thin hollow shell can have more than the bare-sphere critical mass, as can a cylinder, which can be arbitrarily long without ever reaching criticality.\n\nA ''tamper'' is an optional layer of dense material surrounding the fissile material. Due to its [[inertia]] it delays the expansion of the reacting material, increasing the efficiency of the weapon. Often the same layer serves both as tamper and as neutron reflector.\n\n===Gun-type assembly weapon===\n[[File:Gun-type fission weapon en-labels thin lines.svg|thumb|350px|Diagram of a gun-type fission weapon]]\n{{Main|Gun-type fission weapon}}\n[[Little Boy]], the Hiroshima bomb, used {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of uranium with an average enrichment of around 80%, or {{convert|51|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of U-235, just about the bare-metal critical mass. (See [[Little Boy#Assembly details|Little Boy]] article for a detailed drawing.) When assembled inside its tamper/reflector of [[tungsten carbide]], the {{convert|64|kg|lb|abbr=on}} was more than twice critical mass. Before the detonation, the uranium-235 was formed into two sub-critical pieces, one of which was later fired down a gun barrel to join the other, starting the nuclear explosion. Analysis shows that less than 2% of the uranium mass underwent fission;<ref>Glasstone and Dolan, ''Effects'', pp. 12\u201313. When 454 g (one pound) of U-235 undergoes complete fission, the yield is 8 kilotons. The 13 to 16-kiloton yield of the Little Boy bomb was therefore produced by the fission of no more than {{convert|2|lb|g}} of U-235, out of the {{convert|141|lb|g}} in the pit. Thus, the remaining {{convert|139|lb|kg}}, 98.5% of the total, contributed nothing to the energy yield.</ref> the remainder, representing most of the entire wartime output of the [[Y-12 National Security Complex|giant Y-12 factories]] at Oak Ridge, scattered uselessly.<ref>Compere, A.L., and Griffith, W.L. 1991. \"The U.S. Calutron Program for Uranium Enrichment: History,. Technology, Operations, and Production. Report\", ORNL-5928, as cited in John Coster-Mullen, \"Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man\", 2003, footnote 28, p. 18. The total wartime output of Oralloy produced at Oak Ridge by July 28, 1945 was 165 pounds (74.68 kg). Of this amount, 84% was scattered over Hiroshima (see previous footnote).</ref>\n\nThe inefficiency was caused by the speed with which the uncompressed fissioning uranium expanded and became sub-critical by virtue of decreased density. Despite its inefficiency, this design, because of its shape, was adapted for use in small-diameter, cylindrical artillery shells (a [[gun-type fission weapon#US nuclear artillery|gun-type warhead]] fired from the barrel of a much larger gun). Such warheads were deployed by the United States until 1992, accounting for a significant fraction of the U-235 in the arsenal, and were some of the first weapons dismantled to comply with treaties limiting warhead numbers. The rationale for this decision was undoubtedly a combination of the lower yield and grave safety issues associated with the gun-type design.\n\n===Implosion-type weapon===\n[[File:Implosion Nuclear weapon.svg|right|350px]]\nFor both the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity device]] and the [[Fat Man]], the Nagasaki bomb, nearly identical plutonium fission through implosion designs were used. The Fat Man device specifically used {{convert|6.2|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, about {{convert|350|ml|usoz|abbr=on|disp=or}} in volume, of [[Pu-239]], which is only 41% of bare-sphere critical mass. (See [[Fat Man#Interior of bomb|Fat Man]] article for a detailed drawing.) Surrounded by a [[uranium-238|U-238]] reflector/tamper, the Fat Man's pit was brought close to critical mass by the neutron-reflecting properties of the U-238. During detonation, criticality was achieved by implosion. The plutonium pit was squeezed to increase its density by simultaneous detonation, as with the \"Trinity\" test detonation three weeks earlier, of the conventional explosives placed uniformly around the pit. The explosives were detonated by multiple [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. It is estimated that only about 20% of the plutonium underwent fission; the rest, about {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, was scattered.\n\n[[File:Implosion bomb animated.gif|left|175px]]\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|right|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high explosive lens system.]]\n\nAn implosion shock wave might be of such short duration that only part of the pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the explosive lens and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low [[density]] [[metal]] \u2013 such as [[aluminium]], [[beryllium]], or an [[alloy]] of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium pusher.\n\nThe series of [[RaLa Experiment]] tests of implosion-type fission weapon design concepts, carried out from July 1944 through February 1945 at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] and a remote site 14.3&nbsp;km (9 miles) east of it in Bayo Canyon, proved the practicality of the implosion design for a fission device, with the February 1945 tests positively determining its usability for the final Trinity/Fat Man plutonium implosion design.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoddeson |first=Lillian |date=2004 |title=Critical Assembly: A Technical History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years, 1943\u20131945 |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=271 |isbn=978-0-521-54117-6|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe key to Fat Man's greater efficiency was the inward momentum of the massive U-238 tamper. (The natural uranium tamper did not undergo fission from thermal neutrons, but did contribute perhaps 20% of the total yield from fission by fast neutrons). Once the chain reaction started in the plutonium, the momentum of the implosion had to be reversed before expansion could stop the fission. By holding everything together for a few hundred nanoseconds more, the efficiency was increased.\n\n====Plutonium pit====\n{{Main|Pit (nuclear weapon)}}\nThe core of an implosion weapon \u2013 the fissile material and any reflector or tamper bonded to it \u2013 is known as the ''pit''. Some weapons tested during the 1950s used pits made with [[uranium-235|U-235]] alone, or in [[composite material|composite]] with [[plutonium]],<ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html \"Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1945 until Present\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423121258/https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html |date=April 23, 2016}} \u2013 \"Fact that plutonium and uranium may be bonded to each other in unspecified pits or weapons.\"</ref> but all-plutonium pits are the smallest in diameter and have been the standard since the early 1960s.\n\nCasting and then machining plutonium is difficult not only because of its toxicity, but also because plutonium has many different [[allotropes of plutonium|metallic phases]]. As plutonium cools, changes in phase result in distortion and cracking. This distortion is normally overcome by alloying it with 30\u201335 mMol (0.9\u20131.0% by weight) [[gallium]], forming a [[plutonium-gallium alloy]], which causes it to take up its delta phase over a wide temperature range.<ref name=\"RDD-7\"/> When cooling from molten it then has only a single phase change, from epsilon to delta, instead of the four changes it would otherwise pass through. Other [[valence (chemistry)|trivalent]] [[metal]]s would also work, but gallium has a small neutron [[absorption cross section]] and helps protect the plutonium against [[corrosion]]. A drawback is that gallium compounds are corrosive and so if the plutonium is recovered from dismantled weapons for conversion to [[plutonium dioxide]] for [[nuclear reactor|power reactors]], there is the difficulty of removing the gallium.\n\nBecause plutonium is chemically reactive it is common to plate the completed pit with a thin layer of inert metal, which also reduces the toxic hazard.<ref name=\"NWFAQ-6.2\"/> [[The gadget]] used galvanic silver plating; afterwards, [[nickel]] deposited from [[nickel tetracarbonyl]] vapors was used,<ref name=\"NWFAQ-6.2\"/> [[gold]] was preferred for many years.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009|reason=not found in nuclearweaponarchive.org cite}} Recent designs improve safety by plating pits with [[vanadium]] to make the pits more fire-resistant.\n\n===Levitated-pit implosion===\nThe first improvement on the Fat Man design was to put an air space between the tamper and the pit to create a hammer-on-nail impact. The pit, supported on a hollow cone inside the tamper cavity, was said to be levitated. The three tests of [[Operation Sandstone]], in 1948, used Fat Man designs with levitated pits. The largest yield was 49 kilotons, more than twice the yield of the unlevitated Fat Man.<ref>All information on nuclear weapon tests comes from Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon: U.S. Nuclear Weapons Development since 1945'', October 1995, Chucklea Productions, Volume VIII, p. 154, Table A-1, \"U.S. Nuclear Detonations and Tests, 1945\u20131962\".</ref>\n\nIt was immediately clear that implosion was the best design for a fission weapon. Its only drawback seemed to be its diameter. Fat Man was {{convert|1.5|m|ft|0}} wide vs {{convert|61|cm|ft|0}} for Little Boy.\n\nEleven years later, implosion designs had advanced sufficiently that the {{convert|1.5|m|ft|adj=on|0}}-diameter sphere of Fat Man had been reduced to a {{convert|0.3|m|ft|adj=on|0}}-diameter cylinder {{convert|0.61|m|ft|0}} long, the [[Swan (nuclear explosive)|Swan]] device.\n\nThe Pu-239 pit of Fat Man was only {{convert|9.1|cm|in}} in diameter, the size of a softball. The bulk of Fat Man's girth was the implosion mechanism, namely concentric layers of U-238, aluminium, and high explosives. The key to reducing that girth was the two-point implosion design.\n\n===Two-point linear implosion===\n[[File:Linear implosion schematic.svg|right|350 px]]\nIn the two-point linear implosion, the nuclear fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within the center of a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed at either end of the explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or ''shaper'', is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it is diffracted around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inwards from the shaper.<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.3 Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 4.1.6.3 Hybrid Assembly Techniques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419071500/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.3 |date=April 19, 2016}}, accessed December 1, 2007. Drawing adapted from the same source.</ref>\n\nDue to the lack of a tamper or lenses to shape the progression, the detonation does not reach the pit in a spherical shape. To produce the desired spherical implosion, the fissile material itself is shaped to produce the same effect. Due to the physics of the shock wave propagation within the explosive mass, this requires the pit to be an oblong shape, roughly egg shaped. The shock wave first reaches the pit at its tips, driving them inward and causing the mass to become spherical. The shock may also change plutonium from delta to alpha phase, increasing its density by 23%, but without the inward momentum of a true implosion.\n\nThe lack of compression makes such designs inefficient, but the simplicity and small diameter make it suitable for use in artillery shells and atomic demolition munitions \u2013 ADMs \u2013 also known as backpack or [[suitcase nuke]]s; an example is the [[W48]] artillery shell, the smallest nuclear weapon ever built or deployed. All such low-yield battlefield weapons, whether gun-type U-235 designs or linear implosion Pu-239 designs, pay a high price in fissile material in order to achieve diameters between six and ten inches (15 and 25&nbsp;cm).\n\n====List of US linear implosion weapons====\nArtillery\n*[[W48]] (1963\u20131992)\n*[[W74]] (cancelled)\n*[[W74|W75]] (cancelled)\n*[[W79]] Mod 1 (1976\u20131992)\n*[[W82]] Mod 1 (cancelled)\n\n===Two-point hollow-pit implosion===\nA more efficient two-point implosion system uses two high explosive lenses and a hollow pit.\n\nA hollow plutonium pit was the original plan for the 1945 Fat Man bomb, but there was not enough time to develop and test the implosion system for it. A simpler solid-pit design was considered more reliable, given the time constraints, but it required a heavy U-238 tamper, a thick aluminium pusher, and three tons of high explosives.\n\nAfter the war, interest in the hollow pit design was revived. Its obvious advantage is that a hollow shell of plutonium, shock-deformed and driven inward toward its empty center, would carry momentum into its violent assembly as a solid sphere. It would be self-tamping, requiring a smaller U-238 tamper, no aluminium pusher and less high explosive.\n\nThe Fat Man bomb had two concentric, spherical shells of high explosives, each about {{convert|25|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} thick. The inner shell drove the implosion. The outer shell consisted of a [[truncated icosahedron|soccer-ball pattern]] of 32 high explosive lenses, each of which converted the convex wave from its detonator into a concave wave matching the contour of the outer surface of the inner shell. If these 32 lenses could be replaced with only two, the high explosive sphere could become an ellipsoid (prolate spheroid) with a much smaller diameter.\n\nA good illustration of these two features is a 1956 drawing from the [[Swedish nuclear weapons program]] (which was terminated before it produced a test explosion). The drawing shows the essential elements of the two-point hollow-pit design.{{Citation needed|reason=Given the state of the SV weapons programme at this date, the diagram seems not to be indicative of the actual modalities, if any, of two-point designs.|date=January 2013}}\n\n[[File:Swedish Atomic Bomb.png|center]]\n\nThere are similar drawings in the open literature from the French program, which produced an arsenal.{{Citation needed|reason=If it is open, all the reason to cite it|date=January 2013}}\n\nThe mechanism of the high explosive lens (diagram item #6) is not shown in the Swedish drawing, but a standard lens made of fast and slow high explosives, as in Fat Man, would be much longer than the shape depicted. For a single high explosive lens to generate a concave wave that envelops an entire hemisphere, it must either be very long or the part of the wave on a direct line from the detonator to the pit must be slowed dramatically.\n\nA slow high explosive is too fast, but the flying plate of an \"air lens\" is not. A metal plate, shock-deformed and pushed across an empty space, can be designed to move slowly enough.<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.2 Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 4.1.6.2.2.4 Cylindrical and Planar Shock Techniques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419071500/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-1.html#Nfaq4.1.6.2 |date=April 19, 2016}}, accessed December 1, 2007.</ref><ref>[https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html#I48 \"Restricted Data Declassification Decisions from 1946 until Present\", Section V.B.2.k] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423121258/https://fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.html#I48 |date=April 23, 2016}} \"The fact of use in high explosive assembled (HEA) weapons of spherical shells of fissile materials, sealed pits; air and ring HE lenses\", declassified November 1972.</ref> A two-point implosion system using air lens technology can have a length no more than twice its diameter, as in the Swedish diagram above.\n\n==Fusion-boosted fission weapons==\n{{Main|Boosted fission weapon}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}\nThe next step in miniaturization was to speed up the fissioning of the pit to reduce the minimum inertial confinement time. This would allow the efficient fission of the fuel with less mass in the form of tamper or the fuel itself. The key to achieving faster fission would be to introduce more neutrons, and among the many ways to do this, adding a fusion reaction was relatively easy in the case of a hollow pit.\n\nThe easiest fusion reaction to achieve is found in a 50\u201350 mixture of tritium and deuterium. For [[fusion power]] experiments this mixture must be held at high temperatures for relatively lengthy times in order to have an efficient reaction. For explosive use, however, the goal is not to produce efficient fusion, but simply provide extra neutrons early in the process. Since a nuclear explosion is supercritical, any extra neutrons will be multiplied by the chain reaction, so even tiny quantities introduced early can have a large effect on the final outcome. For this reason, even the relatively low compression pressures and times (in fusion terms) found in the center of a hollow pit warhead are enough to create the desired effect.\n\nIn the boosted design, the fusion fuel in gas form is pumped into the pit during arming. This will fuse into helium and release free neutrons soon after fission begins. The neutrons will start a large number of new chain reactions while the pit is still critical or nearly critical. Once the hollow pit is perfected, there is little reason not to boost; deuterium and tritium are easily produced in the small quantities needed, and the technical aspects are trivial.\n\nThe concept of fusion-boosted fission was first tested on May 25, 1951, in the [[Greenhouse Item|Item]] shot of [[Operation Greenhouse]], [[Enewetak Atoll|Eniwetok]], yield 45.5 kilotons.\n\nBoosting reduces diameter in three ways, all the result of faster fission:\n* Since the compressed pit does not need to be held together as long, the massive U-238 tamper can be replaced by a light-weight beryllium shell (to reflect escaping neutrons back into the pit). The diameter is reduced.\n* The mass of the pit can be reduced by half, without reducing yield. Diameter is reduced again.\n* Since the mass of the metal being imploded (tamper plus pit) is reduced, a smaller charge of high explosive is needed, reducing diameter even further.\n\nSince boosting is required to attain full design yield, any reduction in boosting reduces yield. Boosted weapons are thus [[variable yield|variable-yield]] weapons (also known as dial-a-yield); yield can be reduced any time before detonation simply by reducing the amount of deuterium/tritium inserted into the pit during the arming procedure.\n\n[[File:U.S. Swan Device.svg|center]]\n\nThe first device whose dimensions suggest employment of all these features (two-point, hollow-pit, fusion-boosted implosion) was the [[Swan (nuclear primary)|Swan]] device. It had a cylindrical shape with a diameter of {{convert|11.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} and a length of {{convert|22.8|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nIt was first tested standalone and then as the primary of a two-stage thermonuclear device during [[Operation Redwing]]. It was weaponized as the [[Robin primary]] and became the first off-the-shelf, multi-use primary, and the prototype for all that followed.\n\n[[File:Nuclear Weapon Miniaturization.png|400px|right]]\n\nAfter the success of Swan, {{convert|11|or|12|in|cm}} seemed to become the standard diameter of boosted single-stage devices tested during the 1950s. Length was usually twice the diameter, but one such device, which became the [[W54]] warhead, was closer to a sphere, only {{convert|15|in|cm}} long. It was tested two dozen times in the 1957\u201362 period before being deployed. No other design had such a long string of test failures.\n\nOne of the applications of the W54 was the [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett XM-388 recoilless rifle projectile]]. It had a dimension of just {{convert|11|in|cm}}, and is shown here in comparison to its Fat Man predecessor ({{convert|60|in|cm}}).\n\nAnother benefit of boosting, in addition to making weapons smaller, lighter, and with less fissile material for a given yield, is that it renders weapons immune to radiation interference (RI). It was discovered in the mid-1950s that plutonium pits would be particularly susceptible to partial [[predetonation]] if exposed to the intense radiation of a nearby nuclear explosion (electronics might also be damaged, but this was a separate problem). RI was a particular problem before effective [[early warning radar]] systems because a first strike attack might make retaliatory weapons useless. Boosting reduces the amount of plutonium needed in a weapon to below the quantity which would be vulnerable to this effect.\n\n==Two-stage thermonuclear weapons==\n{{Main|Thermonuclear weapon}}\n\nPure fission or fusion-boosted fission weapons can be made to yield hundreds of kilotons, at great expense in fissile material and tritium, but by far the most efficient way to increase nuclear weapon yield beyond ten or so kilotons is to add a second independent stage, called a secondary.\n\n[[File:IvyMike2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ivy Mike]], the first two-stage thermonuclear detonation, 10.4 megatons, November 1, 1952.]]\n\nIn the 1940s, bomb designers at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] thought the secondary would be a canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form. The fusion reaction would be D-D, harder to achieve than D-T, but more affordable. A fission bomb at one end would shock-compress and heat the near end, and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end. Mathematical simulations showed it would not work, even with large amounts of expensive tritium added.\n\nThe entire fusion fuel canister would need to be enveloped by fission energy, to both compress and heat it, as with the booster charge in a boosted primary. The design breakthrough came in January 1951, when [[Edward Teller]] and [[Stanislaw Ulam]] invented radiation implosion\u2014for nearly three decades known publicly only as the [[Teller-Ulam]] H-bomb secret.<ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/35680 So I pieced together from Edward's testament and from his memoir that Stan had come to him in February of 1951] American Institute of Physics interview with Richard Garwin by Ken Ford, dated December 2012</ref><ref>[https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/28636-1 he was going to use first hydrodynamics and just the shockwaves and then neutron heating, which would have been a disaster.

The first full test was on November 1, 1952, the [[Ivy Mike|Mike]] shot of [[Operation Ivy]], Eniwetok, yield 10.4 megatons.\n\nIn radiation implosion, the burst of X-ray energy coming from an exploding primary is captured and contained within an opaque-walled radiation channel which surrounds the nuclear energy components of the secondary. The radiation quickly turns the plastic foam that had been filling the channel into a plasma which is mostly transparent to X-rays, and the radiation is absorbed in the outermost layers of the pusher/tamper surrounding the secondary, which ablates and applies a massive force<ref>[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-4.html#Nfaq4.4.3.3 4.4 Elements of Thermonuclear Weapon Design] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311152031/http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq4-4.html#Nfaq4.4.3.3 |date=March 11, 2016}}.

As the secondary implodes a fissile \"spark plug\" at its center ignites and provides neutrons and heat which enable the lithium deuteride fusion fuel to produce tritium and ignite as well. The fission and fusion chain reactions exchange neutrons with each other and boost the efficiency of both reactions. The greater implosive force, enhanced efficiency of the fissile \"spark plug\" due to boosting via fusion neutrons, and the fusion explosion itself provide significantly greater explosive yield from the secondary despite often not being much larger than the primary.\n\n[[File:TellerUlamAblation.png|center|thumb|700px|Ablation mechanism firing sequence.\n{{Ordered list\n|Warhead before firing.

The Flute was {{convert|15|in|cm}} in diameter and {{convert|23.4|in|cm}} long, about the size of the Swan. But it weighed ten times as much and yielded 24 times as much energy (355 kilotons, vs 15 kilotons).\n\nEqually important, the active ingredients in the Flute probably cost no more than those in the Swan. Most of the fission came from cheap U-238, and the tritium was manufactured in place during the explosion. Only the spark plug at the axis of the secondary needed to be fissile.\n\nA spherical secondary can achieve higher implosion densities than a cylindrical secondary, because spherical implosion pushes in from all directions toward the same spot. However, in warheads yielding more than one megaton, the diameter of a spherical secondary would be too large for most applications. A cylindrical secondary is necessary in such cases. The small, cone-shaped re-entry vehicles in multiple-warhead ballistic missiles after 1970 tended to have warheads with spherical secondaries, and yields of a few hundred kilotons.\n\nAs with boosting, the advantages of the two-stage thermonuclear design are so great that there is little incentive not to use it, once a nation has mastered the technology.\n\nIn engineering terms, radiation implosion allows for the exploitation of several known features of nuclear bomb materials which heretofore had eluded practical application. For example:\n* The optimal way to store deuterium in a reasonably dense state is to chemically bond it with lithium, as lithium deuteride. But the lithium-6 isotope is also the raw material for tritium production, and an exploding bomb is a nuclear reactor. Radiation implosion will hold everything together long enough to permit the complete conversion of lithium-6 into tritium, while the bomb explodes. So the bonding agent for deuterium permits use of the D-T fusion reaction without any pre-manufactured tritium being stored in the secondary. The tritium production constraint disappears.\n* For the secondary to be imploded by the hot, radiation-induced plasma surrounding it, it must remain cool for the first microsecond, i.e., it must be encased in a massive radiation (heat) shield. The shield's massiveness allows it to double as a tamper, adding momentum and duration to the implosion. No material is better suited for both of these jobs than ordinary, cheap uranium-238, which also happens to undergo fission when struck by the neutrons produced by D-T fusion. This casing, called the pusher, thus has three jobs: to keep the secondary cool; to hold it, inertially, in a highly compressed state; and, finally, to serve as the chief energy source for the entire bomb. The consumable pusher makes the bomb more a uranium fission bomb than a hydrogen fusion bomb. Insiders never used the term \"hydrogen bomb\".<ref>Until a reliable design was worked out in the early 1950s, the hydrogen bomb (public name) was called the superbomb by insiders. After that, insiders used a more descriptive name: two-stage thermonuclear. Two examples. From Herb York, ''The Advisors'', 1976, \"This book is about ... the development of the H-bomb, or the superbomb as it was then called.\" p. ix, and \"The rapid and successful development of the superbomb (or super as it came to be called) ...\" p. 5. From National Public Radio Talk of the Nation, November 8, 2005, Siegfried Hecker of Los Alamos, \"the hydrogen bomb \u2013 that is, a two-stage thermonuclear device, as we referred to it \u2013 is indeed the principal part of the US arsenal, as it is of the Russian arsenal.\"</ref>\n* Finally, the heat for fusion ignition comes not from the primary but from a second fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded in the heart of the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.<ref name=\"CLR\"/>\n\nThe initial impetus behind the two-stage weapon was President Truman's 1950 promise to build a 10-megaton hydrogen superbomb as the U.S. response to the 1949 test of the first Soviet fission bomb. But the resulting invention turned out to be the cheapest and most compact way to build small nuclear bombs as well as large ones, erasing any meaningful distinction between A-bombs and H-bombs, and between boosters and supers. All preferred techniques for fission and fusion explosions are incorporated into one all-encompassing, fully scalable design principle. Even {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} diameter nuclear artillery shells can be two-stage thermonuclears.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nIn the ensuing fifty years, nobody has come up with a more efficient way to build a nuclear bomb. It is the design of choice for the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom, China, and France, the five thermonuclear powers.

An essential energy transfer modulator called the interstage, between the primary and the secondary, protects the secondary's fusion fuel from heating too quickly, which could cause it to explode in a conventional (and small) heat explosion before the fusion and fission reactions get a chance to start.\n\n[[File:W76NeutronTube1200c20.jpg|thumb|right|[[W76]] Neutron Tubes in a Gun Carriage Style Fixture]]\n\nThere is very little information in the open literature about the mechanism of the interstage.

Examples:\n\n===Hydrogen bombs===\n{{Main|Thermonuclear weapon}}\nWhile all modern nuclear weapons (fission and fusion alike) make some use of D-T fusion, in the public perception hydrogen bombs are multi-megaton devices a thousand times more powerful than Hiroshima's Little Boy. Such high-yield bombs are actually two-stage thermonuclears, scaled up to the desired yield, with uranium fission, as usual, providing most of their energy.\n\nThe idea of the hydrogen bomb first came to public attention in 1949, when prominent scientists openly recommended against building nuclear bombs more powerful than the standard pure-fission model, on both moral and practical grounds. Their assumption was that critical mass considerations would limit the potential size of fission explosions, but that a fusion explosion could be as large as its supply of fuel, which has no critical mass limit. In 1949, the Soviets exploded their first fission bomb, and in 1950 U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ended the H-bomb debate by ordering the Los Alamos designers to build one.\n\nIn 1952, the 10.4-megaton [[Ivy Mike]] explosion was announced as the first hydrogen bomb test, reinforcing the idea that hydrogen bombs are a thousand times more powerful than fission bombs.\n\nIn 1954, [[Robert Oppenheimer|J. Robert Oppenheimer]] was labeled a hydrogen bomb opponent. The public did not know there were two kinds of hydrogen bomb (neither of which is accurately described as a hydrogen bomb). On May 23, when his security clearance was revoked, item three of the four public findings against him was \"his conduct in the hydrogen bomb program.\" In 1949, Oppenheimer had supported single-stage fusion-boosted fission bombs, to maximize the explosive power of the arsenal given the trade-off between plutonium and tritium production. He opposed two-stage thermonuclear bombs until 1951, when radiation implosion, which he called \"technically sweet\", first made them practical. The complexity of his position was not revealed to the public until 1976, nine years after his death.<ref>Herbert York, ''The Advisors: Oppenheimer, Teller and the Superbomb'' (1976).</ref>\n\nWhen ballistic missiles replaced bombers in the 1960s, most multi-megaton bombs were replaced by missile warheads (also two-stage thermonuclears) scaled down to one megaton or less.\n\n==={{Anchor|Alarm Clock}}Alarm Clock/Sloika===\n\nThe first effort to exploit the symbiotic relationship between fission and fusion was a 1940s design that mixed fission and fusion fuel in alternating thin layers. As a single-stage device, it would have been a cumbersome application of boosted fission. It first became practical when incorporated into the secondary of a two-stage thermonuclear weapon.<ref>\"The 'Alarm Clock' ... became practical only by the inclusion of Li6 (in 1950) and its combination with the radiation implosion.\" Hans A. Bethe, [https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm Memorandum on the History of Thermonuclear Program] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030002/https://fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/nuclear/bethe-52.htm |date=March 4, 2016}}, May 28, 1952.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. name, Alarm Clock, came from Teller: he called it that because it might \"wake up the world\" to the possibility of the potential of the Super.{{sfn|Rhodes|1995|p=256}} The Russian name for the same design was more descriptive: Sloika ({{lang-ru|\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0439\u043a\u0430}}), a layered pastry cake. A single-stage Soviet Sloika was tested on August 12, 1953. No single-stage U.S. version was tested, but the [[Castle Union|Union]] shot of [[Operation Castle]], April 26, 1954, was a two-stage thermonuclear device code-named Alarm Clock. Its yield, at [[Bikini Atoll|Bikini]], was 6.9 megatons.\n\nBecause the Soviet Sloika test used dry lithium-6 deuteride eight months before the first U.S. test to use it (Castle Bravo, March 1, 1954), it was sometimes claimed that the USSR won the H-bomb race, even though the United States tested and developed the first hydrogen bomb: the Ivy Mike H-bomb test. The 1952 U.S. Ivy Mike test used cryogenically cooled liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel in the secondary, and employed the D-D fusion reaction. However, the first Soviet test to use a radiation-imploded secondary, the essential feature of a true H-bomb, was on November 23, 1955, three years after Ivy Mike. In fact, real work on the implosion scheme in the Soviet Union only commenced in the very early part of 1953, several months after the successful testing of Sloika.\n\n===Clean bombs===\n[[File:Bassoon Prime.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Bassoon, the prototype for a 9.3-megaton clean bomb or a 25-megaton dirty bomb. Dirty version shown here, before its 1956 test. The two attachments on the left are ''light pipes'' - see below for elaboration.]]\nOn March 1, 1954, the largest-ever U.S. nuclear test explosion, the 15-megaton [[Castle Bravo|Bravo]] shot of Operation Castle at Bikini Atoll, delivered a promptly lethal dose of fission-product fallout to more than {{convert|6000|sqmi|km2}} of Pacific Ocean surface.<ref>See [[:File:Bravo fallout2.png|map]].</ref> Radiation injuries to Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen made that fact public and revealed the role of fission in hydrogen bombs.\n\nIn response to the public alarm over fallout, an effort was made to design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of [[uranium-238|unenriched natural uranium]], when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can far exceed the energy released by fusion, as was the case in the [[Castle Bravo]] test. Replacing the [[fissionable]] material in the tamper with another material is essential to producing a \"clean\" bomb. In such a device, the tamper no longer contributes energy, so for any given weight, a clean bomb will have less yield. The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956 in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of [[Operation Redwing]]. This shot used non-fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.\n\nThe public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion reactions are the [[peaceful nuclear explosion]]s of the 1970s, with the 3 detonations that excavated part of [[Pechora\u2013Kama Canal]] being cited as 98% fusion each in the ''Taiga'' test's 15 [[kiloton]] explosive yield devices; that is, a total fission fraction of 0.3 [[kiloton]]s in a 15 kt device.<ref>[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313100251/http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm |date=March 13, 2016}} by Milo D.

The Bassoon Prime produced a 5-megaton yield, of which 87% came from fission. Data obtained from this test, and others, culminated in the eventual deployment of the highest yielding US nuclear weapon known, and the highest [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield-to-weight weapon ever made]], a three-stage thermonuclear weapon with a maximum \"dirty\" yield of 25 megatons, designated as the [[B41 nuclear bomb]], which was to be carried by U.S. Air Force bombers until it was decommissioned; this weapon was never fully tested.\n\nAs such, high-yield clean bombs appear to have been of little value from a military standpoint. The actual deployed weapons were the dirty versions, which maximized yield for the same size device. The need for low fission fraction nuclear devices was driven only by the likes of [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]] and [[peaceful nuclear explosion]]s - for earth excavation with little contamination of the resulting excavated area.\n\n===Third generation nuclear weapons===\nFirst and second generation nuclear weapons release energy as omnidirectional blasts.

The neutron-activated cobalt would have maximized the environmental damage from radioactive fallout. These bombs were popularized in the 1964 film ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]''; the material added to the bombs is referred to in the film as 'cobalt-thorium G'.\n\nSuch \"salted\" weapons were requested by the U.S. Air Force and seriously investigated, possibly built and tested, but not deployed. In the 1964 edition of the DOD/AEC book ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons,'' a new section titled Radiological Warfare clarified the issue.<ref>Samuel Glasstone, ''The Effects of Nuclear Weapons'', 1962, Revised 1964, U.S. Dept of Defense and U.S. Dept of Energy, pp.464\u20135. This section was removed from later editions, but, according to Glasstone in 1978, not because it was inaccurate or because the weapons had changed.</ref> Fission products are as deadly as neutron-activated cobalt. The standard high-fission thermonuclear weapon is automatically a weapon of radiological warfare, as dirty as a cobalt bomb.\n\nInitially, gamma radiation from the fission products of an equivalent size fission-fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than [[cobalt-60|Co-60]]: 15,000 times more intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week; 5 times more intense at 1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 times more intense at 5 years. The very long-lived isotopes produced by fission would overtake the <sup>60</sup>Co again after about 75 years.<ref name=\"Nuclear Weapons FAQ: 1.6\"/>\n\nThe triple \"taiga\" nuclear [[salvo]] test, as part of the preliminary March 1971 [[Pechora\u2013Kama Canal]] project, produced a small amount of fission products and therefore a comparatively large amount of case material activated products are responsible for most of the residual activity at the site today, namely Co-60. With this [[neutron activation|fusion generated neutron activation]] product being responsible for about half of the gamma dose now(2011) at the test site, albeit with that dose being too small to cause deleterious effects, normal green vegetation exists all around the lake that was formed.<ref>{{cite journal|url= |title= Radiological investigations at the \"Taiga\" nuclear explosion site: Site description and in situ measurements|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.04.003|pmid= 21524834|volume=102|issue= 7|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|pages=672\u2013680|year= 2011|last1= Ramzaev|first1= V|last2= Repin|first2= V|last3= Medvedev|first3= A|last4= Khramtsov|first4= E|last5= Timofeeva|first5= M|last6= Yakovlev|first6= V}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url= |title= Radiological investigations at the \"Taiga\" nuclear explosion site, part II: man-made \u03b3-ray emitting radionuclides in the ground and the resultant kerma rate in air|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2011.12.009|pmid= 22541991|volume=109|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|pages=1\u201312|year= 2012|last1= Ramzaev|first1= V|last2= Repin|first2= V|last3= Medvedev|first3= A|last4= Khramtsov|first4= E|last5= Timofeeva|first5= M|last6= Yakovlev|first6= V}}</ref>\n\n===Fission-fusion-fission bombs vs. three-stage (tertiary) bombs===\n{{Repetition|date=July 2015}}\nIn 1954, to explain the surprising amount of fission-product fallout produced by hydrogen bombs, Ralph Lapp coined the term fission-fusion-fission to describe a process inside what he called a three-stage thermonuclear weapon.<ref name=\"LIFE 1955\">{{cite journal |title=Why the H-Bomb Is Now Called the 3-F |journal=LIFE |pages=54\u201355 |date=December 5, 1955 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iD8EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA54&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Time Inc }}</ref> His process explanation was correct, but his choice of terms caused confusion in the open literature. The stages of a nuclear weapon are not fission, fusion, and fission. They are the primary, the secondary, and, in a very few exceptional and powerful weapons no longer in service, the tertiary. Tertiary (three-stage) designs, such as the U.S. [[B41 nuclear bomb]] and the Soviet [[Tsar Bomba]] (discussed above), were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; all have since been retired, as the typical multi-megaton yields of tertiary bombs do not destroy targets efficiently, since they waste energy in a sphere above and below an area of land. For this reason, all tertiary bombs have given way in modern nuclear arsenals to multiple smaller two-stage bomb tactics (see for example, [[MIRV]]). Such two-stage bombs, even though less efficient in yield, are nevertheless more destructive for their total bomb weight, because they can be distributed over a roughly two-dimensional area of land at the target.\n\nAll so-called \"fission-fusion-fission\" weapons (i.e., all conventional modern thermonuclear warheads) employ the additional step of \"jacket fissioning\", using fusion neutrons. This works as follows: the high-energy or \"fast\" neutrons generated by fusion are used to fission a fissionable jacket located around the fusion stage. In the past this jacket was often made of natural or depleted uranium; but today's weapons in which there is a premium on weight and size (i.e., virtually all modern strategic weapons) use moderately-to-highly enriched uranium as the jacketing material (see [[nuclear weapon design#Oralloy thermonuclear warheads|Oralloy thermonuclear warheads]] section below). The [[fast fission]] of the secondary jacket in fission-fusion-fission bombs is sometimes referred to as a \"third stage\" in the bomb, but it should not be confused with the obsolete true three-stage thermonuclear design, in which there existed another complete tertiary fusion stage.\n\nIn the era of open-air atomic testing, the fission jacket was sometimes omitted, in order to create so-called \"clean bombs\" (see above), or to reduce the amount of radioactive fallout from [[fission product]]s in very large multi-megaton blasts. This was done most often in the testing of very large tertiary bomb designs, such as the Tsar Bomba and the Zuni test shot of [[Operation Redwing]], as discussed above. In the testing of such weapons, it was assumed (and sometimes shown operationally) that a jacket of natural uranium or [[enriched uranium]] could always be added to a given unjacketed bomb, if desired, to increase the yield from two to five times.\n\nThe fission jacket is not used in the [[enhanced radiation weapon]], or [[neutron bomb]], discussed later.\n\n===Arbitrarily large multi-staged devices===\nThe idea of a device which has an arbitrarily large number of Teller-Ulam stages, with each driving a larger radiation-driven implosion than the preceding stage, is frequently suggested,<ref>{{cite book\n| last1  = Winterberg\n| first1 = Friedwardt\n| title  = The Release of Thermonuclear Energy by Inertial Confinement: Ways Towards Ignition\n| publisher = World Scientific\n| date   = 2010\n| location =\n| pages  = 192\u2013193\n| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=B7RV_vASz0EC&pg=PA192&dq=arbitrarily+large+gains%22staged+Teller-Ulam\n| doi    =\n| id     =\n| isbn   = 978-9814295918\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last1  = Croddy\n| first1 = Eric A.\n| last2  = Wirtz\n| first2 = James J.\n| last3  = Larsen\n| first3 = Jeffrey, Eds.\n| title  = Weapons of Mass Destruction: An Encyclopedia of Worldwide Policy, Technology, and History\n| publisher = ABC-CLIO, Inc.\n| date   = 2005\n| location =\n| pages  = 376\n| url    = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=RA1-PA376&dq=almost+unlimited+yield\n| doi    =\n| id     =\n| isbn   = 978-1-85109-490-5\n}}</ref> but technically disputed.<ref name=\"ieri.be\">''How much large can bombs be made through staging?

This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).\n\nERWs are more accurately described as suppressed yield weapons. When the yield of a nuclear weapon is less than one kiloton, its lethal radius from blast, {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is less than that from its neutron radiation. However, the blast is more than potent enough to destroy most structures, which are less resistant to blast effects than even unprotected human beings. Blast pressures of upwards of 20 PSI are survivable, whereas most buildings will collapse with a pressure of only 5 PSI.\n\nCommonly misconceived as a weapon designed to kill populations and leave infrastructure intact, these bombs (as mentioned above) are still very capable of leveling buildings over a large radius. The intent of their design was to kill tank crews \u2013 tanks giving excellent protection against blast and heat, surviving (relatively) very close to a detonation. Given the Soviets' vast tank forces during the Cold War, this was the perfect weapon to counter them. The neutron radiation could instantly incapacitate a tank crew out to roughly the same distance that the heat and blast would incapacitate an unprotected human (depending on design). The tank chassis would also be rendered highly radioactive, temporarily preventing its re-use by a fresh crew.\n\nNeutron weapons were also intended for use in other applications, however. For example, they are effective in anti-nuclear defenses \u2013 the neutron flux being capable of neutralising an incoming warhead at a greater range than heat or blast. Nuclear warheads are very resistant to physical damage, but are very difficult to harden against extreme neutron flux.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+ Energy distribution of weapon\n|-\n! !!

Fusion provided the neutrons. Developed in the 1950s, they were first deployed in the 1970s, by U.S. forces in Europe. The last ones were retired in the 1990s.\n\nA neutron bomb is only feasible if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, and if the yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1\u201310 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10\u201315 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a [[W87]] or [[W88]].<ref name=\"Neutron bomb: Why 'clean' is deadly\"/>\n\n===Oralloy thermonuclear warheads===\n[[File:W-88 warhead detail.png|thumb|drawing of W-88]]\n\nIn 1999, nuclear weapon design was in the news again, for the first time in decades. In January, the U.S. House of Representatives released the [[Cox Report]] ([[Christopher Cox]] R-CA) which alleged that China had somehow acquired classified information about the U.S. W88 warhead. Nine months later, [[Wen Ho Lee]], a Taiwanese immigrant working at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]], was publicly accused of [[espionage|spying]], arrested, and served nine months in [[detention of suspects|pre-trial detention]], before the case against him was dismissed. It is not clear that there was, in fact, any espionage.\n\nIn the course of eighteen months of news coverage, the W88 warhead was described in unusual detail. ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed a schematic diagram on its front page.<ref>Broad, William J. (7 September 1999), \"Spies versus sweat, the debate over China's nuclear advance\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p 1.

It has been described as the most advanced, although open literature accounts do not indicate any major design features that were not available to U.S. designers in 1958.\n\nThe above diagram shows all the standard features of ballistic missile warheads since the 1960s, with two exceptions that give it a higher yield for its size.\n* The outer layer of the secondary, called the \"pusher\", which serves three functions: [[heat shield]], tamper, and [[nuclear fuel|fission fuel]], is made of U-235 instead of U-238, hence the name [[Oralloy]] (U-235) Thermonuclear. Being fissile, rather than merely fissionable, allows the pusher to fission faster and more completely, increasing yield. This feature is available only to nations with a great wealth of fissile uranium. The United States is estimated to have 500 tons.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n* The secondary is located in the wide end of the re-entry cone, where it can be larger, and thus more powerful. The usual arrangement is to put the heavier, denser secondary in the narrow end for greater aerodynamic stability during re-entry from outer space, and to allow more room for a bulky primary in the wider part of the cone. (The W87 warhead drawing in the [[W87|W87 article]] shows the usual arrangement.) Because of this new geometry, the W88 primary uses compact conventional high explosives (CHE) to save space,<ref>Jonathan Medalia, \"The Reliable Replacement Warhead Program: Background and Current Developments\", [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32929.pdf CRS Report RL32929] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311184154/https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL32929.pdf |date=March 11, 2016}}, Dec 18, 2007, p CRS-11.</ref> rather than the more usual, and bulky but safer, insensitive high explosives (IHE).

Other nuclear weapon design labs in other countries duplicated those design innovations independently, reverse-engineered them from fallout analysis, or acquired them by espionage.<ref>William J. Broad, \"The Hidden Travels of The Bomb: Atomic insiders say the weapon was invented only once, and its secrets were spread around the globe by spies, scientists and the covert acts of nuclear states\", ''New York Times'', December 9, 2008, p D1.</ref>\n\n===Berkeley===\n{{Main|Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory}}\nThe first systematic exploration of nuclear weapon design concepts took place in mid-1942 at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Important early discoveries had been made at the adjacent [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]], such as the 1940 cyclotron-made production and isolation of plutonium. A Berkeley professor, [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], had just been hired to run the nation's secret bomb design effort. His first act was to convene the 1942 summer conference.\n\nBy the time he moved his operation to the new secret town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the spring of 1943, the accumulated wisdom on nuclear weapon design consisted of five lectures by Berkeley professor [[Robert Serber]], transcribed and distributed as the [[Los Alamos Primer]].<ref name=\"Primer\">{{cite book|last1=Server|first1=Robert|title=The Los Alamos Primer|date=1992|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9780520075764|edition=1st}}</ref> The Primer addressed fission energy, [[neutron]] production and [[neutron capture|capture]], [[nuclear chain reaction]]s, [[critical mass]], tampers, predetonation, and three methods of assembling a bomb: gun assembly, implosion, and \"autocatalytic methods\", the one approach that turned out to be a dead end.\n\n===Los Alamos===\n{{Main|Los Alamos National Laboratory}}\nAt Los Alamos, it was found in April 1944 by [[Emilio Segr\u00e8]] that the proposed [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]] Gun assembly type bomb would not work for plutonium because of predetonation problems caused by [[Pu-240]] impurities. So Fat Man, the implosion-type bomb, was given high priority as the only option for plutonium. The Berkeley discussions had generated theoretical estimates of critical mass, but nothing precise. The main wartime job at Los Alamos was the experimental determination of critical mass, which had to wait until sufficient amounts of fissile material arrived from the production plants: uranium from [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]], and plutonium from the [[Hanford Site]] in Washington.\n\nIn 1945, using the results of critical mass experiments, Los Alamos technicians fabricated and assembled components for four bombs: the ''[[Trinity test|Trinity]]'' [[the gadget|Gadget]], Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused spare Fat Man. After the war, those who could, including Oppenheimer, returned to university teaching positions. Those who remained worked on levitated and hollow pits and conducted weapon effects tests such as [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] Able and Baker at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946.\n\nAll of the essential ideas for incorporating fusion into nuclear weapons originated at Los Alamos between 1946 and 1952. After the [[Teller-Ulam design|Teller-Ulam]] radiation implosion breakthrough of 1951, the technical implications and possibilities were fully explored, but ideas not directly relevant to making the largest possible bombs for long-range Air Force bombers were shelved.\n\nBecause of Oppenheimer's initial position in the H-bomb debate, in opposition to large thermonuclear weapons, and the assumption that he still had influence over Los Alamos despite his departure, political allies of [[Edward Teller]] decided he needed his own laboratory in order to pursue H-bombs. By the time it was opened in 1952, in [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]], California, Los Alamos had finished the job Livermore was designed to do.\n\n===Livermore===\n{{Main|Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}\nWith its original mission no longer available, the Livermore lab tried radical new designs that failed. Its first three nuclear tests were [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzles]]: in 1953, two single-stage [[uranium hydride bomb|fission devices with uranium hydride pits]], and in 1954, a two-stage thermonuclear device in which the secondary heated up prematurely, too fast for radiation implosion to work properly.\n\nShifting gears, Livermore settled for taking ideas Los Alamos had shelved and developing them for the Army and Navy. This led Livermore to specialize in small-diameter tactical weapons, particularly ones using two-point implosion systems, such as the Swan. Small-diameter tactical weapons became primaries for small-diameter secondaries. Around 1960, when the superpower arms race became a ballistic missile race, Livermore warheads were more useful than the large, heavy Los Alamos warheads. Los Alamos warheads were used on the first [[intermediate-range ballistic missile]]s, IRBMs, but smaller Livermore warheads were used on the first [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, ICBMs, and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s, SLBMs, as well as on the first [[multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple warhead]] systems on such missiles.<ref>Sybil Francis, ''Warhead Politics: Livermore and the Competitive System of Nuclear Warhead Design'', UCRL-LR-124754, June 1995, Ph.D. Dissertation, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, available from National Technical Information Service. This 233-page thesis was written by a weapons-lab outsider for public distribution. The author had access to all the classified information at Livermore that was relevant to her research on warhead design; consequently, she was required to use non-descriptive code words for certain innovations.</ref>\n\nIn 1957 and 1958, both labs built and tested as many designs as possible, in anticipation that a planned 1958 test ban might become permanent. By the time testing resumed in 1961 the two labs had become duplicates of each other, and design jobs were assigned more on workload considerations than lab specialty. Some designs were horse-traded. For example, the [[W38]] warhead for the [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] I missile started out as a Livermore project, was given to Los Alamos when it became the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] missile warhead, and in 1959 was given back to Livermore, in trade for the [[W54]] [[Davy Crockett (nuclear device)|Davy Crockett]] warhead, which went from Livermore to Los Alamos.\n\nWarhead designs after 1960 took on the character of model changes, with every new missile getting a new warhead for marketing reasons. The chief substantive change involved packing more fissile uranium-235 into the secondary, as it became available with continued [[uranium enrichment]] and the dismantlement of the large high-yield bombs.\n\nStarting with the [[Nova (laser)#Fusion in Nova|Nova]] facility at Livermore in the mid-1980s, nuclear design activity pertaining to radiation-driven implosion was informed by research with ''indirect drive'' laser fusion. This work was part of the effort to investigate [[Inertial confinement fusion#Nuclear weapons program|Inertial Confinement Fusion]]. Similar work continues at the more powerful [[National Ignition Facility]]. The [[Stockpile stewardship#Stockpile Stewardship  Management Program|Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] also benefitted from research performed at [[National Ignition Facility#Stockpile experiments|NIF]].\n\n==Explosive testing==\nNuclear weapons are in large part designed by trial and error. The trial often involves test explosion of a prototype.\n\nIn a nuclear explosion, a large number of discrete events, with various probabilities, aggregate into short-lived, chaotic energy flows inside the device casing. Complex mathematical models are required to approximate the processes, and in the 1950s there were no computers powerful enough to run them properly. Even today's computers and simulation software are not adequate.<ref>Walter Goad, [https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/goad.html Declaration for the Wen Ho Lee case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308031512/https://fas.org/irp/ops/ci/goad.html |date=March 8, 2016}}, May 17, 2000. Goad began thermonuclear weapon design work at Los Alamos in 1950. In his Declaration, he mentions \"basic scientific problems of computability which cannot be solved by more computing power alone. These are typified by the problem of long range predictions of weather and climate, and extend to predictions of nuclear weapons behavior. This accounts for the fact that, after the enormous investment of effort over many years, weapons codes can still not be relied on for significantly new designs.\"</ref>\n\nIt was easy enough to design reliable weapons for the stockpile. If the prototype worked, it could be weaponized and mass-produced.\n\nIt was much more difficult to understand how it worked or why it failed. Designers gathered as much data as possible during the explosion, before the device destroyed itself, and used the data to calibrate their models, often by inserting [[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]] into equations to make the simulations match experimental results. They also analyzed the weapon debris in fallout to see how much of a potential nuclear reaction had taken place.\n\n===Light pipes===\nAn important tool for test analysis was the diagnostic light pipe. A probe inside a test device could transmit information by heating a plate of metal to incandescence, an event that could be recorded by instruments located at the far end of a long, very straight pipe.\n\nThe picture below shows the Shrimp device, detonated on March 1, 1954 at Bikini, as the [[Castle Bravo]] test. Its 15-megaton explosion was the largest ever by the United States. The silhouette of a man is shown for scale. The device is supported from below, at the ends. The pipes going into the shot cab ceiling, which appear to be supports, are actually diagnostic light pipes. The eight pipes at the right end (1) sent information about the detonation of the primary. Two in the middle (2) marked the time when x-radiation from the primary reached the radiation channel around the secondary. The last two pipes (3) noted the time radiation reached the far end of the radiation channel, the difference between (2) and (3) being the radiation transit time for the channel.<ref>Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon'', Volume IV, pp. 211\u2013212, 284.</ref>\n[[File:Castle Bravo Shrimp composite.png|600 px|centre]]\n\nFrom the shot cab, the pipes turned horizontally and traveled 7500&nbsp;ft (2.3&nbsp;km) along a causeway built on the Bikini reef to a remote-controlled data collection bunker on Namu Island.\n\nWhile x-rays would normally travel at the speed of light through a low-density material like the plastic foam channel filler between (2) and (3), the intensity of radiation from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy. While the secondary is being compressed via radiation-induced ablation, neutrons from the primary catch up with the x-rays, penetrate into the secondary, and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above. This Li-6 + n reaction is exothermic, producing 5 MeV per event. The spark plug has not yet been compressed, and, thus, remains subcritical, so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result. If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete, though, the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded, potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite. The first Livermore-designed thermonuclear weapon, the Morgenstern device, failed in this manner when it was tested as [[Castle Koon]] on April 7, 1954. The primary ignited, but the secondary, preheated by the primary's neutron wave, suffered what was termed as an ''inefficient detonation'';<ref name=\"swordsIV\">{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=IV |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>{{refpage|165}} thus, a weapon with a predicted one-megaton yield produced only 110 kilotons, of which merely 10 kt were attributed to fusion.<ref name=\"swordsIII\">{{cite book |authorlink=Chuck Hansen |first=Chuck |last=Hansen |title=Swords of Armageddon |volume=III |date=1995 |url=http://www.uscoldwar.com |accessdate=2016-05-20}}</ref>{{refpage|316}}\n\nThese timing effects, and any problems they cause, are measured by light-pipe data. The mathematical simulations which they calibrate are called radiation flow hydrodynamics codes, or channel codes. They are used to predict the effect of future design modifications.\n\nIt is not clear from the public record how successful the Shrimp light pipes were. The unmanned data bunker was far enough back to remain outside the mile-wide crater, but the 15-megaton blast, two and a half times as powerful as expected, breached the bunker by blowing its 20-ton door off the hinges and across the inside of the bunker. (The nearest people were twenty miles (32&nbsp;km) farther away, in a bunker that survived intact.)<ref>Dr. John C. Clark, as told to Robert Cahn, \"We Were Trapped by Radioactive Fallout\", ''The Saturday Evening Post'', July 20, 1957, pp. 17\u201319, 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n===Fallout analysis===\n{{See also|Nuclear forensics}}\nThe most interesting data from Castle Bravo came from radio-chemical analysis of weapon debris in fallout. Because of a shortage of enriched lithium-6, 60% of the lithium in the Shrimp secondary was ordinary lithium-7, which doesn't breed tritium as easily as lithium-6 does. But it does breed lithium-6 as the product of an (n, 2n) reaction (one neutron in, two neutrons out), a known fact, but with unknown probability. The probability turned out to be high.\n\nFallout analysis revealed to designers that, with the (n, 2n) reaction, the Shrimp secondary effectively had two and half times as much lithium-6 as expected. The tritium, the fusion yield, the neutrons, and the fission yield were all increased accordingly.<ref>{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Rhodes |title=Dark Sun; the Making of the Hydrogen Bomb |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |page=541 |ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAs noted above, Bravo's fallout analysis also told the outside world, for the first time, that thermonuclear bombs are more fission devices than fusion devices. A Japanese fishing boat, ''[[Daigo Fukury\u016b Maru]]'', sailed home with enough fallout on her decks to allow scientists in Japan and elsewhere to determine, and announce, that most of the fallout had come from the fission of U-238 by fusion-produced 14 MeV neutrons.\n\n===Underground testing===\n{{Main|Underground nuclear weapons testing}}\n[[File:Nevada Test Site craters.jpg|thumb|right|Subsidence Craters at Yucca Flat, Nevada Test Site.]]\nThe global alarm over radioactive fallout, which began with the Castle Bravo event, eventually drove nuclear testing literally underground. The last U.S. above-ground test took place at [[Johnston Island]] on November 4, 1962. During the next three decades, until September 23, 1992, the United States conducted an average of 2.4 underground nuclear explosions per month, all but a few at the [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS) northwest of Las Vegas.\n\nThe [[Yucca Flat]] section of the NTS is covered with subsidence craters resulting from the collapse of terrain over radioactive caverns created by nuclear explosions (see photo).\n\nAfter the 1974 [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] (TTBT), which limited underground explosions to 150 kilotons or less, warheads like the half-megaton W88 had to be tested at less than full yield. Since the primary must be detonated at full yield in order to generate data about the implosion of the secondary, the reduction in yield had to come from the secondary. Replacing much of the lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel with lithium-7 hydride limited the tritium available for fusion, and thus the overall yield, without changing the dynamics of the implosion. The functioning of the device could be evaluated using light pipes, other sensing devices, and analysis of trapped weapon debris. The full yield of the stockpiled weapon could be calculated by extrapolation.\n\n==Production facilities==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=June 2014}}\nWhen two-stage weapons became standard in the early 1950s, weapon design determined the layout of the new, widely dispersed U.S. production facilities, and vice versa.\n\nBecause primaries tend to be bulky, especially in diameter, plutonium is the fissile material of choice for pits, with beryllium reflectors. It has a smaller critical mass than uranium. The [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]] plant near Boulder, Colorado, was built in 1952 for pit production and consequently became the plutonium and beryllium fabrication facility.\n\nThe Y-12 plant in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]], where [[mass spectrometer]]s called [[calutron]]s had enriched uranium for the [[Manhattan Project]], was redesigned to make secondaries. Fissile U-235 makes the best spark plugs because its critical mass is larger, especially in the cylindrical shape of early thermonuclear secondaries. Early experiments used the two fissile materials in combination, as composite Pu-Oy pits and spark plugs, but for mass production, it was easier to let the factories specialize: plutonium pits in primaries, uranium spark plugs and pushers in secondaries.\n\nY-12 made lithium-6 deuteride fusion fuel and U-238 parts, the other two ingredients of secondaries.\n\nThe Hanford Site near Richland WA operated Plutonium production nuclear reactors and separations facilities during World War 2 and the Cold War. Nine Plutonium production reactors were built and operated there. The first being the B-Reactor which began operations in September 1944 and the last being the N-Reactor which ceased operations in January 1987.\n\nThe [[Savannah River Site]] in [[Aiken, South Carolina|Aiken]], [[South Carolina]], also built in 1952, operated [[nuclear reactor]]s which converted U-238 into Pu-239 for pits, and converted lithium-6 (produced at Y-12) into tritium for booster gas. Since its reactors were moderated with heavy water, deuterium oxide, it also made deuterium for booster gas and for Y-12 to use in making lithium-6 deuteride.\n\n==Warhead design safety==\nBecause even low-yield nuclear warheads have astounding destructive power, weapon designers have always recognised the need to incorporate mechanisms and associated procedures intended to prevent accidental detonation.\n\n[[File:Steel balls.png|thumb|right|300px|A diagram of the ''[[Green Grass (nuclear warhead)|Green Grass]]'' warhead's steel ball safety device, shown left, filled (safe) and right, empty (live). The steel balls were emptied into a hopper underneath the aircraft before flight, and could be re-inserted using a funnel by rotating the bomb on its trolley and raising the hopper.]]\n\n===Gun-type weapons===\nIt is inherently dangerous to have a weapon containing a quantity and shape of fissile material which can form a critical mass through a relatively simple accident. Because of this danger, the propellant in Little Boy (four bags of [[cordite]]) was inserted into the bomb in flight, shortly after takeoff on August 6, 1945. This was the first time a gun-type nuclear weapon had ever been fully assembled.\n\nIf the weapon falls into water, the [[neutron moderator|moderating]] effect of the [[light-water reactor|water]] can also cause a [[criticality accident]], even without the weapon being physically damaged. Similarly, a fire caused by an aircraft crashing could easily ignite the propellant, with catastrophic results. Gun-type weapons have always been inherently unsafe.\n\n===In-flight pit insertion===\nNeither of these effects is likely with implosion weapons since there is normally insufficient fissile material to form a critical mass without the correct detonation of the lenses. However, the earliest implosion weapons had pits so close to criticality that accidental detonation with some nuclear yield was a concern.\n\nOn August 9, 1945, Fat Man was loaded onto its airplane fully assembled, but later, when levitated pits made a space between the pit and the tamper, it was feasible to use in-flight pit insertion. The bomber would take off with no fissile material in the bomb. Some older implosion-type weapons, such as the US [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb|Mark 4]] and [[Mark 5 nuclear bomb|Mark 5]], used this system.\n\nIn-flight pit insertion will not work with a hollow pit in contact with its tamper.\n\n===Steel ball safety method===\nAs shown in the diagram above, one method used to decrease the likelihood of accidental detonation employed [[ball (bearing)|metal balls]]. The balls were emptied into the pit: this prevented detonation by increasing the density of the hollow pit, thereby preventing symmetrical implosion in the event of an accident. This design was used in the Green Grass weapon, also known as the Interim Megaton Weapon, which was used in the [[Violet Club]] and [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)|Yellow Sun Mk.1]] bombs.\n\n[[File:One-Point Safety Test.svg|right]]\n\n===Chain safety method===\nAlternatively, the pit can be \"safed\" by having its normally hollow core filled with an inert material such as a fine metal chain, possibly made of [[cadmium]] to absorb neutrons. While the chain is in the center of the pit, the pit can not be compressed into an appropriate shape to fission; when the weapon is to be armed, the chain is removed. Similarly, although a serious fire could detonate the explosives, destroying the pit and spreading plutonium to contaminate the surroundings as has happened in [[list of military nuclear accidents|several weapons accidents]], it could not cause a nuclear explosion.\n\n===One-point safety===\nWhile the firing of one detonator out of many will not cause a hollow pit to go critical, especially a low-mass hollow pit that requires boosting, the introduction of two-point implosion systems made that possibility a real concern.\n\nIn a two-point system, if one detonator fires, one entire hemisphere of the pit will implode as designed. The high-explosive charge surrounding the other hemisphere will explode progressively, from the equator toward the opposite pole. Ideally, this will pinch the equator and squeeze the second hemisphere away from the first, like toothpaste in a tube. By the time the explosion envelops it, its implosion will be separated both in time and space from the implosion of the first hemisphere. The resulting dumbbell shape, with each end reaching maximum density at a different time, may not become critical.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to tell on the drawing board how this will play out. Nor is it possible using a dummy pit of U-238 and high-speed x-ray cameras, although such tests are helpful. For final determination, a test needs to be made with real fissile material. Consequently, starting in 1957, a year after Swan, both labs began one-point safety tests.\n\nOut of 25 one-point safety tests conducted in 1957 and 1958, seven had zero or slight nuclear yield (success), three had high yields of 300 t to 500 t (severe failure), and the rest had unacceptable yields between those extremes.\n\nOf particular concern was Livermore's [[W47]], which generated unacceptably high yields in one-point testing. To prevent an accidental detonation, Livermore decided to use mechanical safing on the W47. The wire safety scheme described below was the result.\n\nWhen testing resumed in 1961, and continued for three decades, there was sufficient time to make all warhead designs inherently one-point safe, without need for mechanical safing.\n\n===Wire safety method===\nIn the last test before the 1958 moratorium the W47 warhead for the Polaris SLBM was found to not be one-point safe, producing an unacceptably high nuclear yield of {{convert|400|lb|abbr=on}} of TNT equivalent (Hardtack II Titania). With the test moratorium in force, there was no way to refine the design and make it inherently one-point safe. A solution was devised consisting of a [[boron]]-coated wire inserted into the weapon's hollow pit at manufacture. The warhead was armed by withdrawing the wire onto a spool driven by an electric motor. Once withdrawn, the wire could not be re-inserted.<ref>Chuck Hansen, ''The Swords of Armageddon'', Volume VII, pp. 396\u2013397.</ref> The wire had a tendency to become brittle during storage, and break or get stuck during arming, preventing complete removal and rendering the warhead a dud.<ref name=\"dud\"/> It was estimated that 50-75% of warheads would fail. This required a complete rebuild of all W47 primaries.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Harvey|first=John R.|last2=Michalowski|first2=Stefan|date=1994|title=Nuclear Weapons Safety:The Case of Trident|url=http://www.princeton.edu/sgs/publications/sgs/pdf/4_3harvey.pdf|journal=Science & Global Security|volume=4}}</ref> The oil used for lubricating the wire also promoted corrosion of the pit.<ref>{{cite book|isbn = 978-0521054010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=95eoQSNDp6gC&pg=PA214&dq=warhead+corrosion&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false}}.{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n===Strong link/weak link===\n{{See also|Strong link/weak link}}\nUnder the strong link/weak link system, \"weak links\" are constructed between critical nuclear weapon components (the \"hard links\"). In the even of an accident the weak links are designed to fail first in a manner that precludes energy transfer between them. Then, if a hard link fails in a manner that transfers or release energy, energy can't be transferred into other weapon systems, potentially starting a nuclear detonation. Hard links are usually critical weapon components that have been hardened to survive extreme environments, while weak links can be both components deliberately inserted into the system to act as a weak link and critical nuclear components that can fail predictably.\n\nAn example of a weak link would be an electrical connector that contains electrical wires made from a low melting point alloy. During a fire, those wires would melt breaking any electrical connection.\n\n===Permissive Action Link===\n{{See also|Permissive Action Link}}\nA ''Permissive Action Link'' is an [[access control]] device designed to prevent unauthorised use of a nuclear weapons. Early PALs were simple electromechanical switches and have evolved into complex arming systems that include integrated yield control options, lockout devices and anti-tamper devices.\n\n==References==\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* [[Samuel T.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Not only was he the executive producer and co-star, but the film's serious subject matter\u2014the [[Watergate scandal]]\u2014and its attempt to create a realistic portrayal of journalism also reflected the actor's offscreen concerns for political causes.<ref name=tca/> The film landed eight Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Director ([[Alan J.

It actually won the New York Film Critics Award for Best Picture and Best Director.\n\nIn 1977 Redford appeared in a segment of the war film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]'' (1977). Then he took a two-year hiatus from movies, before starring as past-his-prime rodeo star in the adventure-romance ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'' (1979).  This film reunited him with [[Jane Fonda]] and which finished at No. 9 in the box office for 1980.<ref name=\"Michael Gebert 1996, pg. 355\">Michael Gebert, ''The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards'', St. Martin's Paperbacks, New York, 1996, pg. 355.</ref> Later that year he appeared in the prison drama ''[[Brubaker]]'' (1980), playing a [[prison warden]] attempting to reform the system. As well, his directoral debut, ''[[Ordinary People]]'', which followed the disintegration of an upper-class American family after the death of a son, was one of the most critically and publicly acclaimed films of the decade, winning four Oscars, including Best Director for Redford himself, and Best Picture.\n\nSoon after that, he starred in the baseball drama ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]'' (1984).<ref name=tca/> Sydney Pollack's ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' (1985), with Redford in the male lead role opposite [[Meryl Streep]], became a large box office success (combined 1985 and 1986 grossess placed it at No. 5 for 1986),<ref name=\"Michael Gebert 1996, pg. 401\">Michael Gebert, ''The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards'', St. Martin's Paperbacks, New York, 1996, pg. 401.</ref> won a Golden Globe for Best Picture,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nme.com/news/bohemian-rhapsody-worst-reviewed-golden-globes-winner-since-80s-2429215 | title='Bohemian Rhapsody' is the worst-reviewed Golden Globes winner in 33 years | work=[[NME]] | date=January 10, 2019 | accessdate=January 14, 2019 | first=John | last=Earls | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110151752/https://www.nme.com/news/bohemian-rhapsody-worst-reviewed-golden-globes-winner-since-80s-2429215 | archive-date=January 10, 2019 | url-status=live | df=mdy-all }}</ref> and won seven [[Academy Awards|Oscars]], including Best Picture. Streep was nominated for Best Actress but Redford did not receive a nomination.

After that, his second directorial project, ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1987), failed to generate the same level of attention as ''Ordinary People''.\n\nRedford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He released his third film as a director, ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', in 1992, which was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young [[Brad Pitt]] to greater prominence. In 1993, Redford played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the newsroom romance ''[[Up Close & Personal]]'' (1996), and with [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] and a young [[Scarlett Johansson]] in ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' (1998), which he also directed.<ref name=tca/> Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as ''[[Havana (film)|Havana]]'' (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), in which he co-starred with [[River Phoenix]] and [[Sidney Poitier]], his first teaming with the star who had experienced film success several years before Redford.\n\nHe appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama ''[[The Last Castle]]'' (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with [[Brad Pitt]] for ''[[Spy Game]]'', another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of ''The Candidate''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|title=Robert Redford plans ''Candidate'' sequel|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230233514/https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> but the project never happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|title=The Candidate and the Sequel That Never Was \u2013 The Atlantic|last=Garber|first=Megan|website=The Atlantic|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181344/https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary ''[[Sacred Planet]]'' (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In ''[[The Clearing (film)|The Clearing]]'' (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.\n\nRedford stepped back into producing with ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future.  With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released.\n\nBack in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]'s ''[[An Unfinished Life]]'' (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)\u2014whom he blames for his son's death\u2014and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship.  The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clich\u00e9d and overly sentimental. Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with [[Meryl Streep]] 22 years after they starred in ''Out of Africa'', for his personal project ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'' (2007), which also starred [[Tom Cruise]]. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office.\n\nRedford appeared in the 2011 documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]]'' by [[Cindy Meehl]], where he discussed his experiences with title subject [[Buck Brannaman]] during the production of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]''. In 2012, Redford directed ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'', in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. In 2013, he starred in ''[[All Is Lost]]'', directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], his first Best Actor nomination for a Golden Globe, and won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]], his first time winning an acting honour from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for ''Downhill Racer'').\n\nIn April 2014, Redford appeared in the [[Marvel Studios]] superhero film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' playing [[Alexander Pierce]], the head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and leader of the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] cell operating the Triskelion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/robert-redford-confirms-captain-america-winter-soldier-role-153202834.html |title=Robert Redford Confirms Captain America: The Winter Soldier Role |publisher=[[Yahoo!

As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for ''[[Downhill Racer]]''.<ref name=tca/> His first film as director was 1980's Best Picture winner ''[[Ordinary People]]'', a drama about the slow disintegration of an [[upper-middle class]] family, for which he won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=tca/> Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from [[Mary Tyler Moore]], as well as superb work from [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Timothy Hutton]], who also won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\nRedford did not direct again until ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of [[John Nichols (American writer)|John Nichols]]' acclaimed novel of the Southwest. ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]] in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases.  Other directorial projects have included the period drama ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1992), based on [[Norman Maclean]]'s novella, and the expos\u00e9 ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s.<ref name=tca/> In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by [[Paul Attanasio]] with noted cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a strong cast that featured [[Paul Scofield]], [[John Turturro]], [[Rob Morrow]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. Redford also directed [[Matt Damon]] and [[Will Smith]] in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000). In 2010, Redford released ''[[The Conspirator]]'', a period drama revolving around the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Despite a subject matter of personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office.

After that, his second directorial project, ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1987), failed to generate the same level of attention as ''Ordinary People''.\n\nRedford continued as a major star throughout the 1990s and 2000s. He released his third film as a director, ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'', in 1992, which was a return to mainstream success for Redford as a director and brought a young [[Brad Pitt]] to greater prominence. In 1993, Redford played what became one of his most popular and recognized roles, starring in ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits. He co-starred with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] in the newsroom romance ''[[Up Close & Personal]]'' (1996), and with [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] and a young [[Scarlett Johansson]] in ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' (1998), which he also directed.<ref name=tca/> Redford also continued work in films with political contexts, such as ''[[Havana (film)|Havana]]'' (1990), playing Jack Weil, a professional gambler in 1959 Cuba during the Revolution, as well as ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992), in which he co-starred with [[River Phoenix]] and [[Sidney Poitier]], his first teaming with the star who had experienced film success several years before Redford.\n\nHe appeared as a disgraced Army general sent to prison in the prison drama ''[[The Last Castle]]'' (2001), directed by Rod Lurie. In the same year, Redford reteamed with [[Brad Pitt]] for ''[[Spy Game]]'', another success for the pair but with Redford switching this time from director to actor. During that time, he planned to direct and star in a sequel of ''The Candidate''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|title=Robert Redford plans ''Candidate'' sequel|website=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230233514/https://ew.com/article/2002/10/24/robert-redford-plans-candidate-sequel/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> but the project never happened.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|title=The Candidate and the Sequel That Never Was \u2013 The Atlantic|last=Garber|first=Megan|website=The Atlantic|access-date=December 30, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181344/https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/09/the-candidate-and-the-sequel-that-never-was/502301/|archive-date=December 30, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Redford, a leading environmental activist, narrated the IMAX documentary ''[[Sacred Planet]]'' (2004), a sweeping journey across the globe to some of its most exotic and endangered places. In ''[[The Clearing (film)|The Clearing]]'' (2004), a thriller co-starring Helen Mirren, Redford was a successful businessman whose kidnapping unearths the secrets and inadequacies that led to his achieving the American Dream.\n\nRedford stepped back into producing with ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (film)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]'' (2004), a coming-of-age road film about a young medical student, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara, and his friend Alberto Granado. It also explored the political and social issues of South America that influenced Guevara and shaped his future.  With five years spent on the film's making, Redford was credited by director Walter Salles for being instrumental in getting it made and released.\n\nBack in front of the camera, Redford received good notices for his role in director [[Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m]]'s ''[[An Unfinished Life]]'' (2005) as a cantankerous rancher who is forced to take in his estranged daughter-in-law (Jennifer Lopez)\u2014whom he blames for his son's death\u2014and the granddaughter he never knew he had when they fled an abusive relationship.  The film, which sat on the shelf for many months while its distributor Miramax was restructured, was generally dismissed as clich\u00e9d and overly sentimental. Meanwhile, Redford returned to familiar territory when he reteamed with [[Meryl Streep]] 22 years after they starred in ''Out of Africa'', for his personal project ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'' (2007), which also starred s [[Tom Cruise]]. After a great deal of hype, the film opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office.\n\nRedford appeared in the 2011 documentary ''[[Buck (film)|Buck]]'' by [[Cindy Meehl]], where he discussed his experiences with title subject [[Buck Brannaman]] during the production of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]''. In 2012, Redford directed ''[[The Company You Keep (film)|The Company You Keep]]'', in which he starred as a former Weather Underground activist who goes on the run after a journalist discovers his identity. In 2013, he starred in ''[[All Is Lost]]'', directed by J.C. Chandor, about a man lost at sea. He received acclaim for his performance in the film, in which he is its only cast member and there is almost no dialogue. Redford was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], his first Best Actor nomination for a Golden Globe, and won the [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actor]], his first time winning an acting honour from that group (he had been nominated in 1969 for ''Downhill Racer'').\n\nIn April 2014, Redford appeared in the [[Marvel Studios]] superhero film ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' playing [[Alexander Pierce]], the head of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] and leader of the [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] cell operating the Triskelion.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/robert-redford-confirms-captain-america-winter-soldier-role-153202834.html |title=Robert Redford Confirms Captain America: The Winter Soldier Role |publisher=[[Yahoo!

As early as 1969, Redford had served as the executive producer for ''[[Downhill Racer]]''.<ref name=tca/> His first film as director was 1980's Best Picture winner ''[[Ordinary People]]'', a drama about the slow disintegration of an [[upper-middle class]] family, for which he won the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]].<ref name=tca/> Redford was credited with obtaining a powerful dramatic performance from [[Mary Tyler Moore]], as well as superb work from [[Donald Sutherland]] and [[Timothy Hutton]], who also won the Oscar for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].\n\nRedford did not direct again until ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' (1988), a well-crafted, though not commercially successful, screen version of [[John Nichols (American writer)|John Nichols]]' acclaimed novel of the Southwest. ''[[The Milagro Beanfield War]]'' is the story of the people of Milagro, New Mexico (based on the real town of [[Truchas, New Mexico|Truchas]] in northern New Mexico), overcoming big developers who set about to ruin their community and force them out because of tax increases.  Other directorial projects have included the period drama ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]'' (1992), based on [[Norman Maclean]]'s novella, and the expos\u00e9 ''[[Quiz Show (film)|Quiz Show]]'' (1994), about the quiz show scandal of the late 1950s.<ref name=tca/> In the latter film, Redford worked from a screenplay by [[Paul Attanasio]] with noted cinematographer [[Michael Ballhaus]] and a strong cast that featured [[Paul Scofield]], [[John Turturro]], [[Rob Morrow]], and [[Ralph Fiennes]]. Redford handpicked Morrow for his part in the film (Morrow's only high-profile feature film role to date), because he liked his work on ''[[Northern Exposure]]''. Redford also directed [[Matt Damon]] and [[Will Smith]] in ''[[The Legend of Bagger Vance]]'' (2000). In 2010, Redford released ''[[The Conspirator]]'', a period drama revolving around the assassination of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Despite a subject matter of personal interest to Redford, the film received mixed reviews and proved to be a flop at the box office. In 2012, he directed the political thriller [[The Company You Keep (film)|'' The Company You Keep'']] starring himself, [[Shia LaBeouf]] and [[Julie Christie]].\n\n== Awards ==\n{{main|List of awards and nominations received by Robert Redford}}\n[[File:2005 Kennedy Center honorees.jpg|thumb|300px|right|U.S. President [[George W.

It allows you to jump from a tank to a fighter jet in one gameplay session.}}</ref> Vehicles range from the [[interwar period]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]] to the [[Iraq War|Iraq war]] and beyond, with an emphasis on [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Game|url=http://warthunder.com/en/game/about|website=Warthunder.com|publisher=Gaijin Entertainment|accessdate=28 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/war-thunder-review/1900-6415815/|title=War Thunder Review|first=Brett|last=Todd|date=10 July 2014|website=Gamespot.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/war-thunder-review/|title=War Thunder review|first=Rob|last=Zacny|date=7 August 2014|website=Pcgamer.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> Players can control aircraft, ground vehicles and warships from various nations, the major ones including the [[United States|USA]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]] and the [[USSR]]. The game itself is divided into three main categories: Aviation, Ground and Fleet with game modes divided between Arcade, Realistic and Simulator that offer different styles of battle.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.psu.com/news/war-thunder-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-is-still-being-looked-at/ |title=War Thunder PS4 & Xbox One Cross-Play Is Still Being Looked At |last=Harradence |first=Michael |date=2 October 2019 |website=psu.com |publisher=Playstation Universe |access-date=16 March 2020 |quote=Players can take part in different styles of battles depending on their preferences, including Arcade, Realistic, and Simulation matches.}}</ref> In Aviation, gameplay is restricted to aircraft without helicopters whereas Ground Forces and Fleet will include their respective vehicle types of ground vehicles and warships alongside aircraft. A single player mode is available focusing on historical settings as well as a cooperative mode against AI ground vehicles and aircraft.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\"/>\n\n===Arcade Battles===\nIn this mode, the game draws two teams of players (of up to 16 players on each side) with vehicles from different nations of varying combat performance. It is possible to see vehicles of the same type on different teams, and different countries on the player's own team. Damage and physics are greatly simplified (e.g. in very high-speed dives planes do not have their [[Aeroelasticity|wings ripped off]] and are still controllable, and ground vehicles receive a boost in engine power), but retain some realism (e.g. bombers are not as maneuverable as fighters). In Arcade, there are mechanics that \u2014 while unrealistic \u2014 are meant to make the player's experience easier (e.g. aircraft are able to reload midair after running out of ammunition). There is also an indicator indicating where bombs and shells would land and showing whether shells would penetrate the opponent's vehicles or not. Everyone can see everyone in this game mode.\n\nFor aircraft, games are played in either Ground Strike, where in order to win players must destroy all enemy ground units, shoot down all enemy aircraft, and destroy the enemy airfield and bombing points; Domination, which consists of seizing neutral or enemy airfields by touching down on them for about five seconds, causing the enemy team to lose points; or Air Domination, which requires players to have total control over an area of airspace for long enough to capture it. To help simplify aiming, a 'leading marker' appears when an enemy plane is in range. This shows a prediction of where the enemy plane will be by the time the bullets of the smaller caliber weapon arrive if the plane continues its current trajectory.\n\nFor ground forces, Domination revolves around the capture of three strategic zones on the map, with Conquest featuring only one. In Break, the two teams must capture a series of points in order, while in Battle, each team has its own base zone and must prevent it from being captured.\n\n===Realistic Battles===\nPreviously called Historical Battles, this mode is designed for more advanced players, and offers more realistic physics and damage modeling, while retaining some of the simplistic elements of the interface and controls of Arcade Battles. For the majority of matches in this mode, players are selected to have only collaborating nations on each team, making it possible to recreate real scenarios, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] between the Soviet Union and Germany.\n\nIn Air Realistic Battles, players do not have the option to respawn. Once ammunition or armaments are depleted, aircraft are required to land at their airfield to rearm, refuel and repair. Enemy aircraft receive range markers and nametags within a certain range, which varies depending on the angle and distance to the aircraft. The amount of bombers available to each team is also limited.\n\nIn Ground Realistic Battles, players get to use more than one vehicle per game through the use of Spawn Points, which are obtained by destroying enemy vehicles and capturing points. These capture points are essential for ground units to repair without a battle repair kit or to restock on ammunition. Aircraft and helicopters may also be used. Like the Air Realistic Battles mode, players do not have access to enemy player markers, penetration indicators, or range indicators (except for the separate rangefinder).\n\n====Simulator Battles====\nPreviously called Full Real Battles, Simulator Battles are based on Realistic Battles with further restrictions on the user's interface and controls; only the first-person view in the cockpit and external turret gunner views for aircraft are allowed in flight. Tank players are restricted to the gunner's scope, the driver's port / cabin, and a commander's perspective located above the vehicle. Additionally, aircraft can only be played in Full Real controls (there is no \"instructor\" to prevent the aircraft [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalling]] and the mouse can only be used to simulate a joystick). Players retain the ability to utilize their aircraft's flaps, trim, and engine(s) in Simulator mode. The [[Heads-up display (video games)|Heads up display]] is available to display speed, altitude, heading, engine/throttle settings, oil and water temperatures, and basic vehicle damage status.\n\nPlayer tags are not given for enemy units and players, while tags for friendly units and players are only provided if they are within a certain distance of the player. Combined battles do not show markers above enemy or friendly units and players. Thus, players must pay particular attention when dealing with aircraft and tanks that are available to multiple nations, and vehicles that use [[roundels]] as decoration for countries other than their own through personal customization of the vehicles.\n\n=== Custom Battles ===\nCustom battles, available for air, ground, and naval vehicles alike, is a mode allowing for the creation of battles by individual players. The creator of the custom battle can select the map, game mode, and other settings; they can also set a password to restrict who can play.\n\n=== PvE ===\n\n[[Player_versus_environment|PvE]] \"Assault\" was introduced in patch 1.67. This is an \"Arcade\" tank or a plane game mode where players try to defend a base against waves of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] attackers.\n\n===Events===\nEvents in ''War Thunder'' provide custom missions, usually based on one of the three main game modes, but with alternative settings regarding allowed vehicles, mission specifics, etc. Examples are the recreation of historical battles by restricting available vehicles (e.g. [[Battle of Britain]])\n\nTraditionally, the developers prepare unconventional events for [[April Fools' Day]]. The 2019 event named \"Earth Thunder\" is an event for April Fools 2019 in ''War Thunder'' where it takes place in an fictional American city named \"Green Hills\" where the players get to play with UFOs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/6128-special-earth-thunder-we-are-not-their-playthings-en|title=[Special] Earth Thunder: We are not their playthings!|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> The 2018 event named \"Silent Thunder\" was based underwater, with submarines. For 2017, ''War Thunder'' made playable rank IX main battle tanks and attack helicopters. For 2016, ahead of the announcement of the naval forces update, ''War Thunder'' offered playable sailing ships of the 18th century fighting in the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Naval combat setting sail in War Thunder|url=http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/404453/Naval+combat+setting+sail+in+War+Thunder/|website=Gamereactor.eu|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> The year before, a new game mode called \"Unrealistic Battles\" featured inflated rubber tanks firing potatoes and carrots.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unrealistic Battles|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/2974/current/|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref> Other notable examples include \"March to Victory\", introducing playable [[Mecha]] composed of tank parts;<ref>{{cite web|title=War Thunder - March to Victory Trailer|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/war-thunder-march-to-victory-trailer/2300-6424215/|website=Gamespot.com|accessdate=12 January 2017|date=2015-08-20}}</ref> \"The Pony Nation\" introducing [[Equestria|the world]] of ''[[My Little Pony]]'' as a sixth playable faction (2013);<ref>{{cite news|author1=Sethisto|title=War Thunder Adds the Pony Nation |url=http://www.equestriadaily.com/2013/04/war-thunder-adds-pony-nation.html|accessdate=2 April 2015|work=Equestria Daily|date=1 April 2013}}</ref> , and \"Gaijilla\" was a battle against a giant [[Godzilla]]-like snail (2014).<ref>{{cite web|title=New Japanese war machine in War Thunder!|url=http://warthunder.com/en/news/514/current/|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign===\n{{expand section|date=November 2019}}\n\n===World War Mode===\nIn this game mode squadrons battle in historical settings from [[World War II|The Second World War]] to dominate the world.

The game itself is divided into three main categories: Aviation, Ground and Fleet with game modes divided between Arcade, Realistic and Simulator that offer different styles of battle.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\">{{cite web |url=https://www.psu.com/news/war-thunder-ps4-xbox-one-cross-play-is-still-being-looked-at/ |title=War Thunder PS4 & Xbox One Cross-Play Is Still Being Looked At |last=Harradence |first=Michael |date=2 October 2019 |website=psu.com |publisher=Playstation Universe |access-date=16 March 2020 |quote=Players can take part in different styles of battles depending on their preferences, including Arcade, Realistic, and Simulation matches.}}</ref> In Aviation, gameplay is restricted to aircraft without helicopters whereas Ground Forces and Fleet will include their respective vehicle types of ground vehicles and warships alongside aircraft. A single player mode is available focusing on historical settings as well as a cooperative mode against AI ground vehicles and aircraft.<ref name=\"pscrossplay\"/>\n\n===Arcade Battles===\nIn this mode, the game draws two teams of players (of up to 16 players on each side) with vehicles from different nations of varying combat performance. It is possible to see vehicles of the same type on different teams, and different countries on the player's own team. Damage and physics are greatly simplified (e.g. in very high-speed dives planes do not have their [[Aeroelasticity|wings ripped off]] and are still controllable, and ground vehicles receive a boost in engine power), but retain some realism (e.g. bombers are not as maneuverable as fighters). In Arcade, there are mechanics that \u2014 while unrealistic \u2014 are meant to make the player's experience easier (e.g. aircraft are able to reload midair after running out of ammunition). There is also an indicator indicating where bombs and shells would land and showing whether shells would penetrate the opponent's vehicles or not. Everyone can see everyone in this game mode.\n\nFor aircraft, games are played in either Ground Strike, where in order to win players must destroy all enemy ground units, shoot down all enemy aircraft, and destroy the enemy airfield and bombing points; Domination, which consists of seizing neutral or enemy airfields by touching down on them for about five seconds, causing the enemy team to lose points; or Air Domination, which requires players to have total control over an area of airspace for long enough to capture it. To help simplify aiming, a 'leading marker' appears when an enemy plane is in range. This shows a prediction of where the enemy plane will be by the time the bullets of the smaller caliber weapon arrive if the plane continues its current trajectory.\n\nFor ground forces, Domination revolves around the capture of three strategic zones on the map, with Conquest featuring only one. In Break, the two teams must capture a series of points in order, while in Battle, each team has its own base zone and must prevent it from being captured.\n\n===Realistic Battles===\nPreviously called Historical Battles, this mode is designed for more advanced players, and offers more realistic physics and damage modeling, while retaining some of the simplistic elements of the interface and controls of Arcade Battles. For the majority of matches in this mode, players are selected to have only collaborating nations on each team, making it possible to recreate real scenarios, such as the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] between the Soviet Union and Germany.\n\nIn Air Realistic Battles, players do not have the option to respawn. Once ammunition or armaments are depleted, aircraft are required to land at their airfield to rearm, refuel and repair. Enemy aircraft receive range markers and nametags within a certain range, which varies depending on the angle and distance to the aircraft. The amount of bombers available to each team is also limited.\n\nIn Ground Realistic Battles, players get to use more than one vehicle per game through the use of Spawn Points, which are obtained by destroying enemy vehicles and capturing points. These capture points are essential for ground units to repair without a battle repair kit or to restock on ammunition. Aircraft and helicopters may also be used. Like the Air Realistic Battles mode, players do not have access to enemy player markers, penetration indicators, or range indicators (except for the separate rangefinder).\n\n====Simulator Battles====\nPreviously called Full Real Battles, Simulator Battles are based on Realistic Battles with further restrictions on the user's interface and controls; only the first-person view in the cockpit and external turret gunner views for aircraft are allowed in flight. Tank players are restricted to the gunner's scope, the driver's port / cabin, and a commander's perspective located above the vehicle. Additionally, aircraft can only be played in Full Real controls (there is no \"instructor\" to prevent the aircraft [[Stall (fluid mechanics)|stalling]] and the mouse can only be used to simulate a joystick). Players retain the ability to utilize their aircraft's flaps, trim, and engine(s) in Simulator mode. The [[Heads-up display (video games)|Heads up display]] is available to display speed, altitude, heading, engine/throttle settings, oil and water temperatures, and basic vehicle damage status.\n\nPlayer tags are not given for enemy units and players, while tags for friendly units and players are only provided if they are within a certain distance of the player. Combined battles do not show markers above enemy or friendly units and players. Thus, players must pay particular attention when dealing with aircraft and tanks that are available to multiple nations, and vehicles that use [[roundels]] as decoration for countries other than their own through personal customization of the vehicles.\n\n=== Custom Battles ===\nCustom battles, available for air, ground, and naval vehicles alike, is a mode allowing for the creation of battles by individual players. The creator of the custom battle can select the map, game mode, and other settings; they can also set a password to restrict who can play.\n\n=== PvE ===\n\n[[Player_versus_environment|PvE]] \"Assault\" was introduced in patch 1.67. This is an \"Arcade\" tank or a plane game mode where players try to defend a base against waves of [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] attackers.\n\n===Events===\nEvents in ''War Thunder'' provide custom missions, usually based on one of the three main game modes, but with alternative settings regarding allowed vehicles, mission specifics, etc. Examples are the recreation of historical battles by restricting available vehicles (e.g. [[Battle of Britain]])\n\nTraditionally, the developers prepare unconventional events for [[April Fools' Day]]. The 2019 event named \"Earth Thunder\" is an event for April Fools 2019 in ''War Thunder'' where it takes place in an fictional American city named \"Green Hills\" where the players get to play with UFOs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://warthunder.com/en/news/6128-special-earth-thunder-we-are-not-their-playthings-en|title=[Special] Earth Thunder: We are not their playthings!|website=Warthunder.com|accessdate=20 April 2019}}</ref> The 2018 event named \"Silent Thunder\" was based underwater, with submarines.
