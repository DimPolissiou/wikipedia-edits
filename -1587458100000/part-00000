There were some ethnic-majority areas, but there were also vast mixed areas and abundant smaller pockets settled by various ethnicities. Within these areas of diversity, including the major cities of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], regular interaction among various ethnic groups had taken place on a daily basis for centuries, while not always harmoniously, on every civic and economic level.<ref name=\"Tonkin\">Kati Tonkin reviewing Jurgen Tampke's \"Czech-German Relations and the Politics of Central Europe: From Bohemia to the EU\", ''The Australian Journal of Politics and History'', March 2004 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_1_50/ai_n6291863 Findarticles.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822030324/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_1_50/ai_n6291863/ |date=22 August 2009 }}; accessed 6 December 2014.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 19th century, the ethnicity of citizens became an issue<ref name=\"Tonkin\"/> in territorial claims, the self-perception/identity of states, and claims of ethnic superiority. The [[German Empire]] introduced the idea of [[Prussian Settlement Commission|ethnicity-based settlement]] in an attempt to ensure its territorial integrity. It was also the first modern European state to propose population transfers as a means of solving \"nationality conflicts\", intending the removal of Poles and [[Jews]] from the projected post\u2013[[World War I]] \"[[Polish Border Strip]]\" and its resettlement with Christian ethnic Germans.<ref>Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945''.

None of the new states were ethnically homogeneous.<ref>Jane Boulden, Will Kymlicka,  International Approaches to Governing Ethnic Diversity Oxford UP 2015</ref> After 1919, many ethnic Germans emigrated from the former imperial lands back to Germany and Austria after losing their privileged status in those foreign lands, where they had maintained majority communities. In 1919 ethnic Germans became national minorities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. In the following years, the Nazi ideology encouraged them to demand local autonomy. In Germany during the 1930s, Nazi propaganda claimed that Germans elsewhere were subject to persecution. Nazi supporters throughout eastern Europe (Czechoslovakia's [[Konrad Henlein]], Poland's [[Deutscher Volksverband]] and [[Jungdeutsche Partei]], Hungary's ''Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn'') formed local Nazi political parties sponsored financially by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, e.g. by [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]].

They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahns maintain that most of the reported 473,013 deaths occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they point out that there are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps. They put the postwar losses in eastern Europe at a fraction of the total losses: Poland- 15,000 deaths from 1945 to 1949 in internment camps; Czechoslovakia- 15,000\u201330,000 dead, including 4,000\u20135,000 in internment camps and ca. 15,000 in the [[Prague uprising]]; Yugoslavia- 5,777 deliberate killings and 48,027 deaths in internment camps; Denmark- 17,209 dead in internment camps; Hungary and Romania - no postwar losses reported. The Hahns point out that the official 1958 figure of 273,000 deaths for Czechoslovakia was prepared by Alfred Bohmann, a former Nazi Party member who had served in the wartime SS. Bohmann was a journalist for an ultra-nationalist Sudeten-Deutsch newspaper in postwar West Germany.

Before World War II, several major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the [[League of Nations]]. The tide started to turn when the charter of the [[Nuremberg trials]] of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and this opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of nation-states to impose fiats which could adversely affect such individuals. The Charter of the then-newly formed [[United Nations]] stated that its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] could take no enforcement actions regarding measures taken against World War II \"enemy states\", defined as enemies of a Charter signatory in WWII.<ref name=\"uncharter2\">[http://www.hrweb.org/legal/unchartr.html Charter of the United Nations.] Chapters 1\u201319 at Human Rights Web Hrweb.org; accessed 26 May 2015.</ref> The Charter did not preclude action in relation to such enemies \"taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action.\"<ref name=\"uncharter\"/> Thus, the Charter did not invalidate or preclude action against World War II enemies following the war.<ref name=\"uncharter\">Krzysztof Rak & Mariusz Muszy\u0144ski.

There were some ethnic-majority areas, but there were also vast mixed areas and abundant smaller pockets settled by various ethnicities. Within these areas of diversity, including the major cities of [[Central and Eastern Europe]], regular interaction among various ethnic groups had taken place on a daily basis for centuries, while not always harmoniously, on every civic and economic level.<ref name=\"Tonkin\">Kati Tonkin reviewing Jurgen Tampke's \"Czech-German Relations and the Politics of Central Europe: From Bohemia to the EU\", ''The Australian Journal of Politics and History'', March 2004 [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_1_50/ai_n6291863 Findarticles.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822030324/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go1877/is_1_50/ai_n6291863/ |date=22 August 2009 }}; accessed 6 December 2014.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of [[nationalism]] in the 19th century, the ethnicity of citizens became an issue<ref name=\"Tonkin\"/> in territorial claims, the self-perception/identity of states, and claims of ethnic superiority. The [[German Empire]] introduced the idea of [[Prussian Settlement Commission|ethnicity-based settlement]] in an attempt to ensure its territorial integrity. It was also the first modern European state to propose population transfers as a means of solving \"nationality conflicts\", intending the removal of Poles and [[Jews]] from the projected post\u2013[[World War I]] \"[[Polish Border Strip]]\" and its resettlement with Christian ethnic Germans.<ref>Hajo Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945''.

None of the new states were ethnically homogeneous.<ref>Jane Boulden, Will Kymlicka,  International Approaches to Governing Ethnic Diversity Oxford UP 2015</ref> After 1919, many ethnic Germans emigrated from the former imperial lands back to Germany and Austria after losing their privileged status in those foreign lands, where they had maintained majority communities. In 1919 ethnic Germans became national minorities in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania. In the following years, the Nazi ideology encouraged them to demand local autonomy. In Germany during the 1930s, Nazi propaganda claimed that Germans elsewhere were subject to persecution. Nazi supporters throughout eastern Europe (Czechoslovakia's [[Konrad Henlein]], Poland's [[Deutscher Volksverband]] and [[Jungdeutsche Partei]], Hungary's ''Volksbund der Deutschen in Ungarn'') formed local Nazi political parties sponsored financially by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, e.g. by [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]].

They place the ultimate blame for the mass flight and expulsion on the wartime policy of the Nazis in Eastern Europe. The Hahns maintain that most of the reported 473,013 deaths occurred during the Nazi organized flight and evacuation during the war, and the forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union; they point out that there are 80,522 confirmed deaths in the postwar internment camps. They put the postwar losses in eastern Europe at a fraction of the total losses: Poland- 15,000 deaths from 1945 to 1949 in internment camps; Czechoslovakia- 15,000\u201330,000 dead, including 4,000\u20135,000 in internment camps and ca. 15,000 in the [[Prague uprising]]; Yugoslavia- 5,777 deliberate killings and 48,027 deaths in internment camps; Denmark- 17,209 dead in internment camps; Hungary and Romania - no postwar losses reported. The Hahns point out that the official 1958 figure of 273,000 deaths for Czechoslovakia was prepared by Alfred Bohmann, a former Nazi Party member who had served in the wartime SS. Bohmann was a journalist for an ultra-nationalist Sudeten-Deutsch newspaper in postwar West Germany.

Before World War II, several major population transfers were the result of bilateral treaties and had the support of international bodies such as the [[League of Nations]]. The tide started to turn when the charter of the [[Nuremberg trials]] of German Nazi leaders declared forced deportation of civilian populations to be both a war crime and a crime against humanity, and this opinion was progressively adopted and extended through the remainder of the century. Underlying the change was the trend to assign rights to individuals, thereby limiting the rights of nation-states to impose fiats which could adversely affect such individuals. The Charter of the then-newly formed [[United Nations]] stated that its [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] could take no enforcement actions regarding measures taken against World War II \"enemy states\", defined as enemies of a Charter signatory in WWII.<ref name=\"uncharter2\">[http://www.hrweb.org/legal/unchartr.html Charter of the United Nations.] Chapters 1\u201319 at Human Rights Web Hrweb.org; accessed 26 May 2015.</ref> The Charter did not preclude action in relation to such enemies \"taken or authorized as a result of that war by the Governments having responsibility for such action.\"<ref name=\"uncharter\"/> Thus, the Charter did not invalidate or preclude action against World War II enemies following the war.<ref name=\"uncharter\">Krzysztof Rak & Mariusz Muszy\u0144ski.

In 1966, at age 11, Mike Tenay began one of the country's first wrestling newsletters, ''Mat News''. He also made audio recordings of LA wrestling programs and traded them with fans, a precursor to the tape traders who would follow. In the 1970s, Tenay wrote for the Olympic Auditorium's programs and several national wrestling magazines. After high school, he worked as a repairman and then a betting supervisor for a casino. From 1991-1995, Tenay talked about wrestling with the nationally aired late night sports talk radio show \"Wrestling Insiders\". He interviewed wrestling superstars, including Jesse Ventura, Jim Cornette, and Sting. His work on radio led WCW to hire Tenay to work on the WCW Hotline and do his on-location radio broadcasts at WCW events. This led to Tenay\u2019s first major announcing job with WCW.<ref>[http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/tna-wcw-wrestling-announcer-mike-tenay-profile-17604/ TNA WCW Wrestling Announcer Mike Tenay Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809164839/http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/tna-wcw-wrestling-announcer-mike-tenay-profile-17604/ |date=2014-08-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===World Championship Wrestling (1994\u20132001)===\nMike Tenay made his WCW announcing debut during the [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) co-promoted ''[[AAA When Worlds Collide]]'' [[pay-per-view]] in November 1994.<ref name=\"Going in depth with Mike Tenay\">[http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tenay_21mar00.html Going in depth with Mike Tenay]</ref> Every announcer in WCW, including lead announcer Tony Schiavone, declined to work the broadcast.<ref name=\"Going in depth with Mike Tenay\"/> During this first broadcast, he and Chris Cruise called the match of Los Gringos Locos ([[Eddie Guerrero|Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr]]) vs. Hijo del Santo and Octagon, judged by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' as a \"legendary\" five-star match.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mfoy18/5starlist.html&date=2009-10-24+21:33:40 Wrestling Observer Newsletter's five-star matches]</ref> Following the success of that event, WCW added more luchadores to the roster, and Tenay would appear as a guest announcer during their pay-per-view matches due to his extensive knowledge of holds and maneuvers as well as lucha libre ring psychology. Tenay would later serve as a full-time play-by-play announcer for secondary television shows such as ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'' and ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', where he was known as \"Iron\" Mike Tenay. He was also backstage interviewer for [[Uncensored (1995)|Uncensored 1995]].\n\nOn September 2, 1996 he was moved up to the main show, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', where he served as a third commentator to the team originally consisting of play-by-play announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] and color commentator [[Bobby Heenan]].<ref name=WIA>[http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/announ.htm Wrestling Information Archive - Announcers list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325181405/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/announ.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}</ref> It was there that Schiavone gave him the nickname \"The Professor\" for his vast and impressive knowledge of the wrestling business, wrestling history, and wrestling maneuvers.<ref name=\"TNA\"/>\n\nIn light of WCW adding ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' as another major weekly show in its lineup, the announce team was pulling double duty during the week.

After TNA decided to switch to a booking committee format in mid-2005, Tenay was named to the committee, enhancing his formerly modest influence behind the scenes.<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/holidays/ericwish.shtml TNA's former and current booking committee members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219135752/http://www.phillyburbs.com/holidays/ericwish.shtml |date=2008-02-19 }}</ref> Tenay also became the prominent on-screen personality for TNA, conducting interviews with Jeff Jarrett (who has labeled Tenay as \"the voice of the fans\") as well as making major announcements (such as the signing of Sting).\n\n[[Josh Mathews]] took Tenay's place as commentator on weekly airings of ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact Wrestling]]'' after its move from [[Paramount Network|Spike]] to [[Destination America]].

In 1966, at age 11, Mike Tenay began one of the country's first wrestling newsletters, ''Mat News''. He also made audio recordings of LA wrestling programs and traded them with fans, a precursor to the tape traders who would follow. In the 1970s, Tenay wrote for the Olympic Auditorium's programs and several national wrestling magazines. After high school, he worked as a repairman and then a betting supervisor for a casino. From 1991-1995, Tenay talked about wrestling with the nationally aired late night sports talk radio show \"Wrestling Insiders\". He interviewed wrestling superstars, including Jesse Ventura, Jim Cornette, and Sting. His work on radio led WCW to hire Tenay to work on the WCW Hotline and do his on-location radio broadcasts at WCW events. This led to Tenay\u2019s first major announcing job with WCW.<ref>[http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/tna-wcw-wrestling-announcer-mike-tenay-profile-17604/ TNA WCW Wrestling Announcer Mike Tenay Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809164839/http://www.entertainmentscene360.com/index.php/tna-wcw-wrestling-announcer-mike-tenay-profile-17604/ |date=2014-08-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===World Championship Wrestling (1994\u20132001)===\nMike Tenay made his WCW announcing debut during the [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) co-promoted ''[[AAA When Worlds Collide]]'' [[pay-per-view]] in November 1994.<ref name=\"Going in depth with Mike Tenay\">[http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingFeatures/tenay_21mar00.html Going in depth with Mike Tenay]</ref> Every announcer in WCW, including lead announcer Tony Schiavone, declined to work the broadcast.<ref name=\"Going in depth with Mike Tenay\"/> During this first broadcast, he and Chris Cruise called the match of Los Gringos Locos ([[Eddie Guerrero|Eddy Guerrero]] and [[Art Barr]]) vs. Hijo del Santo and Octagon, judged by the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' as a \"legendary\" five-star match.<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mfoy18/5starlist.html&date=2009-10-24+21:33:40 Wrestling Observer Newsletter's five-star matches]</ref> Following the success of that event, WCW added more luchadores to the roster, and Tenay would appear as a guest announcer during their pay-per-view matches due to his extensive knowledge of holds and maneuvers as well as lucha libre ring psychology. Tenay would later serve as a full-time play-by-play announcer for secondary television shows such as ''[[WCW Worldwide]]'' and ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'', where he was known as \"Iron\" Mike Tenay. He was also backstage interviewer for [[Uncensored (1995)|Uncensored 1995]].\n\nOn September 2, 1996 he was moved up to the main show, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'', where he served as a third commentator to the team originally consisting of play-by-play announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] and color commentator [[Bobby Heenan]].<ref name=WIA>[http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/announ.htm Wrestling Information Archive - Announcers list] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325181405/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/other/announ.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}</ref> It was there that Schiavone gave him the nickname \"The Professor\" for his vast and impressive knowledge of the wrestling business, wrestling history, and wrestling maneuvers.<ref name=\"TNA\"/>\n\nIn light of WCW adding ''[[WCW Thunder|Thunder]]'' as another major weekly show in its lineup, the announce team was pulling double duty during the week.

In the case of writer's block, many find it helpful to take a break and revisit their topic. Another tactic that is used when people with mental blocks are learning new information is repetition. A similar phenomenon occurs when one cannot solve a problem in [[mathematics]] which one would normally consider simple. Mental blocks can be caused by physical disabilities or simply a lack of focus. Mental blocks are also often used to describe a temporary inability to recall a name or other information.

The '''forgetting curve''' was first described by [[Ebbinghaus]] as the natural loss of memory retention over time. Memories can also simply disappear over time from [[Trace decay]] which is the weakening of memories over time. This kind of decay stems from both the visual and verbal working memory. Although the triggers decay, some of the information remains stored. [[Interference theory|Interference]] is the phenomenon that a memory can be distorted due to the existence of related memories when it comes to [[Knowledge retrieval|Retrieval]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Memory|last=Baddeley|first=Alan|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-84872-183-8|location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY|pages=238\u2013254|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Associative blocking ==\n'''Associative blocking''' is explained as the effects of an interference during a retrieval. Associative blocking can be caused by failure of cues that a specific target, this is because the cue is being replaced by a new cue that grows stronger. This causes the initial cue to deteriorate because each separate memory is competing for first access to the conscious when the shared cue is presented.\n\n== Unlearning ==\n[[Unlearning]] is associated with two separate stimuli that are attached to a memory trace, the trace is then weakened because it isn't accessed often enough. When one attempted to recover said memory there is an error that happens when a different cue is presented.\n\n== Motivated forgetting ==\n[[Directed forgetting]] is another name for ''motivated Forgetting'', meaning that one is forgetting consciously any recent experience that was unwanted.\n\n[[Cognitive control]] is known as the ability to access thoughts and memories, but as well as the ability to have control over unwanted thoughts surfacing from the unconscious. This kind of [[Thought suppression|suppression]] can be linked to the [[think/no think]] (TNT) paradigm, which is practice that is designed to remind one of undesired life experiences that result in unwanted feelings, such as a first heartbreak, that one would normally try to avoid thinking about.\n\nAlso, [[Psychological repression|repression]] a [[Freudian theory]] theorizes that it is a defense mechanism that destroys undesired feelings, ideas, and memories in the unconscious.<ref name=\":0\" /> This defense mechanism is due to the attempt to resolve and eliminate psychological hurt.\n\nWhen unwelcome reminders occur, people often try to exclude the unwanted memory from awareness. Stopping retrieval of an unwanted memory is known as \u2018retrieval suppression\u2019, a process that engages response override mechanisms formally similar to stopping a reflexive motor action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michael C.|last2=Hanslmayr|first2=Simon|date=June 2014|title=Neural mechanisms of motivated forgetting|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=18|issue=6|pages=279\u2013292|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.002|issn=1364-6613|pmc=4045208|pmid=24747000}}</ref>\n\n==Overcoming the mental block==\n'''Mental Toughness, Self-Efficacy and Negative Perceptions:'''\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/250509|title=7 Unexpected Ways to Get Around Mental Blocks|last=Kittaneh|first=Firas|date=2015-09-14|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>Jones (2002) defined mental toughness as having a psychological edge, whether naturally or developed, which allows you to cope with the many demands of sport and be consistently more focused, determined and confident under pressure. It is thought that individuals with a sufficient level of mental toughness adopt approach behavior to sport and challenges. This would therefore minimize the chances of developing a mental block, as everything would ultimately be seen as a challenge oppose to a threat which may diminish self-efficacy. However, individuals who lack in self-efficacy and/or lack in mental toughness would be more prone to developing a mental block.\u00a0 In addition, if a mental block is formed there would be a greater chance of avoiding the challenge altogether.

Smaller tasks can also help us by motivating us to do the work. When we complete smaller tasks it gives us motivation because  when we see that can complete multiple smaller tasks then believe we can complete the bigger task..\n\n'''Right environment'''\n\nSet up the right environment for fostering creativity.

Also can be an inability to continue or complete a [[train of thought]], as in the case of [[writer's block]]. In the case of writer's block, many find it helpful to take a break and revisit their topic. Another tactic that is used when people with mental blocks are learning new information is repetition. A similar phenomenon occurs when one cannot solve a problem in [[mathematics]] which one would normally consider simple. Mental blocks can be caused by physical disabilities or simply a lack of focus. Mental blocks are also often used to describe a temporary inability to recall a name or other information. A sudden cessation of speech or a thought process without an immediate observable cause, sometimes considered a consequence of repression.<ref>{{cite web|last=Langford|first=Tim|title=Cascades School Resources Room|url=http://lebanon.or.schoolwebpages.com/education/school/schoolhistory.php?sectiondetailid=130|publisher=Lebanon Community Schools|accessdate=10/2/11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415154853/http://lebanon.or.schoolwebpages.com/education/school/schoolhistory.php?sectiondetailid=130|archivedate=2012-04-15}}</ref> Mental blocking can be a coping mechanism for mental illnesses such as hysteria, neurosis, and lack of pathology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n==Incidental forgetting==\n[[Forgetting curve]] could be associated with mental blocking. The '''forgetting curve''' was first described by [[Ebbinghaus]] as the natural loss of memory retention over time. Memories can also simply disappear over time from [[Trace decay]] which is the weakening of memories over time. This kind of decay stems from both the visual and verbal working memory. Although the triggers decay, some of the information remains stored. [[Interference theory|Interference]] is the phenomenon that a memory can be distorted due to the existence of related memories when it comes to [[Knowledge retrieval|Retrieval]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Memory|last=Baddeley|first=Alan|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2015|isbn=978-1-84872-183-8|location=711 Third Avenue, New York, NY|pages=238\u2013254|quote=}}</ref>\n\n== Associative blocking ==\n'''Associative blocking''' is explained as the effects of an interference during a retrieval. Associative blocking can be caused by failure of cues that a specific target, this is because the cue is being replaced by a new cue that grows stronger. This causes the initial cue to deteriorate because each separate memory is competing for first access to the conscious when the shared cue is presented.\n\n== Unlearning ==\n[[Unlearning]] is associated with two separate stimuli that are attached to a memory trace, the trace is then weakened because it isn't accessed often enough. When one attempted to recover said memory there is an error that happens when a different cue is presented.\n\n== Motivated forgetting ==\n[[Directed forgetting]] is another name for ''motivated Forgetting'', meaning that one is forgetting consciously any recent experience that was unwanted.\n\n[[Cognitive control]] is known as the ability to access thoughts and memories, but as well as the ability to have control over unwanted thoughts surfacing from the unconscious. This kind of [[Thought suppression|suppression]] can be linked to the [[think/no think]] (TNT) paradigm, which is practice that is designed to remind one of undesired life experiences that result in unwanted feelings, such as a first heartbreak, that one would normally try to avoid thinking about.\n\nAlso, [[Psychological repression|repression]] a [[Freudian theory]] theorizes that it is a defense mechanism that destroys undesired feelings, ideas, and memories in the unconscious.<ref name=\":0\" /> This defense mechanism is due to the attempt to resolve and eliminate psychological hurt.\n\nWhen unwelcome reminders occur, people often try to exclude the unwanted memory from awareness. Stopping retrieval of an unwanted memory is known as \u2018retrieval suppression\u2019, a process that engages response override mechanisms formally similar to stopping a reflexive motor action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michael C.|last2=Hanslmayr|first2=Simon|date=June 2014|title=Neural mechanisms of motivated forgetting|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=18|issue=6|pages=279\u2013292|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2014.03.002|issn=1364-6613|pmc=4045208|pmid=24747000}}</ref>\n\n==Overcoming the mental block==\n'''Mental Toughness, Self-Efficacy and Negative Perceptions:'''\n\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/250509|title=7 Unexpected Ways to Get Around Mental Blocks|last=Kittaneh|first=Firas|date=2015-09-14|website=Entrepreneur|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>Jones (2002) defined mental toughness as having a psychological edge, whether naturally or developed, which allows you to cope with the many demands of sport and be consistently more focused, determined and confident under pressure. It is thought that individuals with a sufficient level of mental toughness adopt approach behavior to sport and challenges. This would therefore minimize the chances of developing a mental block, as everything would ultimately be seen as a challenge oppose to a threat which may diminish self-efficacy. However, individuals who lack in self-efficacy and/or lack in mental toughness would be more prone to developing a mental block.\u00a0 In addition, if a mental block is formed there would be a greater chance of avoiding the challenge altogether. This is because self-doubt correlates with low self-confidence, meaning you're more likely to adopt avoidance behavior due to the negative perception you hold in regards to your lack of ability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://believeperform.com/mental-blocks-and-how-to-overcome-them/|title=Mental blocks and how to overcome them|date=2014-07-28|website=BelievePerform - The UK's leading Sports Psychology Website|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\n'''Tackle smaller tasks first'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dac.gen.xyz/cart.html?sld=pc&tld=.uk.net&ref=slds|title=My Account {{!}} .xyz {{!}} For every website, everywhere\u00ae|website=dac.gen.xyz|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed by how little you have progressed, take a break and work on a few mindless tasks that require little attention or thought and allow the mind to wander. Wash the dishes, organize your bookshelf, sift through unread emails or do laundry. By accomplishing small wins, you develop momentum and confidence to overcome your mental block.\n\nTaking a step back may also help you gain clarity and perspective on the root cause of the block, allowing you to think about how you can move forward more efficiently in the future.Immerse yourself in the right environment.\n\nWhen you focus on the smaller tasks the bigger task can become less intimidating. Smaller tasks can also help us by motivating us to do the work. When we complete smaller tasks it gives us motivation because  when we see that can complete multiple smaller tasks then believe we can complete the bigger task..\n\n'''Right environment'''\n\nSet up the right environment for fostering creativity. Surround yourself with the right people, those who will offer constructive feedback to objectively challenge and build upon your ideas.\n\nBeing around individuals with similar goals and interests can help enhance rather than suppress your creative ideas. When you have the right environment while you or working on project,writing,paper or just doing homework, it is best for us to be in an environment we comfortable in.

She was freed from the charges through her husband's connections, as he managed to get her a pardon from the King of [[Denmark]]. The year after this, she became a wealthy widow, freed from taxes by the king. Once accused of witchcraft, however, she was always considered a witch.

Others claimed they had seen her in the presence of demons.\n\nDuring the trial, Anne reportedly displayed \"willpower, clearsight and skill\". On the accusation of having killed a child, she replied: \"Many children die in the town, I have not killed them all\". Despite protests from some ministers in Bergen clergy, she was sentenced to death. In Norway, witches were generally burned alive, and Anne received this sentence. On the way to the execution, she cried out her innocence several times.\n \nAnne Pedersdotter was burned alive at the stake in the city of Bergen on the 7 April 1590.
