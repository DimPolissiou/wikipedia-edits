Cuba and the United States restored [[diplomacy|diplomatic relations]] on 20 July 2015, relations which had been severed in 1961 during the [[Cold War]]. U.S. diplomatic representation in [[Cuba]] is handled by the [[Embassy of the United States, Havana|United States Embassy]] in [[Havana]], and there is a similar [[Embassy of Cuba in Washington, D.C.|Cuban Embassy]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] The [[United States]], however, continues to maintain its commercial, economic, and financial [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], making it illegal for U.S. corporations to do business with Cuba.\n\nThe hold of the [[Spanish Empire]] on possessions in the Americas was reduced in the 1820s as a result of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]; only Cuba and [[Puerto Rico]] remained under Spanish rule until the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] (1898) that resulted from the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. Under the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]], Cuba became a U.S. protectorate from 1898\u20131902; the U.S. gained a position of economic and political dominance over the island, which persisted after it became formally independent in 1902.\n\nFollowing the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959, bilateral relations deteriorated substantially. In 1961, the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba and began pursuing covert operations to topple the Cuban government.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|title = U.S.-Cuba Relations|website = Council on Foreign Relations|first1 = Claire|last1 = Felter|first2 = Danielle|last2 = Renwick|first3 = Rocio|last3 = Cara Labrador|date = 7 March 2019|access-date = 3 May 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150511123927/http://www.cfr.org/cuba/us-cuba-relations/p11113|archive-date = 11 May 2015|url-status = dead}}</ref> In October 1960, the U.S. imposed and subsequently tightened a [[United States embargo against Cuba|comprehensive set of restrictions and bans]] against the Cuban government as retaliation for the [[nationalization]] of U.S. corporations' property by Cuba.

As both legal and illegal trade increased, Cuba became a comparatively prosperous trading partner in the region, and a center of tobacco and [[Sugar#Production|sugar production]]. During this period Cuban merchants increasingly traveled to North American ports, establishing trade contracts that endured for many years.\n\nThe [[Battle of Havana (1768)|British occupation of Havana]] in 1762 opened up trade with the colonies in North and South America, and the [[American Revolution]] in 1776 provided additional trade opportunities. Spain opened Cuban ports to North American commerce officially in November 1776 and the island became increasingly dependent on that trade.\n\n[[File:Florida Moyne 1591.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of 1591 map of [[Florida]] and Cuba]]\n\n===19th century===\nAfter the opening of the island to world trade in 1818, trade agreements began to replace Spanish commercial connections.

Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] wanted stability and favored the Spanish government and did not publicly challenge the popular anti-Spanish American viewpoint. Grant and Fish gave lip service to Cuban independence, called for an end to slavery in Cuba, and quietly opposed American military intervention. Fish worked diligently against popular pressure, and was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the [[Alabama Claims]]. [[Daniel Sickles]], the American Minister to Madrid, made no headway. Grant and Fish successfully resisted popular pressures.

Platt]], which would allow the United States to intervene in Cuban affairs if needed for the maintenance of good government and committed Cuba to lease to the U.S. land for naval bases. Cuba leased to the United States the southern portion of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where a [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|United States Naval Station]] had been established in 1898. The Platt Amendment defined the terms of Cuban-U.S. relations for the following 33 years and provided the legal basis for U.S. military interventions with varying degrees of support from Cuban governments and political parties.\n\nDespite recognizing Cuba's transition into an independent republic, United States Governor [[Charles Edward Magoon]] assumed temporary military rule for three more years following a rebellion led in part by [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel G\u00f3mez]].

The United States and Cuba signed another [[Cuban\u2013American Treaty of Relations (1934)|Treaty of Relations]] in 1934.

The U.S. stopped buying Cuban sugar and refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil, with a devastating effect on the island's economy, leading to Cuba turning to their newfound trading partner the [[Soviet Union]] for petroleum. In March 1960, tensions increased when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'' exploded in Havana Harbor, killing over 75 people.

Consequently, Cuba began to consolidate trade [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|relations with the USSR]], leading the U.S. to break off all remaining official diplomatic relations. Later that year, U.S. diplomats Edwin L. Sweet and William G.

On 3 January 1961 the U.S. withdrew diplomatic recognition of the Cuban government and closed the embassy in Havana.\n\nPresidential [[1960 United States presidential election|candidate]] John F.

He criticized what he saw as use of the U.S. government influence to advance the interest and increase the profits of private U.S. companies instead of helping Cuba to achieve economic progress, saying that Americans dominated the island's economy and had given support to one of the bloodiest and most repressive dictatorships in the history of Latin America. \"We let Batista put the U.S. on the side of tyranny, and we did nothing to convince the people of Cuba and Latin America that we wanted to be on the side of freedom\".<ref>Original Spanish: \" Mientras permitimos que Batista nos colocara de lado de la tiran\u00eda, nada hicimos para convencer al pueblo de Cuba y Latinoam\u00e9rica que quer\u00edamos estar de lado de la libertad.\", Mariano Ospina Pe\u00f1a, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=6 Las Elecciones Presidenciales de 1960] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035035/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=6 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=5 La Bah\u00eda de Cochinos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035117/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=5 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/ caballerosandantes.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517044903/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/ |date=17 May 2014 }} (in Spanish).</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Cuba resisted an armed invasion by about 1,500 CIA trained [[Cuban exile]]s at the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4925262.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Americas \u2013 Castro marks Bay of Pigs victory|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> President [[John F.

These activities were collectively known as the \"[[Cuban Project]]\" (also known as Operation Mongoose). This was to be a coordinated program of political, psychological, and military sabotage, involving intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. The Cuban project also proposed attacks on mainland U.S. targets, hijackings and assaults on Cuban refugee boats to generate U.S. public support for military action against the Cuban government, these proposals were known collectively as [[Operation Northwoods]].\n\nA [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee]] report later confirmed over eight attempted plots to kill Castro between 1960 and 1965, as well as additional plans against other Cuban leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm|title=AARC Public Digital Library \u2013 Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, pg|work=ASSASSINATION ARCHIVES|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> After weathering the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuba observed as U.S. armed forces staged a mock invasion of a [[Caribbean]] island in 1962 named [[Operation Ortsac]].

The discovery led to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nTrade relations also deteriorated in equal measure. In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] broadened the partial trade restrictions imposed after the revolution by Eisenhower to a ban on all trade with Cuba, except for non-subsidized sale of foods and medicines. A year later travel and financial transactions by U.S. citizens with Cuba was prohibited. The [[United States embargo against Cuba]] was to continue in varying forms. Despite tensions between the United States and Cuba during the Kennedy years, relations began to thaw somewhat after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Back channels that had already been established at the height of tensions between the two nations began to expand in 1963. Though Attorney General Robert Kennedy worried that such contact would hurt his brother's chances of re-election, President John Kennedy continued these contacts resulting in several meetings U.S ambassador William Atwood and Cuban officials such as Carlos Lechuga. Other contacts would be established directly between President Kennedy and Fidel Castro through media figures such as Lisa Howard and French reporter Jean Daniel days before the Kennedy Assassination with Castro stating \"I am willing to declare Goldwater my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election\".\n\nCastro would continue efforts to improve relations with the incoming Johnson Administration sending a message to Johnson encouraging dialogue saying:\n\n{{quote|I seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually respect and negotiate our differences. I believe that there are no areas of contention between us that cannot be discussed and settled within a climate of mutual understanding. But first, of course, it is necessary to discuss our differences.

Perhaps the biggest clash during the Johnson Administration would be the capture of Che Guevara in 1967 by Bolivia forces assisted by the Cia and U.S Special forces.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and early 1970s a sustained period of [[List of Cuba-US aircraft hijackings|aircraft hijackings]] between Cuba and the U.S. by citizens of both nations led to a need for cooperation. By 1974, U.S. elected officials had begun to visit the island. Three years later, during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the U.S. and Cuba simultaneously opened [[United States Interests Section in Havana|interests sections]] in each other's capitals. In 1980, after 10,000 Cubans crammed into the Peruvian embassy seeking political asylum, Castro stated that any who wished to do so could leave Cuba, in what became known as the [[Mariel boatlift]]. Approximately 125,000 people left Cuba for the United States.\n\n[[File:Propaganda a Cuba 07.jpg|thumb|Poster in [[Bay of Pigs]]]]\n\nIn 1977, Cuba and the United States signed a [[Maritime Boundary Agreement (Cuba \u2013 United States)|maritime boundary treaty]] in which the countries agreed on the location of their [[border]] in the [[Straits of Florida]]. The treaty was never sent to the [[United States Senate]] for [[ratification]], but the agreement has been implemented by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].\n\nIn 1981 President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s new administration announced a tightening of the embargo. The U.S. also re-established the travel ban, prohibiting U.S. citizens from spending money in Cuba. The ban was later supplemented to include Cuban government officials or their representatives visiting the U.S. In 1985 [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed]], backed by Ronald Reagan's administration, began to broadcast news and information from the U.S. to Cuba.\n\n===After the Cold War===\nThe [[Cold War]] ended with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, leaving Cuba without its major international sponsor. The ensuing years were marked by economic difficulty in Cuba, a time known as the [[Special Period]]. U.S. law allowed private humanitarian aid to Cuba for part of this time. However, the long-standing [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] was reinforced in October 1992 by the [[Cuban Democracy Act]] (the \"Torricelli Law\") and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the [[Helms-Burton Act]]). The 1992 act prohibited foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies from trading with Cuba, travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, and family remittances to Cuba.<ref>Full text of Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act</ref> [[Economic sanctions|Sanctions]] could also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. As a result, multinational companies had to choose between Cuba and the U.S., the latter being a much larger market.\n\nOn 24 February 1996, two unarmed Cessna 337s flown by the group \"[[Brothers to the Rescue]]\" were [[1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue planes|shot down]] by Cuban Air Force MiG-29, killing three Cuban-Americans and one Cuban U.S. resident. The Cuban government claimed that the planes had entered into Cuban airspace.\n\nSome veterans of CIA's 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, while no longer being sponsored by the CIA, are still active, though they are now in their seventies or older.

Beginning with opposition to the Castro led Independence Revolution in Cuba, the Spanish\u2013American War, naval use of Guantanamo Bay, trade restrictions imposed by Nixon, and a trade embargo opened in the year 2000.\n\nSince the 1990s, American public opinion of Cuba has overall become more favorable, and people became more supportive of ending the trade embargo as well as re-establishing diplomatic ties to Cuba. Gallup's poll that asked, \"Is your overall opinion of Cuba very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly unfavorable or very unfavorable?,\" began in 1997 with only 10% of people voting favorable, or mostly favorable and in 2015, Cuba's favorability reached 46%, almost half of the population believing Cuba to be very or mostly favorable, the highest percentage since the question has been asked. That question has had a constant rise in favorability, while asking whether or not Cuba was a serious threat had a constant decrease. According to the Roper Center, 68% of people in 1983 viewed Cuba as a serious or moderately serious threat to the United States, while in 2014 only 25% of the American population see Cuba as a threat. In a separate question by Gallup, \"Do you favor or oppose re-establishing diplomatic relationships with Cuba?\" this question has varied quite a bit over time, reaching its highest 71% in 1999 and most recently 51% in 2015. Data is likely to change more with higher favorability proceeding President Obama's 2016 actions to lift the Cold War embargo policy off of Cuba.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agreement for Democracy]]\n*[[Cuban Americans]]\n*[[Americans in Cuba]]\n*[[Spain\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[United States\u2013Vietnam relations]]\n*[[Canada\u2013Cuba relations]]\n*[[Peaceful coexistence]]\n*[[Cuban Thaw]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Air Force Fellows Program Maxwell AFB.

The U.S. stopped buying Cuban sugar and refused to supply its former trading partner with much needed oil, with a devastating effect on the island's economy, leading to Cuba turning to their newfound trading partner the [[Soviet Union]] for petroleum. In March 1960, tensions increased when the freighter ''[[La Coubre explosion|La Coubre]]'' exploded in Havana Harbor, killing over 75 people.

He criticized what he saw as use of the U.S. government influence to advance the interest and increase the profits of private U.S. companies instead of helping Cuba to achieve economic progress, saying that Americans dominated the island's economy and had given support to one of the bloodiest and most repressive dictatorships in the history of Latin America. \"We let Batista put the U.S. on the side of tyranny, and we did nothing to convince the people of Cuba and Latin America that we wanted to be on the side of freedom\".<ref>Original Spanish: \" Mientras permitimos que Batista nos colocara de lado de la tiran\u00eda, nada hicimos para convencer al pueblo de Cuba y Latinoam\u00e9rica que quer\u00edamos estar de lado de la libertad.\", Mariano Ospina Pe\u00f1a, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=6 Las Elecciones Presidenciales de 1960] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035035/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=6 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=5 La Bah\u00eda de Cochinos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723035117/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/index.php?cid=34&page=5 |date=23 July 2011 }}, [http://www.caballerosandantes.net/ caballerosandantes.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517044903/http://www.caballerosandantes.net/ |date=17 May 2014 }} (in Spanish).</ref>\n\nIn 1961 Cuba resisted an armed invasion by about 1,500 CIA trained [[Cuban exile]]s at the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|Bay of Pigs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4925262.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Americas \u2013 Castro marks Bay of Pigs victory|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> President [[John F.

These activities were collectively known as the \"[[Cuban Project]]\" (also known as Operation Mongoose). This was to be a coordinated program of political, psychological, and military sabotage, involving intelligence operations as well as assassination attempts on key political leaders. The Cuban project also proposed attacks on mainland U.S. targets, hijackings and assaults on Cuban refugee boats to generate U.S. public support for military action against the Cuban government, these proposals were known collectively as [[Operation Northwoods]].\n\nA [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee]] report later confirmed over eight attempted plots to kill Castro between 1960 and 1965, as well as additional plans against other Cuban leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0043a.htm|title=AARC Public Digital Library \u2013 Interim Report: Alleged Assassination Plots Involving Foreign Leaders, pg|work=ASSASSINATION ARCHIVES|accessdate=21 December 2014}}</ref> After weathering the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuba observed as U.S. armed forces staged a mock invasion of a [[Caribbean]] island in 1962 named [[Operation Ortsac]].

The discovery led to the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]].\n\nTrade relations also deteriorated in equal measure. In 1962, President [[John F. Kennedy]] broadened the partial trade restrictions imposed after the revolution by Eisenhower to a ban on all trade with Cuba, except for non-subsidized sale of foods and medicines. A year later travel and financial transactions by U.S. citizens with Cuba was prohibited. The [[United States embargo against Cuba]] was to continue in varying forms. Despite tensions between the United States and Cuba during the Kennedy years, relations began to thaw somewhat after the Cuban Missile Crisis. Back channels that had already been established at the height of tensions between the two nations began to expand in 1963. Though Attorney General Robert Kennedy worried that such contact would hurt his brother's chances of re-election, President John Kennedy continued these contacts resulting in several meetings U.S ambassador William Atwood and Cuban officials such as Carlos Lechuga. Other contacts would be established directly between President Kennedy and Fidel Castro through media figures such as Lisa Howard and French reporter Jean Daniel days before the Kennedy Assassination with Castro stating \"I am willing to declare Goldwater my friend if that will guarantee Kennedy's re-election\".\n\nCastro would continue efforts to improve relations with the incoming Johnson Administration sending a message to Johnson encouraging dialogue saying:\n\n{{quote|I seriously hope that Cuba and the United States can eventually respect and negotiate our differences. I believe that there are no areas of contention between us that cannot be discussed and settled within a climate of mutual understanding. But first, of course, it is necessary to discuss our differences.

Perhaps the biggest clash during the Johnson Administration would be the capture of Che Guevara in 1967 by Bolivia forces assisted by the Cia and U.S Special forces.\n\nThrough the late 1960s and early 1970s a sustained period of [[List of Cuba-US aircraft hijackings|aircraft hijackings]] between Cuba and the U.S. by citizens of both nations led to a need for cooperation. By 1974, U.S. elected officials had begun to visit the island. Three years later, during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, the U.S. and Cuba simultaneously opened [[United States Interests Section in Havana|interests sections]] in each other's capitals. In 1980, after 10,000 Cubans crammed into the Peruvian embassy seeking political asylum, Castro stated that any who wished to do so could leave Cuba, in what became known as the [[Mariel boatlift]]. Approximately 125,000 people left Cuba for the United States.\n\n[[File:Propaganda a Cuba 07.jpg|thumb|Poster in [[Bay of Pigs]]]]\n\nIn 1977, Cuba and the United States signed a [[Maritime Boundary Agreement (Cuba \u2013 United States)|maritime boundary treaty]] in which the countries agreed on the location of their [[border]] in the [[Straits of Florida]]. The treaty was never sent to the [[United States Senate]] for [[ratification]], but the agreement has been implemented by the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]].\n\nIn 1981 President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s new administration announced a tightening of the embargo. The U.S. also re-established the travel ban, prohibiting U.S. citizens from spending money in Cuba. The ban was later supplemented to include Cuban government officials or their representatives visiting the U.S. In 1985 [[Radio y Televisi\u00f3n Mart\u00ed]], backed by Ronald Reagan's administration, began to broadcast news and information from the U.S. to Cuba.\n\n===After the Cold War===\nThe [[Cold War]] ended with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in the early 1990s, leaving Cuba without its major international sponsor. The ensuing years were marked by economic difficulty in Cuba, a time known as the [[Special Period]]. U.S. law allowed private humanitarian aid to Cuba for part of this time. However, the long-standing [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] was reinforced in October 1992 by the [[Cuban Democracy Act]] (the \"Torricelli Law\") and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the [[Helms-Burton Act]]). The 1992 act prohibited foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies from trading with Cuba, travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, and family remittances to Cuba.<ref>Full text of Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act</ref> [[Economic sanctions|Sanctions]] could also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. As a result, multinational companies had to choose between Cuba and the U.S., the latter being a much larger market.\n\nOn 24 February 1996, two unarmed Cessna 337s flown by the group \"[[Brothers to the Rescue]]\" were [[1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue planes|shot down]] by Cuban Air Force MiG-29, killing three Cuban-Americans and one Cuban U.S. resident. The Cuban government claimed that the planes had entered into Cuban airspace.\n\nSome veterans of CIA's 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion, while no longer being sponsored by the CIA, are still active, though they are now in their seventies or older.

Beginning with opposition to the Castro led Independence Revolution in Cuba, the Spanish\u2013American War, naval use of Guantanamo Bay, trade restrictions imposed by Nixon, and a trade embargo opened in the year 2000.\n\nSince the 1990s, American public opinion of Cuba has overall become more favorable, and people became more supportive of ending the trade embargo as well as re-establishing diplomatic ties to Cuba. Gallup's poll that asked, \"Is your overall opinion of Cuba very favorable, mostly favorable, mostly unfavorable or very unfavorable?,\" began in 1997 with only 10% of people voting favorable, or mostly favorable and in 2015, Cuba's favorability reached 46%, almost half of the population believing Cuba to be very or mostly favorable, the highest percentage since the question has been asked. That question has had a constant rise in favorability, while asking whether or not Cuba was a serious threat had a constant decrease. According to the Roper Center, 68% of people in 1983 viewed Cuba as a serious or moderately serious threat to the United States, while in 2014 only 25% of the American population see Cuba as a threat. In a separate question by Gallup, \"Do you favor or oppose re-establishing diplomatic relationships with Cuba?\" this question has varied quite a bit over time, reaching its highest 71% in 1999 and most recently 51% in 2015. Data is likely to change more with higher favorability proceeding President Obama's 2016 actions to lift the Cold War embargo policy off of Cuba.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Agreement for Democracy]]\n*[[Cuban Americans]]\n*[[Americans in Cuba]]\n*[[Spain\u2013United States relations]]\n*[[United States\u2013Vietnam relations]]\n*[[Canada\u2013Cuba relations]]\n*[[Peaceful coexistence]]\n*[[Cuban Thaw]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Air Force Fellows Program Maxwell AFB.

{"title_page": "Clone Hero", "text_new": "{{short description|Indie rhythm video game}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = March 2020}}\n{{Use American English|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{Infobox video game\n| image = File:CloneHeroLogo.png\n| engine = [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]]\n| platforms = [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[OS X]], [[Linux]]\n| genre = [[Rhythm game]]\n| modes = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| released = March 2017\n}}\n\n'''''Clone Hero''''' is an [[Indie game|indie]] [[Rhythm game|rhythm]] [[video game]] created by a small team of developers led by a user under the pseudonym of \"Srylain The 2nd\", first released circa March 2017. The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note.

The game is a [[Clone (computing)|clone]] of the ''[[Guitar Hero]]'' franchise, and as such, features nearly identical gameplay. The main draw of the game is its ability to play community-made songs, which has resulted in a large [[Fandom|fan community]] around the game.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n''Clone Hero'', by design, features nearly identical gameplay to ''Guitar Hero''. Specifically, the game is most similar to later entries in the series such as ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour|World Tour]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock|Warriors of Rock]]''. Gameplay involves pressing colored buttons on a [[guitar]]-shaped controller to play along to songs, although in ''Clone Hero'' these inputs can be mapped to a keyboard or any other input device. Players must hold specific buttons that line up with colored notes that appear on the screen on a \"highway\"; when the notes hit the bottom of the highway, the player must strum to hit the notes in time with the music. There is also an \"open strum\" note, represented with a purple bar, which requires the player to strum without pressing any other buttons. In addition to normal notes, there are \"HOPO\"s (\"[[Hammer-on|Hammer-ons]]\" and \"[[Pull-off|Pull-offs]]\") and \"tap notes\", which both do not require the player to strum them to hit them, with the difference between the two being that a string of HOPOs must begin with a strum, and the player must re-strum if they miss a note. Unlike the ''Guitar Hero'' series, by default there is no penalty for missing notes, aside from breaking a combo, making it impossible to fail a song. The game also contains a mode which emulates the gameplay of ''[[Guitar Hero Live]]'', which is notably different from other games in the series.\n\n=== Community-made charts ===\n''Clone Hero'' has the ability to play community-made songs, called \"charts\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-01-meet-the-community-reviving-classic-guitar-hero-gameplay-in-their-own-clone|title=The spirit of Guitar Hero lives on in a bizarre community-made clone|last=Stubbs|first=Mike|date=2018-05-01|website=Eurogamer|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/guitar-heroes-never-die-they-just-start-playing-clone-1828254899|title=Guitar Heroes never die, they just start playing Clone Hero|last=Neilan|first=Dan|date=August 10, 2018|website=AV Club|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> However, unlike games in the ''Guitar Hero'' series, these songs do not need to be original compositions, and can instead be any audio file a member of the community wishes to turn into a playable chart.

With the use of SMS and voice calls, group coordination is organized through singular calls/text messages to each individual group member. Although, one person can send the same text message to multiple group members, the group members can't see the responses of everyone else or even know who's in the group at all. Group members only have access to the messages they either send or receive, which hinders group coordination. With the introduction of messaging apps, users can form group chats, where all the members can see an entire thread of everyone's responses. Members can also respond directly to each other, rather than having to go through the member who started the group message, to relay the information. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ling |first1=Rich |last2=Lai |first2=Chih-Hui |title=Microcoordination 2.0: Social Coordination in the Age of Smartphones and Messaging Apps. |journal=Journal of Communication |date=October 6, 2016 |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=834\u2013856 |doi=10.1111/jcom.12251 }}</ref>\n\n==Features==\nMessaging apps each have some of the following features:\n\n* Chat\n** One-on-one chat\n** Group chat\n** Broadcast lists\n** [[Chatbots]] (including \"bot in group chats\")\n** \"Smart replies\" (suggested replies to incoming messages provided by Google's Reply platform )<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ausdroid.net/2018/02/22/googles-new-reply-app-makes-appearance-link-install-inside/|title=Google's new Reply app makes an appearance, link to install inside - Ausdroid|website=ausdroid.net|date=2018-02-22}}</ref>\n* Calls\n** Voice calls\n** Video calls\n* Audio alerts (on Line)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/05/07/economist-talks-advantages-line-over-whatsapp-mobile-messaging-push|title=The Economist talks on advantages of Line over Whatsapp for mobile messaging push|publisher=}}</ref>\n* [[File sharing]]\n* Games\n* \"Mini Programs\" (e.g. WeChat Mini Program)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://open.wechat.com/cgi-bin/newreadtemplate?t=overseas_open/docs/mini-programs/development/brief-tutorial|title=Brief Tutorial - WeChat Open Platform|website=open.wechat.com}}</ref>\n* News discovery (e.g. Snapchat Discover)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://digiday.com/media/snap-tries-to-make-tv-and-magazines-coexist-on-snapchat-discover/|title=Does Snapchat Discover want to be TV or magazines?
