In the fall of his senior year at the university, Miller began writing for the South Hills Record, mixing humor into his sports reporting. When the paper changed its payment structure to pay around an eighth of a penny per column inch, Miller quit.<ref name=Finder/> Miller graduated from Point Park in 1976 with a degree in journalism.<ref name=\"TVG bio\">{{cite web|title=Dennis Miller Biography|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/dennis-miller/bio/147096|work=TV Guide|accessdate=November 2, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Finder/> Miller would later reflect on why he did not continue to pursue journalism, saying \"I'm just not that interested in other people's business and that's a tragic flaw in a journalist.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter college, Miller was unable to find work in journalism. Instead, he moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy.<ref name=Finder/> Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with [[Tom Snyder]], Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a \"bad hotel,\" which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller say \"I'm in Hell, I don't even know what I am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case.\" Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as \"an all-gay florist.\" Leaving that job, he worked as an ice cream scooper. Miller recalled that he was twenty-one\u2014five years out of high school and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licenses. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and he was the one who had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment.<ref name=Tom>{{cite video|title=1995-Dennis Miller|publisher=The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAyOAz2xkU|date=July 28, 1995}}</ref> Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a [[Franz Kafka]] novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.<ref name=Joke/>\n\nLeaving the ice cream parlor, Miller joined the staff at Point Park's Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league.<ref name=Finder/> Air-hockey regulars nicknamed him \"Clarence\" after NHL Commissioner [[Clarence Campbell]], or called him \"Commish.\" When Miller's brother Jimmy was around, they referred to him as \"Commush\".<ref name=Finder/> A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the \"[[Pittsburgh Steelers#The Chuck Noll era|era of the Super Steelers]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\n===Stand-up===\nIn 1979 after seeing a [[Robin Williams]] comedy special on HBO, Miller decided that he had to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Miller began pursuing a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1989|first=Duncan|last=Strauss|title=He's Brainy, Funny--and Frightened?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3378_1_stand-up-fresh-air-real-life}}</ref> When he finally made his d\u00e9but at the Oak's Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Miller's family was in the audience to cheer him on.<ref name=Julina>{{cite news|title=Comic Killing' Em With Gags|first=Mike|last=Julina|date=February 23, 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=12|url=\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88936157/}}</ref>\n\nIn a later interview, Miller spoke of the stage presence he developed for his stand-up act to address his fears. (He emphasized that the comedy business will always be frightening as any error could spiral into the end of a career.) To compensate for his early fears, Miller said, \"I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it. ...It's a part of me, but it's not the real me.\" He would keep his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjust his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a \"hipper-than-thou\" persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nHe began appearing onstage at the Oak's Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in [[Kennedy Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Kennedy]].<ref name=Finder/> Miller lived without a car and without much money in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh]], hitching rides or taking buses.<ref name=Finder/> He continued to do stand-ups in Oakland and at places like Brandy's in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Julina/> Arriving there, Miller had to bribe a landlord $200 to give him a room, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first month's rent of $250, resulting in his having spent $700 of his $1,000 savings the first day for a sparse, bunker-like room.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York he submitted a joke for a ''Playboy'' magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[David Brenner]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Art Buchwald]], and [[Buck Henry]].<ref name=Julina/> Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine.<ref name=Duncan/><ref name=Julina/> Miller won $500 in ''Playboy''{{'}}s first annual humor competition with the following joke:\n{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|''Playboy'', June 1979<ref>{{cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller had heavily relied on props during his act, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nMiller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. 350 people tried out for the remaining eight slots, some of whom had appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', or ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. Many of the comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him onto the finals. While he did not win the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile he was working in New York City, ''[[Hustler Magazine]]'' listed Miller in a piece called \"The 10 Funniest People in America You'll Never See on TV\".<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York City, Miller supported himself by working rather mundane jobs during the day, such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.<ref name=Julina/> After about a year, unable to make a go of it, he returned to Pittsburgh.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\n==Television==\nHaving honed his stand-up comedy act, Miller was able to transition to television, increasing his audience base.\n\n===KDKA-TV===\nHaving gone through the comedy-club circuit, Miller returned to do his sight-gag routine back in Pittsburgh at Brandy's in August 1980. It was there that local television station [[KDKA-TV]] was shooting a piece for its ''Evening Magazine'' and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller acted as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKA's ''Pittsburgh 2Day''. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]''. By 1983 he had become the host of ''Punchline,'' a Saturday-morning [[newsmagazine]] aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian [[Pat Paulsen]]. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that \"you have to start somewhere,\" and that he was \"just pleased to be in front of a camera.\"<ref name=Finder/><ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030529/http://comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Miller also performed stand-up in New York City comedy clubs such as [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip. While in New York, Miller saw a show by [[Richard Belzer]] and noted how he barked at the crowd rather than embraced it, was cutting rather than cute. Miller adopted this comedic philosophy.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nDuring performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended [[Jay Leno]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a d\u00e9but for Miller at [[The Improv]].<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Joke/> Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.\n\nMiller's brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy would go on to become a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich would run RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller as he was to many upcoming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians would gather at Leno's home late at night and he would offer critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno would also tape television appearances of his group and show them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller would later fondly recall the time, saying it was like \"sitting at his knee, querying [[Yoda]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\nMiller appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] after the two tied on judges' scores; Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on June 24, 1985 (other guests were [[Phil Collins]] and [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]]).<ref name=Joke/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=epguides.com|url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/|title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)}}</ref>\n\n===''Saturday Night Live''===\nMiller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. Michaels had him come in for an audition. Miller did an audition in L.A. for SNL and that went well enough for him to be brought to New York for a second audition in a room in Times Square. About 70 people watched this second audition\u2014this was most of the show's staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told \"Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis.\"<ref name=Roe/> After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he \"just sat there quietly\".<ref name=Roe/>\n\nMiller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: \"He looked at me and goes, 'Would you like to do my newscast?'. And I said, 'Yeah, I would', and he said, 'Well, I'll see you tomorrow'. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, 'My life has just changed'.\"<ref name=Joke/> Miller had landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name=\"penn\">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show.

That's the news, and I am outta here!\" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair\u2014idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\nIn 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White, (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.\n\nAlthough Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name=\"snl archives\">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>\n\n====Recurring characters====\n* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch \"Miss Connie's Fable Nook\"\n* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n* [[Gary Hart]]\n* [[George Harrison]]\n* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]\n\nIt was thought that he would renew his contract with NBC until at least 1993. It was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Miller's show and prefer that over Leno's in that time slot.<ref name=Phil/>\n\n====Leaving SNL====\nMiller decided he was going to leave SNL after the 1990\u201391 season despite being happy with his role on the show and despite loving writing political gags for it, because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden had made him want to strive for things to \"make the boy proud.\"<ref name=Allan/><ref name=Adams/> He told an interviewer, \"I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesn't present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it. ...I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot.\"<ref name=Adams/> Miller thought that his outspokenness behind the SNL desk on political topics and even on jokes not working out made the transition to talk show host a good idea. He also felt that the SNL studio audience never fully accepted him in skits as other characters, making him question his acting ability.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAfter it was announced that Miller would be starting his own show, he was a guest on ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', who offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. He told Miller to compete only with himself, not to focus on the competition. Miller appreciated the advice, noting that \"there's no class for this\" and that he would have to learn on the job in front of an audience.<ref name=Allan/> In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the show's stage hands.

The number received around 150,000 calls and the charge for calling it made between $40-$50,000, which was donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Miller said he was touched by the outpouring and said he had only expected at most 20,000 calls.<ref name=Hastings/> Also during the final week, he took on a sharper edge that, to some reviewers, such as Phil Rosenthal, showed \"just how much unfulfilled promise the show held for the same viewers who love NBC's ''Late Night With David Letterman'' or even [[Comedy Central]]'s cult favorite ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]''.\" He jokingly looked into the camera and begged CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky for a job; he had [[Julia Sweeney]] appear as her androgynous SNL character Pat and serenade him mimicking [[Bette Midler]]'s song for the retiring Johnny Carson. When a skit began to fail he moved the man with the cue-cards on camera.<ref name=Rosenthal/>\n\nMiller also openly complained that getting guests had become increasingly difficult after Leno took over from Carson.

Guests included fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leaned [[right-wing|right of center]], there were several liberals who appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some \"regulars\" like columnists and conservatives [[Debra Saunders]], [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], [[William Kristol|Bill Kristol]], and [[Jerome Corsi]] along with entertainers such as singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] and actor [[Orson Bean]]. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often commented on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for \"Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]\", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.\n\nIn a 2007 interview Miller said he felt that his radio show of all his work best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying \"This time, if I'm fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller.\"<ref name=IR>{{cite web|work=Illinois Review|date=July 31, 2007|title=After 30 Years, the Real Dennis Miller|url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2007/07/after-30-years-.html}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show had an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences |year=2011 |work=[[Talkers Magazine]] |url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209101821/http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Miller ended the radio show after his contract expired on March 27, 2015.<ref name=radioinsight>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92131/dennis-miller-to-end-syndicated-show/ \"Dennis Miller To End Syndicated Show\"] from Radio Insight (February 27, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Other endeavors===\nMiller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.\n\nHe has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).\n\nMiller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He played the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appeared as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).\n\nMiller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.\n\n==Comedic style==\nMiller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people \"babe\" or \"cat\") and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with \"Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but...\" and end with \"...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\"\n\nMiller listed his comedic influences for ''The New York Times'' as including \"[[Jonathan Miller]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Richard Belzer]] and Mr. [Jay] Leno.\"<ref name=Joke/> When the ''Times'' asked him about the comedians [[Mort Sahl]] and [[Lenny Bruce]], to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahl's early work but that as Sahl's career continued he became too tied to the [[Kennedy family]] and became a \"savage name-dropper,\" which diminished him in Miller's eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the ''Times'', \"Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldn't care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me he's a genius, I think, 'Really?' I'm not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I don't know what kind of genius they are.\"<ref name=Joke/>\n\nDescribing his career Miller stated, \"It's all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I've been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that I've stuck with it. That's my favorite part of showbiz, hangin' in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought I'd have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I'd have to lay around for it to be visited on me. ''SNL'' was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three 'Updates' up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. \"I don't ever wanna get self-important. I'm a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid.\"<ref name=Carl/>\n\nMiller has referred to his casual stage-style as \"quasi-[[Dean Martin]] insouciance.\"<ref name=SI/> When asked if he's accepted others' title of him as \"the 'intelligent' comedian,\" he replied, \"The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for [[The Jetsons]]. It's just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I\u2019m trying to get laughs. ... I'm OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me\u2014and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didn't think I was smart\u2014but he said, 'I'll give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system.' I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n==Personal life==\nMiller married Carolyn \"Ali\" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as \"Espley\" or \"Epsley.\" In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as \"Ali Espley\".</ref> a former model from [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s 1983 \"[[Too Shy]]\" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and have two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller is a partner in the Hollywood management company Gold/Miller representing comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].<ref name=Joke/>\n\n==Political views==\nAlthough in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|neoconservative]] political opinions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Currie, Duncan|date=June 27, 2003|title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace? | work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp|accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHe was a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called \"Miller Time\", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called \"Real Free Speech.\"\n\n===Early outlook===\nWhen asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter \"I didn't know my dad\u2014he moved out early. And my mom's politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn't think about [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. She thought about who made sense. I've been both in my life. Somebody can say they don't understand why somebody drifts. But I've always found people who drift interesting, 'cause it shows me the game's not stagnant in their own head. They're thinking.\"<ref name=Winters/>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], eager to bash conservative Republicans.\n\nMiller has said that he privately began to change his politics in 1992 when liberals made jokes about the poor performance [[Ross Perot]]'s running mate [[James Stockdale]] displayed during a televised debate. Stockdale was a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and Miller saw jokes about him as mockery. Miller would later comment, \"You know, Stockdale, we would have been blessed to have him as a President. I don't care if he's bad on TV. He was a hero and an icon. I saw people on the left go, 'Who's this old guy who's bad on TV?'... If he's the problem, that's too hip a room for me. That's when I got out.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Richter|title=Dennis Miller: Liberal Mockery of Stockdale Made Me Conservative|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dennis-Miller-James-Stockdale-Ross-Perot-conservative/2014/06/04/id/575254/|website=[[Newsmax]]|publisher=[[Newsmax Media]]|location=Palm Beach, Florida|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that Miller was a member of the political left did not change much, even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: \"I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings.

Even before 9/11, I'd travel to New York and say, 'Wow, this city certainly seems to be running better. Giuliani is the kind of leader I admire.

I must say that I never considered myself a secular progressive. ... I didn't consider myself that then, and I don't consider myself to be [[Curtis LeMay]] now. I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I don't like lockstep, even if it's lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here. And that seemed to put me\u2014I don't know\u2014off to the kids' table.\" He said that his more open conservatism may have cost him some passing acquaintances, but it has not affected \"my dear friends.

If two gay guys want to get married, it's none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. I'm happy when people fall in love. But if some idiot foreign terrorist wants to blow up their wedding to make a political statement, I would rather kill him before he can do it, or have my country kill him before he can do it, instead of having him do it and punishing him after the fact. If that makes me a right-wing fanatic, I will bask in that assignation. ... I think abortion's wrong, but it's none of my business to tell somebody what's wrong. So I'm pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other people's personal business. I guess I fall into conservative when it comes to protecting the United States in a world where a lot of people hate the United States. ... [After 9/11] everybody should be in the protection business now. I can't imagine anybody not saying that. Well, I guess on the farthest end of the left they'd say, 'That's our fault.' And on the middle end they'd say, 'Well, there's another way to deal with it other than flat-out protecting ourselves.' I just don't believe that. People say we're the ones who make them hate us because of what we do. That's garbage to me. I think they're nuts.

In the fall of his senior year at the university, Miller began writing for the South Hills Record, mixing humor into his sports reporting.

Instead, he moved through several occupations, including a clerk at Giant Eagle deli, a janitor, a delivery man for a florist, and an ice cream scooper at the Village Dairy.<ref name=Finder/> Reflecting on his pre-comedy job history in a later discussion with [[Tom Snyder]], Miller recalled leaving college and attending a real estate seminar at a \"bad hotel,\" which consisted of a five-hour lecture without bathroom breaks. Near the end of the lecture, he was told that he would only be paid by commission, which made Miller say \"I'm in Hell, I don't even know what I am going to do for a living here. I'm a nut case.\" Miller then worked as a delivery man for what he describes as \"an all-gay florist.\" Leaving that job, he worked as an ice cream scooper. Miller recalled that he was twenty-one\u2014five years out of high school and wearing a paper hat while working alongside teens excited about getting their driver's licenses. A spur to quit the ice cream scooping job was when the prettiest girl he had attended high school with came in and he was the one who had to take her order, which filled him with embarrassment.<ref name=Tom>{{cite video|title=1995-Dennis Miller|publisher=The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAyOAz2xkU|date=July 28, 1995}}</ref> Miller later stated that at the time he feared that if he stayed in such jobs, his life would become a [[Franz Kafka]] novella, and it stiffened his resolve to start pursuing a comedy career.<ref name=Joke/>\n\nLeaving the ice cream parlor, Miller joined the staff at Point Park's Recreation Room, where he was in charge of the bowling alley, video games, and running the air-hockey league.<ref name=Finder/> Air-hockey regulars nicknamed him \"Clarence\" after NHL Commissioner [[Clarence Campbell]], or called him \"Commish.\" When Miller's brother Jimmy was around, they referred to him as \"Commush\".<ref name=Finder/> A patron from that time recalled that Miller sat on pool tables telling jokes and honing his comedy to those in the rec room, which was the only place the commuters gathered. Miller and the other patrons closely followed the NFL at the time as it was the \"[[Pittsburgh Steelers#The Chuck Noll era|era of the Super Steelers]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\n===Stand-up===\nIn 1979 after seeing a [[Robin Williams]] comedy special on HBO, Miller decided that he had to pursue his dream of being a stand-up comedian.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Miller began pursuing a comedy career by performing at open-mic nights. He backed out of his first two attempts to perform at an open mic due to stage fright and anger with himself over the question of whether the drive to perform was a need for approval from others.<ref name=Duncan>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|date=June 11, 1989|first=Duncan|last=Strauss|title=He's Brainy, Funny--and Frightened?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-11/entertainment/ca-3378_1_stand-up-fresh-air-real-life}}</ref> When he finally made his d\u00e9but at the Oak's Lounge on Sleepy Hollow Road in Castle Shannon, most of Miller's family was in the audience to cheer him on.<ref name=Julina>{{cite news|title=Comic Killing' Em With Gags|first=Mike|last=Julina|date=February 23, 1980|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=12|url=\nhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/88936157/}}</ref>\n\nIn a later interview, Miller spoke of the stage presence he developed for his stand-up act to address his fears. (He emphasized that the comedy business will always be frightening as any error could spiral into the end of a career.) To compensate for his early fears, Miller said, \"I got up there and acted like the guy I always wanted to be to get through it. ...It's a part of me, but it's not the real me.\" He would keep his hands in his pockets to appear unfazed, or adjust his cuffs during an audience laugh to give the appearance of indifference to approval. Miller pointed out that part of his act is to show a \"hipper-than-thou\" persona, but then purposely undermine it at regular intervals for comedic effect.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nHe began appearing onstage at the Oak's Lounge in Castle Shannon while working at the Giant Eagle deli in [[Kennedy Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Kennedy]].<ref name=Finder/> Miller lived without a car and without much money in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh]], hitching rides or taking buses.<ref name=Finder/> He continued to do stand-ups in Oakland and at places like Brandy's in the Strip District and the Portfolio on Craig Street, eventually saving up $1,000 which he used to try to fast-track his comedy career by moving to New York City.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Julina/> Arriving there, Miller had to bribe a landlord $200 to give him a room, then had to pay the security deposit of $250 and the first month's rent of $250, resulting in his having spent $700 of his $1,000 savings the first day for a sparse, bunker-like room.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York he submitted a joke for a ''Playboy'' magazine contest for humor writing that was judged by an all-star panel including [[Rodney Dangerfield]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[David Brenner]], [[Martin Mull]], [[Art Buchwald]], and [[Buck Henry]].<ref name=Julina/> Of around 15,000 entries, Miller tied for second and his joke and picture appeared in the June 1979 issue of the magazine.<ref name=Duncan/><ref name=Julina/> Miller won $500 in ''Playboy''{{'}}s first annual humor competition with the following joke:\n{{quote|The only difference between group sex and group therapy is that in group therapy you hear about everyone's problems, and in group sex you see them.|Dennis Miller|''Playboy'', June 1979<ref>{{cite news|date=June 1979|title=Funny Money|magazine=Playboy|volume=26|number=6|issn=0032-1478}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the first year and a half of his comedy career, Miller had heavily relied on props during his act, but he felt this limited him and switched to using purely language.<ref name=Duncan/>\n\nMiller gained more exposure when he tried out for the New York Laff-Off Contest. The contest had 40 slots but 32 of them had already been filled by the top regulars who appeared at the three comedy venues sponsoring the competition. 350 people tried out for the remaining eight slots, some of whom had appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]'', or ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. Many of the comedians Miller was up against had hours of crafted material, while he had fine-tuned around ten minutes. To his surprise and delight, Miller earned one of the remaining slots. For the competition itself he appeared at the Improv and received a standing ovation, moving him onto the finals. While he did not win the Laff-Off, he was seen by dozens of talent agents, resulting in bookings at colleges and other clubs.<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile he was working in New York City, ''[[Hustler Magazine]]'' listed Miller in a piece called \"The 10 Funniest People in America You'll Never See on TV\".<ref name=Julina/>\n\nWhile in New York City, Miller supported himself by working rather mundane jobs during the day, such as bartender and payroll clerk, and by night made the rounds of New York clubs The Comic Strip, The Improvisation, and Catch a Rising Star.<ref name=Julina/> After about a year, unable to make a go of it, he returned to Pittsburgh.<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Duncan/>\n\n==Television==\nHaving honed his stand-up comedy act, Miller was able to transition to television, increasing his audience base.\n\n===KDKA-TV===\nHaving gone through the comedy-club circuit, Miller returned to do his sight-gag routine back in Pittsburgh at Brandy's in August 1980. It was there that local television station [[KDKA-TV]] was shooting a piece for its ''Evening Magazine'' and offered him a job at the station. By the end of 1980 Miller acted as a warm-up in the afternoons for KDKA's ''Pittsburgh 2Day''. He then began starring in humorous segments for the syndicated ''[[Evening Magazine]]''. By 1983 he had become the host of ''Punchline,'' a Saturday-morning [[newsmagazine]] aimed at teenagers. In one episode he interviewed fellow comedian [[Pat Paulsen]]. Miller later reflected on this time, saying that \"you have to start somewhere,\" and that he was \"just pleased to be in front of a camera.\"<ref name=Finder/><ref>{{cite web|author=The Comedy Zone Humor Network |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |title=Dennis Miller : Comedian Profile |publisher=Comedy-zone.net |accessdate=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612030529/http://comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/m/miller-dennis.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nDuring this time Miller also performed stand-up in New York City comedy clubs such as [[Catch a Rising Star (comedy clubs)|Catch A Rising Star]] and The Comic Strip. While in New York, Miller saw a show by [[Richard Belzer]] and noted how he barked at the crowd rather than embraced it, was cutting rather than cute. Miller adopted this comedic philosophy.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nDuring performances at comedy clubs in Pittsburgh, Miller befriended [[Jay Leno]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]. In 1984 Leno found Miller an apartment in Los Angeles and he and Seinfeld arranged a d\u00e9but for Miller at [[The Improv]].<ref name=Finder/><ref name=Joke/> Miller resigned from KDKA and moved to Los Angeles to try to further his comedy career.\n\nMiller's brothers Rich and Jimmy joined him in Los Angeles, taking up varied jobs around The Improv such as booking shows, acting as bouncer, and selling tickets. Jimmy would go on to become a power talent agent with Gold Miller, and Rich would run RCM Entertainment, booking comedians across the country.<ref name=Finder/>\n\nIn Los Angeles, Leno was a big influence on Miller as he was to many upcoming comedians in the area at the time. Young comedians would gather at Leno's home late at night and he would offer critiques with humorous, biting wit. Leno would also tape television appearances of his group and show them during such sessions while offering more humorous critiques. Miller would later fondly recall the time, saying it was like \"sitting at his knee, querying [[Yoda]]\".<ref name=Finder/>\n\nMiller appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'', where he lost out to fellow comedian [[Sinbad (comedian)|Sinbad]] after the two tied on judges' scores; Sinbad won with a higher studio-audience approval rating. Miller made his first appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on June 24, 1985 (other guests were [[Phil Collins]] and [[Mar\u00eda Conchita Alonso]]).<ref name=Joke/><ref>{{cite web|publisher=epguides.com|url=http://epguides.com/LateNightwithDavidLetterman/|title=Late Night with David Letterman (a Guest Stars & Air Dates Guide)}}</ref>\n\n===''Saturday Night Live''===\nMiller's big break came in 1985 when he was discovered by [[Lorne Michaels]] at [[The Comedy Store]]. Michaels had him come in for an audition. Miller did an audition in L.A. for SNL and that went well enough for him to be brought to New York for a second audition in a room in Times Square. About 70 people watched this second audition\u2014this was most of the show's staff along with Lorne Michaels, Paul Simon, and Dan Aykroyd. Miller walked into a well-lit room and was told \"Go ahead, you have eight minutes, Dennis.\"<ref name=Roe/> After the New York audition he went to dinner with Michaels and Jack Nicholson. Miller felt that this was just another aspect of his audition, to see if he could handle himself around famous people, so he \"just sat there quietly\".<ref name=Roe/>\n\nMiller later recalled the conclusion of the meeting with Michaels: \"He looked at me and goes, 'Would you like to do my newscast?'. And I said, 'Yeah, I would', and he said, 'Well, I'll see you tomorrow'. And then I walked out. And I remember thinking, 'My life has just changed'.\"<ref name=Joke/> Miller had landed a spot on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', where he succeeded [[Christopher Guest]] as the ''[[Weekend Update]]'' anchor. The spot was supposed to go to comic [[Jon Lovitz]], but Lovitz was scheduled for other parts on the show and needed the ''Update'' segment to do costume changes, so Miller was drafted to read the news.<ref name=\"penn\">{{cite episode|title=Penn Jillette Radio Show.

That's the news, and I am outta here!\" Fans of ''SNL'' became accustomed to his snarky delivery, high-pitched giggle, and frequently primped hair\u2014idiosyncrasies that would be spoofed by [[Dana Carvey]], [[Tom Hanks]], and [[Jimmy Fallon]], all of whom have impersonated Miller on the show. When Miller left ''SNL'' in 1991, the anchor's chair was turned over to [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\nIn 1988, Miller released a stand-up comedy CD, ''The Off-White Album'', derived from an [[HBO]] special titled ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0249466|Mr. Miller Goes to Washington Starring Dennis Miller (1988) }}</ref> which drew heavily from the [[Observational comedy|observational]] and [[metaphor]]-driven style he was known for on ''Saturday Night Live'', and showed glimpses of the political humor that would influence his later work. A well-received HBO special, ''Dennis Miller: Black and White'',<ref>{{IMDb title|0317340|Dennis Miller: Black and White, (1990)}}</ref> aired shortly after the release of the CD.\n\nAlthough Miller spent much of his time on ''SNL'' behind the ''Weekend Update'' desk, he was included in some sketches and did a few recurring characters and celebrity impersonations.<ref name=\"snl archives\">[http://snl.jt.org/cast.php?i=DeMi Dennis Miller], SNL Archives</ref>\n\n====Recurring characters====\n* Koko, one of the pixies in the recurring sketch \"Miss Connie's Fable Nook\"\n* Steve, one of The Stand-Ups (others include [[Jon Lovitz]] as Bob, [[Damon Wayans]] as Keith, and [[Tom Hanks]] as Paul)\n\n====Celebrity impersonations====\n* [[Gary Hart]]\n* [[George Harrison]]\n* [[Nathaniel Crosby]]\n\nIt was thought that he would renew his contract with NBC until at least 1993. It was believed that fans of Letterman would naturally be interested in Miller's show and prefer that over Leno's in that time slot.<ref name=Phil/>\n\n====Leaving SNL====\nMiller decided he was going to leave SNL after the 1990\u201391 season despite being happy with his role on the show and despite loving writing political gags for it, because he had turned 38 and his 18-month-old son Holden had made him want to strive for things to \"make the boy proud.\"<ref name=Allan/><ref name=Adams/> He told an interviewer, \"I had a great gig and this came up. It seemed like an opportunity that doesn't present itself too frequently in your life, so I opted to take it. ...I wanted to see what other talents I had, so I decided this was the shot.\"<ref name=Adams/> Miller thought that his outspokenness behind the SNL desk on political topics and even on jokes not working out made the transition to talk show host a good idea. He also felt that the SNL studio audience never fully accepted him in skits as other characters, making him question his acting ability.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAfter it was announced that Miller would be starting his own show, he was a guest on ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', who offered him some advice while reflecting on his own 30-year career from which he was retiring in May 1992. He told Miller to compete only with himself, not to focus on the competition. Miller appreciated the advice, noting that \"there's no class for this\" and that he would have to learn on the job in front of an audience.<ref name=Allan/> In preparation, Miller sharpened his interviewing skills by practicing on the show's stage hands. He felt that the secret to interviewing well was listening to the guest rather than trying to set up jokes while the guest is talking.<ref name=Allan/>\n\nAs the date for the show's opening approached, Miller told an interviewer that he was both thrilled and \"scared shitless\" by the opportunity. He hoped to eventually be able to relax enough to be entirely himself. He saw Johnny Carson's approach as the standard but hoped not to be too influenced by anyone.<ref name=Adams/> Between SNL and his new show, Miller did stand-up dates with [[Howie Mandel]] and then with [[Steven Wright]].<ref name=Adams/>\n\n===''The Dennis Miller Show''===\nIn 1992, after leaving SNL, Miller hosted an eponymous late-night talk show in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] that lasted seven months.\n\n====Late-night landscape====\n''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' was launched in 1989, and after Tribune Entertainment saw how that show brought in new and younger viewers to late night, they wanted to make their own show in an attempt to match its success.<ref name=Phil>{{cite news|title=Talk With A 'tude|date=January 20, 1992|first=Phil|last=Rosenthal|work=Los Angeles Daily News|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-01-20/lifestyle/9201181129_1_dennis-miller-miller-show-miller-brings}}</ref> In 1990 Tribune Entertainment pursued [[Garry Shandling]] to create a syndicated late-night talk show, reaching out to him through the talent agency that represented him [[Brillstein Entertainment Partners|Brillstein-Grey Entertainment]].

''The Dennis Miller Show'' continued in the tradition of \"[[Alternative culture|alternative]]\" talk shows, starting with the ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' show, which debuted on [[NBC]] in 1982. [[Nick Bakay]] was the announcer, and [[Andy Summers]], formerly of the band [[The Police]], led the house band.\n\nGuests included [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] (with [[Leslie West]] and [[Corky Laing]]), [[Toad the Wet Sprocket]] (who made their national television debut on the show), [[Henry Rollins]] (who appeared repeatedly to chat with Miller and perform [[spoken word]]), [[Primus (band)|Primus]] (who while performing \"[[Tommy the Cat]]\", had to deal with a member of the audience who jumped onstage\u2014whom Miller playfully tried to \"tackle\"), [[King's X]] (who performed two songs, \"[[Black Flag (song)|Black Flag]]\" and \"[[It's Love]]\" to empty seats in the studio due to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]]), and comedian [[Bill Hicks]].\n\nThe show remained faithful to the classic talk-show format with a desk and three or four guests a night, while Miller carried forward the spirit of his SNL ''Weekend Update'' with a newscast segment that aired on Fridays.<ref name=Adams/><ref name=Allan/>\n\nThe show's staff boasted a mix of past and future performers, writers, and producers of note including [[Mark Brazill]] (''[[That '70s Show]]''), Eddie Feldmann, [[David Kohan]] and [[Max Mutchnick]] (creators of ''[[Will & Grace]]''), [[Norm Macdonald]], [[Bob Odenkirk]] (''[[Mr. Show]]''), [[John Riggi]], [[Kevin Rooney]], [[Herb Sargent]] (''[[Saturday Night Live]]''), [[Drake Sather]], and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] (''[[Second City TV]]'').\n\nMiller thought there would be room for his show as its main competitors for the time slot would be ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' and ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and he felt they all attracted different audiences.<ref name=Allan/> At the time [[Arsenio Hall]] was not worried about Jay Leno's hold on late night, but told the Los Angeles Times, \"Dennis Miller is the only one who scares me, because I have tremendous respect for him and think he's one of the brightest comics on the scene.\"<ref name=Phil/><ref>{{cite news|title=The Arsenio Way : No Carson Copycat, Hall Woofs Up His Audience By Making His Own Rules|date=January 5, 1992|first=Dabuek|last=Cerone|work=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-01-05/news/tv-2136_1_arsenio-hall}}</ref>\n\nThe show opened to mixed reviews, with some being \"blisteringly negative\", but Tribune remained optimistic, saying that a 2 rating nationally would be acceptable due to the late hour of the show and pointed out that in some places Miller was doing better than Hall.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reporter's Notebook|first=Bill|last=Carter|date=February 4, 1992|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/04/arts/reporter-s-notebook-rather-pulls-cbs-news-back-to-the-assassination.html|work=New York Times}}</ref> As the show progressed, national ratings were still behind Hall (whose show was also syndicated).

The number received around 150,000 calls and the charge for calling it made between $40-$50,000, which was donated to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation. Miller said he was touched by the outpouring and said he had only expected at most 20,000 calls.<ref name=Hastings/> Also during the final week, he took on a sharper edge that, to some reviewers, such as Phil Rosenthal, showed \"just how much unfulfilled promise the show held for the same viewers who love NBC's ''Late Night With David Letterman'' or even [[Comedy Central]]'s cult favorite ''[[Night After Night with Allan Havey]]''.\" He jokingly looked into the camera and begged CBS Entertainment president Jeff Sagansky for a job; he had [[Julia Sweeney]] appear as her androgynous SNL character Pat and serenade him mimicking [[Bette Midler]]'s song for the retiring Johnny Carson.

He also expressed some anger at Tribune for pulling the plug by July rather than fulfilling its commitment to him which was at least until September (a promise they had repeated as late as May).

The show's theme song was the [[Tears for Fears]] hit \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\", and included a snippet of the song \"Civilized\" by the [[Rollins Band]].\nThe show was taped at [[CBS Television City]] on the same stage where ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' is taped. It utilized a small set and sparse lighting, and there was no band. It comprised mainly Miller, speaking to the largely-unseen studio audience, on a darkened stage.\n\nMiller hosted one guest per show, with whom he would discuss the topic of the day. Early on, guests were all interviewed live via satellite, but soon most appeared live in the studio. There was also a call-in segment. The number was originally given as 1-800-LACTOSE. Later, he referred to it only by its numeric equivalent (1-800-522-8673). Within the time available, Miller typically could accommodate only two or three calls. He gradually eliminated call-ins in the last few seasons of the show.\n\nMiller and his writing staff won five [[Emmy Award]]s during the show's run, which aired 215 episodes over nine years.

By the close of the 1999 season, they were looking to make the fourth change in as many years.<ref name=SI/> By the end of the 1999 NFL season, ''Monday Night Football'' had its ratings decline for the fifth season in a row. In an effort to turn things around, ABC fired [[Boomer Esiason]] who had been on the show for two years.

He had grown up watching the 1970s championship Steelers and was an avid watcher of the NFL draft. He had even inquired about an announcing job with Fox after they had acquired rights to show [[Fox NFL|NFL games in 1994]].<ref name=SI/> Michaels later told an interviewer, \"It was way beyond what we expected. I had no idea that he knew as much about football as he did. He made points that other analysts we brought in never made, and his points were more salient, more interesting, and better stated. He was giving his riff, analyzing the plays and providing the humor. Amazing would not be an overstatement. Then I thought, Maybe he's shooting his wad here, and that's all we're going to get. But he kept going. Hell, it was almost perfect. Don and I looked at each other and said, 'Wow. Where did this come from?'.\"<ref name=SI/>\n\nABC told Sports Illustrated about the three-month process Ohlmeyer went through, including going through hundreds of tapes, slimming down to 40 candidates, and conducting 20 auditions (which included Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells, Steve Young, and John Elway).<ref name=SI/> ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that ESPN's [[Sterling Sharpe]] appeared to have been ABC's first choice but he had refused to return phone calls to ABC.<ref name=Edge/> Ohlmeyer had considered Miller early in the process, more as offering a rant segment within the broadcast, but he began to think of him in an expanded role.<ref name=SI/>\n\nBy late June 2000, it was announced that Miller had beaten out [[Rush Limbaugh]] and [[Tony Kornheiser]] (among others) for a job as [[color commentator]] on ABC's ''Monday Night Football''.<ref name=eonline>{{cite web |last=Armstrong |first=Mark |url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html |title=Dennis Miller Takes 'Monday Night' Pigskin|publisher=[[E!]]|date=June 22, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html|archivedate=February 21, 2003}}</ref><ref name=Edge/> The L.A.

Guests included fellow comedians and ''SNL'' alumni (such as [[Dana Carvey]] and [[Jon Lovitz]]), pundits and authors such as [[Ann Coulter]], [[Aaron Klein]] and [[Mark Steyn]] (while the show's guest list leaned [[right-wing|right of center]], there were several liberals who appeared on the show, such as [[Dennis Kucinich]] and [[Alan Dershowitz]]), Presidential candidates, several sports commentators, and some \"regulars\" like columnists and conservatives [[Debra Saunders]], [[Charles Krauthammer]], [[Victor Davis Hanson]], [[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], [[William Kristol|Bill Kristol]], and [[Jerome Corsi]] along with entertainers such as singer [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]] and actor [[Orson Bean]]. Miller generally took calls every hour, and in addition to comments about culture and politics, Miller encouraged humorous callers and often commented on their comedic delivery. A segment on Fridays was set aside for \"Dennis [[Deus Ex Machina|Ex Machina]]\", his term for a segment without a guest, where he allowed phone calls on any topic.\n\nIn a 2007 interview Miller said he felt that his radio show of all his work best represented his actual unvarnished views, saying \"This time, if I'm fired, they will be firing the real Dennis Miller.\"<ref name=IR>{{cite web|work=Illinois Review|date=July 31, 2007|title=After 30 Years, the Real Dennis Miller|url=http://illinoisreview.typepad.com/illinoisreview/2007/07/after-30-years-.html}}</ref>\n\nAccording to ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'', as of spring 2011, Miller's show had an estimated 2,250,000 weekly listeners.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Top Talk Radio Audiences |year=2011 |work=[[Talkers Magazine]] |url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209101821/http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ |archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref> Miller and [[Dial Global]] signed an agreement in early 2012 to continue his show for three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rbr.com/dennis-miller-re-ups-with-dial-global/|title=Dennis Miller re-ups with Dial-Global|work=Radio & Television Business Report|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref> Miller ended the radio show after his contract expired on March 27, 2015.<ref name=radioinsight>[http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92131/dennis-miller-to-end-syndicated-show/ \"Dennis Miller To End Syndicated Show\"] from Radio Insight (February 27, 2015)</ref>\n\n===Other endeavors===\nMiller periodically performs stand-up at the Orleans Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas. In recent appearances, he has done a mix of his old and new material, with some political jokes as well.\n\nHe has authored four books based on his stand-up comedy and television monologues: ''The Rants'' (1996), ''Ranting Again'' (1999), ''I Rant, Therefore I Am'' (2000), and ''The Rant Zone'' (2001).\n\nMiller has appeared in several films, in both comedic and non-comedic roles. His movie credits include ''[[Madhouse (1990 film)|Madhouse]]'', ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'', ''[[The Net (1995 film)|The Net]]'', ''[[Never Talk to Strangers]]'', ''[[Bordello of Blood]]'', ''[[What Happens in Vegas]]'' and ''[[Murder at 1600]]''. He played the [[Howard Stern]]-like talk-radio host Zander Kelly in ''[[Joe Dirt]]'' (2001) and appeared as himself in ''[[Thank You for Smoking (film)|Thank You for Smoking]]'' (2006).\n\nMiller guest hosted the [[Slammy Award]]s episode of [[WWE Raw]] on December 14, 2009.\n\n==Comedic style==\nMiller has a laid-back style (for example, calling people \"babe\" or \"cat\") and an acerbic, brooding sense of humor. His specialty is the rant, which typically begin with \"Now, I don't want to get off on a rant here, but...\" and end with \"...of course, that's just my opinion. I could be wrong.\"\n\nMiller listed his comedic influences for ''The New York Times'' as including \"[[Jonathan Miller]], [[Richard Pryor]], [[Richard Belzer]] and Mr. [Jay] Leno.\"<ref name=Joke/> When the ''Times'' asked him about the comedians [[Mort Sahl]] and [[Lenny Bruce]], to whom he is often compared, Miller stated that he had been impressed with transcripts of Sahl's early work but that as Sahl's career continued he became too tied to the [[Kennedy family]] and became a \"savage name-dropper,\" which diminished him in Miller's eyes, and served as an example for him to avoid. Miller had no respect for Bruce, telling the ''Times'', \"Lenny was a heroin addict, and I couldn't care less about heroin addicts. Once I hear a guy is a heroin addict, and they tell me he's a genius, I think, 'Really?' I'm not trying to be judgmental. But anybody whose last vision is of a tile pattern on a bathroom floor, I don't know what kind of genius they are.\"<ref name=Joke/>\n\nDescribing his career Miller stated, \"It's all been built on arcane references, precision of language, and a reasonably imperturbable nature on TV. The basics are there, but I've been getting paid, making a living and having fun with it for next to 25 years, and you know that blows my mind that I've stuck with it. That's my favorite part of showbiz, hangin' in, knowing that something good is coming along. ... When I was starting, I thought I'd have to have a sword-in-the-stone moment of inspiration where I'd have to lay around for it to be visited on me. ''SNL'' was just a machine, and if you screwed two or three 'Updates' up, guess what, they have someone new and ready to go. So I learned how to pick up any newspaper and have five usable jokes in five minutes. \"I don't ever wanna get self-important. I'm a comedian, and I want everyone in my life to know it. The stream-of-consciousness style is my monkey trick. I sit there, I watch stuff, and cultural references bump into my head. I watched a lot of TV when I was a kid.\"<ref name=Carl/>\n\nMiller has referred to his casual stage-style as \"quasi-[[Dean Martin]] insouciance.\"<ref name=SI/> When asked if he's accepted others' title of him as \"the 'intelligent' comedian,\" he replied, \"The smartest thing I ever did was not buying into the fact that people thought I was smart. I was telling jokes about where I named the robot maid for [[The Jetsons]]. It's just a joke. I just did jokes. I never had my head up my ass that I mattered. I\u2019m trying to get laughs. ... I'm OK [intelligence-wise]. I remember I had a writer once who told me\u2014and we disagreed about everything, so I know he didn't think I was smart\u2014but he said, 'I'll give you this. You have a deep drawer and a nice retrieval system.' I always thought that was a good appraisal of whatever limited comedy gift I had. I have a pretty good memory for pop arcana and a pretty quick retrieval system.\"<ref name=Tulsa/>\n\n==Personal life==\nMiller married Carolyn \"Ali\" Espley,<ref>Reliable sources spell her name variously as \"Espley\" or \"Epsley.\" In the closing credits of ''Mr. Miller Goes to Washington'', she is listed as \"Ali Espley\".</ref> a former model from [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada, on April 24, 1988. Espley is best known as the girl in [[Kajagoogoo]]'s 1983 \"[[Too Shy]]\" music video. The couple live in [[Santa Barbara, California]], and have two sons, Holden (born 1990) and Marlon (born 1993). His younger brother Jimmy Miller is a partner in the Hollywood management company Gold/Miller representing comedians such as [[Jim Carrey]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Judd Apatow]], and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].<ref name=Joke/>\n\n==Political views==\nAlthough in his early years of fame he was perceived to be a staunch [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and an outspoken critic of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], in recent years, Miller has become known for his [[Conservatism in the United States|neoconservative]] political opinions.<ref>{{cite web|author=Currie, Duncan|date=June 27, 2003|title=Dennis the Right-Wing Menace? | work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/nr_comment/nr_comment062703.asp|accessdate=February 27, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHe was a regular political commentator on [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' in a segment called \"Miller Time\", and previously appeared on the network's ''[[Hannity & Colmes]]'' in a segment called \"Real Free Speech.\"\n\n===Early outlook===\nWhen asked if his political outlook was a result of early influence by his parents, Miller told a reporter \"I didn't know my dad\u2014he moved out early. And my mom's politics were kind of hardscrabble. She didn't think about [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] or [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. She thought about who made sense. I've been both in my life. Somebody can say they don't understand why somebody drifts. But I've always found people who drift interesting, 'cause it shows me the game's not stagnant in their own head. They're thinking.\"<ref name=Winters/>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, Miller was generally perceived as a cynic on the [[Left-wing politics|left]], eager to bash conservative Republicans.\n\nMiller has said that he privately began to change his politics in 1992 when liberals made jokes about the poor performance [[Ross Perot]]'s running mate [[James Stockdale]] displayed during a televised debate. Stockdale was a decorated Vietnam prisoner of war, and Miller saw jokes about him as mockery. Miller would later comment, \"You know, Stockdale, we would have been blessed to have him as a President. I don't care if he's bad on TV. He was a hero and an icon. I saw people on the left go, 'Who's this old guy who's bad on TV?'... If he's the problem, that's too hip a room for me. That's when I got out.\"<ref>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Richter|title=Dennis Miller: Liberal Mockery of Stockdale Made Me Conservative|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/Dennis-Miller-James-Stockdale-Ross-Perot-conservative/2014/06/04/id/575254/|website=[[Newsmax]]|publisher=[[Newsmax Media]]|location=Palm Beach, Florida|date=June 4, 2014|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that Miller was a member of the political left did not change much, even when Miller told ''[[USA Today]]'' in 1995: \"I might be profane and opinionated, but underneath all that are some pretty conservative feelings.

I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I don't like lockstep, even if it's lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here.

If two gay guys want to get married, it's none of my business. I could care less. More power to them. I'm happy when people fall in love. But if some idiot foreign terrorist wants to blow up their wedding to make a political statement, I would rather kill him before he can do it, or have my country kill him before he can do it, instead of having him do it and punishing him after the fact. If that makes me a right-wing fanatic, I will bask in that assignation. ... I think abortion's wrong, but it's none of my business to tell somebody what's wrong. So I'm pro-choice. I want to keep my nose out of other people's personal business. I guess I fall into conservative when it comes to protecting the United States in a world where a lot of people hate the United States. ... [After 9/11] everybody should be in the protection business now. I can't imagine anybody not saying that. Well, I guess on the farthest end of the left they'd say, 'That's our fault.' And on the middle end they'd say, 'Well, there's another way to deal with it other than flat-out protecting ourselves.' I just don't believe that. People say we're the ones who make them hate us because of what we do. That's garbage to me. I think they're nuts.

I don't think about any of that. I go on ''O\u2019Reilly'' once a week, I do my radio show and I go on the road about 20 dates a year. I've winnowed my crowd down to a select few who can support me.

In 2003 Miller told an interviewer that he was impressed by Bush for pursuing \"the liquidation of terrorism,\" even though \"that's not gonna be finished in his lifetime... But to take the first step?

He has made frequent appearances on conservative talk radio; he does weekly political commentary for ''Hannity & Colmes'', a Fox News Channel talk show.\"<ref name=Eyeing/>\n\nIn 2003, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' called Miller \"the loudest pro-Bush/pro-war voice in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]\",<ref name=WS/> and quoted his comment on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' from February of that year. Miller advocated invading Iraq, and vented his displeasure at France's lack of support for the idea, saying, \"I say we invade Iraq and then invade [[Jacques Chirac|Chirac]]. You run a pipe\u2014you run a pipe from the oil field right over this [[Eiffel Tower]], shoot it up and have the world's biggest oil derrick. ...

Elverum & Sun. It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded it using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died. A departure from Elverum's previous work, ''A Crow Looked at Me'' features minimal production and sparse instrumentation alongside lyrics that tell of Castr\u00e9e's illness and death, and Elverum's ensuing grief.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous year-end lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple decade-end lists. Some critics found that due to the album's personal nature, reviewing it felt difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron, all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

Elverum & Sun. It is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded it using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died. A departure from Elverum's previous work, ''A Crow Looked at Me'' features minimal production and sparse instrumentation alongside lyrics that tell of Castr\u00e9e's illness and death, and Elverum's ensuing grief.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous year-end lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple decade-end lists. Some critics found that due to the album's personal nature, reviewing it felt difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|left|250x250px|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron, all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.
