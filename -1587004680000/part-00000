game|Single-player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] (on some systems)\n}}\n\n'''''Lemmings''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] video game originally developed by [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland and published by [[SCE Studio Liverpool|Psygnosis]] for the [[Amiga]] in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by [[Russell Kay (game designer)|Russell Kay]], [[Mike Dailly (game designer)|Mike Dailly]] and [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with [[Deluxe Paint]].\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] [[lemming]]s through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\n''Lemmings'' was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'', and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' in 1996. ''Lemmings'' is also one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] and [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]], and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several [[sequel]]s, [[Video game remake|remake]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, and has also inspired similar games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Amiga Lemmings.png|thumb|left|Lemmings cross a bridge and tunnel through a rock formation in the Amiga version.|alt=Lemmings building a bridge over a chasm and excavating a tunnel through a rock formation.]]\n\n''Lemmings'' is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories.<ref name=spectrum/> Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.<ref name=fox/> Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.<ref name=ysr/>\n\nThe goal is to guide at least a certain percentage of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use.<ref name=\"manual\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130221101311/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archivedate=21 February 2013 |title=Lemmings |work=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if they hit an obstacle they cannot pass.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130130162231/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1& |archivedate=30 January 2013 |title=Addictive as Chips, but Less Fattening |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |first=Charles |last=Herold |url-status=dead }}</ref> A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from a great height, falling into water or lava, disappearing off the top, bottom or side of the level map, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill. Every level has a time limit; if the clock counts down to zero, the level automatically ends.\n\nTo successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> There are eight skills that can be assigned:<ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Atari | title=Lemmings Instruction Manual (Atari Lynx) (C398105-080 Rev. A) | pages=5\u20137 | publisher=Atari }}</ref> Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.<ref name=spectrum/>\n\nWhile the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers.<ref name=spectrum/> This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nThe four difficulty groups \u2013 \"Fun\", \"Tricky\", \"Taxing\" and \"Mayhem\" \u2013 are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty.<ref name=gs/> This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.\n\n===Two-player mode===\n[[Image:SNES Lemmings2Player.png|thumb|In two-player mode, each player can only control lemmings of their own colour but attempt to guide any lemming to their own goal.]]\n\nThe original ''Lemmings'' also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a [[joystick]] simultaneously.<ref name=\"history\"/> Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\nMike Dailly, the first employee<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> of [[DMA Design]] and one of the programmers for ''Lemmings'', provided a detailed history of the development of the game entitled \"The Lemmings Story\" in 2006.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm |first=Mike |last=Dailly |title=The Complete History of Lemmings |year=2006 |work=The Complete History of Lemmings |accessdate= 10 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627001229/http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm|archivedate=27 June 2015}}</ref> [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of ''Lemmings''.<ref name=\"jones recount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120526225205/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Playing Catch Up: GTA/Lemmings' Dave Jones |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Alistair |last=Wallis |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lemming animation.gif|left|thumb|The original ''Lemmings'' walk-cycle sprite animations from Mike Dailly (left) and Gary Timmons' improved version on the right. The animation was done using an 8\u00d710 pixel space, with Timmons' version showing a less stiff walk cycle. The animation has eight frames and takes 0.8 seconds to complete one cycle.]]\n\nThe inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in an 8\u00d78 pixel box created by Dailly using [[Deluxe Paint]]<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> as part of development for ''[[Walker (video game)|Walker]]'', then envisioned as a sequel to ''[[Blood Money (video game)|Blood Money]]''.<ref name=\"history\"/> Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that \"There's a game in that!\", and later coined the term \"lemmings\" for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a ''[[Salamander (video game)|Salamander]]'' weapon concept for ''Blood Money'' and demonstrated with the animations.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nLevels were designed based on a [[Deluxe Paint]] interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in \"hundreds of levels\".<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones \"used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\" They also sent internally tested levels to [[Psygnosis]], getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that \"Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\"<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nEach of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as \"It's Hero Time\", suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles, and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the \"custom\" levels based on other Psygnosis and [[Reflections Interactive]] Amiga games, including ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'', ''[[Awesome (video game)|Awesome]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Beast II]]''. These \"crossover\" levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, \"This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve.\" Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Music}}Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright.

[[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]]\n| modes = [[Single-player video game|Single-player]], [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] (on some systems)\n}}\n\n'''''Lemmings''''' is a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] video game originally developed by [[DMA Design]] in [[Dundee]], Scotland and published by [[SCE Studio Liverpool|Psygnosis]] for the [[Amiga]] in 1991 and later ported for numerous other platforms. The game was programmed by [[Russell Kay (game designer)|Russell Kay]], [[Mike Dailly (game designer)|Mike Dailly]] and [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with [[Deluxe Paint]].\n\nThe objective of the game is to guide a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] [[lemming]]s through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. To save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behaviour of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.\n\n''Lemmings'' was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second-highest-rated game in the history of ''[[Amstrad Action]]'', and was considered the eighth-greatest game of all time by ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' in 1996. ''Lemmings'' is also one of the most widely [[Porting|ported]] and [[List of best-selling video games|best-selling video games]], and is estimated to have sold around 20 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several [[sequel]]s, [[Video game remake|remake]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s, and has also inspired similar games.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Amiga Lemmings.png|thumb|left|Lemmings cross a bridge and tunnel through a rock formation in the Amiga version.|alt=Lemmings building a bridge over a chasm and excavating a tunnel through a rock formation.]]\n\n''Lemmings'' is divided into a number of levels, grouped into four difficulty categories.<ref name=spectrum/> Each level begins with one or more trap doors opening from above, releasing a steady line of lemmings who all follow each other.<ref name=fox/> Levels include a variety of obstacles that prevent lemmings from reaching the exit, such as large drops, booby traps and pools of lava.<ref name=ysr/>\n\nThe goal is to guide at least a certain percentage of the green-haired, blue-robed lemmings from the entrance to the exit by clearing or creating a safe passage through the landscape for the lemmings to use.<ref name=\"manual\"/><ref name=\"eurogamer review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130221101311/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_lemmings_psp |archivedate=21 February 2013 |title=Lemmings |work=[[Eurogamer]] |first=Tom |last=Bramwell |date=7 March 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Unless assigned a special task, each lemming will walk in one direction ignoring any other lemming in its way (except Blockers), falling off any edges and turning around if they hit an obstacle they cannot pass.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130130162231/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/29/technology/29game.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2&ei=5070&en=9b11a61802a7c4f8&ex=1152244800&emc=eta1& |archivedate=30 January 2013 |title=Addictive as Chips, but Less Fattening |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=29 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |first=Charles |last=Herold |url-status=dead }}</ref> A lemming can die in a number of ways: falling from a great height, falling into water or lava, disappearing off the top, bottom or side of the level map, being caught in a trap or fire, or being assigned the Bomber skill. Every level has a time limit; if the clock counts down to zero, the level automatically ends.\n\nTo successfully complete the level, the player must assign specific skills to certain lemmings. Which skills and how many uses of each are available to the player varies from level to level, and the player must assign the skills carefully to successfully guide the lemmings.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> There are eight skills that can be assigned:<ref name=\"manual\">{{cite book | year=1993 | editor=Atari | title=Lemmings Instruction Manual (Atari Lynx) (C398105-080 Rev. A) | pages=5\u20137 | publisher=Atari }}</ref> Climbers climb vertically though fall down if they hit an overhang. Floaters use a parachute to fall safely from heights. Bombers explode after a five-second timer, destroying themselves and any destructible landscape in close proximity, though not damaging other lemmings or traps. Blockers stand still and prevent other lemmings from passing; lemmings that hit a Blocker simply reverse direction. Builders build a stairway of 12 steps. Bashers, Miners and Diggers dig horizontally, diagonally downwards or directly downwards respectively.<ref name=spectrum/>\n\nWhile the player is able to pause the game to inspect the level and status of the lemmings, skills can only be assigned in real-time. Lemmings are initially released at a rate predetermined by the level (from 1 to 99). The player can increase the rate as desired to a maximum of 99, and later decrease it down to, but not lower than, the initial rate. The player also has the option to \"nuke\" all the remaining lemmings on the screen, converting them to Bombers.<ref name=spectrum/> This option can be used to abort a level when in a no-win situation, remove any Blockers that remain after the remaining lemmings have been rescued, or end a level quickly once the required percentage of saved lemmings has been reached.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\nThe four difficulty groups \u2013 \"Fun\", \"Tricky\", \"Taxing\" and \"Mayhem\" \u2013 are used to organise the levels to reflect their overall difficulty.<ref name=gs/> This rating reflects several factors, including the number of obstacles the player has to surpass, the limitation on the number of types of skills available to assign, the time limit, the minimum rate of lemming release, and the percentage of lemmings that must be saved.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> Some versions have additional difficulty ratings with more levels in each.\n\n===Two-player mode===\n[[Image:SNES Lemmings2Player.png|thumb|In two-player mode, each player can only control lemmings of their own colour but attempt to guide any lemming to their own goal.]]\n\nThe original ''Lemmings'' also has 20 two-player levels. This took advantage of the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a [[joystick]] simultaneously.<ref name=\"history\"/> Each player is presented with their own view of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.<ref name=\"manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\nMike Dailly, the first employee<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> of [[DMA Design]] and one of the programmers for ''Lemmings'', provided a detailed history of the development of the game entitled \"The Lemmings Story\" in 2006.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm |first=Mike |last=Dailly |title=The Complete History of Lemmings |year=2006 |work=The Complete History of Lemmings |accessdate= 10 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627001229/http://www.javalemmings.com/DMA/Lem_1.htm|archivedate=27 June 2015}}</ref> [[David Jones (video game developer)|David Jones]], founder of DMA Design, has also commented on the development and success of ''Lemmings''.<ref name=\"jones recount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120526225205/http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=12190 |archivedate=26 May 2012 |title=Playing Catch Up: GTA/Lemmings' Dave Jones |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |work=[[Gamasutra]] |first=Alistair |last=Wallis |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Lemming animation.gif|left|thumb|The original ''Lemmings'' walk-cycle sprite animations from Mike Dailly (left) and Gary Timmons' improved version on the right. The animation was done using an 8\u00d710 pixel space, with Timmons' version showing a less stiff walk cycle. The animation has eight frames and takes 0.8 seconds to complete one cycle.]]\n\nThe inspiration for gameplay came as a result of a simple animated character [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] in an 8\u00d78 pixel box created by Dailly using [[Deluxe Paint]]<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> as part of development for ''[[Walker (video game)|Walker]]'', then envisioned as a sequel to ''[[Blood Money (video game)|Blood Money]]''.<ref name=\"history\"/> Dailly was able to quickly produce an animated graphic showing his creations moving endlessly, with additional graphical improvements made by Gary Timmons and other members of the DMA Design team to help remove the stiffness in the animation. One member, Russell Kay, observed that \"There's a game in that!\", and later coined the term \"lemmings\" for these creations, according to Dailly. Allowing the creatures to move across the landscape was based on a ''[[Salamander (video game)|Salamander]]'' weapon concept for ''Blood Money'' and demonstrated with the animations.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nLevels were designed based on a [[Deluxe Paint]] interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in \"hundreds of levels\".<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones \"used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a finger at the screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and doing it in a much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it.\" They also sent internally tested levels to [[Psygnosis]], getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that \"Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside.\"<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nEach of the designers had a somewhat different style in their levels: Dailly's levels often had titles containing clues to what to do (such as \"It's Hero Time\", suggesting that one lemming had to be separated from the crowd) and generally required the player to perform several actions at once; Gary Timmons's levels were minimalistic, with popular culture references in the titles, and Scott Johnston's (whose mother was the first voice of the lemmings) levels were generally tightly packed. Dailly was also responsible for the \"custom\" levels based on other Psygnosis and [[Reflections Interactive]] Amiga games, including ''[[Shadow of the Beast]]'', ''[[Menace (video game)|Menace]]'', ''[[Awesome (video game)|Awesome]]'' and ''[[Shadow of the Beast II]]''. These \"crossover\" levels also used music from those games, though in ports these levels have been removed or altered to remove such references. After they developed most of the hard levels, they then created several simple levels either by copying the existing ones or creating new layouts; as Dailly states, \"This I believe is where many games fall down today, they do not spend the time making a good learning curve.\" Timmons is credited with the official drawings of the lemmings, as necessitated by the need of Psygnosis for box cover artwork.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Music}}Music was originally created by Brian Johnston (Scott's younger brother), who [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] bits of copyrighted music. This had been common practice, but at that point there was a growing awareness of music copyright. Psygnosis asked [[Tim Wright (Welsh musician)|Tim Wright]] to replace the offending tracks, who often used arrangements and reworkings of [[Classical music|classical]] and [[Traditional music|traditional]] music to avoid copyright problems.<ref name=\"history\" /> Music tracks in the game include: \"Galop Infernal\" from ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' (the music by [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]] often used for the [[can-can]]), \"Rondo alla Turca\" from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|Piano Sonata No. 11]], \"Dance of the Reed Flutes\" from [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s [[Nutcracker Suite]], \"[[Danse des petits cygnes|Dance of the Little Swans]]\" from Tchaikovsky's [[Swan Lake]], \"Ten Lemmings\" (a track that uses melodies from traditional song \"[[Ten Green Bottles]]\", [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata No. 2]] (the part used as funeral march), [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s \"[[Bridal Chorus]]\" (popularly known as \"Here Comes the Bride\"), \"[[London Bridge is Falling Down]]\", the English folk tune \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem|Forest Green]]\" (adapted into the hymn \"All Beautiful the March of Days\"), the carol \"[[O Little Town of Bethlehem]]\" mixed with the melody from the film ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]'', \"[[She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain]]\", and \"[[(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?]]\".<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nThe two-player option was inspired by then-current games ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' and ''[[Stunt Car Racer]]''. DMA Design initially wanted to use a [[null modem|null-modem]] connection between two machines to allow competitive play, but ended up using the ability of the Amiga to have two mouse pointer devices usable at the same time and thus created the split-screen mode.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Ports and remakes==\nThe popularity of the game on the Amiga led to its rapid [[porting]] to many other platforms, and it is regarded as one of the most widely ported video games.<ref name=\"jones recount\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerelectronicsnet.com/games/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46303 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20141210075052/http://www.consumerelectronicsnet.com/games/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=46303 |archivedate=10 December 2014 |title=Lemmings PSP Review |work=Consumer Electronics Net |first=Don |last=Lee |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=10 December 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Within a year of its release, the game had been ported to [[Atari ST]], [[ZX Spectrum|Sinclair Spectrum]], [[IBM PC compatible|PC]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]].<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> David Jones stated that after porting the game to 20 systems, he stopped keeping count of additional ports.<ref name=\"jones recount\"/> Other commercial ports of the original game include [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[Acorn Archimedes]], [[Apple IIgs]], [[Apple Macintosh]], [[CDTV]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]], [[Sega Master System]] and [[Sega Mega Drive|Genesis]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[Philips CD-i]] and [[Sharp X68000]].<ref name=fox>{{cite book|last=Fox |first=Matt |date=3 January 2013 |title=The Video Games Guide: 1,000+ Arcade, Console and Computer Games, 1962-2012, 2d ed. |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA169 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]] |page=169 |isbn=978-0786472574 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230011/https://books.google.com.au/books?id=xzMYYrsDaAEC&pg=PA169 |archivedate=2 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe license to the ''Lemmings'' intellectual property had remained with Psygnosis, which became part of [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in 1993 but ultimately folded in 2012, leaving ''Lemmings'' as a Sony property.

The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and an [[eco-terrorist]] group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose the [[Shinra Electric Power Company]], a powerful [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time action]] with [[Strategy video game|strategic]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

While the game has more real-time elements, strategic elements still remain, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\nCloud Strife is a former first-class SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the metropolis city of Midgar. Shinra drains spiritual energy called mako from the planet, using massive reactors, in order to power Midgar and develop new technologies. Disillusioned with Shinra, Cloud joins Avalanche as a mercenary, an eco-terrorist organization led by the temperamental Barret Wallace. Cloud and Avalanche bomb a mako reactor, and the resulting explosion results in heavy collateral damage. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories and hallucinations of Sephiroth, an enigmatic former high-ranking SOLDIER, and meets the flower peddler Aerith Gainsborough. Cloud also fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures with Avalanche and becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart who is herself involved with the terrorists.\n\nAfter bombing a second reactor with Avalanche, Cloud is unwillingly separated from his group. He meets Aerith again, who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is revealed to be the last descendant of the ancients, the original stewards of the planet who have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for their own gains. Cloud escorts Aerith back to her home and invites him to stay for the night, but her mother secretly requests that he stay away from Aerith. Cloud leaves, but Aerith sneaks out and follows him to take him back to Sector 7. Upon accepting her help, Cloud inexplicably [[Aerith Gainsborough#Death|sheds a single tear]]. At the entrance to Sector 7, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled in city. They pursue and reunite with Tifa, who is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. \n\nAfter infiltrating his organization, Don Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. The slums suffer severe casualties, including several members of Avalanche, and Aerith is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the destruction of the slum, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to the same. After rescuing Aerith, the group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, being held captive by Shinra's scientist Hojo. Red XIII explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny is not altered, and they will use their power to correct deviations, even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile, Sephiroth steals the mysterious Jenova experiment, thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients, from Shinra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra, and also impales Barret, but the Whispers heal Barret. The president's son Rufus becomes the new de facto leader of the company. Meanwhile, the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Highway. At the end of the highway the characters meet a Sephiroth implied to be from a different timeline or universe. Sephiroth opens a portal and enters it. Aerith alters the portal, stating that they will fight for freedom from their destiny. The group enters the portal and battles a large Whisper which appears to be a deity controlling destiny. After defeating the Whisper, the group battles the Sephiroth that made the portal. Later Cloud finds himself alone with Sephiroth, and Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him. When Cloud refuses, Sephiroth departs, leaving with cryptic messages. It appears that Cloud is then able to alter the past, [[Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core|saving the life of Zack Fair]]. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that the Sephiroth from their own world is a threat to the planet as well, and commit to defeating him. The entire conclusion of the game is presented in an overall ambiguous way.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision.

game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]]. The game is a [[Video game remake|remake]] of the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]].'' Square Enix developed the remake as a multi-part series, with the first entry released for the [[PlayStation 4]] on April 10, 2020, with timed exclusivity for one year.\n\nPlayers control mercenary [[Cloud Strife]] as he and an [[eco-terrorist]] group known as [[AVALANCHE]] oppose the [[Shinra Electric Power Company]], a powerful [[megacorporation]], from using the planet's life essence as an energy source. The gameplay combines [[Turns, rounds and time-keeping systems in games#Real-time|real-time action]] with [[Strategy video game|strategic]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.\n\n''Remake'' was announced in 2015 following years of fan requests and rumors. Several key staff members returned, including character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] as director and main character designer, director [[Yoshinori Kitase]] as producer, writer [[Kazushige Nojima]], and music composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' retells [[Final Fantasy VII#Plot|the story of the original ''Final Fantasy VII'']]. Players control [[Cloud Strife]], a former Shinra soldier turned mercenary who joins the [[eco-terrorist]] group AVALANCHE to fight the Shinra Corporation, who have been draining the planet's life energy. The game is a full [[Video game remake|remake]] with real-time polygonal graphics, as opposed to the [[Pre-rendering|pre-rendered]] environments of the original.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n\nExploration and battle mechanics both take place in real-time, like ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]''. The game features an altered \"[[Active Time Battle]]\" (ATB) system from the original, which gradually fills up slowly, or can fill faster with attacks. Once it is filled, the player can halt the action and use special abilities such as magic, items, and special moves. The player can also assign these special abilities to shortcut buttons, allowing them to play entirely in real-time without pausing. Each special ability uses up a segment of the ATB bar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake still has ATB \u2026 kinda |url=https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |accessdate=June 12, 2019 |work=[[VentureBeat]] |date=June 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617105924/https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-still-has-atb-kinda/ |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The player can also switch between party members at any time.

While the game has more real-time elements, strategic elements still remain, such as selecting weapons and magic for each character to wield.<ref name=\"VIIRover1\"/><ref name=\"VIIRover2\"/>\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==Plot==\nCloud Strife is a former first-class SOLDIER, the elite warriors of the Shinra Electric Power Company which rules the metropolis city of Midgar. Shinra drains spiritual energy called mako from the planet, using massive reactors, in order to power Midgar and develop new technologies. Disillusioned with Shinra, Cloud joins Avalanche as a mercenary, an eco-terrorist organization led by the temperamental Barret Wallace. Cloud and Avalanche bomb a mako reactor, and the resulting explosion results in heavy collateral damage. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories and hallucinations of Sephiroth, an enigmatic former high-ranking SOLDIER, and meets the flower peddler Aerith Gainsborough. Cloud also fights off strange ghost-like hooded creatures with Avalanche and becomes reacquainted with his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart who is herself involved with the terrorists.\n\nAfter bombing a second reactor with Avalanche, Cloud is unwillingly separated from his group. He meets Aerith again, who is being chased by Shinra. Aerith is revealed to be the last descendant of the ancients, the original stewards of the planet who have magical powers. Shinra believes they can use her power for their own gains. Cloud escorts Aerith back to her home and invites him to stay for the night, but her mother secretly requests that he stay away from Aerith. Cloud leaves, but Aerith sneaks out and follows him to take him back to Sector 7. Upon accepting her help, Cloud inexplicably [[Aerith Gainsborough#Death|sheds a single tear]]. At the entrance to Sector 7, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, [[Kowloon Walled City |a lawless walled in city]]. They pursue and reunite with Tifa, who is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. \n\nAfter infiltrating his organization, Don Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. The slums suffer severe casualties, including several members of Avalanche, and Aerith is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the destruction of the slum, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she is subjected to the same. After rescuing Aerith, the group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, being held captive by Shinra's scientist Hojo. Red XIII explains that the strange ghost-like hooded creatures the group has been fighting are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny is not altered, and they will use their power to correct deviations, even if it means bringing someone back from the dead. Meanwhile, Sephiroth steals the mysterious Jenova experiment, thought to be connected to the extinction of the ancients, from Shinra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra, and also impales Barret, but the Whispers heal Barret. The president's son Rufus becomes the new de facto leader of the company. Meanwhile, the building becomes engulfed in Whispers. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Highway. At the end of the highway the characters meet a Sephiroth implied to be from a different timeline or universe. Sephiroth opens a portal and enters it. Aerith alters the portal, stating that they will fight for freedom from their destiny. The group enters the portal and battles a large Whisper which appears to be a deity controlling destiny. After defeating the Whisper, the group battles the Sephiroth that made the portal. Later Cloud finds himself alone with Sephiroth, and Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him. When Cloud refuses, Sephiroth departs, leaving with cryptic messages. It appears that Cloud is then able to alter the past, [[Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core|saving the life of Zack Fair]]. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that the Sephiroth from their own world is a threat to the planet as well, and commit to defeating him. The entire conclusion of the game is presented in an overall ambiguous way.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> The game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> It features newly arranged and orchestrated tracks from the original game, in addition to original material such as \"Hollow\", a theme song by Uematsu.<ref name=\"Music\"/> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" />\n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n==Release==\nRumors of a ''Final Fantasy VII'' remake appeared in 2014.<ref name=\"RemakeRumor\"/> It was announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015|2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) during the [[PlayStation]] conference, and received a standing ovation.<ref name=\"GSremake\"/><ref name=\"4Govation\"/> [[Visual Works]] created the announcement trailer.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\" /> Square Enix's stock prices rose to their highest rating since November 2008, and the [[YouTube]] release of the reveal trailer garnered over 10 million views in the following two weeks.<ref name=\"IGNstocks\" /><ref name=\"VIIRtrailer\" /> The game was next showcased at the 2015 PlayStation Experience, demonstrating cutscenes and gameplay from the opening sequence.<ref name=\"WiredPSE\"/>\n\nDuring the Final Fantasy 30th anniversary [[opening ceremony]] event hosted by Square Enix in [[Tokyo]] on January 31, 2017 \u2014 the 20th anniversary of ''Final Fantasy VII''\u2014 the game's first piece of CGI key art was unveiled, along with announcements for a collaboration event with ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GamaAnniversary\"/> On February 18, Nomura revealed two screenshots, showing off the updated [[HUD (video gaming)|HUD]].<ref name=\"Magic2017showing\"/> Due to its lack of footage since 2015, switch to internal development, and other projects Nomura was involved in, there were concerns about the status of the project. Speaking following E3 2018, Nomura stated that the game was in development, with his full attention shifted to it when ''Kingdom Hearts III'' was completed.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/><ref name=\"Nomura2018b\"/>\n\nAfter years without substantial footage, a teaser trailer was shown during PlayStation's May 2019 State of Play broadcast. Kitase announced that the team had wanted to \"try something new\" on the State of Play broadcast by showing the trailer.<ref name=\"RemakeSoP\"/> The release date, March 3, 2020, was revealed the following month in a second teaser trailer during an orchestral concert dedicated to the [[Music of the Final Fantasy VII series|music of ''Final Fantasy VII'']] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"2020REL\"/> Further release details were announced at the company's [[E3 2019]] press conference, including different editions of ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeFirstInfo\"/> Kitase later clarified at the event that Square Enix had yet to determine the number of games in the ''Remake'' series, adding that they were in the process of planning the second installment.<ref name=\"RemakeScale\"/>\n\nAn extended gameplay showcase and demo was playable at E3 2019, demonstrating parts of the opening mission, including some of the exploration, combat system, and first boss battle.

And if they didn't like it, when they looked at their phones they could just click something else; ... we are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button.\"\n\n\"So when you're [busking] on the street, .. to command [your] attention, people would be like: 'again! again!' .. 'more! more!' .. or they would just leave. So if you replace [the lyric]: 'dance for me, dance for me' with 'sing for me, sing for me,' it's pretty literal,\" she said.<ref>https://www.novafm.com.au/show/smallzys-surgery/tones-and-i-explains-how-she-went-busker-festival-performer-within-year/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was produced by Visible Studios, directed by Liam Kelly and Nick Kozakis and released on 24 June 2019.<ref name=\"Dance Monkey video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q|title=Tones and I \u2013 Dance Monkey (Official Video)|via=YouTube|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> The video follows \"Mr. Tones\" ([[Tones and I]]), an elderly man who sneaks out of his home to have a dance party at a golf course with other senior citizens.

It has since peaked at number 4 on the chart.\n\n==Lyrics==\nWhen interviewed by DJ Smallzy in July 2019 on Australian radio station Nova FM, Tones explained that the song's lyrics are about the relationship she had with her audience when she was [[busking]] on the streets of Australia:\n\n\"I wrote this song when I was busking, and about the pressure that I felt to always be entertaining people on the street. And if they didn't like it, when they looked at their phones they could just click something else; ... we are all so used to being entertained at the click of a button.\"\n\n\"So when you're [busking] on the street, .. to command [your] attention, people would be like: 'again! again!' .. 'more! more!' .. or they would just leave. So if you replace [the lyric]: 'dance for me, dance for me' with 'sing for me, sing for me,' it's pretty literal,\" she said.<ref>https://www.novafm.com.au/show/smallzys-surgery/tones-and-i-explains-how-she-went-busker-festival-performer-within-year/</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video was produced by Visible Studios, directed by Liam Kelly and Nick Kozakis and released on 24 June 2019.<ref name=\"Dance Monkey video\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0hyYWKXF0Q|title=Tones and I \u2013 Dance Monkey (Official Video)|via=YouTube|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=20 July 2019}}</ref> The video follows \"Mr. Tones\" ([[Tones and I]]), an elderly man who sneaks out of his home to have a dance party at a golf course with other senior citizens.
