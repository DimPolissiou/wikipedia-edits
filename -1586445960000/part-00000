They were developed by [[Intratec]], an [[United States|American]] [[subsidiary]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] firearms manufacturer Interdynamic AB. Introduced in 1985, the TEC-9 was made of inexpensive molded [[polymer]]s and a mixture of stamped and milled steel parts, and the simple design of the gun made it easy to repair and modify. The TEC-9 developed a negative reputation for its association with [[organized crime]], [[Gangs in the United States|street gangs]] and [[mass shootings]] in the 1990s, most notably used during the [[101 California Street shooting]] and the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. However, it was a commercial success, and over 250,000 were sold.\n\n== History ==\n[[Interdynamic AB]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[firearms]] manufacturer based in [[Stockholm]], designed the [[Interdynamic MP-9]], intended as an inexpensive [[9mm]] [[submachine gun]] based on the [[Carl Gustav M/45]] for military applications. Interdynamic did not find a government buyer, so the weapon was taken to the [[United States]] domestic market as an [[open-bolt]] [[semi-automatic pistol]], but the design was deemed too easy to convert to [[Automatic weapon|an  automatic weapon]]. Due to this, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) forced Interdynamic to redesign the firearm into a [[closed-bolt]] system, which was harder to convert to automatic weapon. This variant was called the KG-99, and was popularized when it made frequent appearances on the popular television show ''[[Miami Vice]]'', where it was legally converted to full auto by [[Special Occupational Taxpayers|Title II manufacturers]].<ref name=\"Muramatsu2012\">{{cite book|last=Muramatsu|first=Kevin |title=The Gun Digest Book of Automatic Pistols Assembly/Disassembly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAjzU4WjeLoC&pg=PA361|accessdate=10 July 2013|date=18 July 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3006-6|pages=361\u2013369}}</ref><ref name=\"BrownAbel2010\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Harry Brown|author2=Daniel G.

This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition, and if a heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. Later versions of the TEC-9 and AB-10 had a [[Threading (manufacturing)|threaded]] upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver, solving the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.\n\n=== Reputation and legislation ===\nFollowing the 1989 [[Cleveland School massacre]], the TEC-9 was placed on [[California]]'s list of banned weapons. To circumvent this, Intratec rebranded a variant of the TEC-9 as a '''TEC-DC9''' from 1990 to 1994 (''DC'' standing for \"'''D'''esigned for '''C'''alifornia\").

They were developed by [[Intratec]], an [[United States|American]] [[subsidiary]] of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] firearms manufacturer Interdynamic AB. Introduced in 1985, the TEC-9 was made of inexpensive molded [[polymer]]s and a mixture of stamped and milled steel parts, and the simple design of the gun made it easy to repair and modify. The TEC-9 developed a negative reputation for its association with [[organized crime]], [[Gangs in the United States|street gangs]] and [[mass shootings]] in the 1990s, most notably used during the [[101 California Street shooting]] and the [[Columbine High School massacre]]. However, it was a commercial success, and over 250,000 were sold.\n\n== History ==\n[[Interdynamic AB]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[firearms]] manufacturer based in [[Stockholm]], designed the [[Interdynamic MP-9]], intended as an inexpensive [[9mm]] [[submachine gun]] based on the [[Carl Gustav M/45]] for military applications. Interdynamic did not find a government buyer, so the weapon was taken to the [[United States]] domestic market as an [[open-bolt]] [[semi-automatic pistol]], but the design was deemed too easy to convert to [[Automatic weapon|an  automatic weapon]]. Due to this, the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) forced Interdynamic to redesign the firearm into a [[closed-bolt]] system, which was harder to convert to automatic weapon. This variant was called the KG-99, and was popularized when it made frequent appearances on the popular television show ''[[Miami Vice]]'', where it was legally converted to full auto by [[Special Occupational Taxpayers|Title II manufacturers]].<ref name=\"Muramatsu2012\">{{cite book|last=Muramatsu|first=Kevin |title=The Gun Digest Book of Automatic Pistols Assembly/Disassembly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAjzU4WjeLoC&pg=PA361|accessdate=10 July 2013|date=18 July 2012|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-3006-6|pages=361\u2013369}}</ref><ref name=\"BrownAbel2010\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Harry Brown|author2=Daniel G.

This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition, and if a heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. Later versions of the TEC-9 and AB-10 had a [[Threading (manufacturing)|threaded]] upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver, solving the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.\n\n=== Reputation and legislation ===\nFollowing the 1989 [[Cleveland School massacre]], the TEC-9 was placed on [[California]]'s list of banned weapons. To circumvent this, Intratec rebranded a variant of the TEC-9 as a '''TEC-DC9''' from 1990 to 1994 (''DC'' standing for \"'''D'''esigned for '''C'''alifornia\"). The most noticeable external difference between the TEC-9 and the later TEC-DC9 is that rings to hold the sling were moved from the side of the gun with the cocking handle to a removable stamped metal clip in the back of the gun.

In the Middle Ages they had been [[Border Reivers]] based in [[Redesdale]]. The main family line had seats at [[Mitford Castle]] and [[Mitford Old Manor House]] prior to building [[Mitford Hall]] in 1828.\n\n==Mitford siblings==\n[[Nancy Mitford]] (28 November 1904 \u2013 30 June 1973) married Peter Rodd and had a longstanding relationship with French politician and statesman [[Gaston Palewski]]. She lived in France for much of her adult life. She wrote many novels, including the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Pursuit of Love]]'' and ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]''. She was also a biographer of historical figures, including the [[Sun King]].\n\n[[Pamela Mitford]] (25 November 1907 \u2013 12 April 1994) was known as \"Woman\".{{fact|date=March 2019}} She married and divorced millionaire physicist [[Derek Jackson (physicist)|Derek Jackson]]. [[John Betjeman]], who for a time was in love with her, referred to her as the \"Rural Mitford\". After her divorce, she spent the remainder of her life as the companion of Giuditta Tommasi (died 1993), an Italian horsewoman.<ref>Charlotte Mosley, editor, ''The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters'', London: Fourth Estate, 2007, p. 264. According to her sister Jessica, Pamela Mitford had become \"a you-know-what-bian\" [lesbian], although that was not taken literally.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas David Freeman-Mitford|Thomas (Tom) Mitford]] (2 January 1909 \u2013 30 March 1945) was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was a close friend of [[James Lees-Milne]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1212641/The-National-Trust-bed-hopper-persuaded-aristocrats-slept--women-men--leave-homes-nation.html The National Trust bed-hopper who persuaded aristocrats he slept with&mdash;women AND men&mdash;to leave their homes to the nation], Matthew Wilson, ''Daily Mail'', 11 September 2009</ref> He had a lengthy affair with [[Tilly Losch]] during her marriage to [[Edward James]]. He died during [[World War II]] while stationed in [[Myanmar|Burma]]. According to Jessica's letters, he supported British fascism and was posted to Burma after refusing to fight in Europe.<ref name=jeslets/>\n\n[[Diana Mitford]] (17 June 1910 \u2013 11 August 2003) married aristocrat and writer [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Walter Guinness]] in 1929. She left him in 1933 for British fascist leader [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], with whom she had two sons, Alexander and [[Max Mosley]]. She was interned in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway Prison]] during the Second World War. She remained a devotee of fascism and Adolf Hitler.\n\n[[Unity Mitford|Unity Valkyrie Mitford]] (8 August 1914 \u2013 28 May 1948) was known as \"Bobo\" or \"Boud\" to her siblings. Her adulation of, and friendship with, [[Adolf Hitler]] was widely publicised. She shot herself in the head days after Britain declared war on Germany,<ref name=jeslets/> but failed to kill herself and eventually died of [[Pneumococcal infection|pneumococcal meningitis]] at West Highland Cottage Hospital, Oban, after being transferred from [[Inch Kenneth]].\n\n[[Jessica Mitford]] (11 September 1917 \u2013 22 July 1996) was known as \"Decca\". She eloped with [[Esmond Romilly]] to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. She spent most of her adult life in the United States. Two years after Esmond was killed during the [[Second World War]], she married [[Robert Treuhaft]], whom she met as a fellow US government employee. She was a member of the [[American Communist Party]] until 1958. She wrote several volumes of memoirs and several volumes of polemical investigation, including the best-selling ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' (1963) about the funeral industry. She was the grandmother of [[James Forman Jr.]] and Chaka Forman, sons of the African-American [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] leader [[James Forman]] by her daughter Constancia Romilly.\n\n[[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]] (31 March 1920 \u2013 24 September 2014) married [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|Andrew Cavendish]] who became the Duke of Devonshire, and with him turned his ancestral home, [[Chatsworth House]], into one of Britain's most successful stately homes. She wrote a dozen books.\n\n==Mitford sisters==\n[[Image:Mitford sisters.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=Nearly full-length group portrait of five well-dressed women standing in a field.

Two wear pearls.|Jessica, Nancy, Diana, Unity, and Pamela Mitford in 1935. Of the six sisters, the youngest, Deborah, is absent.]]\nThe sisters gained widespread attention for their stylish and controversial lives as young people, and for their public political divisions between communism and fascism. [[Nancy Mitford|Nancy]] and [[Jessica Mitford|Jessica]] became well-known writers: Nancy wrote ''[[The Pursuit of Love]]'' and ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]'', and Jessica ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' (1963). Deborah managed one of the most successful [[stately homes]] in England, [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]]. \n\nJessica and Deborah married nephews of prime ministers [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]], respectively. Deborah and [[Diana Mitford|Diana]] both married wealthy aristocrats. [[Unity Mitford|Unity]] and Diana were well known during the 1930s for being close to [[Adolf Hitler]]. Jessica turned her back on her inherited privileges and ran away to become a communist.<ref>''Boadilla'' by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press Limited, London, 2018 {{ISBN|978-1999654306}}</ref> Jessica's memoir, ''[[Hons and Rebels]]'', describes their upbringing, and Nancy obviously drew upon her family members for characters in her novels. In the early 1980s, Deborah became politically active when she and her husband [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire]], joined the new [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].\n\nThe sisters and their brother Thomas were the children of [[David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale|David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale]], known to his children as \"Farve\" and by various other nicknames. Their mother was Sydney Freeman-Mitford, Baroness Redesdale, known as \"Muv\", the daughter of [[Thomas Gibson Bowles|Thomas Bowles]]. David and Sydney married in 1904. The family homes changed from Batsford House to [[Asthall Manor]] beside the [[River Windrush]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and then Swinbrook Cottage nearby, with a house at Rutland Gate in London.<ref>26 Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge, SW7 > Notable Abodes |http://www.notableabodes.com/abode-search-results/abode-details/139176/26-rutland-gate-knightsbridge-london</ref> They also lived in a cottage in [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]], which they used as a summer residence.<ref name=thisislondon>[http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/1189.print/ Mitford Girls at 'This Is Local London' 2001]. Retrieved 14 December 2013</ref> The siblings grew up in an aristocratic [[country house]] with emotionally distant parents and a large household with numerous servants; this family dynamic was not unusual for upper-class families of the time. The parents disregarded formal education of women of the family, and they were expected to marry at a young age to a financially well-off husband. The children had a private language called \"Boudledidge\" (pronounced \"bowdledidge\"), and each had a different nickname for the others.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, their political views came into sharper relief. \"Farve\" remained a conservative, but \"Muv\" usually supported her fascist daughters, and the couple separated in the late 1940s. Nancy, a moderate socialist, worked in London during [[the Blitz]]. Pamela remained seemingly non-political, although she was reportedly an [[antisemitic|anti-Semite]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nancy Mitford spied on sisters |first=Paul |last=Reynolds |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3263733.stm |work=BBC News |date=14 November 2003 |accessdate=25 November 2010 }}</ref> Tom, a fascist, refused to fight [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] but volunteered to fight against [[Imperial Japan]]; he was [[killed in action]] a short time after arriving in Asia. Diana, married to [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]], was imprisoned in London for three years under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. Unity, distraught over the war declaration against Germany, tried to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head. She suffered brain damage that eventually led to her early death. Jessica, a communist supporter, had moved to the US, but her husband [[Esmond Romilly]] volunteered for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]]. He died when his bomber developed mechanical problems over the North Sea and went down.<ref name=jeslets>{{cite book |last1=Mitford |first1=Jessica |authorlink1=Jessica Mitford |editor1-first=Peter Y. |editor1-last=Sussman |title=[[Decca: The Letters of Jessica Mitford]] |year=2006 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |location= }}</ref> In numerous letters Jessica said  that her daughter received a pension from the Canadian government from Esmond's death until she turned 18.<ref name=jeslets/> The political rift between Jessica and Diana left them estranged until their deaths. The other sisters kept in frequent contact. The sisters were prolific letter-writers, and a substantial body of correspondence still exists, principally letters between them.<ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\"/>\n\n==The Mitfords in popular culture==\nNancy Mitford's 1949 novel, ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]'', which was based on the family, was serialised by [[Thames Television]] in 1980 and by the [[BBC]] in 2001.\n\nThe daughters were the subject of a 1981 musical, ''The Mitford Girls,'' by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]], and of a song, \"The Mitford Sisters\", by [[Luke Haines]].\n\nA fictional family based on the Mitford sisters features prominently in [[Jo Walton]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Ha'penny (novel)|Ha'penny]]''; Viola Lark, one of the point-of-view characters, is one of the sisters, another is married to [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], and a third is a [[Soviet Union|Communist]] spy.\n\nThe fictional \"Combe sisters\" in the [[BBC 2]] series ''[[Bellamy's People]]'', first broadcast in 2010, bear a striking resemblance to the Mitford sisters. Bellamy meets two of the surviving Combe sisters, said to have been notorious in the 1930s and '40s for their extreme political views, now living together in a strained relationship in the dramatically different political realities of 2010. One an avid fascist and the other a committed Communist, the sisters have hit upon the solution of dividing their stately home down the middle, each converting her side into an homage to her ideology.\n\n[[Sharon Horgan]], [[Samantha Spiro]], and [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] played a version of the Mitford Sisters in a song-based sketch for Season 2 of the [[Sky Arts]] comedy series ''[[Psychobitches]]'', in the winter of 2014.\n\nIn his [[Jean_d%27Ormesson#Bibliography|French language trilogy of novels]] - ''Le Vent du soir'' (1985), ''Tous les hommes en sont fous'' (1985), and ''Le Bonheur \u00e0 San Miniato'' (1987) - [[Jean d'Ormesson]] recounts a much-imagined version of the exploits of four of the Mitford sisters, through the characters Pandora, Vanessa, Atalanta, and Jessica.\n\nA portion of Jessica Mitford's writing is used as a spoken-word introduction to the song \"Last Act of Defiance\", about the [[New Mexico State Penitentiary riot]], on thrash metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]]'s 1989 album ''[[Fabulous Disaster]]''.\n\n[[Jessica Fellowes]] has written two mystery novels, ''The Mitford Murders'' (2017) and ''Bright Young Dead'' (2018), which feature the older sisters, Nancy and Pamela, as major characters, and the rest of the family in supporting roles.\n\n==Gallery==\nThe Mitford sisters by [[William Acton (painter)|William Acton]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Nancy Mitford.jpg|[[Nancy Mitford]] (1904\u20131973)\nFile:Pamela Mitford.jpg|[[Pamela Mitford]] (1907\u20131994)\nFile:Diana Mitford by William Acton.jpg|[[Diana Mitford]] (1910\u20132003)\nFile:Unity Mitford by William Acton.jpg|[[Unity Mitford]] (1914\u20131948)\nFile:Jessica Mitford, by William Acton.jpg|[[Jessica Mitford]] (1917\u20131996)\nFile:Deborah Mitford.jpg|[[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]] (1920\u20132014)\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n:1.{{note|a}}Daughter of [[Thomas Gibson Bowles]].\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of the Mitford siblings\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.

She lived in France for much of her adult life. She wrote many novels, including the semi-autobiographical ''[[The Pursuit of Love]]'' and ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]''. She was also a biographer of historical figures, including the [[Sun King]].\n\n[[Pamela Mitford]] (25 November 1907 \u2013 12 April 1994) was known as \"Woman\".{{fact|date=March 2019}} She married and divorced millionaire physicist [[Derek Jackson (physicist)|Derek Jackson]]. [[John Betjeman]], who for a time was in love with her, referred to her as the \"Rural Mitford\". After her divorce, she spent the remainder of her life as the companion of Giuditta Tommasi (died 1993), an Italian horsewoman.<ref>Charlotte Mosley, editor, ''The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters'', London: Fourth Estate, 2007, p. 264. According to her sister Jessica, Pamela Mitford had become \"a you-know-what-bian\" [lesbian], although that was not taken literally.</ref>\n\n[[Thomas David Freeman-Mitford|Thomas (Tom) Mitford]] (2 January 1909 \u2013 30 March 1945) was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was a close friend of [[James Lees-Milne]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1212641/The-National-Trust-bed-hopper-persuaded-aristocrats-slept--women-men--leave-homes-nation.html The National Trust bed-hopper who persuaded aristocrats he slept with&mdash;women AND men&mdash;to leave their homes to the nation], Matthew Wilson, ''Daily Mail'', 11 September 2009</ref> He had a lengthy affair with [[Tilly Losch]] during her marriage to [[Edward James]]. He died during [[World War II]] while stationed in [[Myanmar|Burma]]. According to Jessica's letters, he supported British fascism and was posted to Burma after refusing to fight in Europe.<ref name=jeslets/>\n\n[[Diana Mitford]] (17 June 1910 \u2013 11 August 2003) married aristocrat and writer [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Walter Guinness]] in 1929. She left him in 1933 for British fascist leader [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]], with whom she had a son, [[Max Mosley]]. She was interned in [[Holloway (HM Prison)|Holloway Prison]] during the Second World War. She remained a devotee of fascism and Adolf Hitler.\n\n[[Unity Mitford|Unity Valkyrie Mitford]] (8 August 1914 \u2013 28 May 1948) was known as \"Bobo\" or \"Boud\" to her siblings. Her adulation of, and friendship with, [[Adolf Hitler]] was widely publicised. She shot herself in the head days after Britain declared war on Germany,<ref name=jeslets/> but failed to kill herself and eventually died of [[Pneumococcal infection|pneumococcal meningitis]] at West Highland Cottage Hospital, Oban, after being transferred from [[Inch Kenneth]].\n\n[[Jessica Mitford]] (11 September 1917 \u2013 22 July 1996) was known as \"Decca\". She eloped with [[Esmond Romilly]] to the [[Spanish Civil War]]. She spent most of her adult life in the United States. Two years after Esmond was killed during the [[Second World War]], she married [[Robert Treuhaft]], whom she met as a fellow US government employee. She was a member of the [[American Communist Party]] until 1958. She wrote several volumes of memoirs and several volumes of polemical investigation, including the best-selling ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' (1963) about the funeral industry. She was the grandmother of [[James Forman Jr.]] and Chaka Forman, sons of the African-American [[Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] leader [[James Forman]] by her daughter Constancia Romilly.\n\n[[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]] (31 March 1920 \u2013 24 September 2014) married [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire|Andrew Cavendish]] who became the Duke of Devonshire, and with him turned his ancestral home, [[Chatsworth House]], into one of Britain's most successful stately homes. She wrote a dozen books.\n\n==Mitford sisters==\n[[Image:Mitford sisters.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.1|alt=Nearly full-length group portrait of five well-dressed women standing in a field.

Two wear pearls.|Jessica, Nancy, Diana, Unity, and Pamela Mitford in 1935. Of the six sisters, the youngest, Deborah, is absent.]]\nThe sisters gained widespread attention for their stylish and controversial lives as young people, and for their public political divisions between communism and fascism. [[Nancy Mitford|Nancy]] and [[Jessica Mitford|Jessica]] became well-known writers: Nancy wrote ''[[The Pursuit of Love]]'' and ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]'', and Jessica ''[[The American Way of Death]]'' (1963). Deborah managed one of the most successful [[stately homes]] in England, [[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]]. \n\nJessica and Deborah married nephews of prime ministers [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Harold Macmillan]], respectively. Deborah and [[Diana Mitford|Diana]] both married wealthy aristocrats. [[Unity Mitford|Unity]] and Diana were well known during the 1930s for being close to [[Adolf Hitler]]. Jessica turned her back on her inherited privileges and ran away to become a communist.<ref>''Boadilla'' by Esmond Romilly, The Clapton Press Limited, London, 2018 {{ISBN|978-1999654306}}</ref> Jessica's memoir, ''[[Hons and Rebels]]'', describes their upbringing, and Nancy obviously drew upon her family members for characters in her novels. In the early 1980s, Deborah became politically active when she and her husband [[Andrew Cavendish, 11th Duke of Devonshire]], joined the new [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]].\n\nThe sisters and their brother Thomas were the children of [[David Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale|David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, 2nd Baron Redesdale]], known to his children as \"Farve\" and by various other nicknames. Their mother was Sydney Freeman-Mitford, Baroness Redesdale, known as \"Muv\", the daughter of [[Thomas Gibson Bowles|Thomas Bowles]]. David and Sydney married in 1904. The family homes changed from Batsford House to [[Asthall Manor]] beside the [[River Windrush]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and then Swinbrook Cottage nearby, with a house at Rutland Gate in London.<ref>26 Rutland Gate, Knightsbridge, SW7 > Notable Abodes |http://www.notableabodes.com/abode-search-results/abode-details/139176/26-rutland-gate-knightsbridge-london</ref> They also lived in a cottage in [[High Wycombe]], [[Buckinghamshire]], which they used as a summer residence.<ref name=thisislondon>[http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/1189.print/ Mitford Girls at 'This Is Local London' 2001]. Retrieved 14 December 2013</ref> The siblings grew up in an aristocratic [[country house]] with emotionally distant parents and a large household with numerous servants; this family dynamic was not unusual for upper-class families of the time. The parents disregarded formal education of women of the family, and they were expected to marry at a young age to a financially well-off husband. The children had a private language called \"Boudledidge\" (pronounced \"bowdledidge\"), and each had a different nickname for the others.\n\nOn the outbreak of the Second World War, their political views came into sharper relief. \"Farve\" remained a conservative, but \"Muv\" usually supported her fascist daughters, and the couple separated in the late 1940s. Nancy, a moderate socialist, worked in London during [[the Blitz]]. Pamela remained seemingly non-political, although she was reportedly an [[antisemitic|anti-Semite]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nancy Mitford spied on sisters |first=Paul |last=Reynolds |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3263733.stm |work=BBC News |date=14 November 2003 |accessdate=25 November 2010 }}</ref> Tom, a fascist, refused to fight [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] but volunteered to fight against [[Imperial Japan]]; he was [[killed in action]] a short time after arriving in Asia. Diana, married to [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]], was imprisoned in London for three years under [[Defence Regulation 18B]]. Unity, distraught over the war declaration against Germany, tried to commit suicide by shooting herself in the head. She suffered brain damage that eventually led to her early death. Jessica, a communist supporter, had moved to the US, but her husband [[Esmond Romilly]] volunteered for the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].

The other sisters kept in frequent contact. The sisters were prolific letter-writers, and a substantial body of correspondence still exists, principally letters between them.<ref name=\"timesonline.co.uk\"/>\n\n==The Mitfords in popular culture==\nNancy Mitford's 1949 novel, ''[[Love in a Cold Climate]]'', which was based on the family, was serialised by [[Thames Television]] in 1980 and by the [[BBC]] in 2001.\n\nThe daughters were the subject of a 1981 musical, ''The Mitford Girls,'' by [[Caryl Brahms]] and [[Ned Sherrin]], and of a song, \"The Mitford Sisters\", by [[Luke Haines]].\n\nA fictional family based on the Mitford sisters features prominently in [[Jo Walton]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Ha'penny (novel)|Ha'penny]]''; Viola Lark, one of the point-of-view characters, is one of the sisters, another is married to [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]], and a third is a [[Soviet Union|Communist]] spy.\n\nThe fictional \"Combe sisters\" in the [[BBC 2]] series ''[[Bellamy's People]]'', first broadcast in 2010, bear a striking resemblance to the Mitford sisters. Bellamy meets two of the surviving Combe sisters, said to have been notorious in the 1930s and '40s for their extreme political views, now living together in a strained relationship in the dramatically different political realities of 2010. One an avid fascist and the other a committed Communist, the sisters have hit upon the solution of dividing their stately home down the middle, each converting her side into an homage to her ideology.\n\n[[Sharon Horgan]], [[Samantha Spiro]], and [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] played a version of the Mitford Sisters in a song-based sketch for Season 2 of the [[Sky Arts]] comedy series ''[[Psychobitches]]'', in the winter of 2014.\n\nIn his [[Jean_d%27Ormesson#Bibliography|French language trilogy of novels]] - ''Le Vent du soir'' (1985), ''Tous les hommes en sont fous'' (1985), and ''Le Bonheur \u00e0 San Miniato'' (1987) - [[Jean d'Ormesson]] recounts a much-imagined version of the exploits of four of the Mitford sisters, through the characters Pandora, Vanessa, Atalanta, and Jessica.\n\nA portion of Jessica Mitford's writing is used as a spoken-word introduction to the song \"Last Act of Defiance\", about the [[New Mexico State Penitentiary riot]], on thrash metal band [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]]'s 1989 album ''[[Fabulous Disaster]]''.\n\n[[Jessica Fellowes]] has written two mystery novels, ''The Mitford Murders'' (2017) and ''Bright Young Dead'' (2018), which feature the older sisters, Nancy and Pamela, as major characters, and the rest of the family in supporting roles.\n\n==Gallery==\nThe Mitford sisters by [[William Acton (painter)|William Acton]]\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Nancy Mitford.jpg|[[Nancy Mitford]] (1904\u20131973)\nFile:Pamela Mitford.jpg|[[Pamela Mitford]] (1907\u20131994)\nFile:Diana Mitford by William Acton.jpg|[[Diana Mitford]] (1910\u20132003)\nFile:Unity Mitford by William Acton.jpg|[[Unity Mitford]] (1914\u20131948)\nFile:Jessica Mitford, by William Acton.jpg|[[Jessica Mitford]] (1917\u20131996)\nFile:Deborah Mitford.jpg|[[Deborah Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Deborah Mitford]] (1920\u20132014)\n\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n:1.{{note|a}}Daughter of [[Thomas Gibson Bowles]].\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of the Mitford siblings\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1= 1.
