Soo Ae began her career on television, but after her breakout role in ''[[A Family (2004 film)|A Family]]'' (2004), she became best known as a leading actress in film, notably in ''[[Sunny (2008 film)|Sunny]]'' (2008) and ''[[Midnight FM]]'' (2010). She also appeared in the popular television melodramas ''[[Emperor of the Sea]]'' (2004), ''[[A Thousand Days' Promise]]'' (2011), ''[[Queen of Ambition]]'' (2013) and ''[[Mask (2015 TV series)|Mask]]'' (2015). In 2016, she made her romantic-comedy drama comeback in KBS2's ''[[Sweet Stranger and Me]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===Pre-debut===\nSoo Ae nearly became a member of a [[K-pop]] [[Korean pop idol|idol]] group. Fresh out of high school, a record agent approached the young stunner on the street in the trendy [[Apgujeong]] area. She spent six months in grueling practice, but in the end had no album to put out. She reminisced in an interview, \"I didn't sing well, but the six months I spent with the team was so fun. I was lucky to get into acting.\"<ref name=boorish>[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/08/17/2007081761009.html \"Soo Ae Sheds Refined Image for Boorish New Role\"].

Soo Ae in reality was known for her a husky, neutral voice, which helped her tomboyish performance feel so natural. But her voice wasn't always a plus. She said, \"I've been told many times that my voice would be a detriment to my career. When I first got started, a lot of viewers posted comments online that they changed the channel because of the way I talk. [...] It was odd because I thought of my husky voice as my biggest asset.

Soo Ae began her career on television, but after her breakout role in ''[[A Family (2004 film)|A Family]]'' (2004), she became best known as a leading actress in film, notably in ''[[Sunny (2008 film)|Sunny]]'' (2008) and ''[[Midnight FM]]'' (2010). She also appeared in the popular television melodramas ''[[Emperor of the Sea]]'' (2004), ''[[A Thousand Days' Promise]]'' (2011), ''[[Queen of Ambition]]'' (2013) and ''[[Mask (2015 TV series)|Mask]]'' (2015). In 2016, she made her romantic-comedy drama comeback in KBS2's ''[[Sweet Stranger and Me]]''.\n\n==Career==\n===Pre-debut===\nSoo Ae nearly became a member of a [[K-pop]] [[Korean pop idol|idol]] group. Fresh out of high school, a record agent approached the young stunner on the street in the trendy [[Apgujeong]] area. She spent six months in grueling practice, but in the end had no album to put out. She reminisced in an interview, \"I didn't sing well, but the six months I spent with the team was so fun. I was lucky to get into acting.\"<ref name=boorish>[http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2007/08/17/2007081761009.html \"Soo Ae Sheds Refined Image for Boorish New Role\"].

Soo Ae in reality was known for her a husky, neutral voice, which helped her tomboyish performance feel so natural. But her voice wasn't always a plus. She said, \"I've been told many times that my voice would be a detriment to my career. When I first got started, a lot of viewers posted comments online that they changed the channel because of the way I talk. [...] It was odd because I thought of my husky voice as my biggest asset.

She said she decided to challenge herself by choosing the role of a strong female character fighting against a villain.
