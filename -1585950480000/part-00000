Three years later, he finally participates in his first ever volleyball match in junior high, but his first match is against Tobio Kageyama, a genius volleyball player known as \"King of the Court\". Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place. He calls Hinata useless and tries to prove up with continual blocks against him. However Hinata manages to score some points with his speed and route alterations. In the end Kageyama easily advances 3-0 and Hinata vows revenge.\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Karasuno High School Volleyball Team\n| TranslitTitle       = Karasuno k\u014dk\u014d haiky\u016bbu\n| NativeTitle         = \u70cf\u91ce\u9ad8\u6821\u6392\u7403\u90e8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = K\u014dichi Kikuta\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2014|4|13}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hinata arrives at his new school Karasuno High School (The same school where \"The Little Giant\" used to attend) determined to join the volleyball club and defeat Kageyama.

The two personalities clash, and later when the captain Daichi Sawamura arrives he throws the two out and tells them they can't join the club until they start to get along. A few days pass and the two get envious.

Three years later, he finally participates in his first ever volleyball match in junior high, but his first match is against Tobio Kageyama, a genius volleyball player known as \"King of the Court\". Kageyama is recognized nationally as one of the best setters, but he pushes his teammates harder than any of them think should take place. He calls Hinata useless and tries to prove up with continual blocks against him. However Hinata manages to score some points with his speed and route alterations. In the end Kageyama easily advances 3-0 and Hinata vows revenge.\n}}{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Karasuno High School Volleyball Team\n| TranslitTitle       = Karasuno k\u014dk\u014d haiky\u016bbu\n| NativeTitle         = \u70cf\u91ce\u9ad8\u6821\u6392\u7403\u90e8\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy          = K\u014dichi Kikuta\n| WrittenBy           = Taku Kishimoto\n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2014|4|13}}\n| ShortSummary        = Hinata arrives at his new school Karasuno High School (The same school where \"The Little Giant\" used to attend) determined to join the volleyball club and defeat Kageyama.

Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_easternlands/> He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He was intentionally vague about the size of the ''Ice and Fire'' world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/> A new map artist was used in ''A Dance with Dragons'' so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/>\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012 as ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' ({{ISBN|978-0345538543}}). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled \"The Known World\", \"The West\", \"Central Essos\", \"The East\", \"Westeros\", \"Beyond The Wall\", \"The Free Cities\", \"Slaver's Bay\", \"The Dothraki Sea\", \"King's Landing\", \"Braavos\", and \"Journeys\".

The continent is home to the '''Seven Kingdoms''', also known as \"the Realm\" or the \"Sunset Kingdom\", located to the south side of [[#The Wall|the Wall]], a massive man-made ice wall (allegedly fused with magic) 700 feet in height and spanning east\u2013west for 300 miles from coast to coast.  The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called \"[[#The North|North]]\" and \"South\" by a [[swamp]]-rich [[isthmus]] called '''the Neck'''.  The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk (being roughly the size of [[Canada]]) of Westeros, but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the [[ice field]] region north and west of a massive [[mountain range]] called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of [[human settlement]]s.<ref group=S name=HBOYouTubeWildlings/><ref group=S name=newyorker/>  The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although it is thought to be continuous with a [[polar ice cap]] north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of one king of the Targaryen dynasty, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history,<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> in particular the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sffworld/>\n\nThe first inhabitants of the continent were the [[Children of the Forest]], a nature-worshipping [[stone age]] anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in [[weirwood]] trees.  Some time later, [[bronze age]] human settlers, known as the First Men, migrated from Essos via a [[land bridge]] at the southeastern end of the continent and gradually spread to the entire continent.  The First Men's attempts at chopping down forests and cultivating the land led to a millennia-long war with the Children of the Forest, that eventually was settled by an agreement known as \"The Pact\".  This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes, during which the First Men adopted the religion of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Old Gods|Old Gods]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran VII, pp. 737\u2013739}}\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}} an enigmatic arctic humanoid species called the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] emerged from the Land of Always Winter, the northernmost part of Westeros, during the decades-long winter known as \"The Long Night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}  The Children of the Forest and the First Men allied to repel the Others, and then built the Wall barring passage from the far north.  The region north of the Wall was since collectively known as the land \"Beyond the Wall\", and settled by tribal First Men descendants known as the Wildlings or Free Folks.\n\n{{anchor|Seven Kingdoms|7 Kingdoms|7 kingdoms}}\nSometime later, the [[iron age]] humans from Essos called the Andals invaded Westeros, bring along the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Faith of the Seven|Faith of the Seven]].  One by one, First Men kingdoms south of the Neck fell to the Andals, and only the North remained unconquered.  The Children of the Forest was slaughtered and disappeared from Andal lands.  Over time, seven relatively stable feudal kingdoms were forged across Westeros, although their territories fluctuated over the next few thousand years through constant warfares, and no kingdom remained dominant for long:\n* The [[#The North|Kingdom of the North]], ruled by [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]\n* The [[#The Iron Islands|Kingdom of the Isles]] [[#The Riverlands|and the Rivers]], ruled by House Hoare of [[Harrenhal]]\n* The [[#The Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of Mountain and Vale]], ruled by [[House Arryn]] of [[The Eyrie]]\n* The [[#The Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], ruled by [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]\n* The [[#The Stormlands|Kingdom of the Storm]], ruled by House Durrandon of [[Storm's End]]\n* The [[#The Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]], ruled by House Gardener of [[Highgarden]]\n* The [[#Dorne|Principality of Dorne]], ruled by [[House Martell]] of [[Sunspear]].<ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat/>\n\nThree hundred years before the novels begin, the [[Targaryen]] dragonlord [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and his two [[consanguine marriage|sister-wives]] Visenya and Rhaenys, whose ancestors migrated from [[Valyria]] to [[#Dragonstone|Dragonstone]]{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} a century prior, invaded the Westerosi mainland and landed his army at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the Blackwater Rush.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  The three assembled a temporary [[bastion]] called \"Aegonfort\", which later grew into the a massive capital city known as [[#King's Landing|King's Landing]].{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  Aided by their three formidable [[fire-breathing]] [[dragon]]s, the Targaryen armies subdued six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, wiping out three of the seven ruling houses (Durrandon, Hoare and Gardener).

The TV adaptation used [[Iceland]] as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada{{snd}} [[Hudson Bay]] or the Canadian forests just north of [[Michigan]]. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into [[tundra]] and [[ice field]]s and it becomes more of an [[arctic]] environment. You have [[plain]]s on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the [[Himalayas]].\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada.<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the [[Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull]] [[Ice calving|calving]] [[glacier]] in [[Skaftafell]], Iceland, followed by shooting near [[Smyrlabj\u00f6rg]] and [[V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal]] on [[H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i]].

It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\n===The Riverlands===\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_strength\"/> areas surrounding the forks of the river [[Trident]] on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale, and the North<ref group=\"S\" name=\"hbo_viewersguide_map\"/> and lacking the natural defenses of other regions,<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Riverrunvmap\"/> they have seen frequent warfare.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Tullyvguide\"/> As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IX, p. 649}}\n\n====Harrenhal====\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black,<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed.<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a [[white elephant]]. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\n====Riverrun====\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of [[Robb Stark]]'s great victory over [[House Lannister]] and the site of his crowning. By the end of the ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', [[Brynden Tully]] surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.\n\n====The Twins====\nThe Twins is the seat of [[House Frey]], which has grown wealthy by charging a toll of all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, theirs is one of the most powerful houses sworn to [[House Tully]]. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre him, his mother, and his army (and in the TV adaptation, his wife): an event known as \"[[The Red Wedding]]\", which violates native customs of [[hospitality#Celtic cultures|guest right]] and incurs enmity throughout the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\n===The Vale of Arryn===\n[[File:Meteore.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, images of the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]] were used for the composite views of the Vale.]]\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====The Eyrie====\n[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The German [[Neuschwanstein Castle|castle of Neuschwanstein]], on which the Eyrie is based]]\nBased on the German castle of [[Neuschwanstein]],<ref group=S name=westeros.orgKepler/> the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant's Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the [[granary]] can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below.  [[Oxen]] are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells\", are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush [[velvet]] curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of ''Feast for Crows'', Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert \"Robin\" Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn's death.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Alayne, Chapter 41}}\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]]. Initially they had been considering the [[Wulingyuan|Zhangjiajie Mountains]] in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option.<ref group=S name=btlnews_bluebolt/> Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"<ref group=S name=aoltv_qa/>\n\n===The Westerlands===\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth.{{cn|date=April 2012}} As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Prologue, p. 12}}\n\n====Casterly Rock====\n[[File:Rock of Gibraltar northwest.jpg|thumb|Casterly Rock was inspired by the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] (pictured).]]\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of [[House Lannister]]. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] before the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] made one of her cousins [[castellan]] of the castle. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref group=S name=grrm_blog_080529/>\n\n===The Reach===\n[[File:Castillo de Almodovar (11801978016).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, which represented Highgarden in ''Game of Thrones'']]\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by [[House Tyrell]] from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven.{{cn|date=April 2012}} Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Oldtown====\n[[File:PHAROS2013-3000x2250.jpg|thumb|The Hightower of Oldtown bears similarities to the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (3D reconstruction pictured)]]\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive [[ziggurat|stepped lighthouse]] which extends some {{convert|800|ft}} into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the [[War of the Five Kings]], but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\n===The Stormlands===\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by [[House Baratheon]], bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Aegon joined the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=S name=westeros.orgStormlands/> Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, p. 161}}\n\n====Storm's End====\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others suggest that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|40|ft}} thick on its thinnest side, nearly {{convert|80|ft}} thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, [[barracks]], [[armory (military)|armory]] and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. [[Stannis Baratheon]], commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of ''A Dance with Dragons'' an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm's End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in [[Larrybane]], Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the [[Cushendun Caves]], also in Northern Ireland.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n===The Crownlands===\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\n====Dragonstone====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Downhill Strand]], [[County Londonderry]] was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone (left) and [[Gaztelugatxe]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain (right) stood in for Dragonstone in Season 7. |image1=Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 222956.jpg |image2=Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg}}\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of [[Valyria]]. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family moved to Dragonstone. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious [[gargoyle]]s to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis felt slighted because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros and condemned the queen's children as bastards born of [[incest]], as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of [[Downhill Strand]].<ref group=S name=utv_beach/> In [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|Season 7]] of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]] of Spain: the islet of [[Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Bermeo]], Itzurun Beach in [[Zumaia]], and Muriola Beach in [[Barrika]].<ref group=S name=TelegraphFilmingLocations/>\n\n====King's Landing====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Mdina]] in Malta (left) and [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia (right) stood in for King's Landing in the TV adaptation. |image1=Mdina, Malta - panoramio (18).jpg |image2=Dubrovnik from walls.JPG}}\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 1 million people, making it the most populous city in Westeros.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, p. 528}} It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the [[royal court]]. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on [[Perpetual stew|\"bowls of brown\"]], a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> It was inspired by the view of [[Staten Island]] from his childhood home in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].<ref group=S name=GRRMInterviewABCNews/>\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital [[Mdina]] to represent King's Landing.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland city{{snd}} so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the [[Mdina Gate|town gate]], which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives. Nearby [[Fort Manoel]] doubled as the great Sept of Baelor,\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> which can be seen when Ned Stark is executed. Various other locations around Malta represent the Red Keep, \"including the real-life residence of the president of Malta, [[San Anton Palace]].

As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, [[Tyrion Lannister]], as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Prince's Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin,<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> Dorne has the highest temperatures of any kingdom in Westeros, and is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including [[equal primogeniture]]. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling [[House Martell]] still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring{{cn|date=April 2012}} and given the surname Sand,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}} as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\nAccording to ''A Storm of Swords'', \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran\u2019s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}}\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], [[Seville, Spain]].\n\n==Summer Sea==\n====Basilisk Isles====\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for [[pirate]]s, [[slave trade|slaver]]s, [[sellsword]]s, and [[outlaw]]s. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\n====Naath====\nNaath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island off the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies west of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme pacifism, making music instead of war and refusing to eat meat, only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys' interpreter [[Missandei]] is from Naath.\n\n====Summer Islands {{anchor|Summer Islands|The Summer Islands}}====\nAs indicated on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'', the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} with a local fauna of talking birds,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 302}} apes,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}} and monkeys.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne III, p. 300}} The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}} They wear colored feathery clothes{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 294}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} and live on fruit and fish.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell V, p. 965}} From their port city named Tall Trees Town,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 121}} spices,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}} feathers,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 8}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Griffin Reborn, p. 801}} People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels ''swan ships'', \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u201375}} Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in ''A Feast for Crows'' aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in ''A Clash of Kings'', the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 238}}\n\n==Essos==\nPart of the narrative in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' lies across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of [[Eurasia]],<ref group=S name=ssm_geography/> Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of [[#Qohor|Qohor]], and extensive island chains such as [[#Braavos|Braavos]] and [[#Lys|Lys]]. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with a coastline along the Summer Sea and [[#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]]. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/>\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of [[House Targaryen]] before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as [[city-states]]. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\n===Free Cities and vicinity {{anchor|The Free Cities|Free Cities|Andalos|Rhoyne}}===\nAcross the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys I, pp. 30\u201331}} the books only provide a map of this region in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the [[#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]], though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria.{{cn|date=June 2012}} An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of [[Valyrian languages|High Valyrian]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}}\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 182}} Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, p. 436}} As mapped in ''A Dance with Dragons'', the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, pp. 187\u2013189}} The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}}\n\n====Braavos====\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon V, p. 447}} in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} Braavos is home to the 'Iron Bank', one of the wealthiest banks in the known world <ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-everything-to-know-about-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-2017-8#what-is-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-1</ref>.

Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of [[R'hllor]] is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], Spain.\n\n====Other Free Cities {{anchor|Lorath|Lys|Myr|Norvos|Qohor|Tyrosh|Volantis}}====\n* '''Lorath''' is a port city on a group of northern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The character [[Jaqen H'ghar]] poses as a Lorathi in ''A Clash of Kings'', wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}}\n* '''Lys''' sits astride a series of southern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Lysene have a tendency to be tall and fair of skin and eyes, unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys.{{cn|date=June 2012}} Dany's handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.\n* '''Myr''' is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate lace, and fine carpets. The dark eyed and dark skinned Myrmen are similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.\n* '''Norvos''' sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large bells, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-stucco villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.\n* '''Qohor''' is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor's city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor's defenders.\n* '''Tyrosh''', a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves and Tyroshi pear brandy. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.\n\n===Central Essos===\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in ''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings'' before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\n==== Valyria ====\nValyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundreds of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\n====Dothraki Sea {{anchor|The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea|Vaes Dothrak}}====\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their [[Dothraki language|own language]] and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal's consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\n\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of [[steppe]] and [[plains cultures]] ... [[Mongols]] and [[Huns]], certainly, but also [[Alans]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and various other [[Amerindian]] tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to [[Arabs]] or [[Turkish people|Turks]] is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [[Turkic peoples|[historic] Turks]] were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/> However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The dosh khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] of northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later [[Computer-generated imagery|C.G.I.ed]] on two pedestals erected on location.<ref group=S name=mogot_swarming/>\n\n====Lhazar====\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=}} The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in [[Malta]], at the farming town of [[Manikata]].<ref group=S name=magot_dothraki/>\n\n===Slaver's Bay {{anchor|Slaver's Bay|Slavers Bay|Slavers' Bay}}===\nSlaver's Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 329\u2013330}} The climate is very hot.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} After a first mention in ''A Game of Thrones'' in relation to slavery,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 667}} Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver's Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen in ''A Storm of Swords''.

Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes.

The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]], Morocco in the TV show.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Meereen====\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nFor the [[Game of Thrones|HBO television series]], many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the [[Fortress of Klis]], Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in [[Osuna]], Spain.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n=== Eastern Essos ===\n====Red Waste {{anchor|The Red Waste}}====\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in ''A Clash of Kings'' when Daenerys Targaryen and her ''khalasar'' crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\n====Qarth====\nFirst mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'',{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books.

The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many colors, including rose, violet, and [[umber]].

They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a ''jhat'', or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and ''jhats'' are mostly male. (Paraphrased from ''[[The World of Ice & Fire|The World of Ice and Fire]])''\n\n==Sothoryos {{anchor|Sothoryos|Sothoros|Sothyros}}==\nTo the south of Essos is the continent of Sothoryos{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} (mistakenly spelled Sothoros in early novels).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} Sothoryos is the third continent of the known world, and is vast, plague-ridden, covered in [[jungle]]s, and largely unexplored. It is reported to be as large as Essos and described as a \"land without end\" by Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.  \n\nThe continent is first named on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} The narrative itself first refers to the continent in ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as \"the southern continent, roughly equivalent to [[Africa]], jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_geographicalinformation/> The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in ''A Dance with Dragons'',{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} and [[teak]] from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} A corsair's road runs along the continent's northern coast.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} ''A Dance with Dragons'' refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion X, p. 628}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion XI, p. 756}} Victarion describes some people as \"squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros\",{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} and some people fighting in Daznak's Pit for Daenerys's entertainment in ''A Dance with Dragons'' are described as \"[[brindle]]-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys IX, p. 693}} Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n==Ulthos {{anchor|Ulthos}}==\nThe map collection ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' also shows the north tip of a landmass named \"Ulthos\" to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, \"Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world.

Each new book has added one or two maps so that, as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', seven maps of the fictional world are available in the books. Martin said in 2003 that complete world maps were not made available so that readers may better identify with people of the real Middle Ages who were uneducated about distant places.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He also did not \"subscribe to the theory put forth in ''[[The Tough Guide To Fantasyland]]'' ... that eventually the characters must visit every place shown on The Map.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_easternlands/> He conceded, however, that readers may be able to piece together a world map by the end of the series.<ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> He was intentionally vague about the size of the ''Ice and Fire'' world, omitting a scale on the maps to discourage prediction of travel lengths based on measured distances.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_consumerhelpweb/> A new map artist was used in ''A Dance with Dragons'' so that the maps are available in two versions by James Sinclair and Jeffrey L. Ward, depending on the book. The old maps were redone to match the style of the new ones.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/>\n\nA set of foldout maps was published on October 30, 2012 as ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' ({{ISBN|978-0345538543}}). The illustrator and cartographer Jonathan Roberts drew the maps, based on drafts by Martin. The twelve maps in the set are entitled \"The Known World\", \"The West\", \"Central Essos\", \"The East\", \"Westeros\", \"Beyond The Wall\", \"The Free Cities\", \"Slaver's Bay\", \"The Dothraki Sea\", \"King's Landing\", \"Braavos\", and \"Journeys\". The latter tracks the paths taken by the novels' characters.\n\n==Westeros {{anchor|Westeros}}==\n{{Redirect|Westeros|the website|A Song of Ice and Fire fandom|the \"Westeros the Series\" viral video|Zondag met Lubach|similarly sounding locations|V\u00e4ster\u00e5s|and|Wester Ross}}\n{{further|Heptarchy}}\n{{Infobox fictional location\n| name       = Westeros\n| colour     = #C0C0C0\n| image      = Westeros.map.jpg\n| imagesize  = 250px\n| caption    = A map of the Westeros continent\n| source     = [[A Song of Ice and Fire]]\n| creator    = [[George R.

The continent is home to the '''Seven Kingdoms''', also known as \"the Realm\" or the \"Sunset Kingdom\", located to the south side of [[#The Wall|the Wall]], a massive man-made ice wall (allegedly fused with magic) 700 feet in height and spanning east-west for 300 miles from coast to coast.  The Seven Kingdoms are further divided into the so-called \"[[#The North|North]]\" and \"South\" by a [[swamp]]-rich [[isthmus]] called '''the Neck'''.  The land north of the Wall still makes up a large chunk (being roughly the size of [[Canada]]) of Westeros, but remains largely unmapped and unexplored, especially the [[ice field]] region north and west of a massive [[mountain range]] called the Frostfangs, which marks the farthest geographic limit of [[human settlement]]s.<ref group=S name=HBOYouTubeWildlings/><ref group=S name=newyorker/>  The northern extent of the continent is therefore unknown, although it is thought to be continuous with a [[polar ice cap]] north of the Shivering Sea known as the White Waste.\n\nAt the novel's beginning, the majority of Westeros is united under the rule of one king of the Targaryen dynasty, with each of nine regions controlled by a different major house. Martin here drew inspiration from medieval European history,<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grmm_iv_polish/> in particular the [[Hundred Years' War]], the [[Crusades]], the [[Albigensian Crusade]], and the [[Wars of the Roses]].<ref group=S name=deepmagic41/><ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sffworld/>\n\nThe first inhabitants of the continent were the [[Children of the Forest]], a nature-worshipping [[stone age]] anthropoid species who carved the faces of their gods in [[weirwood]] trees.  Some time later, [[bronze age]] human settlers, known as the First Men, migrated from Essos via a [[land bridge]] at the southeastern end of the continent and gradually spread to the entire continent.  The First Men's attempts at chopping down forests and cultivating the land led to a millennia-long war with the Children of the Forest, that eventually was settled by an agreement known as \"The Pact\".  This was the beginning of the Age of Heroes, during which the First Men adopted the religion of the Children of the Forest. Those gods later became known in Westeros as the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Old Gods|Old Gods]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran VII, pp. 737\u2013739}}\n\nEight thousand years before the events of the novels,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}} an enigmatic arctic humanoid species called the [[Others (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Others]] emerged from the Land of Always Winter, the northernmost part of Westeros, during the decades-long winter known as \"The Long Night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}  The Children of the Forest and the First Men allied to repel the Others, and then built the Wall barring passage from the far north.  The region north of the Wall was since collectively known as the land \"Beyond the Wall\", and settled by tribal First Men descendants known as the Wildlings or Free Folks.\n\n{{anchor|Seven Kingdoms|7 Kingdoms|7 kingdoms}}\nSometime later, the [[iron age]] humans from Essos called the Andals invaded Westeros, bring along the [[Themes in A Song of Ice and Fire#Faith of the Seven|Faith of the Seven]].  One by one, First Men kingdoms south of the Neck fell to the Andals, and only the North remained unconquered.  The Children of the Forest was slaughtered and disappeared from Andal lands.  Over time, seven relatively stable feudal kingdoms were forged across Westeros, although their territories fluctuated over the next few thousand years through constant warfares, and no kingdom remained dominant for long:\n* The [[#The North|Kingdom of the North]], ruled by [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]\n* The [[#The Iron Islands|Kingdom of the Isles]] [[#The Riverlands|and the Rivers]], ruled by House Hoare of [[Harrenhal]]\n* The [[#The Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of Mountain and Vale]], ruled by [[House Arryn]] of [[The Eyrie]]\n* The [[#The Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], ruled by [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]\n* The [[#The Stormlands|Kingdom of the Storm]], ruled by House Durrandon of [[Storm's End]]\n* The [[#The Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]], ruled by House Gardener of [[Highgarden]]\n* The [[#Dorne|Principality of Dorne]], ruled by [[House Martell]] of [[Sunspear]].<ref group=S name=eventhorizon_chat/>\n\nThree hundred years before the novels begin, the [[Targaryen]] dragonlord [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and his two [[consanguine marriage|sister-wives]] Visenya and Rhaenys, whose ancestors migrated from [[Valyria]] to [[#Dragonstone|Dragonstone]]{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} a century prior, invaded the Westerosi mainland and landed his army at the [[river mouth|mouth]] of the Blackwater Rush.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  The three assembled a temporary [[bastion]] called \"Aegonfort\", which later grew into the a massive capital city known as [[#King's Landing|King's Landing]].{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cersei VI, p. 600}}  Aided by their three formidable [[fire-breathing]] [[dragon]]s, the Targaryen armies subdued six of the Seven Kingdoms through conquest or treaty, wiping out three of the seven ruling houses (Durrandon, Hoare and Gardener).

The castle was built over a natural [[hot spring]], whose scalding water runs inside the castle walls and warms its halls and rooms as well as the [[greenhouse|glass garden]] at its northwestern corner.  There are several open pools where heated water collects within the godswood.  The hot spring also prevents the ground from freezing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn II, p. 58}}  The castle has deep [[catacombs]] called \"the crypt\", where bodies of deceased Starks are entombed behind statues in their likeness with a [[direwolf (fictional creature)|direwolf]] at their feet and their swords left in their hands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, pp. 42\u201343}}  The tombs have been used since the old kings of the North, known as the Kings of Winter, were in power.

Looking out over the hills, Martin wondered what a [[centurion|Roman centurion]] from the Mediterranean would feel, not knowing what threats might come from the north.<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/> This experience was so profound that a decade later, in 1991, he wanted to \"write a story about the people guarding the end of the world\",<ref group=S name=tiff2/> and ultimately \"the things that come out of the [fictional] north are a good deal more terrifying than [[Scottish people|Scotsmen]] or [[Picts]]\".<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> \n\nMartin adjusted the size, length, and magical nature of the Wall for [[genre fiction|genre]] demands;<ref group=S name=grrm_iv_sfsite2/> [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]]'s chapters describe it as approximately {{convert|300|mi}} long{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VI, p. 520}} and {{convert|700|ft}} high in general, rising up to a perceived {{convert|900|ft}} in spots due to huge foundation blocks.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jon IV, pp. 405\u2013406}} The top is wide enough for a dozen mounted knights to ride abreast (approximately 30&nbsp;ft or 10&nbsp;m),{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}} while the base is so thick that the Wall's gates are more like tunnels through the ice.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Bran III, p. 550}}\n\nThe novels' legends claim that the First Men,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon IX, p. 784}} or more specifically Brandon the Builder with the possible help of children of the forest and giants,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran IV, pp. 239\u2013240}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jon V, p. 557}} constructed the Wall some 8,000 years before the events of the series.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Eddard I, p. 46}}\n\nThe Wall has since been maintained by the Night's Watch to guard the realms of men against the threats from beyond, originally the Others, and later against [[wildling (character)|wildling]] raids.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon VIII, p. 656}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Samwell II, p. 450}} \n\nA strip of land known as \"the Gift\", now stretching 50 [[league (unit)|leagues]] (about {{convert|150|mi}}) south of the wall, was given to them in [[perpetuity]] thousands of years ago for cultivation.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Bran III, p. 546}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Samwell V, p. 1077}} In ''A Game of Thrones'', out of the nineteen castles built along the wall, only three are still manned:{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}} Castle Black with 600 men, and the Shadow Tower and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea with 200 men each.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 206}} Parts of Castle Black have fallen into ruin.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon III, pp. 184\u2013186}}\n\nThe TV series' Castle Black and the Wall were filmed in the abandoned [[Magheramorne#Game of Thrones|Magheramorne]] Quarry near [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]],<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> whereas the scenes shot atop the wall were filmed inside [[Paint Hall Studios]].<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall, and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry as the basis for the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a functional elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall.<ref group=S name=mogot_fresh/> A castle with real rooms and a working elevator were built near a cliff {{convert|400|ft}} high.<ref group=S name=fodors/><ref group=S name=tiff2/> \"Working construction lifts were discovered at a nearby work site and rise 18 feet; CGI fills in the rest to make the wall appear 700 feet high.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The area around the elevator was painted white to make it look like ice.

It is wet and rainy, and the mud is thick....[it] really gets the actors in the mood of being at the end of the world in all of this cold and damp and chill.\"<ref group=S name=fodors/>\n\n====Beyond the Wall====\n[[File:OeraefajoekullMorning.jpg|thumb|Season 2 of the TV adaptation featured scenes set north of the Wall that were filmed on the [[Vatnaj\u00f6kull]] glacier in Iceland.]]\n''A Clash of Kings'' takes the story to the lands Beyond the Wall, although the first five books do not explore \"what lies really north ... but we will in the last two books\". The TV adaptation used [[Iceland]] as filming location for the lands Beyond the Wall. Martin, who has never been to Iceland, said Beyond the Wall was \"considerably larger than Iceland and the area closest to my Wall is densely forested, so in that sense it's more like Canada{{snd}} [[Hudson Bay]] or the Canadian forests just north of [[Michigan]]. And then as you get further and further north, it changes. You get into [[tundra]] and [[ice field]]s and it becomes more of an [[arctic]] environment. You have [[plain]]s on one side and a very high range of mountains on the other. Of course, once again this is fantasy, so my mountains are more like the [[Himalayas]].\" In an HBO featurette, Martin stated the lands beyond the wall make up a big part of Westeros, being roughly the size of Canada.<ref group=S name=smartertravel/> The Valley of Thenn is one such location beyond the Wall, and north of that is the Lands of Always Winter, where the Others come from.\n\nDuring the first season, the HBO team used places that they could decorate with artificial snow for the north of the Wall, but a bigger landscape was chosen for Season 2. \"Primary filming for these scenes, which encompass both the Frostfangs and the Fist of the First Men, occurred at the [[Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull]] [[Ice calving|calving]] [[glacier]] in [[Skaftafell]], Iceland, followed by shooting near [[Smyrlabj\u00f6rg]] and [[V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal]] on [[H\u00f6f\u00f0abrekkuhei\u00f0i]]. Benioff said, \"We always knew we wanted something shatteringly beautiful and barren and brutal for this part of Jon's journey, because he's in the true North now. It's all real. It's all in camera. We're not doing anything in postproduction to add mountains or snow or anything.\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\n===The Iron Islands===\nThe Iron Islands are a group of seven islands to the west of Westeros \u2013 Pyke, Great Wyk, Old Wyk, Harlaw, Saltcliffe, Blacktyde, and Orkmont \u2013 in Ironman's Bay off the west coast of the continent.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Map}} Ruled by [[House Greyjoy]] of Pyke,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Greyjoy, pp. 827\u2013828}} the isles are described as bare and barren, with the local weather being \"windy and cold, and damp\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 165\u2013166}} The members of this seafaring nation are known in the rest of Westeros as Ironmen,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Greyjoy, pp. 827\u2013828}} and to themselves as Ironborn.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, p. 917}} Illegitimate children born in the Iron Islands are given the surname Pyke.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 439}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jon VI, p. 664}}\n\nFor fierce raids, the Ironmen are titled the \"terror of the seas\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Greyjoy, pp. 827\u2013828}} They worship the Drowned God, who \"had made them to reave and rape, to carve out kingdoms and write their names in fire and blood and song\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, p. 169}} The appendix of ''A Game of Thrones'' summarizes that the Ironmen once ruled over the Riverlands and much of the western coast of Westeros. When Aegon the Conqueror extinguished Harren the Black's line, he chose House Greyjoy as the new rulers of the Ironmen.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Greyjoy, pp. 827\u2013828}}\n\n====Pyke====\n[[File:Ballintoy Harbour - geograph.org.uk - 19750.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, the harbour of [[Ballintoy]] in Northern Ireland was redressed as the port of Pyke.]]\nPyke is the seat of [[House Greyjoy]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Greyjoy, pp. 827\u2013828}} The television adaptation filmed the scenes of Pyke's port at Lordsport Harbour in [[Ballintoy Harbour]], in Northern Ireland's [[County Antrim]].<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/><ref group=S name=Skyscanner/> The sea has worn away much of the rock on which Pyke originally stood, so the castle now consists mostly of a main keep on the main island and smaller towers perched on rocks surronded by sea.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 165\u2013166}}\n\n====Old Wyk====\nOld Wyk is the smallest and holiest island in the Iron Islands. It is where Kingsmoots are held, and where the Grey King slew Nagga, a sea dragon, and made a court of his bones.\n\n===The Riverlands===\nThe Riverlands are the populous and fertile<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_strength\"/> areas surrounding the forks of the river [[Trident]] on Westeros. While they form one of the nine regions of Westeros, the Riverlands' central location and geographic features made the region an inter-kingdom battle zone that changed hands rather than becoming its own 'eighth' kingdom of the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> Centrally located between the Westerlands, the Crownlands, the Vale, and the North<ref group=\"S\" name=\"hbo_viewersguide_map\"/> and lacking the natural defenses of other regions,<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Riverrunvmap\"/> they have seen frequent warfare.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"ssm_bywater\"/> The first ruler to unite the Riverlands was Benedict Justman, but the Justman dynasty died out three centuries later. The Durrandons conquered the Riverlands, but lost rule of it to Harwyn \"Hardhand\" Hoare, King of the Iron Islands. At the time of Aegon's conquest, the Riverlands were ruled by Harwyn's grandson, Harren the Black, king of the Iron Islands, and the Tullys were local nobles who rebelled against him by joining Aegon the Conqueror.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Tullyvguide\"/> As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Riverlands are given the surname Rivers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IX, p. 649}}\n\n====Harrenhal====\nHarrenhal is an enormous ruined castle and is the site of many important events in the novels. Harrenhal was built by Harren the Black,<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> after his conquest of the Riverlands, intending to make it the largest fortification ever built in Westeros. The castle has been described as so large that an entire army was needed to garrison it. The Great Hall had 35 hearths and seated thousands. Shortly after the castle was completed, Aegon the Conqueror's dragon slew Harren, his sons, and his entire army by setting the castle alight.\n\nSince then, the ruins of the castle have been occupied by a variety of houses, all of which eventually became extinct. As a result, the people of Westeros believe the castle is cursed.<ref group=S name=Harrenhalvmap/> The logistical and economic difficulties inherent in keeping such an enormous castle maintained and garrisoned has made it something of a [[white elephant]]. At the start of the War of the Five Kings, the castle is in ruin, with only a fraction of it habitable, and held by Lady Shella Whent, the last of her House, who is stripped of Harrenhal when the Lannisters seize her castle. The castle changes hands repeatedly over the course of the novels, many of those holding it meeting unpleasant ends.\n\n====Riverrun====\nRiverrun is the ancestral stronghold of House Tully. The castle is located along one of the \"forks\" of the Trident and controls access to the interior of Westeros. The castle is bordered on two sides by the Tumblestone River and the Red Fork. The third side fronts on a massive manmade ditch. It was built by Ser Axel Tully on land he received from the Andal King Armistead Vance.\n\nThe castle is the location of [[Robb Stark]]'s great victory over [[House Lannister]] and the site of his crowning. By the end of the ''[[A Feast for Crows]]'', [[Brynden Tully]] surrenders the castle to Jaime Lannister to spare further bloodshed. Riverrun then passed into the hands of Emmon Frey, an ally of House Lannister.\n\n====The Twins====\nThe Twins is the seat of [[House Frey]], which has grown wealthy by charging a toll of all those who cross for the past six centuries. Because the Freys are both wealthy and numerous, theirs is one of the most powerful houses sworn to [[House Tully]]. The castle's strategic position gives House Frey enormous importance in times of war.\n\nWhen Robb Stark goes to The Twins to repair his alliance with House Frey, the Freys massacre him, his mother, and his army (and in the TV adaptation, his wife): an event known as \"[[The Red Wedding]]\", which violates native customs of [[hospitality#Celtic cultures|guest right]] and incurs enmity throughout the Seven Kingdoms, especially in the Riverlands and North.\n\n===The Vale of Arryn===\n[[File:Meteore.jpg|thumb|For the TV adaptation, images of the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]] were used for the composite views of the Vale.]]\nThe Vale is the area surrounded almost completely by the Mountains of the Moon in the east of Westeros. The Vale is under the rulership of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest lines of Andal nobility and formerly Kings of Mountain and Vale. Their seat, the Eyrie, is a castle high in the mountains, small but considered unassailable. The only way to reach the Vale is by a mountain road teeming with animals called 'shadowcats', rock slides, and dangerous mountain clans. The mountain road ends at the Vale's sole entrance, the Bloody Gate: a pair of twin watchtowers, connected by a covered bridge, on the rocky mountain slopes over a very narrow path. The protection of the surrounding mountains gives the Vale itself a temperate climate, fertile meadows, and woods. The snowmelt from the mountains and a constant waterfall that never freezes, named Alyssa's Tears, provide plentiful water. The Vale has rich black soil, wide slow-moving rivers, and hundreds of small lakes. Illegitimate children born in the Vale are given the surname Stone.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====The Eyrie====\n[[File:Schloss Neuschwanstein 2013.jpg|thumbnail|The German [[Neuschwanstein Castle|castle of Neuschwanstein]], on which the Eyrie is based]]\nBased on the German castle of [[Neuschwanstein]],<ref group=S name=westeros.orgKepler/> the Eyrie is the seat of House Arryn. It is situated on the Giant's Lance and reachable only by a narrow mule trail, guarded by the Gates of the Moon and three small castles, titled Stone, Snow, and Sky. Travelers must enter the Gates of the Moon and its upper bailey before reaching the narrow path up the mountain. The steps up the Giant's Lance starts directly behind the Gates of the Moon. The Eyrie clings to the mountain and is six hundred feet above Sky. The last part of the climb to the Eyrie is something of a cross between a chimney and a stone ladder, which leads to the Eyrie's cellar entrance. Due to the Mountains of the Moon's harsh winters, travel to and from the Eyrie is possible through the mountains only in summer.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie is the smallest of the great castles in the story, consisting of seven slim towers bunched tightly together. It has no stables, kennels, or smithies, but the towers can house 500 men, and the [[granary]] can sustain a small household for a year or more. The Eyrie does not keep livestock on hand; all dairy produce, meats, fruits, vegetables, etc., must be brought from the Vale below. Its cellars hold six great winches with long iron chains to draw supplies and occasionally guests from below.  [[Oxen]] are used to raise and lower them. Winter snows can make supplying the fortress impossible. The Eyrie's dungeons, known as \"sky cells\", are left open to the sky on one side and have sloping floors that put prisoners in danger of slipping or rolling off the edge. Executions in the Eyrie are carried out via the Moon Door, which opens from the high hall onto a 600-foot drop.\n\nThe Eyrie is made of pale stone and primarily decorated with the blue and white colors of House Arryn. Elegant details provide warmth and comfort through plentiful fireplaces, carpets, and luxurious fabrics. Many of the chambers have been described to be warm and comfortable, with magnificent views of the Vale, the Mountains of the Moon, or the waterfall. The Maiden's Tower is the easternmost of the seven slender towers, so all the Vale can be seen from its windows and balconies. The apartments of the Lady of the Eyrie open over a small garden planted with blue flowers and ringed by white towers, containing grass and scattered statuary, with the central statue of a weeping woman believed to be Alyssa Arryn, around low, flowering shrubs. The lord's chambers have doors of solid oak, and plush [[velvet]] curtains covering windows of small rhomboid panes of glass. The High Hall has a blue silk carpet leading to the carved weirwood thrones of the Lord and Lady Arryn. The floors and walls are of milk-white marble veined with blue. Daylight enters down through high narrow arched windows along the eastern wall, and there are some fifty high iron sconces where torches may be lit.{{cn|date=April 2012}}\n\nThe Eyrie was held by Lord Jon Arryn, who fostered Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon prior to Robert's Rebellion. After the war, Lord Arryn served as King Robert I Baratheon's Hand of the King (prime minister). After Lord Arryn was assassinated, his wife, Lady Lysa Arryn, took her sickly child, Robin, and fled to the Eyrie. Lysa refused to align herself with any of the claimants during the War of the Five Kings, but eventually pretends to a possible alliance with House Lannister after Lord Petyr Baelish agrees to marry her. Later Baelish kills Lysa after she attempts to murder her niece, Sansa Stark. As of ''Feast for Crows'', Baelish rules in the Eyrie as the Lord Protector and Regent for the sickly, epileptic Lord Robert \"Robin\" Arryn, and plans for Sansa to marry Harold Harding, who will become heir to the Eyrie and the Vale in the event of young Robin Arryn's death.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Alayne, Chapter 41}}\n\nFor the CGI compositions of the Vale of Arryn in the TV series, as seen in the establishing shot of the Eyrie and from the sky cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of [[Meteora]]. Initially they had been considering the [[Wulingyuan|Zhangjiajie Mountains]] in China, but because the landscape base plates were shot in Northern Ireland, using Meteora resulted a better option.<ref group=S name=btlnews_bluebolt/> Set designer Gemma Jackson said, \"A lot of the mosaics in the Eyrie were based on a beautiful chapel I visited in Rome.\"<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The interior of the High Hall of the Arryns was filmed at The Paint Hall, occupying one of the four soundstages there. Martin acknowledged that the set differed significantly from its presentation in the books: \"In the books, the room is long and rectangular. But [The Paint Hall soundstage] had essentially a square space, which they chose to put a round hall in, with a staircase curving up to a throne that was high above.\"<ref group=S name=aoltv_qa/>\n\n===The Westerlands===\nThe Westerlands are the Westerosi lands to the west of the Riverlands and north of the Reach. They are ruled by House Lannister of Casterly Rock, formerly Kings of the Rock. People of this region are often called \"Westermen.\" Lannisport, lying hard by Casterly Rock, is the chief town of the region and one of the great ports and cities of Westeros. The Westerlands are rich in precious metals, mostly gold, which is the source of their wealth.{{cn|date=April 2012}} As with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}} illegitimate children born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Prologue, p. 12}}\n\n====Casterly Rock====\n[[File:Rock of Gibraltar northwest.jpg|thumb|Casterly Rock was inspired by the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] (pictured).]]\nA stronghold carved from a mountain overlooking the harbor city of Lannisport and the sea beyond, Casterly Rock is the ancestral seat of [[House Lannister]]. According to popular legend, the hero known as Lann the Clever tricked the Casterlys into giving up the Rock, and took it for himself. The Rock is renowned as the wealthiest region due to its abundance of gold mining resources, and it is one of the strongest castles of the Seven Kingdoms. It has never been taken in battle, despite attacks by the Iron Islanders and the plans of Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings. It was held by Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] before the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] made one of her cousins [[castellan]] of the castle. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the narrative has not actually taken place in Casterly Rock, yet descriptions of it have been offered by the Lannisters in the POV chapters.\n\nWest of Casterly Rock is the coastal city of Lannisport. A busy port under the governance of the Lannisters of Casterly Rock, Lannisport thrives as a protected and wealthy city. The city is also home to many lesser Lannisters and other people with similar surnames, such as Lannys.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin stated on his blog that he drew inspiration for Casterly Rock from the [[Rock of Gibraltar]].<ref group=S name=grrm_blog_080529/>\n\n===The Reach===\n[[File:Castillo de Almodovar (11801978016).jpg|thumb|The [[Castle of Almod\u00f3var del R\u00edo]] in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, which represented Highgarden in ''Game of Thrones'']]\nThe Reach is the most lush and fertile region of Westeros, ruled by [[House Tyrell]] from Highgarden. The Tyrells were stewards to House Gardener, the Kings of the Reach before Aegon's conquest. After the last Gardener King was killed on the Field of Fire, the Tyrells surrendered Highgarden to Aegon and were rewarded with both the castle and the position of overlords of the Reach. The wealth and power of the Reach comes from their bountiful harvests of the most sought-after wines and foods. During times of war, the lengthy distance of the Reach and its abundance of foods protects their inhabitants from initial famine and sickness. In a significant political maneuver during the civil war in Westeros and the War of the Five Kings, House Tyrell provides the starving populace of King's Landing with hundreds of carts of food, ensuring the positive image of House Tyrell foremost, and the alliance for the Iron Throne with House Baratheon as secondary. However, the Tyrells were responsible for the starvation in the first place, as part of their plan to help Renly usurp the Iron Throne. The most prominent city in the Reach is Oldtown. It is the oldest city in Westeros, home to the Maester's Citadel, and the previous seat of the Faith of the Seven.{{cn|date=April 2012}} Illegitimate children born in the Reach are given the surname Flowers.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\n====Oldtown====\n[[File:PHAROS2013-3000x2250.jpg|thumb|The Hightower of Oldtown bears similarities to the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (3D reconstruction pictured)]]\nOldtown is one of the largest cities in Westeros and is by far the oldest, built by the First Men before the Andal Invasion. It survived the invasion by welcoming the Andals rather than resisting them. The city is located in the southwestern part of Westeros, at the mouth of the River Honeywine, where it opens onto Whispering Sound and the Sunset Sea beyond.\n\nOldtown is primarily known as the location of the Citadel, home of the order of Maesters who serve as councillors, doctors, scientists, and postmasters for the Seven Kingdoms. The city's Starry Sept was the seat of the Faith of the Seven until the construction of the Great Sept of Baelor in King's Landing. Aegon the Conqueror's reign is dated from his entrance into the city of Oldtown and his acknowledgment as king by the High Septon.\n\nOldtown is the second most important port in the Seven Kingdoms after King's Landing: trading ships from the Summer Islands, the Free Cities, the eastern cities, and the rest of Westeros constantly crowd into its harbors. The city itself is described as stunningly beautiful. Many rivers and canals crisscross its cobbled streets, and breathtaking stone mansions are common. The city lacks the squalor of King's Landing, which usurped its position as the preeminent city of Westeros.\n\nThe largest structure in the city, and the tallest structure in Westeros, is the Hightower, a massive [[ziggurat|stepped lighthouse]] which extends some {{convert|800|ft}} into the sky and is topped by a huge beacon which can be seen for many miles out to sea. Oldtown is ruled from the Hightower by House Hightower. Originally kings in their own right, they later swore fealty to the Gardeners of Highgarden, and became vassals of the Tyrells after the Conquest. The Hightowers are known for their loyalty and stalwartness. The current ruler of the city is Lord Leyton Hightower.\n\nOldtown remained aloof from the [[War of the Five Kings]], but late in the war the Ironborn under King Euron Greyjoy launched a massive raid along the coast, conquering the Shield Islands and parts of the Arbor before trying to blockade the mouth of the Honeywine. An attempt to attack the city harbor was repulsed by the city's defenders. Oldtown remains under threat from the Ironborn.\n\n===The Stormlands===\nThe Stormlands are the Westerosi areas between King's Landing and the Sea of Dorne. In the east they are bordered by Shipbreaker Bay and the Dornish Sea to the south. Before Aegon's conquest they were ruled by the Storm Kings, and afterwards by [[House Baratheon]], bastard relatives to the Targaryens. The Dornish Marches are located within this region, and were common battlegrounds between the Stormlands and Dorne until Aegon joined the Seven Kingdoms.<ref group=S name=westeros.orgStormlands/> Illegitimate children born in the Stormlands are given the surname Storm.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, p. 161}}\n\n====Storm's End====\nStorm's End is the seat of House Baratheon and, before them, the ancestral seat of the Storm Kings extending back many thousands of years. According to legend, the first Storm King in the age of the First Men was Durran, who married Elenei, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind. In a rage her parents sent vast storms to shatter his keep and kill his wedding guests and family; whereupon Durran declared war against the gods and raised several castles over Shipbreaker Bay, each larger and more formidable than the last. Finally, the seventh castle stayed in place and resisted the storms. Some believe the Children of the Forest took a hand in its construction; others suggest that Brandon Stark, the builder of the Wall, advised Durran on its construction. The truth of the matter is unknown.\n\nStorm's End has never fallen to either siege or storm. Its outer defenses consist of a huge [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]], {{convert|100|ft|m}} tall and {{convert|40|ft}} thick on its thinnest side, nearly {{convert|80|ft}} thick on its seaward side. The wall consists of a double course of stones with an inner core of sand and rubble. The wall is smooth and curving, the stones so well placed that the wind cannot enter. On the seaward side, there is a {{convert|150|ft|m|adj=on}} drop below the wall into the sea.\n\nThe castle itself consists of one huge drum tower crowned with formidable battlements, and so large that it can comfortably contain stables, [[barracks]], [[armory (military)|armory]] and lord's chambers in the same structure. Although never taken in battle, Storm's End has endured several sieges and battles in recent history. The last Storm King, Argilac the Arrogant, abandoned his impressive defenses to meet the Targaryen commander, Orys Baratheon, in open battle during Aegon Targaryen's War of Conquest, and lost. This led to Orys Baratheon marrying Argilac's daughter and becoming Lord of Storm's End.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, Storm's End was besieged for a year by the host of Lord Mace Tyrell, who commanded the landward forces, while Paxter Redwyne's fleet of the Arbor kept the castle cut off by sea. [[Stannis Baratheon]], commanding the defense, refused to yield and his men were reduced to eating rats. A smuggler named Davos ran the blockade to resupply the castle and Stannis rewarded him by knighting him and giving him lands, thus founding House Seaworth, but he also cut off the fingertips of his left hand as punishment for all his previous smuggling. After the war, Stannis was furious when his brother Robert, now king, gave the castle to their younger brother Renly and placed Stannis in command of Dragonstone. This led to many years of bitterness on Stannis' part.\n\nDuring the War of the Five Kings, Storm's End supported Renly when he attempted to usurp the crown, and was besieged by Stannis. When the castellan, Cortnay Penrose, refused to yield even after Renly's death, he was killed by Stannis' ally, the priestess Melisandre, and the castle surrendered. Later, the castle was besieged by a strong army under Mace Tyrell, but he abandoned the siege after a few weeks to return to King's Landing after the arrest of his daughter Margaery by the High Septon. As of ''[[A Dance with Dragons]]'', the castle remains in the hands of Stannis Baratheon.\n\nAt the end of ''A Dance with Dragons'' an army lands in the Stormlands led by Jon Connington and a young man claiming to be Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell and heir to the Iron Throne. To attract support, Aegon plans to conquer Storm's End and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.\n\nIn the TV adaptation, scenes in the Stormlands were filmed in [[Larrybane]], Northern Ireland. The scene where Stannis' red priestess Melisandre gave birth to a shadow creature was filmed in the [[Cushendun Caves]], also in Northern Ireland.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n===The Crownlands===\nThe Crownlands are the lands in Westeros surrounding King's Landing, ruled directly by the crown of the Iron Throne. The Targaryen kings consolidated this as one of the nine regions of Westeros, after their conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, from sparsely populated pieces of the Riverlands and Stormlands. The Crownlands form the entire coastline of Blackwater Bay, and include the original Targaryen homeland on the island of Dragonstone, at the Narrow Sea entrance to Blackwater Bay. Besides King's Landing, which is the largest city in Westeros, the Crownlands include many towns and castles. The illegitimate children born in the Crownlands are given the surname Waters.\n\n====Dragonstone====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Downhill Strand]], [[County Londonderry]] was used to represent a beach of the island of Dragonstone (left) and [[Gaztelugatxe]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Spain (right) stood in for Dragonstone in Season 7. |image1=Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 222956.jpg |image2=Gaztelugatxe_4199995260.jpg}}\nDragonstone was once the westernmost outpost of the ancient Freehold of [[Valyria]]. A century before the Doom, the Targaryen family moved to Dragonstone. When the Doom came upon Valyria, House Targaryen survived along with the last of the Valyrian dragons. Another century later, Aegon Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya launched a massive campaign of conquest from the island and eventually conquered all of Westeros except for Dorne, and North of the Wall. Aegon's progeny reigned as kings of the Seven Kingdoms for centuries.\n\nDragonstone is a massive, forbidding fortress, taking up a large portion of the island of the same name. The castle is unique in that the builders and sorcerers of Valyria carved its towers and keeps into the shapes of dragons and made ferocious [[gargoyle]]s to cover its walls using both magic and masonry. The castle's lower levels are warmed by residual volcanic activity deep below the keep. There is a small port and town outside of the castle.\n\nDuring the War of the Usurper, before the sack of King's Landing, the Targaryen Queen Rhaella, who was pregnant, and her son Viserys were sent to Dragonstone along with part of the Targaryen fleet and a garrison of loyal soldiers. But after King's Landing fell, Robert Baratheon dispatched his brother Stannis to take the island stronghold. After a storm destroyed the royalist fleet, the Targaryen garrison tried to betray Viserys and his newborn sister, Daenerys, to Stannis (the queen had died in childbirth). But Targaryen loyalists led by Ser Willem Darry took the children away. Stannis conquered Dragonstone easily, and King Robert granted him ownership of the castle. Stannis felt slighted because his younger brother Renly then inherited Storm's End, the ancient seat of House Baratheon. Ser Axell Florent, one of the uncles of Stannis' wife Selyse Florent, acted as castellan.\n\nUpon Robert's death, Stannis declared himself King of Westeros and condemned the queen's children as bastards born of [[incest]], as he had discovered with Jon Arryn. Dragonstone became his main seat. He returned there after the disastrous Battle of the Blackwater. His councilor, the red priestess Melisandre of Asshai, tried to convince him to let her raise the \"stone dragon\" of the castle through blood magic, but Lord Davos Seaworth convinced Stannis to go north to the Wall to help the Night's Watch instead. After Stannis abandoned Dragonstone, leaving the Bastard of Nightsong Rolland Storm as castellan, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister dispatched a fleet to barricade it. However, Ser Loras Tyrell, impatient to free the fleet to protect his home castle of Highgarden, attacked Dragonstone directly. He took the castle but lost a thousand men and was himself reportedly gravely wounded. As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Dragonstone is now controlled by troops loyal to House Tyrell, and theoretically, once again under control of the Iron Throne.\n\nOne scene set at Dragonstone, in which Stannis burns wooden sculptures of the Seven gods, was filmed at the beach of [[Downhill Strand]].<ref group=S name=utv_beach/> In [[Game of Thrones (season 7)|Season 7]] of the show, filming for Dragonstone took place at several locations in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque region]] of Spain: the islet of [[Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Bermeo]], Itzurun Beach in [[Zumaia]], and Muriola Beach in [[Barrika]].<ref group=S name=TelegraphFilmingLocations/>\n\n====King's Landing====\n{{multiple image |footer=[[Mdina]] in Malta (left) and [[Dubrovnik]] in Croatia (right) stood in for King's Landing in the TV adaptation. |image1=Mdina, Malta - panoramio (18).jpg |image2=Dubrovnik from walls.JPG}}\nKing's Landing is the royal capital of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms. King's Landing has an estimated population of 1 million people, making it the most populous city in Westeros.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, p. 528}} It is situated on the Blackwater river on the spot where Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros to begin his conquest. The main city is surrounded by a wall, which is manned by the City Watch of King's Landing, which is nicknamed the gold cloaks, after the cloaks they wear. Within the walls, the city's natural landscape is dominated by three hills, named after Aegon and his two sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya. Poorer smallfolk (commoners) build shanty settlements outside the city. King's Landing is described as extremely populous but unsightly and dirty. The stench of the city's waste can be smelled far beyond its walls.\n\nThe royal castle, called the Red Keep, sits on Aegon's Hill. It is the seat of the [[royal court]]. The Keep holds the Iron Throne. Aegon commissioned the throne's construction from the swords of his defeated enemies. According to legend, he kept the blades sharp because he believed that no ruler should ever sit comfortably. Centuries later, kings still cut themselves on the throne. It is a common belief that one who cuts himself on the throne has been \"rejected\" by the throne and is therefore not fit to rule.\n\nThe city also holds the Great Sept of Baelor, where the Most Devout convene with the High Septon. It is the holiest sept of the Seven. The slums of King's Landing are called Flea Bottom, where residents are so poor they regularly subsist on [[Perpetual stew|\"bowls of brown\"]], a mystery stew that can include the meat of puppies and murder victims.\n\nMartin compared King's Landing to medieval Paris or London.<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> It was inspired by the view of [[Staten Island]] from his childhood home in [[Bayonne, New Jersey]].<ref group=S name=GRRMInterviewABCNews/>\n\nThe first season of the TV adaptation used Malta's former capital [[Mdina]] to represent King's Landing.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> \"Like King's Landing, Mdina is a walled medieval city built upon a hill, but unlike King's Landing, Mdina is an inland city{{snd}} so the production was limited to interior shots such as side streets and the [[Mdina Gate|town gate]], which can be seen when Ned Stark arrives.

As of the first five books, Doran Nymeros Martell is the Prince of Dorne and Lord of Sunspear. Doran's sister, Princess Elia, was married in a political alliance to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, the Prince of Dragonstone and heir to the Iron Throne. They had two children, a daughter, Rhaenys, and a son, Aegon. During the Sack of King's Landing at the end of Robert's Rebellion, Princess Elia was raped and murdered by Gregor Clegane, a House Lannister bannerman (vassal). Her children were also killed in front of her. Prince Doran and his wife, Princess Mellaria, have three children, Arianne, Quentyn and Trystane. During the War of the Five Kings, [[Tyrion Lannister]], as Hand of the King, turns the historical enmity of House Martell and Dorne into an alliance by sending King Joffrey's middle sibling and sister, Myrcella Baratheon, as the betrothed future bride to Trystane, the youngest child of Prince Doran, who is about her own age. The eldest child of Prince Doran, Arianne, is heir to House Martell, Sunspear and the rule of Dorne. The wealth of Dorne comes from their famous Sand Steeds, purebred horses of endurance, speed, and grace, and from spices, wines, fishing, fabrics, and textiles.\n\nDorne is bordered by the Sea of Dorne to the north, the islands known as the Stepstones to the east, and stretches from the high mountains of the Dornish marches, the Red Mountains, separating Dorne from the remainder of the Seven Kingdoms by land. The two major passes though the Red Mountains that connect Dorne with the rest of the continent are the Stone Way Pass and the Prince's Pass. The Prince's Pass leads to the Reach, while the Stone Way exits the mountains near Summerhall. The southern coast of the continent is bordered by the Summer Sea.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Described as tropical in climate by George R. R. Martin,<ref group=S name=denverpost_grrm/> Dorne has the highest temperatures of any kingdom in Westeros, and is arid, with a rocky, mountainous, terrain that includes the only desert on the continent. Its rivers provide some fertile lands and during a long summer there is enough rain and other supplies of water to keep Dorne habitable. Inland water is almost as valuable as gold, and wells are jealously guarded. Notable locations of Dorne are Starfall, the seat of House Dayne, and Yronwood, the seat of House Yronwood, the most powerful of the Martell bannermen. Planky Town is a trade port town at the mouth of the River Greenblood.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nDornishmen have a reputation for hot-bloodedness. They differ both culturally and ethnically from other Westerosi due to the historical mass immigration of Rhoynish people. They have adopted many Rhoynish customs as well, including [[equal primogeniture]]. Dorne was the only kingdom in Westeros to successfully resist Aegon's conquest, even killing one of his dragons during the war. It was conquered by Daeron I over a century after the Targaryen invasion, but rose against him leading to his death. Finally under Daeron's cousin Daeron II they joined through marriage. This accomplishment has allowed Dorne to retain a measure of independence. Lords of the ruling [[House Martell]] still style themselves \"Prince\" and \"Princess\" in the Rhoynish fashion. Unlike most of the rest of Westeros, illegitimate children born in Dorne are treated nearly the same as legal offspring{{cn|date=April 2012}} and given the surname Sand,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}} as with Westerosi customs to give bastards a surname showing their origins.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn VI, p. 369}}\n\nAccording to ''A Storm of Swords'', \"There were three sorts of Dornishmen [...]. There were the salty Dornishmen who lived along the coasts, the sandy Dornishmen of the deserts and long river valleys, and the stony Dornishmen who made their fastnesses in the passes and heights of the Red Mountains. The salty Dornishmen had the most Rhoynish blood, the stony Dornishmen the least. All three sorts seemed well represented in Doran\u2019s retinue. The salty Dornishmen were lithe and dark, with smooth olive skin and long black hair streaming in the wind. The sandy Dornishmen were even darker, their faces burned brown by the hot Dornish sun. They wound long bright scarfs around their helms to ward off sunstroke. The stony Dornishmen were biggest and fairest, sons of the Andals and the First Men, brownhaired or blond, with faces that freckled or burned in the sun instead of browning.\"{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Tyrion V, pp. 520\u2013521}}\n\nIn the show, Dornish scenes were filmed in the [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville]], [[Seville, Spain]].\n\n==Summer Sea==\n====Basilisk Isles====\nEast of Naath, the Basilisk Isles have been a festering sore of the Summer Sea, and a safe haven for [[pirate]]s, [[slave trade|slaver]]s, [[sellsword]]s, and [[outlaw]]s. Ruins have been found on the Isle of Tears, the Isle of Toads, and Ax Island. The Isle of Tears is the largest island, with steep valleys and black bogs. It was conquered by the Ghiscari and it was called Gorgai for two centuries, until the dragonlords of Valyria captured it and renamed it Gorgossos. It was used as a prison by the Freehold, a place where they sent their most despicable criminals.\n\n====Naath====\nNaath, also known as the Isle of Butterflies, is an island off the north-west coast of Sothoryos that lies west of the Basilisk Isles. The Naathi people have dark skin and golden eyes. They practice extreme pacifism, making music instead of war and refusing to eat meat, only fruit. This makes them especially vulnerable to slavers from Essos. Daenerys' interpreter [[Missandei]] is from Naath.\n\n====Summer Islands {{anchor|Summer Islands|The Summer Islands}}====\nAs indicated on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'', the Summer Islands are situated to the south of Westeros,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} with a local fauna of talking birds,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 302}} apes,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}} and monkeys.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne III, p. 300}} The novels describe the island natives as dark-skinned people who speak their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}} They wear colored feathery clothes{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Sansa II, p. 294}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} and live on fruit and fish.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell V, p. 965}} From their port city named Tall Trees Town,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} the Summer Isles export rare goods to Westeros such as wine,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 121}} spices,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}} feathers,{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} but also a special kind of wood from which bows are made that have a longer range than most others.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 8}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Griffin Reborn, p. 801}} People of the Seven Kingdoms call the Summer Islanders' great vessels ''swan ships'', \"for their billowing white sails and for their figureheads, most of which depicted birds\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u201375}} Samwell Tarly, who spends two chapters in ''A Feast for Crows'' aboard a swan ship, describes the Summer Islander women as wanton, and their gods as strange; they \"revered the elderly and celebrated their dead\" through sexual intercourse.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Samwell IV, pp. 740\u2013741, 751\u2013752}} As a prostitute explains to Tyrion in ''A Clash of Kings'', the Summer Islanders regard their sexuality as the gods' gift to worship them through mating, and hence many of their highborn youths and maidens serve in pleasure houses for a few years to honor the gods.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion III, p. 238}}\n\n==Essos==\nPart of the narrative in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' lies across the Narrow Sea from Westeros, an area comprising the large eastern continent named Essos. Being roughly the size of [[Eurasia]],<ref group=S name=ssm_geography/> Essos has geography and climate that vary greatly. The western coastline is characterized by green rolling hills, the massive Forest of [[#Qohor|Qohor]], and extensive island chains such as [[#Braavos|Braavos]] and [[#Lys|Lys]]. The middle of the continent is covered by the flat grasslands of the Dothraki Sea and the arid lands known as the Red Waste to the east. Beyond the Red Waste lies the city of Qarth. The south is dominated by dry rolling hills and has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with a coastline along the Summer Sea and [[#Slaver's Bay|Slaver's Bay]]. The north coast of the mainland is separated from the polar cap by the Shivering Sea. To the south, across the Summer Sea, lies the uncharted jungle continent of Sothoryos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/>\n\nMuch of the fictional history of Essos relates to Valyria, a city located on a peninsula in southern Essos and the origin of [[House Targaryen]] before the destruction of the Valyrian Empire in an unspecified cataclysm.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Appendix: House Targaryen, p. 832}} After the destruction of Valyria, the cities of Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen regained independence and ruled their respective areas as [[city-states]]. The area is known in the books as Slaver's Bay.\n\n===Free Cities and vicinity {{anchor|The Free Cities|Free Cities|Andalos|Rhoyne}}===\nAcross the Narrow sea on the western side of Essos lie the nine Free Cities, independent city-states that are mostly on islands or along the coast. They are Lys, Myr, Pentos, Braavos, Lorath, Norvos, Qohor, Volantis and Tyrosh. Although most Free Cities are named early in the first novel,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys I, pp. 30\u201331}} the books only provide a map of this region in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Mountains to the east separate the coast from the plains of the [[#The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea]], though gaps in the mountain range provide the Dothraki people some access to the Free Cities. The Free Cities were colonies built by the ancient Valyrian Freehold, and later declared independence after the Doom of Valyria.{{cn|date=June 2012}} An exception to this is Braavos, which was founded by refugees fleeing Valyrian expansion, escaped slaves and other rabble.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} The languages of the Free Cities are derivatives of [[Valyrian languages|High Valyrian]].{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}}\n\nThe Free Cities span an area characterized by the river Rhoyne, which the local character Yandry describes as \"the greatest river in the world\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, p. 182}} Its banks are the homeland of the Rhoynar, who worship the river as \"Mother Rhoyne\".{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, p. 436}} As mapped in ''A Dance with Dragons'', the Rhoyne originates from the conjunction of two of its tributaries, the Upper Rhoyne and the Little Rhoyne, southeast of the ruins of Ghoyan Drohe. The headwaters of the Upper Rhoyne lie in Andalos, the homeland of the Andals between Braavos and Pentos.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Rhoyne's course runs southeast to turn due south after Dagger Lake, where river pirates hide on and around the many lake islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion IV, pp. 187\u2013189}} The Rhoyne gains in width considerably as it gets fed by more tributaries, until it opens into the Summer Sea in a delta near the Free City of Volantis.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}}\n\n====Braavos====\nUnique among the Free Cities, Braavos was not a Valyrian colony, but a secret refuge from Valyrian expansion.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} It is a city spread over hundreds of tiny islands{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Jon V, p. 447}} in a lagoon on the northwestern end of Essos where the Narrow Sea and Shivering Sea meet.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} Braavos is home to the 'Iron Bank', one of the wealthiest banks in the known world <ref>https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-everything-to-know-about-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-2017-8#what-is-the-iron-bank-of-braavos-1</ref>. Braavos is also known for its swordsmen known as 'bravos'<ref>https://www.ign.com/wikis/game-of-thrones/Braavos</ref>, and its mysterious assassins, the Faceless Men. It is also famed for the Titan of Braavos, both a fortress and a statue. The ruler of Braavos is known as the Sealord and it is from the sea that the city's power and wealth flows. The hulls of Braavosi ships are painted purple{{sfn| ''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Davos, pp. 194}} and their merchant ships sail to many distant lands and bring their trade and wealth back home.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} Braavos has many moneylenders and the Iron Bank of Braavos lends money to foreign nations, especially The Crown, which has borrowed millions.\n\nBraavosi dress in flashy colors while the very rich and powerful dress in black and in blues that are almost black. Officials of Braavos, called keyholders and justiciars, wear drab coats of brown or grey.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The city is also renowned worldwide for its [[courtesan]]s. Every courtesan has her own barge and servants to work them. The beauty of famed courtesans has inspired many a song. They are showered with gifts from goldsmiths and craftsmen beg for their custom. Nobility and rich merchants pay the courtesans large amounts of money to appear alongside them at events, and bravos are known to kill each other in their names.{{cn|date=June 2012}} The character Syrio Forel, former first sword of the Sealord of Braavos, introduces Arya Stark to a unique form of Braavosi sword fighting, called Water Dancing.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Arya IV, pp. 530\u2013531}} The style is a refined form of fencing in which the practitioner stands sideways and wields a slender blade. Pugnacious bravos fill the city, frequently dueling to display their skill.\n\nBraavos was inspired by [[Venice]], Italy.<ref group=S name=FrankelBook/> It was filmed in Croatian towns of [[\u0160ibenik]], and [[Ka\u0161tel Gomilica]] in the TV series.<ref group=S name=Skyscanner/>\n\n====Pentos====\n[[File:Palazz Verdala - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The TV series filmed Illyrio's mansion in Pentos at [[Verdala Palace]] in Malta.]]\nPentos is a major trading port on a bay of the western coast. Dominated by an architecture of square brick towers, it is headed by a Prince who is chosen by the de facto rulers of the city, known as Magisters. Khalasars occasionally make their way this far from the Dothraki Sea, but the Pentoshi are spared much of the raiding and invasions by paying tribute to their khals. Men from Pentos wear dyed and forked beards. As in many Free Cities, slavery is outlawed, but the wealthy and powerful members of the city have the ability to flout these laws by keeping servants collared in bronze.\n\nDaenerys's scenes in the pilot episode were filmed in [[Morocco]].<ref group=S name=dailybeast_secrets/> The television adaptation re-used the Jerusalem sets of ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' near [[Ouarzazate]], Morocco. \"One small portion of the Jerusalem set, redressed and repainted, became the courtyard of Illyrio's manse where Dany first meets Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog10526 /> \"When the pilot was delivered, HBO asked for extensive reshoots, including the scrapping of all the footage shot in a landlocked part of Morocco{{snd}} which was supposed to take place in Pentos, a fictional port city{{snd}} and filming it again in Malta.\"<ref group=S name=nyt/> The exterior scenes at Illyrio's mansion in Pentos were shot at [[Verdala Palace]], the 16th century summer palace of the [[president of Malta]].<ref group=S name=\"Den of Geek 29 February 2012\"/> \"One of Malta's most spectacular natural attractions, the [[Azure Window]] on the island of Gozo, stood in for the location of Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo.\"<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nWhen Pentos reappeared in Season 5, it was filmed in Croatia.\n\n====Volantis====\nVolantis is a port on the southern coast of Essos, and is the oldest and proudest of the Free Cities. A fortification known as the Black Wall protects the oldest parts of the city.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} The city is ruled by three [[triarchy|triarchs]], who are elected every year by free landholders of Volantis, and defended by slave soldiers called the \"Tiger cloaks\". Volantis is incredibly important to the slave market, and in the city there are five slaves to every free man.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion, Chapter 5}} All Volantene slaves have facial tattoos denoting their profession: for instance, sex slaves have tears tattooed on their faces, and the tiger cloaks have tiger stripes. The worship of [[R'hllor]] is the most influential religion of Volantis, especially among slaves.\n\nThe TV adaptation used locations in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], Spain.\n\n====Other Free Cities {{anchor|Lorath|Lys|Myr|Norvos|Qohor|Tyrosh|Volantis}}====\n* '''Lorath''' is a port city on a group of northern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The character [[Jaqen H'ghar]] poses as a Lorathi in ''A Clash of Kings'', wearing long hair dyed red on one side and white on the other.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Arya II, p. 86}}\n* '''Lys''' sits astride a series of southern islands.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Map}} The Lysene have a tendency to be tall and fair of skin and eyes, unlike most inhabitants of the Free Cities. Lys is well known for its pleasure houses, training slaves in the arts of love and selling them as concubines and bed-slaves. Lys also frequently fights over control of the Stepstones and the Disputed Lands. There appears to be a love goddess whose worship is peculiar to Lys.{{cn|date=June 2012}} Dany's handmaiden Doreah and the pirate Salladhor Saan are Lysene.\n* '''Myr''' is a coastal city renowned for their master lenscrafters, intricate lace, and fine carpets. The dark eyed and dark skinned Myrmen are similar to Norvosi and Pentoshi in that they are ruled by magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. Myr is a hub of trade in both slaves and their signature green nectar wines. Myr frequently fights over control of the Disputed Lands.\n* '''Norvos''' sits on the main continent in two parts, one atop a high hill and the other beside a low river. The city has three large bells, each with its own name and distinctive voice, that are rung frequently. The surrounding area is a land of rolling hills, terraced farms, and white-stucco villages. The climate is fairly mild. Norvosi can be recognized by their dyed and upswept mustaches. The city is run by a council of magisters that are known to pay tribute to passing Dothraki khalasars. It is also home to a group of bearded priests that train elite guardsmen. These guardsmen swear oaths of duty and consider themselves wedded to their distinctive long axes.\n* '''Qohor''' is situated on the main continent, in the vast Forest of Qohor. It is known for its fine tapestries and its smiths, who have the rare ability to reforge Valyrian steel, even directly infusing the metal with a variety of different colors. The Black Goat is a prominent god in the city. Qohor's city guard has been composed solely of Unsullied eunuch slave soldiers ever since the Battle of the Three Thousand, when 3,000 Unsullied soldiers successfully defended the city against over 25,000 Dothraki horsemen. Guardsmen tie braids of human hair to their spears to commemorate the Dothraki cutting their braids in salute to Qohor's defenders.\n* '''Tyrosh''', a coastal city-state ruled by an Archon, is infamous for its avarice. Traders deal extensively in slaves and Tyroshi pear brandy. The city features an abundance of pleasure houses, but they are not as highly regarded as those in Lys. Tyroshi master armorsmiths make intricate armor in fantastic shapes. Tyrosh is a popular center for the hiring of sellswords. The city is often drawn into the ongoing conflicts over the Disputed Lands and the Stepstones. The Tyroshi often wear forked beards and pointed mustaches dyed in bright colors. The character Daario Naharis is from Tyrosh.\n\n===Central Essos===\nThis section covers the Essos locations east of the Free Cities that Daenerys Targeryen passes through on her travels in ''A Game of Thrones'' and ''A Clash of Kings'' before moving on to Slaver's Bay.\n\n==== Valyria ====\nValyria is a peninsula in South-Central Essos, west of Slaver's Bay. Before the Doom of Valyria, it was the seat of the Valyrian Freehold, a massive empire thousands of years old. The Valyrians are characterized by their silver hair and violet eyes. Valyria was called The Freehold because every man who owned land was allowed to vote for their leaders. The Valyrians also used slaves to mine the Fourteen Flames, a series of volcanoes rich with ore. They subjugated the Ghiscari and the Rhoynar and established all of the Free Cities, save Braavos. They did this through their knowledge of dragonlore. Many Valyrians rode dragons. However, hundreds of years ago, an event known as the Doom of Valyria, apparently involving a violent eruption of the Fourteen Flames, destroyed the Freehold and made Valyria an archipelago. The Targaryens are of the blood of old Valyria, who escaped before The Doom.\n\n====Dothraki Sea {{anchor|The Dothraki Sea|Dothraki Sea|Vaes Dothrak}}====\nThe Dothraki Sea is a vast, flat grassland on Essos. It is inhabited by the Dothraki people, a copper-skinned race of warlike nomads with their [[Dothraki language|own language]] and unique culture. The Dothraki live in hordes called khalasars, each led by a chief called a khal. Khalasars are broken into groups, called khas, which are each led by one of the khal's captains, called kos. Each khal and his khalasar owe fealty to a ruling council of royal priestesses, called the dosh khaleen, whose members are each a former khal's consort, called a khaleesi during the reign of her husband, one who became part of the dosh khaleen following his death.\n\nDothraki are expert riders and their horses are of prime importance in their culture, used for food, transportation, raw materials, warfare, and establishing social standing. They regularly raid other peoples.\n\nGeorge R. R. Martin said \"The Dothraki were actually fashioned as an amalgam of a number of [[steppe]] and [[plains cultures]] ... [[Mongols]] and [[Huns]], certainly, but also [[Alans]], [[Sioux]], [[Cheyenne]], and various other [[Amerindian]] tribes ... seasoned with a dash of pure fantasy. So any resemblance to [[Arabs]] or [[Turkish people|Turks]] is coincidental. Well, except to the extent that the [[Turkic peoples|[historic] Turks]] were also originally horsemen of the steppes, not unlike the Alans, Huns, and the rest.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/> However, he also noted that \"In general, though, while I do draw inspiration from history, I try to avoid direct one-for-one transplants, [so] it would not be correct to say that the Dothraki are Mongols.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\nThe Dothraki have only one permanent city, called Vaes Dothrak, which serves as their capital. The dosh khaleen hold the city as their seat. It is filled with statues stolen from other cities the Dothraki conquered or raided. There is a law that no Dothraki may shed blood within the boundaries of Vaes Dothrak and that those who do are cursed. Two gigantic bronze stallions, whose hooves meet midair, form an arch above the entryway to the city.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/> For the first season of the TV adaptation, Sandy Brae in the [[Mourne Mountains]] of northern Ireland was chosen to stand in for Vaes Dothrak; the bronze stallions making up the Horse Gate as the main entrance of Vaes Dothrak were later [[Computer-generated imagery|C.G.I.ed]] on two pedestals erected on location.<ref group=S name=mogot_swarming/>\n\n====Lhazar====\nLhazar is an area of the semi-arid lands south of the Dothraki Sea. A region of pastures and hills, it is inhabited by the Lhazareen, a peaceful people with bronze skin, flat faces, and almond eyes. They are predominantly shepherds, called the Lamb Men by the Dothraki, who frequently prey on them. They worship a god called the Great Shepherd and believe that all of humanity is part of a single flock.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=}} The scenes at the village of the Lamb Men that is sacked by the Dothraki were filmed in [[Malta]], at the farming town of [[Manikata]].<ref group=S name=magot_dothraki/>\n\n===Slaver's Bay {{anchor|Slaver's Bay|Slavers Bay|Slavers' Bay}}===\nSlaver's Bay is a marginal sea of the Summer Sea,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} lying to the south of the Dothraki Sea, to the west of Lhazar and thousands of leagues to the east of the Free Cities.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 329\u2013330}} The climate is very hot.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 322\u2013323}} After a first mention in ''A Game of Thrones'' in relation to slavery,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 667}} Daenerys Targaryen conquers the three great Slaver's Bay port city-states Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen in ''A Storm of Swords''. She stays in Meereen throughout most of ''A Dance with Dragons''.\n\nThe cities were built from the rubble of Old Ghis, an ancient rival of Valyria that was crushed by Valyria thousands of years before the series' events.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}}{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 371\u2013373}} The economies of the cities are largely based on slave labor and the slave trade.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} Treatment of slaves is often harsh,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} while citizens live in relative luxury. Professional soldiers of all three cities wear outlandish costumes and hairstyles that limit their usefulness in battle. The cities' militaries are highly dependent on additional slave and mercenary armies for the actual fighting.\n\nPresent inhabitants of the bay are a mixed race that no longer speak the old Ghiscari tongue but variations of High Valyrian with a characteristic growl.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The ancient folk of Ghis, who name themselves the harpy's sons in Astapor, are said to have bristly red-black hair.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 311\u2013320}} The Good Masters of Astapor all appear alike to Daenerys as \"thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes.

The city is similar to Astapor in architecture except for its smaller size and its use of yellow brick in its buildings instead of red. The slavers of Yunkai are known as the Wise Masters. Because of the city's lack of Unsullied, it relies on a mixed professional and slave army of approximately 4,000 with at least 1,000 mercenaries. Typical for Ghiscari, Yunkai soldiers wear impractical armor and oiled hair teased into enormous shapes, limiting their effectiveness.\n\nYunkish scenes were filmed in [[A\u00eft Benhaddou]], Morocco in the TV show.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n====Meereen====\nThe largest of the three slaver cities, Meereen has a population equaling that of Astapor and Yunkai combined. The city has architecture similar to that of its neighbors, but it is made of bricks of many colors. Its landscape is dominated by a massive pyramid, named the Great Pyramid, and the Temple of Graces, which is capped by a golden dome. Meereen is unique among the Ghiscari cities in that it is filled with many temples and pyramids. The slavers of Meereen are known as the Great Masters. They field a force of lancers equipped in traditionally extravagant Ghiscari fashion with scales of copper and lances as long as fourteen feet. It is built on the banks of the river Skahadhazan.\n\nFor the [[Game of Thrones|HBO television series]], many of the scenes in Meereen were filmed in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and the [[Fortress of Klis]], Croatia. In Season 5, Daznak's Pit in the city was shot in the Plaza de Toros in [[Osuna]], Spain.<ref group=\"S\" name=\"Skyscanner\"/>\n\n=== Eastern Essos ===\n====Red Waste {{anchor|The Red Waste}}====\nThe Red Waste is a great desert-like area in the eastern part of Essos. Not much is known about it, since it was only briefly seen in ''A Clash of Kings'' when Daenerys Targaryen and her ''khalasar'' crossed it. The only known settlement in the region, Vaes Tolorro, is in ruins.\n\n====Qarth====\nFirst mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'',{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} the city of Qarth has not yet appeared on any maps in the books. However, the HBO ''Viewer's Guide'' world map and the opening titles of the TV series' second season show Qarth located at a strait between the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea in the south-east of Essos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/> Upon Daenerys' first visit to Qarth in ''A Clash of Kings'', the warlock Pyat Pree describes his city as the center of the world and as a gateway of commerce and culture between the east and west, and the north and south. The reader learns through Daenerys's eyes that the city is surrounded by three graded walls of thirty to fifty feet in height, respectively engraved with portraits of animals, war, and lovemaking. The city's buildings are of many colors, including rose, violet, and [[umber]]. Slender towers rise throughout the city, fountains adorn every square, and thousands of colored birds, blooming trees and flowers fill the city.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The TV adaptation filmed Qarth on the island of [[Lokrum]] near [[Dubrovnik]] and constructed a set at the Dubac quarry in Croatia to double for the gates of Qarth.<ref group=S name=go_hbofilmed/>\n\nThe Qartheen are described as \"tall pale folk in linen and [[samite]] and tiger fur\", with the women wearing gowns that leave one breast bare, while the men sport beaded silk skirts.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} Daenerys perceives them as \"nothing if not polite\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Slaves serve their needs.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}} The Pureborn, descendants of the city's ancient kings and queens, govern Qarth and also command the city's defenses.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Three principal merchant groups battle amongst themselves and against the Pureborn for dominance of the city: the Thirteen, the Ancient Guild of Spicers, and the Tourmaline Brotherhood.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth's warlocks, whose lips are turned blue from a potion called \"the shade of the evening\", are said to brood over these factions; they are still feared although their power and prestige have waned over the years.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 422\u2013426}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Qarth is also home to the Sorrowful Men, a guild of assassins named so for whispering \"I am so sorry,\" before killing their victims.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} Daenerys leaves Qarth again at the end of ''A Clash of Kings''.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 884}}\n\n=== Unvisited lands {{anchor|Other lands|Unvisited lands}} ===\n{{for|Valyria|#Essos{{!}}\u00a7 World and fictional history \u00a7\u00a7 Essos}}\n====Asshai and the Shadow Lands {{anchor|Asshai|The Shadow Lands|Asshai and the Shadow Lands}}====\nAsshai and the Shadow Lands are mysterious locations in the ''Ice and Fire'' world. They are first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones''{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, pp. 102\u2013104}} and were first mapped in ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'', lying on the far east of the known world. Martin is unsure if the books will ever take the readers to Asshai, but said that readers may learn more through the POV character Melisandre (who originates from Asshai{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Prologue, pp. 20\u201321}}) or through the memories and mentions of other characters.<ref group=S name=indigo_iv1/> Jorah Mormont describes Asshai as a port city far to the south of the Dothraki sea, at the end of the known world.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VIII, pp. 707, 710}} Asshai exports such goods as black [[amethyst]]s,{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Sansa V, p. 833}} amber and [[obsidian|dragonglass]].{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 575\u2013577}} At another time, Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys of great kingdoms to the east of the Red Waste, and lists Asshai by the Shadow as one of the cities full of wonders there.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys I, p. 192}} According to Martin, all ship travels between Westeros and Asshai go via the Summer Sea and the Jade Sea through the straits at Qarth, and that the common folk still believe the world to be flat.<ref group=S name=ssm_asshaitrade/> However, according to Martin, \"Asshai is not nearly important to trade as Yi Ti, and the rich port cities of Yi Ti (and Leng) and more easily reached via Qarth.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog121031/> Quaithe of the Shadow prophesies Daenerys in Qarth that \"To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east [...] and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\" When Daenerys interprets this to mean she must go to Asshai, Quaithe says she would find the truth there.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 583}}\n\nThere are many tales about the Shadow Lands, though how much truth they hold is unclear. The Dothraki believe that ghost grass covers the Shadow Lands, with stalks that glow in the dark and grow taller than a man on horseback.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 226}} Daenerys heard that \"spellsingers, warlocks, and aeromancers practiced their arts openly in Asshai, while shadowbinders and bloodmages worked terrible sorceries in the black of night\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} There are also Westerosi maesters in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} The mages of Asshai teach others their healing powers,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VII, p. 672}} but also their spells requiring blood sacrifice.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VIII, pp. 707, 710}} Ancient books of Asshai record the Azor Ahai prophecy followed by members of the [[R'hllor]] faith.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}} Daenerys heard that dragons themselves originated from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai and the islands of the Jade Sea, and they possibly still live there.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Bran dreams of flying Dragons in Asshai.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Bran III, p. 163}} The petrified dragon eggs Illyrio gives to Daenerys are said to come from the Shadow Lands.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys II, p. 104}} The \"dour and frightening\" Shadow Men cover their bodies in tattoos and wear lacquered wooden masks,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} and the appearance of the Asshai'i is described as dark and solemn.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} The Dothraki believe the Asshai'i to be the spawn of shadows.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys III, p. 583}} The Asshai'i have a language of their own.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Davos I, pp. 148, 150}}\n\n====Ibben====\nIbben is a collection of islands north of Essos in the Bay of Whales. The largest of these islands is Ib, which contains the cities Port of Ibben and Ib Nor. Until the Doom of Valyria, Ibben was ruled by a God-King. Now power is held by the Shadow Council, which is made up of nobles, priests, and wealthy guildsmen. Ibben is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', where Tyrion talks of rumors that mammoths \"roam the cold wastes beyond the Port of Ibben\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Tyrion II, p. 122}} In 2002, Martin said the narrative would \"probably not\" take readers to Ibben, which he described as a \"cold, mountainous, [[Iceland]]-sized island\" (i.e. 40,000 [[square miles]]) in the Shivering Sea, with the Port of Ibben as the major city; some Ibbenese also live on smaller islands nearby or in colonies on Essos.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> Ibben is unmapped in the books as of ''A Dance with Dragons'', but similar to Martin's descriptions,<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> the HBO ''Viewer's Guide'' world map gives the island's location as to the north-east of Essos.<ref group=S name=hbo_viewersguide_map/> Martin said that due to a large [[whale]] population in the Shivering sea, many of the Ibbenses were [[whaler]]s.<ref group=S name=ssm_ibbenarmor/> The Ibbenses are known to chew whale blubber in order to maintain their metabolism in the cold climate. Several characters see Ibbenese whalers and [[Cog (ship)|cogs]] at the ports of King's Landing,{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Catelyn IV, p. 169}} Braavos,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Maidenpool,{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Brienne V, p. 521}} Eastwatch-by-the-Sea,{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Jon IX, p. 585}} and the Iron Islands.{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Theon I, pp. 172\u2013173}} The novels describe the people of Ibben as squat and hairy; Arya even meets an Ibbenese woman with a mustache.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Tyrion and Varys meet foul-smelling Ibbenese, {{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Jaime III, p. 296}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} who \"were as fond of axes as they were of each other\".{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Tyrion VII, p. 452}} Arya sees \"a dark brutal axeman from Ib\" in her dreams.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Arya I, p. 51}} The Ibbenese are said to speak with low, raspy voices and to have their own language.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Prologue, p. 11}}{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}}\n\n====Yi Ti====\nThe novels repeatedly describe Yi Ti as a city full of wonders, lying in the far east.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys X, p. 799}}{{sfn|''A Clash of Kings''|loc=Daenerys I, p. 192}} As of ''A Dance with Dragons'', Yi Ti has not appeared on any maps in the books, but Martin specified that \"Yi Ti is to the south east of Qarth, generally, across the Jade Sea.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_yiti/> The city is first mentioned in ''A Game of Thrones'', talking of rumors that \"basilisks infested the jungles of Yi Ti\".{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys III, pp. 234\u2013235}} Sailor stories presented in ''A Feast for Crows'' mention that a grey plague has hit Yi Ti.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Queenmaker, pp. 425\u2013426}} The god of the people of Yi Ti is called the Lion of Night.{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=Cat of the Canals, pp. 722\u2013728}} Daenerys sees people of Yi Ti as bright-eyed men in monkey-tail hats in the markets of Vaes Dothrak.{{sfn|''A Game of Thrones''|loc=Daenerys VI, p. 587}} Martin is unsure \"to what extent those peoples [like of Yi Ti] will ever enter this present story, however... their lands are very far away.\"<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n====Plains of Jogos Nhai====\nNorth of Yi Ti, the Plain of Jogos Nhai are windswept, with rolling hills. They are dominated by a race of mounted warriors called the Jogos Nhai. The Jogos Nhai live in [[yurt]]s and tents, and are a nomadic people. They are short, squat, and have large heads and small faces. Men and women both have pointed skulls, a result of their custom of binding the heads of newborns. They also ride zorses, a striped mount that can withstand much more than average horse. The Jogos Nhai do not fight between themselves, and live in small clans bound by blood. They live in a state of perpetual war with outsiders. Each tribe is commanded by a ''jhat'', or war chief, and a moonsinger, who is a priestess, healer, and judge. Moonsingers are generally female, and ''jhats'' are mostly male. (Paraphrased from ''[[The World of Ice & Fire|The World of Ice and Fire]])''\n\n==Sothoryos {{anchor|Sothoryos|Sothoros|Sothyros}}==\nTo the south of Essos is the continent of Sothoryos{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} (mistakenly spelled Sothoros in early novels).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} Sothoryos is the third continent of the known world, and is vast, plague-ridden, covered in [[jungle]]s, and largely unexplored. It is reported to be as large as Essos and described as a \"land without end\" by Jaenara Belaerys, a Valyrian dragonlord from before the Doom of Valyria.  \n\nThe continent is first named on a map in ''A Storm of Swords'' (2000), showing the cities of Yeen and Zamettar on it.{{sfn|''A Storm of Swords''|loc=Map}} The narrative itself first refers to the continent in ''A Feast for Crows'' (2005).{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} Martin had described Sothoryos in 2002 as \"the southern continent, roughly equivalent to [[Africa]], jungly, plague-ridden, and largely unexplored.\"<ref group=S name=ssm_geographicalinformation/> The novels provide little other information. The swampy nature of Sothoryos is briefly referenced by Victarion in ''A Dance with Dragons'',{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} and [[teak]] from Sothoryos is said to be used to build ships.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys V, p. 395}} A corsair's road runs along the continent's northern coast.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=The Iron Suitor, pp. 744\u2013746}} ''A Dance with Dragons'' refers to the diseases on Sothoryos in regards to the wealthy but sick Yunkai slave trader Yezzan zo Qaggaz.{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion X, p. 628}}{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Tyrion XI, p. 756}} Victarion describes some people as \"squat and hairy as the apes of Sothoros\",{{sfn|''A Feast for Crows''|loc=The Iron Captain, p. 365}} and some people fighting in Daznak's Pit for Daenerys's entertainment in ''A Dance with Dragons'' are described as \"[[brindle]]-skinned half-men from the jungles of Sothoros\".{{sfn|''A Dance with Dragons''|loc=Daenerys IX, p. 693}} Martin said that, unlike other peoples in the novels, the brindled men of Sothoryos were pure fantasy constructs.<ref group=S name=grrm_blog120203/>\n\n==Ulthos {{anchor|Ulthos}}==\nThe map collection ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' also shows the north tip of a landmass named \"Ulthos\" to the south of Essos and east of Sothoryos. Asked whether this was another continent, Martin replied, \"Well, it's a large landmass. I am a little unclear on the formal definition of 'continent' as opposed to 'big island.' Also on the size of Ulthos, which after all sits at the edge of the known world.

Traditionally, only the most perfect elephants could successfully defend the throne, and very great care was taken in raising them. Kham grows up forming close relations to his elephant, Por Yai and his calf, Kohrn. During [[Songkran (Thailand)|Songkran]] festival, the elephants are stolen with help from Mr. Suthep, a local [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and his son who are collaborating with elephant poachers. Kham raids Mr. Suthep's house and beats up the poachers. He intimidates Suthep into telling him that the elephants are in the hands of Johnny, a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Organized crime|gangster]] who runs a Thai restaurant named Tom Yum Goong Otob in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].\n\nKham arrives in Sydney and is immediately taken hostage by a wanted thief posing as a taxi driver. Sydney police officers Mark [[Petchtai Wongkamlao]], a Thai-Australian, and his partner Rick corner the thief while he holds Kham at gunpoint. However, a second policeman, Inspector Vincent, has been following Kham since he left the airport. First he shoots the thief. After the thief drops dead, he tries to shoot at Kham. Mark, who is puzzled at Vincent's actions, questions why did that. Vincent argues that Kham wasn't a hostage and orders Mark and Rick to retrieve him, which they eventually do. In the car, Kham tells Mark that he's searching for relatives (but he doesn't directly tell him that they are elephants). Along the way, they spot Johnny at the Tom Yum Goong restaurant. Kham becomes erratic and urges Mark and Rick to arrest him, but Mark argues that he can't because Kham is offering no proof of a crime. Kham causes the car to crash and he evades the police. He follows Johnny to a bridge, but Johnny escapes, forcing Kham to fight his henchmen. Kham coerces one of the henchman to lead him to Johnny's hideout, interrupting a drug deal. Outraged, Johnny summons countless [[extreme sports]] enthusiasts, who arrive to fight Kham. After defeating the thugs, Kham is exhausted and falls asleep in an alley. A prostitute named Pla ([[Bongkoj Khongmalai]]), who met Kham earlier when he confronted Johnny, brings him to her apartment. In his sleep, he dreams of an epic battle involving war elephants and the Jaturangkabart, the elephant protectors. When Pla leaves, Kham wakes up to the sound of police sirens and must escape.\n\nMark and Rick are taken off the case and reassigned to provide security for the Police Commissioner's meeting with Mr. Sim. In that meeting, Pla acts as a hostess girl and dancer to the two men. During the meeting, Mr. Sim and the Commissioner are murdered by someone hired by Vincent. However, the murder is caught on the commissioner's camera. Vincent kills Rick and puts the blame on Mark. Mark escapes, but is later captured.\n\nWith Pla's help, Kham enters Tom Yum Goong Otob. He fights his way into the VIP area and reaches the dining hall at the top. Kham demands, \"Where are my elephants?\" and is met with the laughter of Johnny and his men. Johnny taunts Kham with Kohrn's bell. This enrages Kham and he fights and defeats his opponents. He enters the storage area, containing various exotic animals ready to be butchered and eaten. Kham finds and frees Mark and Kohrn, escaping minutes before the police arrive. Meanwhile, Madame Rose is made the new leader of the Chinese gang after she murders two other possible successors.\n\nInspector Vincent initiates a search for Kham and Mark, who are hiding in a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery. Soon after their departure, the monastery is set on fire by Vincent and his men. Believing that the temple and its inhabitants might be in danger, Mark and Kham decide to turn around and come back. When they arrive, Kham is confronted by three assassins: a fierce [[capoeira|capoerista]] ([[Lateef Crowder]]), a sword-wielding [[Wushu (sport)|wushu]] ([[Jon Foo]]) expert, and a giant wrestler ([[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nate Jones]]). Kham defeats the capoerista and wushu expert, but the large wrestler proves too strong for Kham. The wrestler gains the upper hand on Kham, but the police arrive, and Mark comes to help him flee. By morning, Kham goes on his way. Mark is discovered by several policemen and sent to deal with Inspector Vincent, whom Pla has revealed to be the murderer.\n\nKham arrives at a conference hall where Madame Rose is having a press conference. Kohrn runs in, scaring off everyone while Kham engages the gangsters. Mark apprehends Vincent, but Johnny arrives and fatally shoots Vincent to \"settle the score.\"\n\nKham finds himself with Kohrn in a huge room, and he is shown the skeleton of Por Yai, encrusted with jewels as a gift to Madame Rose. Her men then attack Kham, and he attacks them more brutally than previously seen, by breaking many of the men's arms and legs. The wrestler from the monastery is called in, along with three others. Kohrn is thrown through a glass wall, and Kham is knocked into the elephant ornament, causing two leg bones to fall off. Kham realizes that the tendons are the most vulnerable and important part of an elephant to protect, and with this knowledge he defeats the four brute wrestlers by using sharp ends of the elephant bones to slice their tendons. He stops Madame Rose before she can escape in a [[helicopter]], and they both crash into the room below. Kham's fall is broken by Por Yai's tusks.\n\nBack in the lobby, Mark is shown Pla, and forgiven by his boss, Inspector Lamond. He is given a new partner who speaks Thai. Mark is then interviewed by a reporter about Kham. Finally, a narration from Mark is heard, with scenes of Kham's childhood shown. Mark explains that [[Thai people]] treat elephants like they are their brothers, and they hate people who hurt them. [[Thai National Anthem|Thais love peace, but dislike people who take liberties.]] Kham is finally reunited with Kohrn.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Tony Jaa]] as Kham, the last of a family line of guards who once watched over the [[Chakri Dynasty|King of Thailand's]] [[war elephant]]s. Kham is characterized by the juxtaposition of his red [[krama]] scarf throughout the film. As he grows up, he bonds closely with his elephant Por Yai and its calf, Korn. When they are stolen, Kham journeys to Sydney, Australia to get them back. Actor [[Nutdanai Kong]] portrays 9-year-old Kham.\n*Sotorn Rungruaeng as Kham's father, who taught Kham the fighting style of the Jaturangkabat, the royal guardians of the Thai war elephants. It has been Kham's father's dream that his elephant Por Yai would be selected as one of the Royal Thai elephants. However, during a fake inspection staged by a local member of parliament, his elephants are stolen, and he is wounded by a gunshot.\n*[[Petchtai Wongkamlao]] as Sergeant Mark, a Thai-Australian policeman who patrols an area of Sydney populated by Asians. He is so popular there that the locals often do him favors like giving him free mangoes and haircuts.\n*[[Bongkoj Khongmalai]] as Pla, a Thai student in Sydney who is forced to be a [[call girl]] to repay the debt of her former boyfriend, the late Wittaya who used to own Tom Yum Goong Otob, a Thai restaurant.\n*[[Jin Xing|Xing Jin]] as Madame Rose, a transsexual member of a Chinese gang in Sydney, who is in conflict with the leader, her Uncle Mr. Sim.\n*[[Damian De Montemas]] as Inspector Vincent, a corrupt policeman in Sydney who collaborates with Madame Rose.\n*David Asavanond as Officer Rick, Sergeant Mark's partner.\n*[[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] (credited as Nathan B.

He is responsible for her drug deals and the running of the Tom Yum Goong Otob.\n*[[Lateef Crowder]] as a [[capoeira|capoerista]] who fights Kham in the Buddhist monastery. He has the word ''Pray'' carved to his chest.\n*[[Jon Foo]] (Jonathan Patrick Foo) as a [[Wushu (term)|wushu]] exponent who is Kham's second opponent in the monastery.\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n* [[Pumwaree Yodkamol]], who co-starred in ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'', is seen briefly, portraying a Thai tourist in a Sydney street scene. She berates a friend of hers about DVD piracy.\n* Wannakit Sirioput who also co starred in Ong Bak (as Don) cameos at the end of the film as Mark's new partner.\n* An [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] portrays [[Jackie Chan]], whom Kham briefly encounters at the airport in Sydney. In real life, Chan is one of Jaa's idols .{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n* Another impressionist portrays Thai rocker [[Loso|Sek Loso]], the pitchman for the M-150 energy drink, which is among the brands with [[product placement]] throughout the film.\n* Actors [[Don Ferguson (actor)|Don Ferguson]], [[Erik Markus Schuetz]], [[Lex de Groot]] (uncredited) and [[Damian Mavis]] (uncredited) appear as bodyguards.\n\n==Production==\n===Technical aspects===\nCompared to ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'', which was noted for its lack of [[wirework]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], this movie uses CGI in several scenes, from the obvious (helicopter scene, and an entirely computer-animated dream sequence), to the subtle (a glass window shattering in the four-minute [[steadicam]] [[long take]] that follows Jaa up several flights of stairs as he dispatches thug after thug in dramatic fashion).\n\nThe largest example of CGI is Tony Jaa's dramatic leap from the top of a building to attack Madame Rose with a double knee attack. While the background was blue screen with the Australian backdrop added in post production, the long fall shown on screen was real as Jaa and a stuntperson pulled the scene off, landing on large mats below. Even in scenes like this with blue screen, normally a stunt double would be called in for the lead actor, but Jaa once again made sure he did the stunt himself.\n\n===Fighting styles===\nTony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai created a new style of [[Muay Thai]] for this movie called ''muay kodchasaan''  (\u0e21\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e0a\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e23 roughly translated as \"elephant boxing\"), emphasizing grappling moves. \"I wanted to show the art of the elephant combined with muay Thai,\" Tony told the Associated Press in an interview, adding that the moves imitate how an elephant would defend itself, with the arms acting as the trunk.\n\n===Stuntwork===\nMany aspiring stuntmen sent demo tapes, hoping to be cast in the film. An American stunt actor was cast but did not properly take the impact and was injured on the first take. \"He kicked me, I used my arm to block his kick, and he fell down hard,\" Tony told the Associated Press.\n\nHowever, no one was hospitalized in the making of the film, with injuries limited to \"bumps and bruises, muscle tears, a little something like that. Nothing major,\" Tony said.<ref name=\"Pearson\">Pearson, Ryan. 5 September 2006. [http://asap.ap.org/stories/851019.s \"Breaking down the beatdown\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929212221/http://asap.ap.org/stories/851019.s |date=2007-09-29 }}, Associated Press (retrieved 4 January 2007).</ref>\n\nThe fights include duels with:\n* Wushu practitioner (portrayed by [[John Foo]]).\n* A Vietnamese triad captain (portrayed by ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-man]]'' [[stunt double]] Johnny Nguyen).\n* A [[capoeira|capoeirista]] (portrayed by [[Lateef Crowder]] of the [[ZeroGravity (stunt team)|ZeroGravity]] stunt team).\n* An extraordinarily large and strong bodyguard (portrayed by former [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestler [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]]).\n* A whip-wielding [[Triad society|triad]] boss (portrayed by world-renowned [[ballerina]] [[Jing Xing]]).\n* Two [[taekwondo]] fighters (portrayed by [[Daniel O'Neill (actor)|Daniel O'Neill]] and [[Dean Alexandrou]]) in a deleted two-vs-one scene in the temple.\n\n==Alternative versions==\nInternational sales rights (outside Asia) were purchased by [[TF1]], which made suggestions for re-editing to director [[Prachya Pinkaew]], who then made some cuts that slightly reduce the film's running time from its original 108 minutes.\n\nThe UK title is ''Warrior King'', and the theatrical release was on 28 July 2006. In France and Belgium, the title is ''L'Honneur du dragon'', and in the Netherlands and other European it is ''Honour of the Dragon''. In Cambodia, the film is called ''Neak Prodal Junboth''.<!--What does it mean?--> In India, it was named ''Haathi Mere Saathi'' (literally ''elephant, my partner''), from a name of another Bollywood [[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|film]] starring [[Rajesh Khanna]].\n\n=== Deleted scenes ===\nA two-vs-one fight scene taking place in the burning temple near the end of the film was deleted from currently released versions of the film. The taekwondo sequence, featuring Dean Alexandrou and [[Daniel O'Neill (actor)|Daniel O'Neill]] is shown in part in nearly all promotional trailers for the film, but was cut due to unknown reasons from the final release. However footage can be seen in the making-of featurettes, and some behind-the-scenes VCDs. The two bodies are seen to mysteriously appear on the temple floor, near the beginning of the temple fight scene.\n\nPrachya Pinkaew stated that he trimmed several of the fight scenes due to their length. Some of these include the sequence on the bridge in Sydney, when Kham confronts Johnny and his henchmen for the first time. One can see in certain trailers Kham launching himself off of the shoulders of one henchmen to elbow the other one. Another sequence that he trimmed considerably was the warehouse fight scene.\n\nIn the U.S. release of ''Tom-Yum-Goong'', where it was named ''The Protector'', there is a deleted scene of Kham beginning his ambush of the house party by the criminal group who stole his elephants. In all of its releases, the fight sequence begins with Tony Jaa throwing a henchman down the stairs. But this deleted scene shows where the fight really began.\n\n===US release as ''The Protector''===\n[[The Weinstein Company]] purchased the U.S. distribution rights for ''Tom-Yum-Goong'' and retitled it ''The Protector'' (also the name of a [[The Protector (1985 film)|1985 film]] starring [[Jackie Chan]]). This version was released theatrically on 8 September 2006. It was released in January 2007 on DVD on The Weinstein Company's [[Dragon Dynasty]] label in a two-disc set that includes both the U.S. edit and the original Thai version of the film.<ref>[http://adg.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=1571&pid=15007&st=0&#entry15007 Tom Yum Goong DVD comparison, Premier Asia vs Dragon Dynasty] (retrieved 11 January 2007).</ref>\n\nFor the US theatrical cut, the film's length was reduced by at least 25 minutes, going so far as to trim down some of the fight scenes, even though it was given an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|\"R\" rating]] restricting audiences to people aged 17 and over. Out of all cuts outside of Thailand, it is the shortest cut of the film, even more so than the European cuts. It also features a new score by [[Rza|RZA]]. Some parts of the missing footage (including cuts to the \"bone breaker\" fight and Madame Rose envisioning herself in a red dress as queen) appeared in the U.S. trailer and TV Spots.\n\nAlso, ''The Protector'' is partially subtitled and partially dubbed, with all of Jaa's dialogue subtitled. Several changes were made to the plot through editing and subtitles that did not match the spoken Thai and Chinese dialogue.\n\nChanges that were made to the US theatrical release include:\n* The historical role of the Thai warriors is given in more detail in the opening prologue\n* Scenes of TV reporters given tour of Sydney by Sgt. Mark are removed.\n* Scenes of Sgt. Mark handling robbery and releasing the would-be assassin are removed.\n* Kham's father, rather than being injured, died by the gunshot.\n* Tony Jaa's lines now include \"You killed my father!\"\n* Madame Rose loses face and is denied a \"security\" contract over bad turtle soup instead of the Chinese business leader's refusal to deal because of bad terms.\n* Madame Rose's [[transsexual]]ity is never mentioned.\n* The ending has been trimmed to imply that Madame Rose is dead rather than just injured after her fall through the roof.\n* Johnny does not return to kill Vincent after Vincent was apprehended by Mark.\n* Exposition is given to further explain the cutting of tendons to defeat the bruisers at the end.\n* The ending epilogue given by Sgt. Mark in the US version is significantly different and nobler than the Thai version, which is whimsical and comic relief in tone and is much less concerned with resolution.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Tom-Yum-Goong'' opened in Thailand on 11 August 2005, and grossed US$1,609,720 in its first weekend and was No. 1 at the Thai box office (normally dominated by Hollywood imports) for two weeks in a row.<ref name = \"MojoThai\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/thailand/?yr=2005&currency=us&p=.htm 2005 Thailand Box Office Index], [[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved 4 January 2006.</ref> It ended its Thai run with US$4,417,800, blockbuster business by Thai standards.<ref name = \"MojoThai2\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/thailand/?yr=2005&wk=35&p=.htm Thailand Box Office 1\u20134 September 2005], [[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved 4 January 2006.</ref>\n\n[[The Weinstein Company]] released ''Tom-Yum-Goong'' in North America in a heavily edited version entitled ''The Protector'', which was the third release by their ''[[Dragon Dynasty]]'' label.

The critical consensus reads: Despite some impressive fight scenes, this trimmed-down version of the Thai action pic is an off-putting mix of scant plot, choppy editing, and confusing subtitles and dubbing.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=The Protector (Tom yum goong) (Warrior King) (2005)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/protector|language=en|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nA sequel, ''[[Tom Yum Goong 2]]'', was released in 2013.

He is so popular there that the locals often do him favors like giving him free mangoes and haircuts.\n*[[Bongkoj Khongmalai]] as Pla, a Thai student in Sydney who is forced to be a [[call girl]] to repay the debt of her former boyfriend, the late Wittaya who used to own Tom Yum Goong Otob, a Thai restaurant.\n*[[Jin Xing|Xing Jin]] as Madame Rose, a transsexual member of a Chinese gang in Sydney, who is in conflict with the leader, her Uncle Mr. Sim.\n*[[Damian De Montemas]] as Inspector Vincent, a corrupt policeman in Sydney who collaborates with Madame Rose.\n*David Asavanond as Officer Rick, Sergeant Mark's partner.\n*[[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]] (credited as Nathan B. Jones) as T.K., a giant wrestler who proves to be more than a match for Kham.\n*[[Johnny Tr\u00ed Nguy\u1ec5n|Johnny Tri Nguyen]] as Johnny, a Vietnamese gangster who is a subordinate of Madame Rose. He is responsible for her drug deals and the running of the Tom Yum Goong Otob.\n*[[Lateef Crowder]] as a [[capoeira|capoerista]] who fights Kham in the Buddhist monastery. He has the word ''Pray'' carved to his chest.\n*[[Jon Foo]] (Jonathan Patrick Foo) as a [[Wushu (term)|wushu]] exponent who is Kham's second opponent in the monastery.\n\n===Cameo appearances===\n* [[Pumwaree Yodkamol]], who co-starred in ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'', is seen briefly, portraying a Thai tourist in a Sydney street scene. She berates a friend of hers about DVD piracy.\n* Wannakit Sirioput who also co starred in Ong Bak (as Don) cameos at the end of the film as Mark's new partner.\n* An [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] portrays [[Jackie Chan]], whom Kham briefly encounters at the airport in Sydney. In real life, Chan is one of Jaa's idols .{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n* Another impressionist portrays Thai rocker [[Loso|Sek Loso]], the pitchman for the M-150 energy drink, which is among the brands with [[product placement]] throughout the film.\n* Actors [[Don Ferguson (actor)|Don Ferguson]], [[Erik Markus Schuetz]], [[Lex de Groot]] (uncredited) and [[Damian Mavis]] (uncredited) appear as bodyguards.\n\n==Production==\n===Technical aspects===\nCompared to ''[[Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior]]'', which was noted for its lack of [[wirework]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], this movie uses CGI in several scenes, from the obvious (helicopter scene, and an entirely computer-animated dream sequence), to the subtle (a glass window shattering in the four-minute [[steadicam]] [[long take]] that follows Jaa up several flights of stairs as he dispatches thug after thug in dramatic fashion).\n\nThe largest example of CGI is Tony Jaa's dramatic leap from the top of a building to attack Madame Rose with a double knee attack. While the background was blue screen with the Australian backdrop added in post production, the long fall shown on screen was real as Jaa and a stuntperson pulled the scene off, landing on large mats below. Even in scenes like this with blue screen, normally a stunt double would be called in for the lead actor, but Jaa once again made sure he did the stunt himself.\n\n===Fighting styles===\nTony Jaa and Panna Rittikrai created a new style of [[Muay Thai]] for this movie called ''muay kodchasaan''  (\u0e21\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e0a\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e23 roughly translated as \"elephant boxing\"), emphasizing grappling moves. \"I wanted to show the art of the elephant combined with muay Thai,\" Tony told the Associated Press in an interview, adding that the moves imitate how an elephant would defend itself, with the arms acting as the trunk.\n\n===Stuntwork===\nMany aspiring stuntmen sent demo tapes, hoping to be cast in the film. An American stunt actor was cast but did not properly take the impact and was injured on the first take. \"He kicked me, I used my arm to block his kick, and he fell down hard,\" Tony told the Associated Press.\n\nHowever, no one was hospitalized in the making of the film, with injuries limited to \"bumps and bruises, muscle tears, a little something like that. Nothing major,\" Tony said.<ref name=\"Pearson\">Pearson, Ryan. 5 September 2006. [http://asap.ap.org/stories/851019.s \"Breaking down the beatdown\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929212221/http://asap.ap.org/stories/851019.s |date=2007-09-29 }}, Associated Press (retrieved 4 January 2007).</ref>\n\nThe fights include duels with:\n* Wushu practitioner (portrayed by [[John Foo]]).\n* A Vietnamese triad captain (portrayed by ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-man]]'' [[stunt double]] Johnny Nguyen).\n* A [[capoeira|capoeirista]] (portrayed by [[Lateef Crowder]] of the [[ZeroGravity (stunt team)|ZeroGravity]] stunt team).\n* An extraordinarily large and strong bodyguard (portrayed by former [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] wrestler [[Nathan Jones (wrestler)|Nathan Jones]]).\n* A whip-wielding [[Triad society|triad]] boss (portrayed by world-renowned [[ballerina]] [[Jing Xing]]).\n* Two [[taekwondo]] fighters (portrayed by [[Daniel O'Neill (actor)|Daniel O'Neill]] and [[Dean Alexandrou]]) in a deleted two-vs-one scene in the temple.\n\n==Alternative versions==\nInternational sales rights (outside Asia) were purchased by [[TF1]], which made suggestions for re-editing to director [[Prachya Pinkaew]], who then made some cuts that slightly reduce the film's running time from its original 108 minutes.\n\nThe UK title is ''Warrior King'', and the theatrical release was on 28 July 2006. In France and Belgium, the title is ''L'Honneur du dragon'', and in the Netherlands and other European it is ''Honour of the Dragon''. In Cambodia, the film is called ''Neak Prodal Junboth''.<!--What does it mean?--> In India, it was named ''Haathi Mere Saathi'' (literally ''elephant, my partner''), from a name of another Bollywood [[Haathi Mere Saathi (1971 film)|film]] starring [[Rajesh Khanna]].\n\n=== Deleted scenes ===\nA two-vs-one fight scene taking place in the burning temple near the end of the film was deleted from currently released versions of the film. The taekwondo sequence, featuring Dean Alexandrou and [[Daniel O'Neill (actor)|Daniel O'Neill]] is shown in part in nearly all promotional trailers for the film, but was cut due to unknown reasons from the final release. However footage can be seen in the making-of featurettes, and some behind-the-scenes VCDs. The two bodies are seen to mysteriously appear on the temple floor, near the beginning of the temple fight scene.\n\nPrachya Pinkaew stated that he trimmed several of the fight scenes due to their length. Some of these include the sequence on the bridge in Sydney, when Kham confronts Johnny and his henchmen for the first time. One can see in certain trailers Kham launching himself off of the shoulders of one henchmen to elbow the other one. Another sequence that he trimmed considerably was the warehouse fight scene.\n\nIn the U.S. release of ''Tom-Yum-Goong'', where it was named ''The Protector'', there is a deleted scene of Kham beginning his ambush of the house party by the criminal group who stole his elephants. In all of its releases, the fight sequence begins with Tony Jaa throwing a henchman down the stairs. But this deleted scene shows where the fight really began.\n\n===US release as ''The Protector''===\n[[The Weinstein Company]] purchased the U.S. distribution rights for ''Tom-Yum-Goong'' and retitled it ''The Protector'' (also the name of a [[The Protector (1985 film)|1985 film]] starring [[Jackie Chan]]). This version was released theatrically on 8 September 2006. It was released in January 2007 on DVD on The Weinstein Company's [[Dragon Dynasty]] label in a two-disc set that includes both the U.S. edit and the original Thai version of the film.<ref>[http://adg.invisionzone.com/index.php?showtopic=1571&pid=15007&st=0&#entry15007 Tom Yum Goong DVD comparison, Premier Asia vs Dragon Dynasty] (retrieved 11 January 2007).</ref>\n\nFor the US theatrical cut, the film's length was reduced by at least 25 minutes, going so far as to trim down some of the fight scenes, even though it was given an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|\"R\" rating]] restricting audiences to people aged 17 and over. Out of all cuts outside of Thailand, it is the shortest cut of the film, even more so than the European cuts. It also features a new score by [[Rza|RZA]]. Some parts of the missing footage (including cuts to the \"bone breaker\" fight and Madame Rose envisioning herself in a red dress as queen) appeared in the U.S. trailer and TV Spots.\n\nAlso, ''The Protector'' is partially subtitled and partially dubbed, with all of Jaa's dialogue subtitled. Several changes were made to the plot through editing and subtitles that did not match the spoken Thai and Chinese dialogue.\n\nChanges that were made to the US theatrical release include:\n* The historical role of the Thai warriors is given in more detail in the opening prologue\n* Scenes of TV reporters given tour of Sydney by Sgt. Mark are removed.\n* Scenes of Sgt. Mark handling robbery and releasing the would-be assassin are removed.\n* Kham's father, rather than being injured, died by the gunshot.\n* Tony Jaa's lines now include \"You killed my father!\"\n* Madame Rose loses face and is denied a \"security\" contract over bad turtle soup instead of the Chinese business leader's refusal to deal because of bad terms.\n* Madame Rose's [[transsexual]]ity is never mentioned.\n* The ending has been trimmed to imply that Madame Rose is dead rather than just injured after her fall through the roof.\n* Johnny does not return to kill Vincent after Vincent was apprehended by Mark.\n* Exposition is given to further explain the cutting of tendons to defeat the bruisers at the end.\n* The ending epilogue given by Sgt. Mark in the US version is significantly different and nobler than the Thai version, which is whimsical and comic relief in tone and is much less concerned with resolution.\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Tom-Yum-Goong'' opened in Thailand on 11 August 2005, and grossed US$1,609,720 in its first weekend and was No. 1 at the Thai box office (normally dominated by Hollywood imports) for two weeks in a row.<ref name = \"MojoThai\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/thailand/?yr=2005&currency=us&p=.htm 2005 Thailand Box Office Index], [[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved 4 January 2006.</ref> It ended its Thai run with US$4,417,800, blockbuster business by Thai standards.<ref name = \"MojoThai2\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/intl/thailand/?yr=2005&wk=35&p=.htm Thailand Box Office 1\u20134 September 2005], [[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved 4 January 2006.</ref>\n\n[[The Weinstein Company]] released ''Tom-Yum-Goong'' in North America in a heavily edited version entitled ''The Protector'', which was the third release by their ''[[Dragon Dynasty]]'' label. It was also given the \"[[Quentin Tarantino]] Presents\" brand, which had proven lucrative in the past for films like ''Hero'' and ''Hostel''. It opened in 1,541 cinemas on 8 September 2006 and ranked No. 4 in its opening weekend, grossing $5,034,180 ($3,226 per screen). It ended its run with $12,044,087.<ref name = \"MojoUS1\">[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?view=&yr=2006&wknd=36&p=.htm Weekend Box Office, 8-10 September 2006], [[Box Office Mojo]], retrieved 4 January 2007.</ref> In the US, it ranks 67th among [[martial arts films]] and 14th among foreign films.\n\nThe film's total worldwide box office gross is US$25,715,096.

The critical consensus reads: Despite some impressive fight scenes, this trimmed-down version of the Thai action pic is an off-putting mix of scant plot, choppy editing, and confusing subtitles and dubbing.\"<ref>{{Citation|title=The Protector (Tom yum goong) (Warrior King) (2005)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/protector|language=en|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref>\n\n==Sequel==\nA sequel, ''[[Tom Yum Goong 2]]'', was released in 2013.

Di Radfield ([[Juno Temple]]) has a crush on Miss G, and is the firm favourite and ringleader of her group. When a beautiful [[Spanish people|Spanish]] girl named Fiamma Corona ([[Mar\u00eda Valverde]]) arrives at the school, Miss G's focus is shifted away from the other girls. It becomes a triangle: Miss G gets increasingly obsessed with Fiamma, Fiamma is disturbed by Miss G and also openly disgusted by the teacher's hypocrisies and deceptions, and Di is terribly jealous and makes Fiamma's life hell.\n\nIn a very telling scene in the film that clearly highlighted Miss G's deceptions, Miss G (who claimed to be a world traveller to her \"girls\") goes to a nearby parochial town to buy some provisions. She is visibly upset by this trip and after buying her provisions and drawing the unwanted attention of some local louts, she returns to the school in, it would seem, a near panic. The bullying culminates in Di physically throwing Fiamma out of the school but, as she is unable to return to Spain as she hoped, Fiamma ends up back at the school later that night.\n\nWhen Fiamma is eventually found, the two girls make the first steps towards friendship, and at the following dorm party they all get a bit drunk, and Fiamma faints. Miss G takes her to her own room. Then Miss G kisses her and rapes her while she is passed out; Di witnesses this through the room door, which was left ajar, and then flees.\n\nThe next morning, Fiamma is visibly upset, and Miss G is equally distressed as she runs around after her. Di is broody, and eventually tells the rest of her gang that ''Fiamma'' seduced Miss G. Fiamma presumably tells Miss G that she will report the molestation to the teachers, and horrified, Miss G realises her career will be over. She in turn manipulates Di's affection for her into anger. She says that Fiamma will make up lies about her molesting her (even though it was true) and plans to get her kicked out of school. Di absolutely refuses to allow this to happen.\n\nThe confrontation between Di's gang and Fiamma turns ugly as Fiamma declines to answer Di's vicious questions and tries to explain what really happened, hinting at Miss G's lies and character defects. Fiamma runs into the forest as things become more violent, but the girls catch up with her and, under Di's leadership, beat her with their sticks and fists. Fiamma starts to have an asthma attack, and the girls stop, terrified. They run to get help, and Di runs into Miss G (who had been watching the beating and the chase that ensued quietly and with no attempt to stop the beating), who says she'll stay with Fiamma, and directs Di to go get a teacher.\n\nIn the forest, Miss G, alone with Fiamma, refuses to give Fiamma her inhaler and calmly watches her die. Di returns just in time to see Miss G placing the inhaler in Fiamma's lifeless hand, realizing the truth.\n\nLater, Di tells the other girls what happened and, united, they confront Miss G. They are powerless officially, but they quit the diving team and symbolically turn in their sashes. The [[head teacher|headmistress]] refuses to acknowledge the school's culpability, and seems only concerned with the school's reputation, but releases Miss G from her duties.\n\nThe final scene has Di leaving the school to explore the world, as both Fiamma and Miss G had spoken of doing, whilst Miss G, fired from the school, goes to the local village and finds a small room she can live in, presumably closing herself away for the rest of her life. In a scene that perhaps allows the viewer a better understanding of Miss G's very complex personality, we see her put her few personal possessions on her bedside table. She puts one item there and then quickly removes it to make room for another item. After that, she counts the items to make sure that there are only five. The viewer is then reminded that when Fiamma arrived at the school, in the dorm room, Di had told her that only five personal items could be displayed on her night table at one time. The audience then realises Miss G is as much a victim of the institutionalised setting she grew up in (she was perhaps like many of the girls at the school \"dumped\" there and basically forgotten about by her family) as Fiamma was her victim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/08/cracks200908 |title=Dangerous Lessons |first=Krista |last=Smith |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=August 2009}}\n</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Lead actresses from Cracks at TIFF 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The lead actresses at the film's showing at the 2009 [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

The [[head teacher|headmistress]] refuses to acknowledge the school's culpability, and seems only concerned with the school's reputation, but releases Miss G from her duties.\n\nThe final scene has Di leaving the school to explore the world, as both Fiamma and Miss G had spoken of doing, whilst Miss G, fired from the school, goes to the local village and finds a small room she can live in, presumably closing herself away for the rest of her life. In a scene that perhaps allows the viewer a better understanding of Miss G's very complex personality, we see her put her few personal possessions on her bedside table. She puts one item there and then quickly removes it to make room for another item. After that, she counts the items to make sure that there are only five. The viewer is then reminded that when Fiamma arrived at the school, in the dorm room, Di had told her that only five personal items could be displayed on her night table at one time. The audience then realises Miss G is as much a victim of the institutionalised setting she grew up in (she was perhaps like many of the girls at the school \"dumped\" there and basically forgotten about by her family) as Fiamma was her victim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/08/cracks200908 |title=Dangerous Lessons |first=Krista |last=Smith |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=August 2009}}\n</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Lead actresses from Cracks at TIFF 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The lead actresses at the film's showing at the 2009 [[Toronto International Film Festival]].

However, one nurse, Tahwaan (Chol Wachananont), has found out that her boyfriend, Dr. Tar, has been having an affair with her sister, Nook (Chidjun Rujiphan). Growing tired of the body-selling scam and enraged by her sister and boyfriend's betrayal, Tahwaan threatens to call the police.\n\nHowever, before Tahwaan can take action, the doctor and six resident nurses at the hospital strap Tahwaan to an operating table, kill her, and then wrap her in a black plastic garbage bag. They then dump her in the trunk of the doctor's car, where her corpse will be kept on dry ice until it can be sold.\n\nAll the women have their own obsessions and weaknesses. The spirit of Tahwaan uses these obsessions to torment and ultimately kill the other six nurses. Scenes shown toward the end of the film indicate that many of these obsessions were in part encouraged by Dr. Tar, or in some cases, used by him to seduce some of the women. For example, Aeh ([[Kanya Rattanapetch]]) seems unhealthily attracted to material possession such as jewelry, dresses, and handbags. One brief scene shows Dr. Tar giving Aeh a handbag that was shown sewn to her head and neck earlier in such a manner that when Nook tries to undo the stitching, Aeh is left decapitated.\n\nIt is eventually revealed that Tahwaan was once a homosexual male who had undergone a sex change so that he could marry Dr. Tar. She finally kills her own sister by being literally reborn through her and as she stares at Tar, she mutters \"marry me\" and the screen goes black\n\n==Cast==\n* Chol Wachananont as Tahwaan\n* Wichan Jarujinda as Dr. Tar\n* Chidjan Rujiphun as Nook\n* [[Kanya Rattanapetch]] as Aeh\n* Dollaros Dachapratumwan as Jo\n* Ase Wang as Yim\n* Ampairat Techapoowapat as Orn\n* Ampaiwan Techapoowapat as Am\n\n==Release and reception==\n''Sick Nurses'' was released in [[List of cinemas in Thailand|Thailand cinemas]] on June 14, 2007, where critical and box-office response was muted and maybe due to less cinema release of 50 and runs only for 2 weeks.
