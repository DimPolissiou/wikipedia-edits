The Blanchards helped paddle her back to shore, then Alana's father fashioned a [[tourniquet]] out of a rash guard and wrapped it around the stump of her arm. She was rushed to [[Wilcox Health|Wilcox Memorial Hospital]]. By the time she arrived there she had lost over 60% of her blood and was in [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]. A doctor living in a hotel nearby raced to the rescue. Her father, who was scheduled to have knee surgery that same morning, was already there, but she took his place in the operating room. During subsequent media interviews, she confirmed that she felt normal when she was bitten and did not feel much pain from the bite at the moment of the disaster, but felt numb on the way to the hospital.\n[[file:Bethany Hamilton 20070311.jpg|thumb|Hamilton surfing in March 2007]]\n\nWhen the news broke out of the shark attack, a family of fishermen led by Ralph Young presented to investigators photos of a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tiger shark they had caught and killed about one mile from the attack site. It had surfboard debris in its mouth. When measurements of its mouth were compared with those of Hamilton's broken board, it matched. In late 2004, the police officially confirmed that it was the same one that had attacked her.\n\nDespite the trauma of the incident, Hamilton was determined to return to surfing.<ref name=\"home-school1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.home-school.com/Articles/soul-surfer.php|title=Homeschool World - Articles - Soul Survivor: The Bethany Hamilton Story - Practical Homeschooling Magazine|publisher=Home-school.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2014-04-28}}</ref> One month after the attack, she returned to her board.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Mark |title=Soul Surfer Interview With Bethany Hamilton! |url=http://whatculture.com/film/soul-surfer-interview-with-bethany-hamilton.php |work=WhatCulture! |accessdate=December 15, 2012 |date=September 24, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029204455/http://whatculture.com/film/soul-surfer-interview-with-bethany-hamilton.php |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nInitially, she adopted a custom-made board that was longer and slightly thicker than standard and had a handle for her right arm, making it easier to paddle, and she learned to kick more to make up for the loss of her left arm.

The Blanchards helped paddle her back to shore, then Alana's father fashioned a [[tourniquet]] out of a rash guard and wrapped it around the stump of her arm. She was rushed to [[Wilcox Health|Wilcox Memorial Hospital]]. By the time she arrived there she had lost over 60% of her blood and was in [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]]. A doctor living in a hotel nearby raced to the rescue. Her father, who was scheduled to have knee surgery that same morning, was already there, but she took his place in the operating room. During subsequent media interviews, she confirmed that she felt normal when she was bitten and did not feel much pain from the bite at the moment of the disaster, but felt numb on the way to the hospital.\n[[file:Bethany Hamilton 20070311.jpg|thumb|Hamilton surfing in March 2007]]\n\nWhen the news broke out of the shark attack, a family of fishermen led by Ralph Young presented to investigators photos of a {{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} tiger shark they had caught and killed about one mile from the attack site. It had surfboard debris in its mouth. When measurements of its mouth were compared with those of Hamilton's broken board, it matched.

It was used as a \"gap filler\", looking for aircraft attempting to sneak by the DEW line by flying between the main [[AN/FPS-19]] stations at low altitude. It could detect aircraft flying at 200 feet over land or 50 feet over water.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}} The system was known as '''Fluttar''' during its development at the [[Lincoln Laboratory]], and this name was widely used. It was also sometimes known as \"Type F\".\n\n==MCL==\n{{main|Mid-Canada Line}}\nIn the early 1950s, [[Canada]] undertook the development of a pioneering radar system as part of the [[Mid-Canada Line]] (MCL). This system was based on [[continuous wave radar]]s that broadcast a signal between separate transmitter and receiver stations. When an aircraft passed through the space between the stations, some of the signal was reflected off the aircraft and back to the receiver.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBecause the beam was not steered, unlike a conventional scanning radar, the antennas did not move and the physical design was greatly simplified. Additionally, as the signal was continuous, not pulsed, the transmitter was simpler and cheaper. The original idea had been to mount the systems on telephone poles and power lines covering relatively short distances, but the need to build thousands of such systems led to this idea being abandoned. So the telephone poles were replaced with tall towers, the distance between them increased from a few miles to about {{convert|90|km}}, and a string of stations was constructed across Canada.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nUnlike a pulse radar where the signal from the station travels out and back, in a forward scatter [[bistatic radar]] like the MCL, it travels an almost straight line from the transmitter to receiver. For this reason, the forward scatter signal is subject only to one [[inverse square law]] reduction in power, compared to the normal [[radar equation]] where power drops with the fourth root of range. Thus with small targets, a pulse radar will only see them near to the station, whereas a forward scatter system will see them over a much greater area.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nOriginally this was seen as a major advantage of the concept, allowing it to cover long ranges using much less power. But when the first experimental versions of the MCL stations were set up, a problem was immediately noticed. Birds, normally only seen as [[radar angels]] at short range, if at all, could now be seen at long distances from the station. During migration, the system was completely swamped with returns that rendered it essentially useless.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\n==Gap fillter==\nThe same basic concept was perfectly suited to fill the gaps between the DEW line stations. Because the radars were very simple, they could be run unattended, forwarding data to the main stations. Desiring better low-altitude coverage, the new system would be spaced about {{convert|25|mi}} apart, so a string of three towers would be built between the main stations.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBut some solution would be needed for the bird problem. The first attempt was made by the [[Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratory]], who surmised that using lower frequencies in the [[VHF]] range might mitigate the problem due to the lower [[Rayleigh scattering]] cross-section as the [[wavelength]] would be much greater than a bird. Tests showed that the large birds seen in the arctic made perfectly good reflectors even at these frequencies.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=38}}\n\n==Fluttar==\nDevelopment of another solution began at the MIT-backed [[Lincoln Laboratory]]. Although similar to the MCL in layout, it worked along different principles. Instead of the signal being scattered along the line between the two stations, the antennas were aimed about 15 degrees \"forward\" of the line between the two stations. When an aircraft entered the area, it would scatter back to the receiver as before, but in this case the aircraft's motion would shift the frequency of the signal. This effect had first been noticed in [[television]] signals when aircraft flew overhead, which is where it gained the name \"flutter\" for the way the image shifted back and forth on the screen.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=37}}\n\nBecause the system received a signal that was not the original frequency, by comparing the original to the received signal, the Doppler shift could be measured to reveal the speed of the target, which allowed it to filter out any slow-moving targets like birds.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=39}} The system was set to filter out anything under {{convert|125|mph}}.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}} Another advantage of Fluttar over MCL was that by using multiple Doppler filters in the receiver, the approximate velocity and direction (north or south) could be determined.\n\n== AN/FPS-23==\nFluttar was an inexpensive system compared to the main DEW radars. It used a 1 kilowatt, continuous wave, klystron amplifier as a source, and as this was not pulsed, much simpler high-voltage circuitry was needed. It could operate anywhere from 475 to 525&nbsp;[[Hertz|MHz]]. Towers were separated anywhere from {{convert|40|to(-)|70|miles}} and were {{convert|100|to(-)|400|feet}} tall, depending on the local terrain.{{sfn|Ray|1965|p=24}}  The main DEW stations were normally about {{convert|100|miles}} apart, so typically the AN/FPT-4 transmitter was placed in the middle, with the AN/FPR-2 receivers at the stations on either side.\n\nThe AN/FPS-23 stations became active in 1957, but soon discovered problems of its own. Annoyingly, although birds flying between the stations were indeed filtered out, it turned out that birds liked to congregate in warm locations, like the Diesel generators at the stations. The signal was so strong that it overwhelmed the filters. A more annoying problem turned out to be the aircraft that flew from station to station for maintenance, which invariably triggered the system. Designed for the very low probability of detection, the system was designed to ring alarms when anything was detected in order to avoid bored operators missing the signal. Instead, it triggered continually and rendered the system ineffective.{{sfn|Skolnik|2007|p=45}}\n\nIt was declared obsolete in 1963, and the intermediate stations were closed.\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{AFHRA}}\n* {{cite web\n |url=http://www.radomes.org/museum/equip.php\n |title=USAF Air Defense Radar Equipment\n |ref=CITEREFUSAF\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |url=https://www.northcom.mil/Portals/28/Paper%20No%2031%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Dew%20Line,%201946-1964%20Full%20Release.pdf?ver=2017-03-16-115749-817\n |title=A History of the DEW Line 1964 - 1964\n |first=Thomas |last=Ray\n |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency\n |date=June 1965\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite techreport\n |url=https://www.northcom.mil/Portals/28/Paper%20No%2031%20A%20History%20of%20the%20Dew%20Line,%201946-1964%20Full%20Release.pdf?ver=2017-03-16-115749-817\n |title=A History of the DEW Line 1964 - 1964\n |first=Thomas |last=Ray\n |publisher=Air Force Historical Research Agency\n |date=June 1965\n |ref=harv\n}}\n* {{cite encyclopedia\n |editor1-first= Nicholas |editor1-last=Willis |editor2-first= Hugh |editor2-last=Griffiths\n |encyclopedia = Advances in Bistatic Radar\n |title=Fluttar DEW-Line Gap-Filler\n |first=Merrill |last=Skolnik\n |pages=35-46\n |publisher=SciTech Publishing\n |date=2007\n |ref=harv\n}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{AN/FPS}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:AN FPS-23}}\n[[Category:Ground radars]]\n[[Category:Bistatic radars]]\n\n\n{{USAF-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox radar\n|name      =   AN/FPS-23\n|image     =   <!--without [[Image:...]] syntax-->\n|caption   =  \n|manufacturer =  Motorola\n|country   =   United States\n|introdate = \n|number    =   \n|type      =   [[early warning radar]]\n|frequency =   475 - 525 MHz ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]])\n|PRF       =   \n|beamwidth =   <!--X\u00b0 (horizontal), X\u00b0 (vertical)-->\n|pulsewidth=   \n|RPM       =   \n|range     =   {{convert|50|nmi|km}}\n|altitude  =   <!--{{m to ft|X|addr=yes}}-->\n|diameter  =   {{convert|20|by|6|feet}}\n|azimuth   =   <!--X-Y\u00ba-->\n|elevation =   <!--X-Y\u00ba-->\n|precision =   \n|power     =   1 kW\n|other names= Fluttar, Type \"F\"\n}}\nThe [[Motorola]] '''AN/FPS-23''' was a short-range [[early warning radar]] deployed on the [[Distant Early Warning Line]] (DEW Line).

Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason.

Behrend divorced Friedl\u00e4nder in 1914, and in 1919, Magda was enrolled in the prestigious Holzhausen Ladies' College near [[Goslar]].<ref name=\"dhm\" /> While in Berlin, Magda also befriended Lisa Arlosoroff and became intimate with her brother Haim, an ardent Zionist.{{sfn|Shindler|2017|pp=46\u201347}} During her relationship with Arlosoroff, she briefly wore a Star of David he had given her and even attended meetings of Tikvat Zion; the relationship did not last but the two remained in contact during the 1920s.{{sfn|Shindler|2017|p=47}}\n\n==Marriage and son with G\u00fcnther Quandt==\nIn 1920, while returning to school on a train, she met [[G\u00fcnther Quandt]], a rich German industrialist twice her age.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} Thereafter, he courted her with courtesy and grand gestures.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=29}} He demanded that she change her surname back to Ritschel (having borne many years the surname of Friedl\u00e4nder), when converting from [[Catholicism]] to Quand's [[Protestantism|Protestant church]].{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=31}} They were married on 4 January 1921, and her first child, [[Harald Quandt|their Harald]], was born on 1 November 1921.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=149}}\n\nMagda soon grew frustrated in her marriage because Quandt spent little time with her. His main interest seemed to be the expansion of his business empire.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} She was left to look after six children - Harald, with Quandt's two sons from prior marriage, and three children from a deceased friend, then run the whole household.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}}\n\nIn October 1927, the couple went on a two month visit to the United States, to conduct a business with the Lloyd Electric Storage Battery Co. of  [[Philadelphia]].<ref>''List or Manifest of Alien Passengers For the United States Immigration Officer At the Port of Arrival'' (Form 500 U.S. Department of Labor, Immigration Service), pp. 7\u20138, number on list 3 & 4, dated October 22 & 28, 1927.</ref>  In 1929, Quandt discovered that Magda was having an affair, so they separated, then went on to divorce that same year, which terms were however quite generous with Magda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}}\n\n==Marriage and family with Joseph Goebbels==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R32860, Berlin, Trauung von Joseph und Magda Goebbels.jpg|left|thumb|Joseph and Magda's wedding day, with her son Harald Quandt in his [[Deutsches Jungvolk]] uniform. [[Adolf Hitler]], their [[best man]], can be seen in the background.]]\n\nIn 1930, Magda attended a meeting of the [[Nazi Party]] where she was impressed by one of the speakers, [[Joseph Goebbels]], then the [[Gauleiter]] of Berlin. She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active. From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels' deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels' own private papers.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=82}} She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=152}} A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} Goebbels wrote in his diary, \"We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the [[Reich]], we will become man and wife. I am very happy.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} Her flat on [[Theodor-Heuss-Platz]] (then named the ''Reichskanzlerplatz'') soon became a favourite meeting place for [[Adolf Hitler]] and other NSDAP officials.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=94}}\n\nBy September, the relationship was experiencing problems. Goebbels was often jealous, and had some concern over the fact that Hitler had grown fond of Magda.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=153, 157, 158}} Magda decided to move forward their wedding date,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=153}} and the couple were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=167}}  [[Otto Wagener]] claims that Magda's marriage to Goebbels was somewhat arranged; since Hitler intended to remain unmarried, it was suggested that as the wife of a leading and highly visible Nazi official she might eventually act as \"first lady of the [[Third Reich]]\". Her social connections and upper class bearing may have influenced Goebbels' own enthusiasm.<ref name=wagener>Wagener, Otto, ''Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant''</ref> Goebbels biographer [[Peter Longerich]] concurred with this \"plausible\" conclusion as Magda was a very ambitious woman.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=159, 160}} Meissner contends that Hitler (though undoubtedly impressed by Magda) was an exceptionally close friend of the couple in the early days. Hitler enjoyed staying at the Goebbels' Berlin apartment, where he could relax,{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=160}} and he grew very fond of the Goebbels' children.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=159, 160}} Hitler would often arrive at their apartment late at night and, in later years, was as likely as Goebbels to sit with the baby Helga (born 1932) on his lap while they talked into the night.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|pp=91, 97\u201399}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1978-086-03, Joseph Goebbels mit Familie.jpg|thumb|The Goebbels family in 1942: (back row) Hildegard, [[Harald Quandt]], Helga; (front row) Helmut, Hedwig, Magda, Heidrun, [[Joseph Goebbels|Joseph]] and Holdine.

Their Berlin home on G\u00f6ringstrasse was remodeled by [[Albert Speer]] and they spent the spring and summers in Kladow.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=231, 290\u2013291}} In 1936, they bought a villa on Schwanenwerder island and later another at Bogensee near Wandlitz in Brandenburg.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=315, 316}}\n\n{{main|Goebbels children}}\nJoseph and Magda Goebbels had six children: Helga Susanne (1932), Hildegard \"Hilde\" Traudel (1934), Helmut Christian (1935), Holdine \"Holde\" Kathrin (1937), Hedwig \"Hedda\" Johanna (1938), and Heidrun \"Heide\" Elisabeth (1940).{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Bogensee 25.jpg|thumb|Goebbels' villa on Bogensee,<br>2008 condition]]\nJoseph Goebbels had many affairs during the marriage. In 1936, Goebbels met the [[Czech people|Czech]] actress [[L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1]] and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=317, 318}} Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about the situation on 15 August 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2010|p=170}} Thereafter, Goebbels and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=392}} The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=392\u2013395}} Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October 1938.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=391, 395}}{{efn|In 1939 at the premiere of the film ''[[The Journey to Tilsit]]'', Magda ostentatiously left because the plot had an accidental resemblance to her situation and the affair between her husband and Baarov\u00e1. {{harv|Romani|1994|p=86}}}} Magda also had affairs, including a relationship with [[Kurt Ludecke]] in 1933{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=317}} and [[Karl Hanke]] in 1938.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=204}}\n\n==War years==\nAt the outbreak of war, Magda's son by her first marriage, Harald Quandt, became a [[Luftwaffe]] pilot and fought at the front, while, at home, she lived up to the image of a patriotic mother by training as a [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]] nurse and working with the electronics company [[Telefunken]], and travelled to work on a bus, like her colleagues.<ref name=\"arditti\" /> She was also involved with entertaining the wives of the foreign heads of state, supporting the troops and comforting war widows.\n\nBoth Goebbels and Magda derived personal benefits and social status from their close association with Hitler, and the couple remained loyal to Hitler and publicly supported him. Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=219}} In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \"He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=222}}  There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the [[Holocaust]]. Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps. Asked about her husband's [[antisemitism]], she answered: \"The F\u00fchrer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.\"{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=127}}\n\nFelix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an [[exit visa]] from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels:{{quote|My father and step-mother were left behind in Germany but, two days before the War started, they were asked to come to Gestapo Headquarters and given an exit visa. There is a story in the family which goes back to the First World War when my step-grandparents were asked to give shelter to a young woman who\u2019d been displaced by the war in Belgium. Although she had a Jewish step-father, she eventually married Joseph Goebbels! My stepmother believes she may have acted as a sort of protecting hand and was involved with the exit visa. Certainly, the night before Kristallnacht, they got an anonymous phone call warning my father not to go home that evening but to go somewhere safe. My step-mother swore it was Magda Goebbels.\"<ref name=arditti/><ref>Jewish Museum Berlin, major exhibition \"Home and Exile, The Jewish Quarterly.</ref>}}\n\nAfflicted with a weak heart and \"delicate health\", Magda would have extended periods of illness.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|pp=197, 361, 362, 706}} Towards the end of the war, she is known to have also suffered from severe depression and [[trigeminal neuralgia]].<ref>Klabunde, Anja, ''Magda Goebbels'', p. 302</ref> This condition affects a nerve in the face, and although usually harmless is considered to cause intense pain and can be notoriously hard to treat.<ref>[http://www.tna-support.org/ What is Trigeminal Neuralgia?] TNA Website</ref> This often left her bedridden and led to bouts of hospitalization as late as August 1944.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|pp=141, 228, 234}}\n\n==Death==\nIn late April 1945, the Soviet [[Red Army]] entered Berlin, and the Goebbels family moved into the ''[[Vorbunker]]'', connected to the lower ''[[F\u00fchrerbunker]]'' under the [[Reich Chancellery]] garden.{{sfn|Thacker|2010|p=298}} Magda wrote a farewell letter to her son Harald, who was in a [[prisoner of war|POW]] camp in [[North Africa]]:<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/Magda_Goebbels.htm|title=Magda Goebbels|work=Spartacus Educational|access-date=2017-04-26|language=en}}</ref>{{quote|My beloved son!

Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves.{{sfn|Longerich|2015|p=686}}\n\nMagda was among the last to see both Hitler and [[Eva Braun]] before they [[Death of Adolf Hitler|committed suicide]] on the afternoon of 30 April.{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|pp=827\u2013828}} On the following day, 1&nbsp;May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist [[Helmut Kunz]] to inject [[Goebbels children|their six children]] with [[morphine]] so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of [[cyanide]] could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS-''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Ludwig Stumpfegger]] (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|pp=380, 381}} Author [[James P. O'Donnell]] concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role.{{sfn|O'Donnell|2001}}\n\nMagda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance.{{sfn|Meissner|1980|p=242}} According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison.\n{{quote|We have demanded monstrous things from the German people, treated other nations with pitiless cruelty.

In the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' she confided to Hitler's secretary [[Traudl Junge]], that \"I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at. My children stand no chance in Germany after the war\".<ref>Junge, Traudl, ''Until the Final Hour''</ref>\n\nThe last survivor of Hitler's bunker, [[Rochus Misch]], gave this account of the events to the [[BBC]]:\n\n{{quote|Straight after Hitler's death, Mrs. Goebbels came down to the bunker with her children.

She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to concentrate on his work but he knew what was going to happen.{{sfn|Misch|2014|p=176}} Magda then went back up to the ''Vorbunker'' with the children. Shortly thereafter, [[Werner Naumann]] came down to the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'' and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something \"sweetened\" to drink.{{sfn|Misch|2014|p=177}} About two hours later, Magda came back down to the ''F\u00fchrerbunker'', alone.

One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a [[coup de gr\u00e2ce]] immediately afterwards.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}} Goebbels' SS adjutant [[G\u00fcnther Schw\u00e4germann]] testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw\u00e4germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw\u00e4germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move.{{sfn|Joachimsthaler|1999|p=52}}{{efn|[[Johannes Hentschel]] later told Misch a singular conflicting story that Goebbels killed himself in his room in the bunker, and Magda in the ''Vorbunker'', during the early hours of 2&nbsp;May. {{harv|Misch|2014|pp=182, 183}}}} The bodies were then doused with [[gasoline|petrol]], but the remains were only partially burned and not buried.{{sfn|Beevor|2002|p=381}}\n\nThe charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops.
