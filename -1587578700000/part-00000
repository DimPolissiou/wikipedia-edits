They were known only as \u2032E\u2032 and \u2032R\u2032.\n\n===History of \u2032E\u2032===\n\u2032E\u2032 was an Egyptian national who came to the UK from [[Bangladesh]] in April 2001 and claimed asylum. \u2032E\u2032 was considered to be sympathetic to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], particularly since his father was a member of the society. \u2032E\u2032 had fled Bangladesh claiming the Egyptian authorities were pursuing him. He needed to renew his passport but could not do so without returning to Egypt. If he were to return, he claimed he would be detained and tortured. The Home Secretary rejected his claim for asylum and on appeal, this refusal was affirmed by the Adjudicator and the IAT. There was a period of over 5 months between the IAT hearing of 22 October 2002 and the issuing of a decision on 4th April 2003. The Tribunal accepted that there was evidence that members of the Muslim Brotherhood were, in fact, being imprisoned and subjected to torture, however, the IAT believed that this was not an ongoing situation, and that this had been short-term detentions due largely to the elections held in Egypt during the year 2000. The tribunal found that the Adjudicator was correct in not deeming the claim made by \u2032E\u2032 especially persuasive and that being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood would necessarily mean that he would be subject to persecution. The tribunal and Adjudicator did not feel that there was any new evidence before them that \u2032E\u2032 was in any way part of organisations involved in conflict around the world. \n\n===History of \u2032R\u2032===\n\u2032R\u2032 was an Afghan national who came to the UK in August 2001 and claimed asylum. The grounds for asylum were that \u2032R\u2032 had converted from [[Islam]] to [[Christianity]] and if made to return would most likely be subject to severe persecution. The Tribunal (IAT) rejected the appeal of \u2032R\u2032, even though the evidence per se was not in dispute. \u2032R\u2032 applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal on 1st September 2003. New evidence, in the form of an additional CIPU (Country Information and Policy Unit) report of April 2003 was put forward to help substantiate the seriousness of the risk of persecution. Anyone suspected or even accused of conversion to Christianity could face severe punishment and in all likelihood, could be put to death.

They were known only as \u2032E\u2032 and \u2032R\u2032.\n\n\u2032E\u2032 was an Egyptian national who came to the UK from [[Bangladesh]] in April 2001 and claimed asylum. \u2032E\u2032 was considered to be sympathetic to the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], particularly since his father was a member of the society. \u2032E\u2032 had fled Bangladesh claiming the Egyptian authorities were pursuing him. He needed to renew his passport but could not do so without returning to Egypt. If he were to return, he claimed he would be detained and tortured. The Home Secretary rejected his claim for asylum and on appeal, this refusal was affirmed by the Adjudicator and the IAT. There was a period of over 5 months between the IAT hearing of 22 October 2002 and the issuing of a decision on 4th April 2003. The Tribunal accepted that there was evidence that members of the Muslim Brotherhood were, in fact, being imprisoned and subjected to torture, however, the IAT believed that this was not an ongoing situation, and that this had been short-term detentions due largely to the elections held in Egypt during the year 2000. The tribunal found that the Adjudicator was correct in not deeming the claim made by \u2032E\u2032 especially persuasive and that being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood would necessarily mean that he would be subject to persecution. The tribunal and Adjudicator did not feel that there was any new evidence before them that \u2032E\u2032 was in any way part of organisations involved in conflict around the world. \n\n\u2032R\u2032 was an Afghan national who came to the UK in August 2001 and claimed asylum. The grounds for asylum were that \u2032R\u2032 had converted from [[Islam]] to [[Christianity]] and if made to return would most likely be subject to severe persecution. The Tribunal (IAT) rejected the appeal of \u2032R\u2032, even though the evidence per se was not in dispute. \u2032R\u2032 applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal on 1st September 2003. New evidence, in the form of an additional CIPU (Country Information and Policy Unit) report of April 2003 was put forward to help substantiate the seriousness of the risk of persecution. Anyone suspected or even accused of conversion to Christianity could face severe punishment and in all likelihood, could be put to death. Permission to appeal was refused by the IAT.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.casemine.com/judgement/uk/5a8ff7b260d03e7f57eb14a6 |title=E v Secretary of State for Home Department [2004] EWCA Civ 49 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2 February 2004 |website=Casemine |access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[R (March) v Secretary of State for Health]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Law-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Public law]]\n[[Category:Common law]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom public law]]\n[[Category:Law of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Judicial review]]\n", "name_user": "SpookiePuppy", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFacts:Adding subsection: History of \u2032E\u2032; and History of \u2032R\u2032.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_v_Secretary_of_State_for_the_Home_Department"}
