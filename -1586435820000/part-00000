Tablets found in the Hurrian city of [[Nuzi]] in the early 20th century appear to use the term ''Kinahnu'' as a synonym for red or [[tyrian purple|purple dye]], laboriously produced by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] from [[murex]] molluscs as early as 1600&nbsp;BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"purple\", apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''. The purple cloth of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in Phoenicia was well known far and wide and was associated by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with nobility and royalty. However, according to [[Robert Drews]], Speiser's proposal has generally been abandoned.{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=48|ps=: \"Until E.A. Speiser proposed that the name \u2018Canaan\u2019 was derived from the (unattested) word kinahhu, which Speiser supposed must have been an Akkadian term for reddish-blue or purple, Semiticists regularly explained \u2018Canaan\u2019 (Hebrew k\u00ebna\u2018an; elsewhere in Northwest Semitic kn\u2018n) as related to the Aramaic verb kn\u2018: \u2018to bend down, be low\u2019.

In this document we find a reference to LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num. The wording of this passage creates some problems as to the identity of these 'Canaanites', because of the parallelism between LUKh-na-ah-num and LUhabbatum, which is unexpected. The Akkadian word habbatum, the meaning of which is actually 'brigands', is sometimes used to translate the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] expression SA.GAZ, which is normally thought to be a logogram for habiru, 'Hebrews'. Thus there is some reason to question the identity of the 'Canaanites' who appear in this text from Marl We may ask whether these people were called 'Canaanites' because they were ethnically of another stock than the ordinary population of Mari, or whether it was because they came from a specific geographical area, the land of Canaan. However, because of the parallelism in this text between LUhabbatum and LUKi-na-ah-num, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression 'Canaanites' was used here with a sociological meaning. It could be that the word 'Canaanites' was in this case understood as a sociological designation of some sort which shared at least some connotations with the sociological term habiru. Should this be the case, the Canaanites of Marl may well have been refugees or outlaws rather than ordinary foreigners from a certain country (from Canaan). Worth considering is also Manfred Weippert's interpretation of the passage LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num\u2014literally 'Canaanites and brigands'\u2014as 'Canaanite brigands', which may welt mean 'highwaymen of foreign origin', whether or not they were actually Canaanites coming from Phoenicia.\"}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie |chapter=Kanaan |first=Manfred |last=Weippert |volume=5 |page=352 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=cEB1Z_c50qgC |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> such that Robert Drews states that the \"first certain cuneiform reference\" to Canaan is found on the Alalakh statue of King Idrimi (below).{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=46|ps=: \"An eighteenth-century letter from Mari may refer to Canaan, but the first certain cuneiform reference appears on a statue base of [[Idrimi]], king of [[Alalakh]] c. 1500 BC.\"}}\n\nA reference to Ammiya being \"in the land of Canaan\" is found on the [[Statue of Idrimi]] (16th century BC) from [[Alalakh]] in modern Syria.

Later still, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] assimilated the region. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, the migrant [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] who appear to have settled in the region included (among others) the [[Amorites]], who had earlier controlled Babylonia. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the ''Amorites'' in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 10:16\u201318a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Book of Genesis 14:7 ''f''., [[Book of Joshua]] 10:5 ''f''., [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as [[Book of Numbers]] 21:13, Book of Joshua 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc.tell of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Ashteroth]], east of the Jordan. However, other passages such as Book of Genesis 15:16, 48:22, Book of Joshua 24:15, [[Book of Judges]] 1:34, etc. regard the name ''Amorite'' as synonymous with \"Canaanite\"; however \"Amorite\" is never used for the population on the coast. {{Citation needed|reason= Putting biblical reference for a paragraph in a historical article is dubious at best if not clarified from the onset of the paragraph|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder [[Thutmose III]] (1479\u20131426&nbsp;BC) and [[Amenhotep II]] (1427\u20131400&nbsp;BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. [[Habiru]] or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands, or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king, or princeling would pay for their support. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Habiru {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as \"brigand\" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''{{lang|akk|[[Habiru|Habiri]]}}'' (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur III]], their appearance in Canaan appears{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a [[Maryannu]] aristocracy of horse-drawn [[chariot]]eers, associated with the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] rulers of the [[Hurrians]], known as [[Mitanni]].\n\nThe Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One analysis{{which|date=June 2018}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a [[language isolate]]), though there were a number of Semites and even some [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Luwian]] adventurers amongst their number. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], as a result was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed{{By whom|date= February 2012}} that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abdi-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who, even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]]. [[Akizzi]], governor of Katna ([[Qatna]]?) (near [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru's attempts. In the reign of the next pharaoh ([[Akhenaten]], reigned {{circa}} 1352 to {{circa}} 1335 BC) however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Hadda]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia-Minor-based [[Hittite Empire]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]]<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.\n\nThe Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. [[Etakkama]] wrote thus to the Pharaoh:\n\n:\"Behold, [[Biryawaza|Namyawaza]] has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} in the land of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and in [[Upu|Ubi]].

Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,\n\n:\"Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}, and my [[Sutean|Suti]] ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands.\"<ref name=\"EA189\">El Amarna letter, EA 189.</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central, and eastern regions of [[Syria]] and the northwestern Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] influence waned as a result.

Assyrian emperor-kings such as [[Ashurnasirpal II|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Adad-nirari II]], [[Sargon II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] came to dominate Canaanite affairs. The [[Egyptians]], then under a [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]], made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region, but were vanquished by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], leading to an Assyrian invasion and conquest of Egypt and the destruction of the [[Kushite Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] was forced to pay tribute to Assyria. Between 616 and 605 BC the Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], and Persians<!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, \"Persians\"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --> and the [[Scythians]]. The Babylonians inherited the western part of the empire of their Assyrian brethren, including all the lands in Canaan and [[Syria]], together with [[Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. They successfully defeated the Egyptians, who had belatedly attempted to aid their former masters, the Assyrians, and then remained in the region in an attempt to regain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. The Babylonian Empire itself collapsed in 539 BC, and Canaan fell to the Persians and became a part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. It remained so until in 332 BC it was conquered by the [[Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]], later to fall to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the late 2nd century BC, and then [[Byzantium]], until the [[Arab]] Islamic invasion and conquest of the 7th century.<ref name=\"roux\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n{{further|Ancient Canaanite religion}}\n[[File:Enthroned deity MET DP137934.jpg|left|thumb|Enthroned deity; 14-13th century BC; bronze and gold foil; height: 12.7 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nCanaan included what today are Lebanon, Israel, northwestern Jordan, and some western areas of Syria.<ref name=\"JonTubb\" />{{rp|13}} According to archaeologist Jonathan N.

During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East\u2014[[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]), the [[Hittites]], and [[Minoan Crete]]\u2014to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in [[Canaanite mythology]] by the struggle between the storm god, variously called [[Teshub]] ([[Hurrian]]) or [[Baal|Ba'al Hadad]] ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Amorite]]/[[Aramean]]) and [[Yam (god)|Ya'a, Yaw]], [[Yahu]], or [[Yam (god)|Yam]], god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local [[horticulture|horticultural products]], along with commercial growing of [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s for wine, and [[pistachio]]s, surrounded by extensive [[grain]] cropping, predominantly [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Harvest in early summer was a season when [[transhumance]] [[nomadism]] was practiced\u2014shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the [[Gezer calendar]] and in the biblical cycle of the year.\n[[File:Sarcophagus of Canaanites.jpg|thumb|Canaanite sarcophagi ([[Israel Museum]])]]\nPeriods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with [[subsistence agricultural]] foodstuffs; and transhumance [[pastoralism]] became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Seters |first=John |year=1987 |title=Abraham in Myth and Tradition |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9781626549104}}</ref> During the periods of the collapse of [[Akkadian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Hyksos]] invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]], trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree [[Assyria]], withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from [[Kadesh Barnea]], through [[Hebron]], [[Lachish]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethel]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] through [[Galilee]] to [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from [[Eilath]], [[Timna]], [[Edom]] ([[Mount Seir|Seir]]), [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], and thence to the Aramean states of [[Damascus]] and [[Palmyra]]. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and [[Tyrians]] in the case of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]], for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas L. |year=2000 |title=Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources |publisher=Brill Academic |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=RwrrUuHFb6UC |access-date=9 October 2018|isbn=978-9004119437 }}</ref>\n\nEventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes, and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., [[PPNB]], [[Ghassulian]], [[Uruk]], and the [[Bronze Age]] cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the [[Greco-Roman]] world (as [[Iudaea]] province), and after [[Byzantine]] times, into the Muslim [[Arab]] and proto-Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. [[Western Aramaic]], one of the two [[lingua franca]]s of Canaanite civilization, is still spoken in a number of small Syrian villages, whilst [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] disappeared as a spoken language in about 100&nbsp;AD. A separate [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]-infused [[Eastern Aramaic]] is still spoken by the existing [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], northeast Syria, and southeast [[Turkey]].\n\n[[Tel Kabri]] contains the remains of a Canaanite city from the Middle [[Bronze Age]] (2000\u20131550 BC). The city, the most important of the cities in the Western [[Galilee]] during that period, had a palace at its center.

Throughout the area that we\u2014with the Greek speakers\u2014prefer to call 'Phoenicia', the inhabitants in the first millennium&nbsp;BC called themselves 'Canaanites'. For the area south of Mt. Carmel, however, after the Bronze Age ended references to 'Canaan' as a present phenomenon dwindle almost to nothing (the Hebrew Bible of course makes frequent mention of 'Canaan' and 'Canaanites', but regularly as a land that had become something else, and as a people who had been annihilated).\"</ref> and after the emigration of Canaanite-speakers to [[Carthage]] (founded in the 9th century BC), was also used as a self-designation by the [[Punics]] (''chanani'') of North Africa during [[Late Antiquity]].\n\nCanaan had significant geopolitical importance in the [[Late Bronze Age]] [[Amarna period]] (14th century&nbsp;BC) as the area where the [[sphere of interest|spheres of interest]] of the [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]], [[Hittite Empire|Hittite]], [[Mitanni]] and [[Assyrian Empire]]s converged. Much of modern knowledge about Canaan stems from [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological excavation]] in this area at sites such as [[Tel Hazor]], [[Tel Megiddo]], [[En Esur]], and [[Gezer]].

Tablets found in the Hurrian city of [[Nuzi]] in the early 20th century appear to use the term ''Kinahnu'' as a synonym for red or [[tyrian purple|purple dye]], laboriously produced by the [[Kassites|Kassite]] rulers of [[Babylon]] from [[murex]] molluscs as early as 1600&nbsp;BC, and on the Mediterranean coast by the Phoenicians from a byproduct of glassmaking. Purple cloth became a renowned Canaanite export commodity which is mentioned in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]. The dyes may have been named after their place of origin. The name 'Phoenicia' is connected with the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"purple\", apparently referring to the same product, but it is difficult to state with certainty whether the Greek word came from the name, or ''vice versa''. The purple cloth of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] in Phoenicia was well known far and wide and was associated by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with nobility and royalty. However, according to [[Robert Drews]], Speiser's proposal has generally been abandoned.{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=48|ps=: \"Until E.A. Speiser proposed that the name \u2018Canaan\u2019 was derived from the (unattested) word kinahhu, which Speiser supposed must have been an Akkadian term for reddish-blue or purple, Semiticists regularly explained \u2018Canaan\u2019 (Hebrew k\u00ebna\u2018an; elsewhere in Northwest Semitic kn\u2018n) as related to the Aramaic verb kn\u2018: \u2018to bend down, be low\u2019. That etymology is perhaps correct after all.

In this document we find a reference to LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num. The wording of this passage creates some problems as to the identity of these 'Canaanites', because of the parallelism between LUKh-na-ah-num and LUhabbatum, which is unexpected. The Akkadian word habbatum, the meaning of which is actually 'brigands', is sometimes used to translate the [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] expression SA.GAZ, which is normally thought to be a logogram for habiru, 'Hebrews'. Thus there is some reason to question the identity of the 'Canaanites' who appear in this text from Marl We may ask whether these people were called 'Canaanites' because they were ethnically of another stock than the ordinary population of Mari, or whether it was because they came from a specific geographical area, the land of Canaan. However, because of the parallelism in this text between LUhabbatum and LUKi-na-ah-num, we cannot exclude the possibility that the expression 'Canaanites' was used here with a sociological meaning. It could be that the word 'Canaanites' was in this case understood as a sociological designation of some sort which shared at least some connotations with the sociological term habiru. Should this be the case, the Canaanites of Marl may well have been refugees or outlaws rather than ordinary foreigners from a certain country (from Canaan). Worth considering is also Manfred Weippert's interpretation of the passage LUhabbatum u LUKi-na-ah-num\u2014literally 'Canaanites and brigands'\u2014as 'Canaanite brigands', which may welt mean 'highwaymen of foreign origin', whether or not they were actually Canaanites coming from Phoenicia.\"}}<ref>{{cite book |title=Reallexikon der Assyriologie |chapter=Kanaan |first=Manfred |last=Weippert |volume=5 |page=352 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=cEB1Z_c50qgC |access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref> such that Robert Drews states that the \"first certain cuneiform reference\" to Canaan is found on the Alalakh statue of King Idrimi (below).{{sfn|Drews|1998|p=46|ps=: \"An eighteenth-century letter from Mari may refer to Canaan, but the first certain cuneiform reference appears on a statue base of [[Idrimi]], king of [[Alalakh]] c. 1500 BC.\"}}\n\nA reference to Ammiya being \"in the land of Canaan\" is found on the [[Statue of Idrimi]] (16th century BC) from [[Alalakh]] in modern Syria.

One Amorite king of Babylonia, [[Hammurabi]] (1792\u20131750&nbsp;BC) founded the first [[Babylonian Empire]], which lasted only as long as his lifetime. Upon his death, the Amorites were driven from Assyria, but remained masters of Babylonia until 1595&nbsp;BC, when they were ejected by the Hittites.\n\nThe semi-fictional ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]'' describes an Egyptian officer, Sinuhe, conducting military activities in the area of \"Upper Retchenu\" and \"Finqu\" during the reign of [[Senusret I]] (c. 1950 BC).

Later still, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] assimilated the region. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAccording to the Bible, the migrant [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples]] who appear to have settled in the region included (among others) the [[Amorites]], who had earlier controlled Babylonia. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the ''Amorites'' in the ''[[Table of Nations|Table of Peoples]]'' ([[Book of Genesis]] 10:16\u201318a). Evidently, the Amorites played a significant role in the early history of Canaan. In Book of Genesis 14:7 ''f''., [[Book of Joshua]] 10:5 ''f''., [[Book of Deuteronomy]] 1:19 ''f''., 27, 44, we find them located in the southern mountain country, while verses such as [[Book of Numbers]] 21:13, Book of Joshua 9:10, 24:8, 12, etc.tell of two great Amorite kings residing at [[Heshbon]] and [[Ashteroth Karnaim|Ashteroth]], east of the Jordan. However, other passages such as Book of Genesis 15:16, 48:22, Book of Joshua 24:15, [[Book of Judges]] 1:34, etc. regard the name ''Amorite'' as synonymous with \"Canaanite\"; however \"Amorite\" is never used for the population on the coast. {{Citation needed|reason= Putting biblical reference for a paragraph in a historical article is dubious at best if not clarified from the onset of the paragraph|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn the centuries preceding the appearance of the biblical Hebrews, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs, although domination by the Egyptians remained sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city struggles. Other areas such as northern Canaan and northern Syria came to be ruled by the Assyrians during this period. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nUnder [[Thutmose III]] (1479\u20131426&nbsp;BC) and [[Amenhotep II]] (1427\u20131400&nbsp;BC), the regular presence of the strong hand of the Egyptian ruler and his armies kept the Amorites and Canaanites sufficiently loyal. Nevertheless, Thutmose III reported a new and troubling element in the population. [[Habiru]] or (in Egyptian) 'Apiru, are reported for the first time. These seem to have been mercenaries, brigands, or outlaws, who may have at one time led a settled life, but with bad luck or due to the force of circumstances, contributed a rootless element to the population, prepared to hire themselves to whichever local mayor, king, or princeling would pay for their support. {{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nAlthough Habiru {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} (a [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] ideogram glossed as \"brigand\" in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]), and sometimes ''{{lang|akk|[[Habiru|Habiri]]}}'' (an Akkadian word) had been reported in Mesopotamia from the reign of the [[Sumer]]ian king, [[Shulgi]] of [[Ur III]], their appearance in Canaan appears{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to have been due to the arrival of a new state based in Asia Minor to the north of Assyria and based upon a [[Maryannu]] aristocracy of horse-drawn [[chariot]]eers, associated with the [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] rulers of the [[Hurrians]], known as [[Mitanni]].\n\nThe Habiru seem to have been more a social class than an ethnic group.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} One analysis{{which|date=June 2018}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a [[language isolate]]), though there were a number of Semites and even some [[Kassites|Kassite]] and [[Luwian]] adventurers amongst their number. The reign of [[Amenhotep III]], as a result was not quite so tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed{{By whom|date= February 2012}} that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule they could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was [[Aziru]], son of [[Abdi-Ashirta]], a prince of Amurru, who, even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of [[Damascus]]. [[Akizzi]], governor of Katna ([[Qatna]]?) (near [[Hama#Hama in the Bible|Hamath]]), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate Aziru's attempts. In the reign of the next pharaoh ([[Akhenaten]], reigned {{circa}} 1352 to {{circa}} 1335 BC) however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like [[Rib-Hadda]], governor of [[Byblos|Gubla]] (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia-Minor-based [[Hittite Empire]] under [[Suppiluliuma I]]<ref>{{cite book |first=A.

Abdi-Ashirta and his son Aziru, at first afraid of the Hittites, afterwards made a treaty with their king, and joining with the Hittites, attacked and conquered the districts remaining loyal to Egypt. In vain did Rib-Hadda send touching appeals for aid to the distant Pharaoh, who was far too engaged in his religious innovations to attend to such messages.\n\nThe Amarna letters tell of the Habiri in northern Syria. [[Etakkama]] wrote thus to the Pharaoh:\n\n:\"Behold, [[Biryawaza|Namyawaza]] has surrendered all the cities of the king, my lord to the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}} in the land of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] and in [[Upu|Ubi]]. But I will go, and if thy gods and thy sun go before me, I will bring back the cities to the king, my lord, from the Habiri, to show myself subject to him; and I will expel the {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}.\"\n\nSimilarly, [[Zimredda (Sidon mayor)|Zimrida]], king of [[Sidon]] (named 'Siduna'), declared, \"All my cities which the king has given into my hand, have come into the hand of the Habiri.\" The king of [[Jerusalem]], [[Abdi-Heba]], reported to the Pharaoh: \n\n:\"If (Egyptian) troops come this year, lands and princes will remain to the king, my lord; but if troops come not, these lands and princes will not remain to the king, my lord.\"\n\nAbdi-heba's principal trouble arose from persons called [[Iilkili]] and the sons of [[Labaya]], who are said to have entered into a treasonable league with the Habiri. Apparently this restless warrior found his death at the siege of [[Gina (Canaan)|Gina]]. All these princes, however, maligned each other in their letters to the Pharaoh, and protested their own innocence of traitorous intentions. Namyawaza, for instance, whom Etakkama (see above) accused of disloyalty, wrote thus to the Pharaoh,\n\n:\"Behold, I and my warriors and my chariots, together with my brethren and my {{transl|Xsux|SA-GAZ}}, and my [[Sutean|Suti]] ?9 are at the disposal of the (royal) troops to go whithersoever the king, my lord, commands.\"<ref name=\"EA189\">El Amarna letter, EA 189.</ref>\n\nFrom the mid 14th century BC through to the 11th century BC, much of Canaan (particularly the north, central, and eastern regions of [[Syria]] and the northwestern Mediterranean coastal regions) fell to the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]], and both [[Egypt]]ian and [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] influence waned as a result.

Assyrian emperor-kings such as [[Ashurnasirpal II|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Adad-nirari II]], [[Sargon II]], [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], [[Esarhaddon]], [[Sennacherib]] and [[Ashurbanipal]] came to dominate Canaanite affairs. The [[Egyptians]], then under a [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|Nubian Dynasty]], made a failed attempt to regain a foothold in the region, but were vanquished by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], leading to an Assyrian invasion and conquest of Egypt and the destruction of the [[Kushite Empire]]. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] was forced to pay tribute to Assyria. Between 616 and 605 BC the Assyrian Empire collapsed due to a series of bitter civil wars, followed by an attack by an alliance of [[Babylonians]], [[Medes]], and Persians<!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, \"Persians\"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --> and the [[Scythians]]. The Babylonians inherited the western part of the empire of their Assyrian brethren, including all the lands in Canaan and [[Syria]], together with [[Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. They successfully defeated the Egyptians, who had belatedly attempted to aid their former masters, the Assyrians, and then remained in the region in an attempt to regain a foothold in the [[Near East]]. The Babylonian Empire itself collapsed in 539 BC, and Canaan fell to the Persians and became a part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. It remained so until in 332 BC it was conquered by the [[Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]], later to fall to [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the late 2nd century BC, and then [[Byzantium]], until the [[Arab]] Islamic invasion and conquest of the 7th century.<ref name=\"roux\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n{{further|Ancient Canaanite religion}}\n[[File:Enthroned deity MET DP137934.jpg|left|thumb|Enthroned deity; 14-13th century BC; bronze and gold foil; height: 12.7 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nCanaan included what today are Lebanon, Israel, northwestern Jordan, and some western areas of Syria.<ref name=\"JonTubb\" />{{rp|13}} According to archaeologist Jonathan N.

During these periods, Canaanites profited from their intermediary position between the ancient civilizations of the Middle East\u2014[[Ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Sumer]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]]), the [[Hittites]], and [[Minoan Crete]]\u2014to become city states of merchant princes along the coast, with small kingdoms specializing in agricultural products in the interior. This polarity, between coastal towns and agrarian hinterland, was illustrated in [[Canaanite mythology]] by the struggle between the storm god, variously called [[Teshub]] ([[Hurrian]]) or [[Baal|Ba'al Hadad]] ([[Semitic languages|Semitic]] [[Amorite]]/[[Aramean]]) and [[Yam (god)|Ya'a, Yaw]], [[Yahu]], or [[Yam (god)|Yam]], god of the sea and rivers. Early Canaanite civilization was characterized by small walled market towns, surrounded by peasant farmers growing a range of local [[horticulture|horticultural products]], along with commercial growing of [[olive]]s, [[grape]]s for wine, and [[pistachio]]s, surrounded by extensive [[grain]] cropping, predominantly [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Harvest in early summer was a season when [[transhumance]] [[nomadism]] was practiced\u2014shepherds staying with their flocks during the wet season and returning to graze them on the harvested stubble, closer to water supplies in the summer. Evidence of this cycle of agriculture is found in the [[Gezer calendar]] and in the biblical cycle of the year.\n[[File:Sarcophagus of Canaanites.jpg|thumb|Canaanite sarcophagi ([[Israel Museum]])]]\nPeriods of rapid climate change generally saw a collapse of this mixed Mediterranean farming system; commercial production was replaced with [[subsistence agricultural]] foodstuffs; and transhumance [[pastoralism]] became a year-round nomadic pastoral activity, whilst tribal groups wandered in a circular pattern north to the Euphrates, or south to the Egyptian delta with their flocks. Occasionally, tribal chieftains would emerge, raiding enemy settlements and rewarding loyal followers from the spoils or by tariffs levied on merchants. Should the cities band together and retaliate, a neighbouring state intervene or should the chieftain suffer a reversal of fortune, allies would fall away or intertribal feuding would return. It has been suggested that the Patriarchal tales of the Bible reflect such social forms.<ref>{{cite book |last=Van Seters |first=John |year=1987 |title=Abraham in Myth and Tradition |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9781626549104}}</ref> During the periods of the collapse of [[Akkadian Empire]] in [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]], the [[Hyksos]] invasions and the end of the Middle Bronze Age in Assyria and Babylonia, and the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]], trade through the Canaanite area would dwindle, as Egypt, Babylonia, and to a lesser degree [[Assyria]], withdrew into their isolation. When the climates stabilized, trade would resume firstly along the coast in the area of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] and Phoenician cities. As markets redeveloped, new trade routes that would avoid the heavy tariffs of the coast would develop from [[Kadesh Barnea]], through [[Hebron]], [[Lachish]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Bethel]], [[Samaria (ancient city)|Samaria]], [[Shechem]], [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] through [[Galilee]] to [[Jezreel (city)|Jezreel]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]]. Secondary Canaanite cities would develop in this region. Further economic development would see the creation of a third trade route from [[Eilath]], [[Timna]], [[Edom]] ([[Mount Seir|Seir]]), [[Moab]], [[Ammon]], and thence to the Aramean states of [[Damascus]] and [[Palmyra]]. Earlier states (for example the Philistines and [[Tyrians]] in the case of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]], for the second route, and Judah and Israel for the third route) tried generally unsuccessfully to control the interior trade.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Thomas L. |year=2000 |title=Early History of the Israelite People: From the Written & Archaeological Sources |publisher=Brill Academic |url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=RwrrUuHFb6UC |access-date=9 October 2018|isbn=978-9004119437 }}</ref>\n\nEventually, the prosperity of this trade would attract more powerful regional neighbours, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Assyria]], the Babylonians, [[Persia]]ns, [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who would control the Canaanites politically, levying tribute, taxes, and tariffs. Often in such periods, thorough overgrazing would result in a climatic collapse and a repeat of the cycle (e.g., [[PPNB]], [[Ghassulian]], [[Uruk]], and the [[Bronze Age]] cycles already mentioned). The fall of later Canaanite civilization occurred with the incorporation of the area into the [[Greco-Roman]] world (as [[Iudaea]] province), and after [[Byzantine]] times, into the Muslim [[Arab]] and proto-Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. [[Western Aramaic]], one of the two [[lingua franca]]s of Canaanite civilization, is still spoken in a number of small Syrian villages, whilst [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] disappeared as a spoken language in about 100&nbsp;AD.

They were named after the Christian [[saint]]s to whom their ancient [[parish church]]es were dedicated:\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=33em|\n*[[Grouville]] (historically ''Saint Martin de Grouville''; incorporating [[Minquiers|Les Minquiers]])\n*[[Saint Br\u00e9lade]]\n*[[Saint Clement, Jersey|Saint Cl\u00e9ment]]\n*[[Saint Helier]]\n*[[Saint John, Jersey|Saint John]]\n*[[Saint Lawrence, Jersey|Saint Lawrence]]\n*[[Saint Martin, Jersey|Saint Martin]] (historically ''Saint Martin le Vieux''; incorporating [[\u00c9cr\u00e9hous|Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous]])\n*[[Saint Mary, Jersey|Saint Mary]]\n*[[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]]\n*[[Saint Peter, Jersey|Saint Peter]]\n*[[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]]\n*[[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]]\n}}\nThe parishes of Jersey are further divided into ''[[vingtaine]]s'' (or, in St. Ouen, ''cueillettes''), divisions that are historic. Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.\n\nThe [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Conn\u00e9table]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl\u00e9es paroissiales''). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.\n\nEach parish elects its own force of [[Honorary Police]] consisting of ''[[Centenier]]s'', ''[[Vingtenier]]s'' and [[Constable's Officer]]s. Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the ''Chef de Police'') deputised for the Conn\u00e9table in the States of Jersey when the Conn\u00e9table was unable to attend a sitting of the States. This function has now been abolished.\n\n===International relations===\n{{main|External relations of Jersey}}\n[[File:Jersey Airport signage in J\u00e8rriais.jpg|upright=1.35|right|thumb|[[Jersey Airport]] greets travellers with \"Welcome to Jersey\" sign in [[J\u00e8rriais]].]]\nAlthough diplomatic representation is reserved to the Crown, Jersey has been developing its own international identity over recent years. It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the Government of Jersey. Jersey maintains the ''Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes'' in [[Caen]], France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation. A similar office, the ''Maison de Normandie'' in St. Helier, represents the ''[[Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]'' of [[Manche]] and the ''[[Regional Council (France)|Regional Council]]'' of [[Normandy]]. It also houses the Consulate of France.

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents did not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]]. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in [[Brussels]] in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Channel Islands appoint representative in Brussels |date=25 January 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-12276525 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain.

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.\n\nJersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its \"Zero/Ten\" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm |title=Harmful tax competition \u2013 Taxation and Customs Union \u2013 European Commission |website=Taxation and Customs Union}}</ref> at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential.

By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years). Economic growth spurred immigration and a rise in population, which is, by 2013, about 100,000. From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

The festival is regularly held in [[Howard Davis Park]], St Saviour.\n\nFirst held in 2008, the [[Branchage|Branchage Jersey International Film Festival]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.branchagefestival.com/ |title=Branchage Film Festival |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915034127/http://www.branchagefestival.com/ |archive-date=15 September 2011 |access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref> attracts filmmakers from all over the world.\n\n===Food and drink===\n[[File:Jersey wonders.jpg|thumb|''Jersey wonders'', or ''m\u00e8rvelles'', are a favourite snack consisting of fried dough, found especially at country f\u00eates. According to tradition, the success of cooking depends on the state of the tide.]]\nSeafood has traditionally been important to the cuisine of Jersey: [[mussel]]s (called ''moules'' in the island), [[oyster]]s, [[European lobster|lobster]] and crabs \u2013 especially [[Maja squinado|spider crabs]] \u2013 [[Abalone|ormers]] and [[conger]].\n\nJersey milk being very rich, [[cream]] and butter have played a large part in insular cooking. ''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop. ''Bourd\u00e9lots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Ni\u00e8r beurre|l\u00e9 ni\u00e8r beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced. Other production of alcohol drinks includes wine,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lamarewineestate.com/estate/heritage |title=La Mare Wine Estate |access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref>  and in 2013 the first commercial [[vodka]]s made from Jersey Royal potatoes were marketed.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thisisjersey.com/news/2013/06/01/double-vodka-on-the-rock/ |title=Double vodka on the Rock |date=1 June 2013 |work=Jersey Evening Post |access-date=28 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAmong other traditional dishes are cabbage loaf, Jersey wonders (''les m\u00e8rvelles''), fliottes, bean crock (''les pais au fou''), [[Urtica dioica|nettle]] (''ortchie'') soup, vraic buns.\n\n===Sport===\n{{main|Sport in Jersey}}\n[[File:Harry Vardon statue Grouville 3.jpg|thumb|A statue of Jersey golfer, [[Harry Vardon]], stands at the entrance to the Royal Jersey Golf Club]]\nIn its own right Jersey participates in the [[Commonwealth Games]] and in the biennial [[Island Games]], which it first hosted in [[1997 Island Games|1997]] and more recently in [[2015 Island Games|2015]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jersey2015.com/home |title=Island Games Jersey 2015 Bid &#124; Home |publisher=Jersey2015.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325001855/https://www.jersey2015.com/home |archive-date=25 March 2012 |access-date=26 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn sporting events in which Jersey does not have international representation, when the British [[Home Nations]] are competing separately, islanders that do have high athletic skill may choose to compete for any of the Home Nations \u2013 there are, however, restrictions on subsequent transfers to represent another Home Nation.\n\nJersey is an associate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). The [[Jersey cricket team]] plays in the [[Inter-insular match]] among others. The Jersey cricket team competed in the World Division 4, held in [[Tanzania]] in October 2008, after recently finishing as runners-up and therefore being promoted from the World Division 5 held in Jersey. They also competed in the European Division 2, held in Guernsey during August 2008. The youth cricket teams have been promoted to play in the European Division 1 alongside Ireland, Scotland, Denmark, the Netherlands and [[Guernsey]]. In two tournaments at this level Jersey have finished 6th.\n\nFor Horse racing, Les Landes Racecourse can be found at Les Landes in St. Ouen next to the ruins of [[Grosnez Castle]].\n\nThe [[Jersey Football Association]] supervises football in Jersey. The Jersey Football Combination has nine teams in its top division. [[Jersey national football team]] plays in the annual [[Muratti]] competition among others.\n\n[[Rugby union in Jersey]] comes under the auspices of the Jersey Rugby Association (JRA), which is a member of the [[Rugby Football Union]] of England.

Swimming in the sea, windsurfing and other marine sports are practised. Jersey Swimming Club have organised an annual swim from Elizabeth Castle to Saint Helier Harbour for over 50 years. A round-island swim is a major challenge that a select number of swimmers have achieved. The Royal Channel Island Yacht Club is based in Jersey.\n\nThere is one facility for [[extreme sports]] and some facilities for youth sports. Jersey has one un-roofed skateboarding park. Coastal cliffs provide opportunities for [[rock climbing]].\n\nTwo professional [[golf]]ers from Jersey have won [[the Open Championship]] seven times between them; [[Harry Vardon]] won six times and [[Ted Ray (golfer)|Ted Ray]] won once. Vardon and Ray also won the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]] once each.

[[Printing]] arrived in Jersey only in the 1780s, but the island supported a multitude of regular publications in French (and J\u00e8rriais) and English throughout the 19th century, in which poetry, most usually topical and satirical, flourished (see [[J\u00e8rriais literature]]). The first J\u00e8rriais book to be published was ''Rimes et Po\u00e9sies Jersiaises de divers auteurs r\u00e9unies et mises en ordre'', edited by Abraham Mourant in 1865. Writers born in Jersey include [[Elinor Glyn]], [[John Lempri\u00e8re]], [[Philippe Le Sueur Mourant]], [[Robert Pipon Marett]] and [[Augustus Asplet Le Gros]]. [[Frederick Tennyson]] and [[Gerald Durrell]] were among authors who made Jersey their home.

As well as offering part-time and evening courses, Highlands is also a [[sixth form]] provider, working alongside [[Hautlieu School]] which offers the only non-fee-paying sixth form, and works collaboratively with a range of organisations including the [[Open University]], [[University of Plymouth]] and [[London South Bank University]]. In particular students can study at Highlands for the two-year foundation degree in financial services and for a BSc in social sciences, both validated by the [[University of Plymouth]].\n\nThe Institute of Law is Jersey's [[law school]], providing a course for students seeking to qualify as Jersey advocates and solicitors. It also provides teaching for students enrolled on the University of London LLB degree programme, via the [[University of London International Programmes|International Programmes]]. The Institute of Law also runs a 'double degree' course: students can obtain the LLB from the University of London and a ''Licence en droit M1'' from Toulouse 1 Capitol University; the two combine 4 years of studies in both English and French. The Open University supports students in Jersey, but they pay higher fees than UK students.

All border on the sea. They were named after the Christian [[saint]]s to whom their ancient [[parish church]]es were dedicated:\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=33em|\n*[[Grouville]] (historically ''Saint Martin de Grouville''; incorporating [[Minquiers|Les Minquiers]])\n*[[Saint Br\u00e9lade]]\n*[[Saint Clement, Jersey|Saint Cl\u00e9ment]]\n*[[Saint Helier]]\n*[[Saint John, Jersey|Saint John]]\n*[[Saint Lawrence, Jersey|Saint Lawrence]]\n*[[Saint Martin, Jersey|Saint Martin]] (historically ''Saint Martin le Vieux''; incorporating [[\u00c9cr\u00e9hous|Les \u00c9cr\u00e9hous]])\n*[[Saint Mary, Jersey|Saint Mary]]\n*[[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]]\n*[[Saint Peter, Jersey|Saint Peter]]\n*[[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]]\n*[[Trinity, Jersey|Trinity]]\n}}\nThe parishes of Jersey are further divided into ''[[vingtaine]]s'' (or, in St. Ouen, ''cueillettes''), divisions that are historic. Today they are used chiefly for purposes of local administration and electoral constituency.\n\nThe [[Conn\u00e9table (Jersey and Guernsey)|Conn\u00e9table]] is the head of each parish, elected at a public election for a four-year term to run the parish and to represent the municipality in the [[States of Jersey|States Assembly]]. The [[Procureur du Bien Public]] (two in each parish) is the legal and financial representative of the parish (elected at a public election since 2003 in accordance with the ''Public Elections (Amendment) (Jersey) Law 2003''; formerly an Assembly of Electors of each parish elected the Procureurs in accordance with the ''Loi (1804) au sujet des assembl\u00e9es paroissiales''). A Procureur du Bien Public is elected for three years as a public trustee for the funds and property of the parish and may contract when authorised by a Parish Assembly. The [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] is the decision-making body of local government in each parish; it consists of all entitled voters of the parish.\n\nEach parish elects its own force of [[Honorary Police]] consisting of ''[[Centenier]]s'', ''[[Vingtenier]]s'' and [[Constable's Officer]]s. Centeniers are elected at a public election within each parish for a term of three years to undertake policing within the parish. The Centenier is the only officer authorised to charge and bail offenders. Formerly, the senior Centenier of each parish (entitled the ''Chef de Police'') deputised for the Conn\u00e9table in the States of Jersey when the Conn\u00e9table was unable to attend a sitting of the States.

It negotiates directly with foreign governments on matters within the competence of the Government of Jersey. Jersey maintains the ''Bureau des Iles Anglo-Normandes'' in [[Caen]], France, a permanent non-diplomatic representation. A similar office, the ''Maison de Normandie'' in St. Helier, represents the ''[[Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral]]'' of [[Manche]] and the ''[[Regional Council (France)|Regional Council]]'' of [[Normandy]].

It did, however, have a relationship with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession in 1972.<ref>[[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]], Article 355(5)(c) TFEU states \"the Treaties shall apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man only to the extent necessary to ensure the implementation of the arrangements for those islands set out in the Treaty concerning the accession of new Member States to the European Economic Community and to the European Atomic Energy Community signed on 22 January 1972\".</ref> However, Jersey did not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This is a result of the manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like [[Gibraltar]], being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that was limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.\n\nUnder Protocol 3, Jersey was part of the [[European Union Customs Union]] of the [[European Community]]. The common customs tariff, levies and other agricultural import measures apply to trade between the island and non-Member States. There is [[Internal Market (European Union)#Free movement of goods|free movement of goods]] and trade between the island and [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]]. EU rules on [[freedom of movement for workers]] do not apply in Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996J0171:EN:HTML |title='&#39;Rui Alberto Pereira Roque v His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor of Jersey'&#39;, Case C-171/96 (European Court of Justice) |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> However, Article 4 of the Protocol required the island's authorities to give the same treatment to all natural and legal persons of the Communities. In Pereira, the ECJ held that the scope of this article included any matter governed by the Treaties in a territory where the Treaties are fully applicable. The island was therefore within the scope of the Treaties to a limited extent, as a European Territory. To infer, as the French Ambassador and finance minister had attempted to argue, namely that the island is outside the European Union and Communities without qualification is therefore simplistic, in law false. The German blacklisting of the island had to be hastily revoked when this was pointed out. As a result, Jersey was not part of the single market in [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive|financial services]]. It was not required to implement EU Directives on such matters as the movement of capital, company law or money laundering. However, the island's close proximity (135&nbsp;km south) and its close association with the financial sector of the U.K. has come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with several mainline publications (e.g., ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'') labelling the island a [[tax haven]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Sesit |first=M |title=Offshore Hazard: Isle of Jersey Proves Less Than a Haven to Currency Investors |date=17 September 1996 |agency=The Wall Street Journal}}</ref>\n\nBritish citizens who have only a connection to Jersey, and not with the United Kingdom or another member state of the European Union, were not considered by the Jersey States to be [[Citizenship of the European Union|European Union citizens]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.statesassembly.gov.je/AssemblyReports/2008/45051-30164-1222008.pdf |title=Status of Channel Islands in the European Union |last=States of Jersey |date=4 February 2008 |access-date=20 December 2011}}</ref> They have 'Islander status' and their Jersey-issued [[Jersey passport|British passports]] are endorsed with the words ''the holder is not entitled to benefit from EU provisions relating to employment or establishment''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |title=Islander status |last=States of Jersey |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107062741/http://www.gov.je/Travel/Passports/OtherInfo/Pages/IslanderStatus.aspx |archive-date=7 November 2011 |access-date=23 August 2011}}</ref> This will continue until the end of the Brexit transition period.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gov.je:80/Travel/Passports/GetAPassport/Pages/ApplyForYourFirstAdultPassport.aspx |title=Government of Jersey |last=Jersey |first=States of |website=gov.je |language=en |access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, it is not yet clear whether the citizenship rights in articles 18 and 21 TFEU are partly available to them as British Citizens, given the limited restriction of their rights under article 2 of the Protocol. That restriction on the exercise of certain freedoms did not apply to all Community or Union rights. The freedom of movement under the prior EC r\u00e9gime was and remains a separate set of rights from the Citizen rights under article 20 and 21 TFEU which include the right to move and reside. Those rights are primary citizenship rights, not a mere freedom. It might not need a Treaty change to perfect this, merely a preliminary ruling from the CJEU, and supplementary implementation measures from the Council, given the effective right of entrance and residence granted to EU nationals via Article 4 of the Protocol. Jersey residents did not have a right to vote in elections for the [[European Parliament]]. Jersey and Guernsey jointly opened an office in [[Brussels]] in 2010 to promote their common interests with European Union institutions.<ref>{{Citation |title=Channel Islands appoint representative in Brussels |date=25 January 2011 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-jersey-12276525 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe effect of the UK leaving the European Union is uncertain.

The levying of ''imp\u00f4ts'' (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). The Income Tax Law of 1928 introducing [[income tax]] was the first law drafted entirely in English. Income tax has been levied at a [[Flat tax|flat rate]] of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War.\n\nBecause [[value added tax]] (VAT) has not been levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, providing an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led to the growth of the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus undercutting local prices on the same products. In 2005, the Government of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. [[Low-value consignment relief]] provided the mechanism for [[VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands]] to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.\n\nAlthough Jersey does not have VAT, the Government of Jersey introduced a [[Value added tax|goods and services tax]] (GST) on 6 May 2008, at a standard rate of 3%. The rate was amended to 5% on 1 June 2011. Although GST is at 5%, shopping in Jersey is still far more expensive than in the UK. Food is not exempt, unlike with VAT.\n\nJersey is not subject to European Union fiscal legislation, and its \"Zero/Ten\" corporate tax legislation will be compliant with the Code of Conduct in business taxation as from the removal of the deemed distribution and attribution anti-avoidance legislation {{as of|2011|December|31|lc=y}}, which was apparently criticised by certain unnamed members of the Code of Conduct Group, a subsidiary body of [[ECOFIN]]. The Code of Conduct Group,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/company_tax/harmful_tax_practices/index_en.htm |title=Harmful tax competition \u2013 Taxation and Customs Union \u2013 European Commission |website=Taxation and Customs Union}}</ref> at least in theory, keeps most of its documentation and discussion confidential. The [[European Commission]] has confirmed that the Code is not a legal instrument, and therefore is not legally binding, only becoming of limited \"political\" authority once a unanimous report has been adopted by the Group at the end of the Presidency concerned.\n\nJersey is considered to be a [[tax haven]] by some organisations - for example the [[Financial Secrecy Index]] ranks Jersey as 18th {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/introduction/fsi-2018-results |title=View 2018 Results |website=www.financialsecrecyindex.com |access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> Jersey does not feature, however, in the March 2019 revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?qid=1553511630251&uri=CELEX:52019XG0326(01) |title=EUR-Lex - 52019XG0326(01) - EN - EUR-Lex |website=eur-lex.europa.eu |access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n===Currency===\n[[File:Dual currency cash machines in Jersey.jpg|thumb|Twin [[Automatic teller machine|cash machines]] at a bank that dispensed a choice of [[Bank of England]] or Jersey banknotes.

By the end of the 19th century, well-to-do British families, attracted by the lack of income tax, were settling in Jersey in increasing numbers, establishing St Helier as a predominantly English-speaking town.\n\nSeasonal work in agriculture had depended mostly on [[Breton people|Bretons]] and mainland Normans from the 19th century. The growth of tourism attracted staff from the United Kingdom. Following [[End of World War II in Europe|liberation]] in 1945, agricultural workers were mostly recruited from the United Kingdom \u2013 the demands of reconstruction in mainland [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]] employed domestic labour.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the population had been relatively stable for decades at around 60,000 (excluding the Occupation years).

From the 1960s [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] workers arrived, mostly working initially in seasonal industries in agriculture and tourism.\n\nImmigration has helped give aspects of Jersey a distinct urban character, particularly in and around the parish of St Helier, which contributes much to ongoing debates between development and sustainability throughout the island.<ref>Johnson, Henry (2016) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/306058256_Encountering_Urbanization_on_Jersey_Development_Sustainability_and_Spatiality_in_a_Small_Island_Setting Encountering Urbanization on Jersey: Development, Sustainability, and Spatiality in a Small Island Setting].

In 2015, Jersey's first ever national survey of religion found that two fifths of Jersey people have [[irreligion|no religion]], with only small handfuls of Jersey people belonging to the non-Christian religions. In total, 54% said they had some form of religion, and 7% were not sure. Of those that specified a denomination of Christianity, equal proportions were 'Catholic' or 'Roman Catholic' (43%) as were 'Anglican' or 'Church of England' (44%). The remaining eighth (13%) gave another Christian denomination.<ref name=\"JASS15\">{{Cite book |url=http://www.gov.je/SiteCollectionDocuments/Government%20and%20administration/R%20JASS%202015%2020151202%20SU.pdf |title=Jersey Annual Social Survey: 2015 |publisher=States of Jersey |page=8 |access-date=2 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[established church]] is the [[Church of England]], from 2015 under the See of Canterbury (previously under the Winchester diocese). In the countryside, [[Methodism]] found its traditional stronghold. A substantial minority of [[Catholic Church in Jersey|Roman Catholics]] can also be found in Jersey. There are two Catholic private combined primary and secondary schools: [[De La Salle College, Jersey|De La Salle College]] in [[Saint Saviour, Jersey|Saint Saviour]] is an all-boys school, and Beaulieu Convent School in Saint Saviour is an all-girls school; and [[Faithful Companions of Jesus|FCJ]] primary school in St. Saviour. A Catholic order of Sisters has a presence in school life.\n\n==Culture==\n{{main|Culture of Jersey}}\n[[File:La Nethe Rue road sign Jersey.jpg|thumb|J\u00e8rriais road sign (\"The black road\") in [[Saint Ouen, Jersey|Saint Ouen]].]]\nUntil the 19th century, indigenous [[J\u00e8rriais]] \u2013 a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of [[Norman language|Norman]] \u2013 was the language of the island, though French was used for official business. During the 20th century, [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British cultural influence]] saw an intense [[language shift]] take place and Jersey today is predominantly [[English-speaking world|English-speaking]].<ref name=\"Facts about Jersey\" /> J\u00e8rriais nonetheless survives; around 2,600 islanders (three percent) are reckoned to be habitual speakers, and some 10,000 (12 percent) in all claim some knowledge of the language, particularly amongst the elderly in rural parishes. There have been efforts to revive J\u00e8rriais in schools, and the highest number of declared J\u00e8rriais speakers is in the capital.\n\n[[File:Lillie langtry.JPG|thumb|upright|Actress [[Lillie Langtry]], nicknamed the ''Jersey Lily''.]]\nThe [[dialect]]s of J\u00e8rriais differ in [[phonology]] and, to a lesser extent, [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]] between parishes, with the most marked differences to be heard between those of the west and east. Many place names are in J\u00e8rriais, and French and English place names are also to be found. [[Anglicisation]] of the [[place names]] increased apace with the migration of English people to the island.\n\nSome [[Neolithic]] carvings are the earliest works of artistic character to be found in Jersey. Only fragmentary wall-paintings remain from the rich mediaeval artistic heritage, after the wholesale [[iconoclasm]] of the [[Reformation|Calvinist Reformation]] of the 16th century.\n\nThe island is particularly famous for the [[Jersey Battle of Flowers|Battle of Flowers]], a carnival held annually since 1902.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.battleofflowers.com/thebattle/index.htm |title=The Jersey Battle of Flowers |year=2005 |publisher=Jersey Battle of Flowers Association |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825021120/http://www.battleofflowers.com/thebattle/index.htm |archive-date=25 August 2006 |access-date=15 October 2006}}</ref> Other festivals include ''La F\u00eate d\u00e9 Nou\u00e9''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jersey.com/english/sightsandactivities/eventscalendar/christmas/pages/default.aspx |title=La F\u00eate d\u00e9 Nou\u00e9 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222111703/http://www.jersey.com/english/sightsandactivities/eventscalendar/christmas/pages/default.aspx |archive-date=22 December 2010 |access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref>  (Christmas festival), ''La Fa\u00ees'sie d'Cidre'' (cidermaking festival),<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://jerseyheritage.org/events/la-fa-s-sie-d-cidre |title=La Fa\u00ees'sie d'Cidre |access-date=18 September 2011}}</ref> the [[Battle of Britain]] air display, Jersey Live Music Festival, Branchage Film Festival, food festivals, and parish events.\n\nThe island's [[patron saint]] is [[Helier|Saint Helier]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/geraint/helier/falle.html |title=Saint Helier \u2013 Saint H\u00e9lyi \u2013 Saint H\u00e9lier |last=Falle |first=Samuel |publisher=[[Geraint Jennings]], [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Jersiaise]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041214190603/http://www.societe-jersiaise.org/geraint/helier/falle.html |archive-date=14 December 2004 |access-date=15 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Jersey}}\n\n====Broadcast====\n{{main|Telecommunications in Jersey}}\n[[File:Ha\u00fbl\u00eengu'thie d'la couleu d'J\u00e8rri l'7 d'Avri 2011 11.jpg|thumb|A Channel Television crew interview the [[Bailiff of Jersey]]]]\n[[BBC Radio Jersey]] provides a radio service, and BBC [[Spotlight (BBC News)|Channel Islands News]] with headquarters in Jersey provides a joint television news service with Guernsey.

The Jersey Film Society was founded on 11 December 1947 at the Caf\u00e9 Bleu, West's Cinema. The large Art Deco Forum Cinema was opened in 1935 \u2013 during the German occupation this was used for German [[propaganda]] films.\n\nThe [[Odeon Cinema]] was opened 2 June 1952 and, was later rebranded in the early 21st century as the Forum cinema. Its owners, however, struggled to meet tough competition from the Cineworld Cinemas group, which opened a 10 screen multiplex on the waterfront centre in St. Helier on reclaimed land in December 2002 and the Odeon closed its doors in late 2008.

''(See [[Channel Island milk]])'' However, there is no indigenous tradition of cheese making, contrary to the custom of mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey [[fudge]], mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.\n\n[[Jersey Royal potatoes]] are the local variety of [[new potato]], and the island is famous for its early crop of Chats (small potatoes) from the south-facing c\u00f4tils (steeply sloping fields). They were originally grown using [[Seaweed fertiliser|vraic]] as a natural fertiliser giving them their own individual taste, only a small portion of those grown in the island still use this method. They are eaten in a variety of ways, often simply boiled and served with butter or when not as fresh fried in butter.\n\nApples historically were an important crop. ''Bourd\u00e9lots'' are apple dumplings, but the most typical speciality is black butter (''[[Ni\u00e8r beurre|l\u00e9 ni\u00e8r beurre]]''), a dark spicy spread prepared from apples, cider and spices. [[Cider]] used to be an important export. After decline and near-disappearance in the late 20th century, apple production is being increased and promoted. Besides cider, [[apple brandy]] is produced.

The show aired from August 26, 2009 to November 29, 2009, lasting 97 days. For the fifth season, the house has been split into two sides with one side representing '<nowiki/>''Paradise''<nowiki/>' and the other representing the '''Slums''<nowiki/>'. The concept of Head of House was introduced into this season.\n\n[[Vappu Pimi\u00e4]] was the host of the ''Big Brother Talk Show'' and [[Jani Toivola]] hosted ''Big Brother Extra''. This was the last season where Pimi\u00e4 served as a hostess; the fifth season was the only season in which Toivola appeared.\n\nThe open auditions for the season were completed in April 2009.\n\n==Housemates==\nFourteen housemates entered the house at launch night. Justiina entered on Day 18, and Toni and Marko entered on Day 27, after the eviction of Lotta and Tuija. The final four housemates - Antti, Iida, Saranna and Stephania - entered on Day 55, after Minna's eviction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 50%\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Name\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Age{{ref|H1|[I]}}\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Occupation\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Hometown\n| class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"22\"|<ref>http://worldofbigbrother.com/BB/Fin/5/housemates.shtml</ref>\n|-\n| Antti Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4inen\n| 30\n| Unemployed\n| [[Kuopio]]\n|-\n| Aso Alanso\n| 30\n| Construction worker\n| [[Turku]], born in [[Iran]]\n|-\n| Dana Mustaj\u00e4rvi\n| 21\n| Student\n| [[Tampere]], born in [[Russia]]\n|-\n| Esa A.

This would also be the second time that ''Big Brother Finland'' linked up with other foreign versions of the show, [[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|Season 4]] being the first, when housemate Johan Grahn traded places with Munyaradzi Chidzonga from the [[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Big Brother Africa]]''.\n\nThe Philippine version boasts of being the first Big Brother franchise with two separate and complete houses, which compete each week for their weekly budget. On Day 66, K\u00e4tlin Laas left the Big Brother house. The following day, it was announced that [[Catherine \"Cathy\" Remperas]], a 22-year-old registered [[nurse]] from [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]] would be swapped with K\u00e4tlin.\n\nK\u00e4tlin left the Big Brother Finland House on Day 66 (Day 26 of the Philippine version) and enter either Philippine House on Day 69 (Day 29 of the Philippine version). She was supposed to arrive in the Philippines and enter either House the day before, but her flight was delayed due to weather disturbances caused by [[Typhoon Mirinae (2009)|Typhoon Mirinae]]. Hours before her entrance, she had a brief appearance on the show ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|The Buzz]]''. On the other hand, Cathy was supposed to leave in the morning of Day 68 (Day 28 of the Philippines version) but their flight was postponed to a later hour of the day.\n\nMuch like the first Big Swap, events from both houses are chronicled. Also, clips from Pinoy Big Brother are shown only in Big Brother Extra, with conversations subtitled in [[Finnish language|Suomi]]. For the Philippine version, clips are shown in the daily show with all conversations in English subtitled in Filipino and all Finnish conversations and confessions dubbed over by Filipino voice actors.\n\nThe Big Swap started on Day 69 (evening of Day 29 of the Philippine version). K\u00e4tlin initially stayed in House A upon her arrival on Day 69. She transferred to House B on Day 71. On Day 72, Cathy and K\u00e4tlin were finally able to meet through a video call through [[Skype]]. Later that day, K\u00e4tlin returned to House A. She left the Philippine House on the morning of Day 34 of the Philippine version (early morning of Day 74 of the Finnish version). She was briefly interviewed for the morning show ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'' just after stepping outside the front door. Meanwhile, Cathy entered on the evening of Day 69 (early morning of Day 30 of the Philippine version). She left six days later on the evening of Day 74 (early morning of Day 35 of the Philippine version), signaling the end of the Big Swap.\n\nK\u00e4tlin left the Philippines the same day she left the ''Pinoy Big Brother'' house and re-entered their house in the early morning of Day 75 of the Finnish version (Day 35 of the Philippine version). Cathy left Finland the morning after she left the Finnish Big Brother house and re-entered the ''Pinoy Big Brother'' house on the evening of Day 36 of the Philippine version (Day 76 of the Finnish version).\n\nBelow is a list of activities each swapped housemate did in their respective host country's houses, aside from introductions and trading of basic phrases:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! K\u00e4tlin\n| '''In House A:'''\n*Had a [[tropical]]-themed welcoming party.\n*Learned and sang the song \"[[Maalaala Mo Kaya (song)|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]\" (''Will You Remember'' in English), together with Tom.\n*Participated in a water [[football (soccer)|soccer]] game in which her team won (with Rob, Tom and Yuri) and ate Filipino exotic foods ([[frog legs]], [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[Balut (egg)|balut]], fried [[worm]]s and [[snails]]) as a reward. Patria acted as referee.\n'''In House B:'''\n*Brought [[plov]], an [[Estonia]]n dish, which is like a [[casserole]] with rice, beef or lamb, onions, carrots and ketchup.\n*Learned the dance [[Pandanggo|Pandanggo sa Ilaw]] with the housemates.\n*Participated in a parlor game involving [[inline skates]] and [[Flag of Finland|her country's flag]], where her team, an all-female team, lost. Tibo acted as referee.\n*Acted as referee in several [[spider fighting]] matches.\n*Had a [[jacuzzi]] party with Filipino street food (chicken head, chicken feet and chicken blood to name a few) foods, vodka and [[palm wine]] (locally known as ''tuba'').\n*As instructed by Big Brother's Finnish counterpart, K\u00e4tlin taught a Finnish song \"[[Ihmisten edess\u00e4 (song)|Ihmisten Edess\u00e4]]\" (''In Front of People'' in English), and had to choreograph a corresponding dance with the housemates.\n|-\n! Cathy\n|\n*Played a game called p\u00f6k\u00f6pallo, invented by the Finnish housemates, a game similar to the French game [[p\u00e9tanque]].\n*Had a [[sauna]] and [[jacuzzi]] welcoming party.\n*Learned and sang the song \"[[:fi:Sininen ja valkoinen|Sininen Ja Valkoinen]]\" (''Blue and White'' in English), together with all the Finnish housemates.\n*Learned different winter sports and activities, including [[cross-country skiing]], [[ice fishing]], [[ice hockey]], [[floorball]] and [[pes\u00e4pallo]] or Finnish baseball, Finland\u2019s national sport, demonstrated by Antti, Aso and Sampo.\n*Had an [[Asia]]n dinner with the housemates.\n*Experienced her first snow fall. Her housemates made a snowman for her, which she named ''Chuva Choo Choo''.\n*Taught the housemates the ''[[Wowowee]]'' game ''Hep Hep, Hooray''.\n*Cooked [[Adobo]] for the Finnish housemates.\n*Served as the judge in the Head of Household competition, which involved the housemates singing \"Sininen Ja Valkoinen\".\n*Had a [[Christmas]] dinner with the housemates and saw [[Santa Claus]].\n|}\n\nAlso, both Philippine and Finnish houses had weekly tasks involving housemates doing a 30-minute cultural [[variety show]] portraying their countries' cultures to their visitors. The Filipino housemates should include K\u00e4tlin in their presentation while the Finnish housemates should work four at a time in the upstairs room while Cathy is not around. However, it was later revealed that the real weekly task of the Filipino housemates is to make K\u00e4tlin feel the Filipino hospitality, to which she felt that both houses were friendly, yet she felt more warmth with House A.\n\nMore than three weeks after the Swap ended, on Day 97 of the fifth Finnish season, K\u00e4tlin was proclaimed as second placer, behind Aso.\n\nAfter 10 weeks, Cathy was evicted from the Pinoy Big Brother house, however, instead of going to the outside world, she was instructed by Big Brother to live in House B along with other ex-housemates to be part of the Resbak Attack team. After an intense week, she along with the other male ex housemates finally left the house.\n\n==Nominations table==\nThe housemate first mentioned in each nomination gets two points, while the second gets one point.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%; font-size:85%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:5%\"|\n! style=\"width:5%\"|{{nowrap|Week 2}} \n! style=\"width:5%\"|{{nowrap|Week 3}} \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 4 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 5 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 6 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 7 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 8 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 9 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 10  \n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week 11 \n! style=\"width:5%\"|{{nowrap|Week 12}} \n! style=\"width:5%\"|{{ nowrap|Week 13}} \n!colspan=\"2\" style=width:10%\" |Week 14<br>Final \n|-\n!

Housemates in Paradise get to live in the main house, have hot water 24/7 for bathing, plenty of food and the right to nominate. Housemates in Slums get to live in a makeshift area, sleeping on the floor with their jackets as blankets, a garden hose to wash in a roofless toilet, limited food (rice, sardines, porridge and pea soup), and had to earn their right to nominate in ''Nominations Competitions''.\n\nThe following Head of Household competitions have taken place:\n\n:*Week 2: Standing on one foot\n:*Week 3: Finding a candy from a bowl of sour milk using the mouth\n:*Week 4: General knowledge quiz\n:*Week 5: Transporting moving crates through an obstacle course\n:*Week 6: Finding marbles hidden in bushes\n:*Week 7: Shuttle run\n:*Week 8: Basketball throwing\n:*Week 9: [[Fear Factor]]-style eating competition\n:*Week 10: [[Uncharted 2]] [[PlayStation]] game\n:*Week 11: Singing ''Sininen Ja Valkoinen''\n:*Week 12: Eat a certain portion from 90-241 kcals, guess how long it will take to burn the food they ate and burn the food they ate using an exercise bicycle.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.subtv.fi/bigbrother Official Website] {{in lang|fi}}\n{{Big Brother Suomi}}\n\n[[Category:2009 Finnish television seasons]]\n[[Category:Big Brother (Finnish TV series) seasons|05]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n{{One source|date=July 2018}}\n{{Infobox television season\n| season_number        = 5\n| bgcolour             = #ADCF53\n| image            = Big Brother Finland 2009 eye.jpg\n| image_alt        = \n| caption          = \n| module1          = {{Infobox reality competition season\n | presenter       = Vappu Pimi\u00e4\n | num_days        = 97\n | num_housemates  = 21\n | winner          = Aso Alanso\n | runner_up       = K\u00e4tlin Laas\n | companion_shows = ''Big Brother Talk Show<br>Big Brother Extra''\n}}\n| country          = Finland\n| num_episodes     = \n| network          = [[Sub (TV channel)|Sub]]\n| first_aired      = {{start date|2009|8|25|df=y}}\n| last_aired       = {{end date|2009|11|25|df=y}}\n| prev_series      = [[Big Brother (Finnish season 4)|Big Brother 2008]]\n| next_series      = [[Big Brother (Finnish season 6)|Big Brother 2010]]\n}}\n'''''Big Brother 2009''''' was the fifth season of the [[Finland|Finnish]] version of the reality show ''[[Big Brother (Finland TV Series)|Big Brother]]''. The show aired from August 26, 2009 to November 29, 2009, lasting 97 days. For the fifth season, the house has been split into two sides with one side representing '<nowiki/>''Paradise''<nowiki/>' and the other representing the '''Slums''<nowiki/>'. The concept of Head of House was introduced into this season.\n\n[[Vappu Pimi\u00e4]] was the host of the ''Big Brother Talk Show'' and [[Jani Toivola]] hosted ''Big Brother Extra''. This was the last season where Pimi\u00e4 served as a hostess; the fifth season was the only season in which Toivola appeared.\n\nThe open auditions for the season were completed in April 2009.\n\n==Housemates==\nFourteen housemates entered the house at launch night. Justiina entered on Day 18, and Toni and Marko entered on Day 27, after the eviction of Lotta and Tuija. The final four housemates - Antti, Iida, Saranna and Stephania - entered on Day 55, after Minna's eviction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 50%\"\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Name\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Age{{ref|H1|[I]}}\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Occupation\n!style=\"text-align:left\" |Hometown\n| class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=\"22\"|<ref>http://worldofbigbrother.com/BB/Fin/5/housemates.shtml</ref>\n|-\n| Antti Syrj\u00e4l\u00e4inen\n| 30\n| Unemployed\n| [[Kuopio]]\n|-\n| Aso Alanso\n| 30\n| Construction worker\n| [[Turku]], born in [[Iran]]\n|-\n| Dana Mustaj\u00e4rvi\n| 21\n| Student\n| [[Tampere]], born in [[Russia]]\n|-\n| Esa A.

This would also be the second time that ''Big Brother Finland'' linked up with other foreign versions of the show, [[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|Season 4]] being the first, when housemate Johan Grahn traded places with Munyaradzi Chidzonga from the [[Big Brother Africa (season 3)|third season]] of ''[[Big Brother Africa]]''.\n\nThe Philippine version boasts of being the first Big Brother franchise with two separate and complete houses, which compete each week for their weekly budget. On Day 66, K\u00e4tlin Laas left the Big Brother house. The following day, it was announced that [[Catherine \"Cathy\" Remperas]], a 22-year-old registered [[nurse]] from [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]] would be swapped with K\u00e4tlin.\n\nK\u00e4tlin left the Big Brother Finland House on Day 66 (Day 26 of the Philippine version) and enter either Philippine House on Day 69 (Day 29 of the Philippine version). She was supposed to arrive in the Philippines and enter either House the day before, but her flight was delayed due to weather disturbances caused by [[Typhoon Mirinae (2009)|Typhoon Mirinae]]. Hours before her entrance, she had a brief appearance on the show ''[[The Buzz (talk show)|The Buzz]]''. On the other hand, Cathy was supposed to leave in the morning of Day 68 (Day 28 of the Philippines version) but their flight was postponed to a later hour of the day.\n\nMuch like the first Big Swap, events from both houses are chronicled. Also, clips from Pinoy Big Brother are shown only in Big Brother Extra, with conversations subtitled in [[Finnish language|Suomi]]. For the Philippine version, clips are shown in the daily show with all conversations in English subtitled in Filipino and all Finnish conversations and confessions dubbed over by Filipino voice actors.\n\nThe Big Swap started on Day 69 (evening of Day 29 of the Philippine version). K\u00e4tlin initially stayed in House A upon her arrival on Day 69. She transferred to House B on Day 71. On Day 72, Cathy and K\u00e4tlin were finally able to meet through a video call through [[Skype]]. Later that day, K\u00e4tlin returned to House A. She left the Philippine House on the morning of Day 34 of the Philippine version (early morning of Day 74 of the Finnish version). She was briefly interviewed for the morning show ''[[Umagang Kay Ganda]]'' just after stepping outside the front door. Meanwhile, Cathy entered on the evening of Day 69 (early morning of Day 30 of the Philippine version). She left six days later on the evening of Day 74 (early morning of Day 35 of the Philippine version), signaling the end of the Big Swap.\n\nK\u00e4tlin left the Philippines the same day she left the ''Pinoy Big Brother'' house and re-entered their house in the early morning of Day 75 of the Finnish version (Day 35 of the Philippine version). Cathy left Finland the morning after she left the Finnish Big Brother house and re-entered the ''Pinoy Big Brother'' house on the evening of Day 36 of the Philippine version (Day 76 of the Finnish version).\n\nBelow is a list of activities each swapped housemate did in their respective host country's houses, aside from introductions and trading of basic phrases:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The organisation's purpose was to engage in an armed struggle to form a socialist Assam.{{citation needed |date=July 2012}}\n\nUlfa during its heyday (late eighties and nineties of the last century) was quite popular among many indigenous Assamese people of the Brahmaputra valley. Majority of the supporters felt that a powerful organisation was necessary to get the voice of a peripheral region heard in the corridors of power in Lutyen's Delhi. But gradually, the organisation's undue emphasis on collection of money and weapons in the name of furthering the \u2018revolution\u2019 led to mindless violence throughout the state. It witnessed a period marked by growing disillusionment and anger amid its supporters. In their bloody conflict with the security agencies, many innocent people lost their lives and several thousands were permanently maimed. It is estimated that more than ten thousand local youths perished during that turbulent period. In the process, owing to the twin factors of increasing pressure by the security agencies and dwindling support among its core sympathisers, its importance in Assam has been steadily declined.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/world/ulfas-misplaced-sense-of-aggression-against-dalai-lama-underscores-its-eagerness-to-keep-china-happy-3358818.html|title=Ulfa's misplaced sense of aggression against Dalai Lama underscores its eagerness to keep China happy|website=Firstpost|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nRecruiting for the front did not begin until 1983. Soon after it finished recruitment in 1984, it began to seek out training and arms procurement from other groups such as the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). In 1986 it launched a fund raising \"campaign\" across India by way of extortion. It then began to set up camps in [[Tinsukia]] and [[Dibrugarh]] but was soon banned by New Delhi on 7 November, under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]].\n\nIn less than a decade of its formation, the ULFA emerged as one of the most powerful and violent insurgent outfit in Southeast Asia, largely because of the immense popularity it enjoyed during the first decade of its struggle as well as its economic power which in turn helped it in bolstering its military capabilities. In the early 1990s, ULFA launched an aggressive campaign with victims such as security forces, political opponents, and blasting rail links. In July 1991 the front captured and held 14 people for ransom, included in the abductees was an engineer and a national of the Soviet Union. From the 1990s on the ULFA have continued to carry out attacks.\n<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ulfa.html]{{Dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[Indo-Asian News Service]] citing Indian police and intelligence officials reported ULFA's commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah was at a temporary base along the Myanmar-China border. The report also stated that the rebels looked to take shelter in China. Paresh Baruah visited China in the 1980s.

It does not consider itself a [[secession]]ist organisation, as it claims that Assam was never a part of India and as a matter of fact the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] was signed in 1826 by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and by Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only 50 miles from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion.\n\nAccording to the treaty, the Burmese agreed to (1) cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of Salween river, (2) cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia, (3) pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four instalments, (4) allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta, and (5) sign a commercial treaty in due course.\n\nIt claims that among the various problems that the [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]] are confronting, the problem of national identity is the most basic, and therefore it seeks to represent \"independent minded struggling indigenous Assamese peoples\" irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[tribe]], [[caste]], religion and nationality.\n\n==ULFA according to Government of India==\nThe [[Government of India]] (GOI) has classified it as a terrorist organisation and had banned it under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] in 1990. Concurrently, GOI started military offensives against it, named [[Operation Bajrang November 1990]], [[Operation Rhino September 1991]], [[Operation All Clear December 2003]] and [[Operation Rhino 2]] led by the [[Indian Army]]. The anti insurgency operations still continues at present under the Unified Command Structure.\n\n==Major activities==\n\n===Assassinations===\n\nSome of the major assassinations by ULFA include that of Surendra Paul in May 1990, the brother of businessman Lord [[Swraj Paul]], that precipitated a situation leading to the sacking of the [[Government of Assam]] under [[Prafulla Kumar Mahanta]] and the beginning of [[Operation Bajrang]].\n\nOn the ULFA's Army Day on 16 March 2003, an IED explosion under a bus on National Highway No. 7 killed six civilians and wounded approximately 55 others.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1991 a Russian engineer, and national of the Soviet Union was kidnapped along with others and killed. In 1997, [[Sanjay Ghose]], a social activist and a relative of a high ranking Indian diplomat, was kidnapped and killed. The highest government officer assassinated by the group was local [[Asom Gana Parishad]] minister [[Nagen Sharma]] in 2000. An unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on AGP Chief Minister [[Prafulla Kumar Mahanta]] in 1997. A [[mass grave]], discovered at a destroyed ULFA camp in Lakhipathar forest, showed evidence of executions committed by ULFA.\n\nULFA continues to attempt ambushes and sporadic attacks on government security forces.\n\nIn 2003, the ULFA was accused of killing labourers from [[Bihar]] in response to an alleged molestation of a [[Mizo people|Mizo]] girl in a train passing through [[Bihar]]. This incident sparked off [[anti-Bihari sentiment]] in [[Assam]] and ULFA saw it as an opportunity to regain its lost ground. The ULFA killed civilians of [[Bihar]]i origin and other outsiders of mainland India.\n\nIn 2003, during a Railways Recruitment Board Examination for Group (D) posts conducted by [[Northeast Frontier Railway zone]] a wing of [[Indian Railways]], a good number of candidates from [[Bihar]] and other states were beaten up and stopped from taking exam by some elements who were seeking 100 percent reservation for the [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]] non-employed long ahead of the date of the said test.\n\nIn resentment, some hoodlums misbehaved randomly with train passengers from North Eastern Indians states passing through some of the stations like [[Katihar]], [[Jamalpur, Munger|Jamalpur]], [[Kishanganj]] in [[Bihar]].\n\nDuring that period ULFA was already losing its popularity and ground across many pockets in [[Assam]] where it had strongholds. However, ULFA took this situation as an opportunity to fan an opposition against '[[India]]' among people in [[Assam]]. They started killing [[Hindi]]-speaking people mostly having origin in [[Bihar]] in the State.\n\nOn 15 August 2004, an explosion occurred in [[Dhemaji District]] of [[Assam]] in which 13 people died, mainly women and school children. This explosion was carried out by ULFA. The ULFA has obliquely accepted responsibility for the blast.<ref>[http://www.assamtribune.com/aug1704/at05.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022123829/http://www.assamtribune.com/aug1704/at05.html|date=22 October 2004}}</ref> This appears to be the first instance of ULFA admitting to public killings with an incendiary device.\n\nIn January 2007, the ULFA once again struck in Assam killing approximately 62 Hindi-speaking migrant workers mostly from Bihar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiandefencereview.com/idr-new-website/|title=Indian Defence Review New Website|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> ULFA notoriety as a directionless and unpopular organisation increased, as the bomb blast victims also included several indigenous Assamese people.\n\nThe Central Government made a tough response, forcing a dreaded group of ULFA - [[28th Battalion (ULFA)|28 Battalion]] to unilaterally bow down and seek asylum from the government. This particular one-sided ceasefire broke the backbone of ULFA.\n\nOn 15 March 2007, ULFA triggered a blast in [[Guwahati]], injuring six persons as it celebrated its 'army day'.\n\n===Economic subversion===\nThe ULFA has claimed responsibility for bombings of economic targets like [[crude oil]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[freight]] trains and government buildings, including 7 August 2005 attack on oil pipelines in Assam.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4129254.stm|title=bombing of oil facilities on August 7, 2005|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> ULFA carried out a bombing and destruction of a five million-liter petrol reservoir at Digboi refinery in Tinsukia, with an estimated property loss of Rs 200million. On the same day they also damaged a gas pipeline in the oil district of Tinsukia.\n<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Recruitment===\nIn the initial years of the ULFA movement (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both urban and rural areas of Assam among the indigenous Assamese people), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Northern and Upper Assam and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late [[Heerak Jyoti Mahanta]] hailed from a place which is just a few kilometres from Guwahati. However, with the elite upper caste Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the predominantly backward areas of predominantly marginalised indigenous communities for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam. The Ulfa also has strong following among the [[Naga people]] in Assam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/06/arunachal-pradesh-becoming-safe-haven.html|title=Arunachal Pradesh Becoming Safe Haven For Militants - Sinlung|publisher=Sinlung.com|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political activities===\nAfter 1985 and before it was banned in 1990, ULFA was credited in the media with many public activities. It has continued a public discourse of sorts through the local media (newspapers), occasionally publishing its position on political issues centred around the nationality question. It has participated in public debates with public figures from Assam. During the last two local elections, the ULFA had called for [[boycott]]s. Media reports suggest that it used its forces to intimidate activists and supporters of the then-ruling parties ([[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and AGP respectively).\n\n===Extortion===\nThe ULFA is credited with some [[bank robbery|bank robberies]] during its initial stages. Now it is widely reported to [[extortion|extort]] businessmen, bureaucrats and politicians for collecting funds. In 1997, the Chief Minister of Assam accused [[Tata Tea]] of paying the medical bills of the ULFA cultural secretary [[Pranati Deka]] at a [[Mumbai]] hospital.\n\n===Organised criminal activities===\nThe ULFA is not involved any other organised criminal activities such as drug trafficking and arms trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pulf.htm |title=Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nThe ULFA is reported to maintain a number of camps in Bangladesh, where members are trained and sheltered away from Indian security forces. In April 2004, police and Coast Guard intercepted unloading at [[Chittagong]] of a massive amount of illegal arms and ammunition, being loaded into 10 trucks and believed intended for ULFA. A total of 50 have been charged with arms smuggling and arms offences, including former high-level Bangladesh political appointees, including Bangladesh National Party ministers and National Security Intelligence military officers, as well as prominent businessmen, and [[Paresh Baruah]], military wing chief of ULFA, then living in Dhaka.<ref name=\"bss2012\"/> He fled the country.

These camps housed combatants and non-combatant families of ULFA members.\n\nThe ULFA maintains close relationships with other separatist organisations like [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland|NDFB]], [[Karabakh Liberation Organization|KLO]] and [[NSCN (Khaplang)]].\n\n==Surrenders==\n{{main article|SULFA}}\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Government of India]] has attempted to wean away members of the ULFA. This occurred due to the death of the ULFA's deputy [[Commander in chief]] [[Heerak Jyoti Mahanta]] on 31 December 1991. He had opposed surrenders, but they began after his death. The group has been meeting more local opposition as residents are tired of the violence and disruption, and some energy has gone out of the movement.\n\nIn 1992 a large section of second-rung leaders and members surrendered to government authorities. These former members were allowed to retain their [[weapons]] to defend against their former colleagues; they were offered [[bank loan]]s without any liabilities to help them re-integrate into society. This loose group, now called SULFA, has become an important element in the armed politics and business of [[Assam]]. Some surrenders have been staged for political and economic reasons by local and national governments.\n\nThe total number of ULFA cadres to have laid down arms has gone up to 8,718. 4,993 cadres surrendered between 1991 and 1998. 3,435 surrendered between 1998 and 2005, when a new policy to deal with the ULFA was unveiled.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/234924.html \"ULFA morale hit as more cadres surrender\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214721/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/234924.html |date=15 May 2008 }}, ''The Indian Express'', 2 November 2007</ref> On 24 January 2012, one of northeast India's biggest surrender ceremonies took place in Assam's main city of Guwahati, when a total of 676 militants laid down their weapons.

With the fall of this government following elections in 2001, the secret killings stopped. Dinesh Barua, the elder brother of [[Paresh Barua]], military wing chief of ULFA in the 2000s, was taken from his house at night by unidentified Assamese men, along with armed military officers. Later his body was found lying near a cremation centre in [[Chabua]]. ULFA's Publicity Secretary, Mithinga Daimary, lost five members of his family during this period.\n\nGovernment investigations into the killings culminated in the report of the \"Saikia Commission\", presented to the Assam Assembly 15 November 2007. The report describes how the killings were organised by [[Prafulla Mahanta]], then the Assam Home Minister. They were executed by the police, with co-operation from the Indian Army. The gunmen were former members of ULFA who had surrendered to the government. They approached their targets at home, at night, knocking on the door and speaking in Assamese to allay suspicion. When the victims answered the door, they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/16/stories/2007111654701400.htm \"Saikia Commission indicts former Chief Minister Mahanta for 'secret killings'\"], ''The Hindu'', 16 November 2007</ref>\n\n==Negotiations/talks==\nThe ULFA has put forward a set of three preconditions for talks and negotiations with the Indian government. The government has rejected these preconditions. The preconditions are:\n# The talks should be held in a third country.\n# The talks should be held under [[United Nations]] supervision.\n# The agenda of the talks should include the Independence of Assam.\n\nIn 2004, the ULFA dropped the first two preconditions and offered to talk with the government. The Government of India was not ready to negotiate on the issue of Independence. Still some progress was made when the ULFA formed a \"[[People's Consultative Group]]\" in September 2005 to prepare the grounds for an eventual negotiation between the government and ULFA, which the government has welcomed. In a sustained operation launched by Indian Army inside a National Park in Dibru Saikhowa, ULFA lost its hides and camps, important leaders and cadres. The group came to the negotiating table in 2005.\nAccording to the India Times, talks were first held in December 2005 at the residence of the Prime Minister, [[Manmohan Singh]].\nThere were three rounds of peace talks with the 11-member [[People's Consultative Group]] (PCG), headed by noted Assamese writer [[Mamoni Raisom Goswami|Indira Goswami]], leading to a temporary truce in August 2006. However the truce broke down by 23 September of the same year as ULFA continued with its violent activities against civil population mainly tea estates and oil pipelines. It also violated ceasefire as it lobbed grenades on Army columns during the ceasefire period.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://o3.indiatimes.com/palashbiswas/archive/2007/10/20/4793351.aspx | work=The Times of India | title=North East Military Peace Tango | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323122913/http://o3.indiatimes.com/palashbiswas/archive/2007/10/20/4793351.aspx | archivedate=23 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Ceasefire by a portion of 28 Battalion of ULFA'''\n{{main article|28th Battalion (ULFA)}}\nSome leaders & cadres of the A and C companies of ULFA declared unilateral ceasefire on 24 Jun'2008 at a press meet held at Amarpur in Tinsukia district.

But the top brass of ULFA expelled the leaders of 28 Battalion led by [[Mrinal Hazarika]] and Jiten Dutta ( who had managed to escape from the cordon of Indian Army in Dibru Saikhowa National Park). The group later renamed as ULFA ( Pro-talk ).\n\nCurrently the 28th Battalion is under commandership of Lt [[Bijoy Chinese]] alias Bijoy Das.<ref>[http://www.assamtimes.org/hot-news/3909.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528214152/http://www.assamtimes.org/hot-news/3909.html|date=28 May 2010}}</ref> All the battalions have now been disbanded and only part of 27 battalion renamed as Kapili Gut remains. There are no commanders other than Paresh Baruah. All the others have been downgraded to staff and workers.\n\n==Renewed Peace Initiative==\nWith the arrest and deportation of top Ulfa leaders by the Bangladesh government to India, the once stalled peace process received a boost when the jailed Ulfa leaders took the initiative in forming a \"Citizen Forum\" comprising intellectuals, writers, journalists, sympathisers and professionals from various other fields that would act as a catalyst in bringing the Government of India and the rebel Ulfa to the negotiating table. In a state level convention held in Guwahati on 24 April 2010, the forum passed a set of resolutions to expedite the peace process between Government and the ULFA. These resolution include sending an 11-member team to Delhi to put pressure on the Centre to hold talk with ULFA at an earlier date. The convention resolved to urge both government and ULFA to come forward for talk without any condition. Moreover, the convention in a resolution demanded immediate release of ULFA leaders for from jail.\nAccording to the Indian Army sources, the total strength of ULFA is around 3,000, while various other sources put the figure ranging from 4,000 to 6,000. A military wing of the ULFA, the [[Sanjukta Mukti Fouj]] (SMF) was formed on 16 March 1996. SMF has three full-fledged battalions: the 7th, 8th and the 709th. The remaining battalions exist only on paper at best they have strengths of a company or so.

The organisation's purpose was to engage in an armed struggle to form a socialist Assam.{{citation needed |date=July 2012}}\n\nUlfa during its heyday (late eighties and nineties of the last century) was quite popular among many indigenous Assamese people of the Brahmaputra valley. Majority of the supporters felt that a powerful organisation was necessary to get the voice of a peripheral region heard in the corridors of power in Lutyen's Delhi. But gradually, the organisation's undue emphasis on collection of money and weapons in the name of furthering the \u2018revolution\u2019 led to mindless violence throughout the state. It witnessed a period marked by growing disillusionment and anger amid its supporters. In their bloody conflict with the security agencies, many innocent people lost their lives and several thousands were permanently maimed. It is estimated that more than ten thousand local youths perished during that turbulent period. In the process, owing to the twin factors of increasing pressure by the security agencies and dwindling support among its core sympathisers, its importance in Assam has been steadily declined.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/world/ulfas-misplaced-sense-of-aggression-against-dalai-lama-underscores-its-eagerness-to-keep-china-happy-3358818.html|title=Ulfa's misplaced sense of aggression against Dalai Lama underscores its eagerness to keep China happy|website=Firstpost|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nRecruiting for the front did not begin until 1983. Soon after it finished recruitment in 1984, it began to seek out training and arms procurement from other groups such as the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) and the Nationalist Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN). In 1986 it launched a fund raising \"campaign\" across India by way of extortion. It then began to set up camps in [[Tinsukia]] and [[Dibrugarh]] but was soon banned by New Delhi on 7 November, under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]].\n\nIn less than a decade of its formation, the ULFA emerged as one of the most powerful and violent insurgent outfit in Southeast Asia, largely because of the immense popularity it enjoyed during the first decade of its struggle as well as its economic power which in turn helped it in bolstering its military capabilities. In the early 1990s, ULFA launched an aggressive campaign with victims such as security forces, political opponents, and blasting rail links. In July 1991 the front captured and held 14 people for ransom, included in the abductees was an engineer and a national of the Soviet Union. From the 1990s on the ULFA have continued to carry out attacks.\n<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ulfa.html]{{Dead link|date=January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, [[Indo-Asian News Service]] citing Indian police and intelligence officials reported ULFA\u2019s commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah was at a temporary base along the Myanmar-China border. The report also stated that the rebels looked to take shelter in China. Paresh Baruah visited China in the 1980s. However in December 2003, China spurned ULFA's chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa appeal to China to provide safe passage to the rebels from Bhutan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/ulfa-eyeing-china-for-shelter-commander-in-china-myanmar-border_100112644.html |title=ULFA eyeing China for shelter, commander in China-Myanmar border |publisher=Thaindian.com |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==ULFA according to itself==\nThe ULFA is a revolutionary political organisation engaged in a liberation struggle against state terrorism and economic exploitation by India for the establishment of a [[sovereignty|sovereign]], [[independence|independent]] Assam for the [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]]. It does not consider itself a [[secession]]ist organisation, as it claims that Assam was never a part of India and as a matter of fact the [[Treaty of Yandaboo]] was signed in 1826 by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and by Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only 50 miles from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion.\n\nAccording to the treaty, the Burmese agreed to (1) cede to the British Assam, Manipur, Rakhine (Arakan), and Taninthayi (Tenasserim) coast south of Salween river, (2) cease all interference in Cachar and Jaintia, (3) pay an indemnity of one million pounds sterling in four instalments, (4) allow for an exchange of diplomatic representatives between Ava and Calcutta, and (5) sign a commercial treaty in due course.\n\nIt claims that among the various problems that the [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]] are confronting, the problem of national identity is the most basic, and therefore it seeks to represent \"independent minded struggling indigenous Assamese peoples\" irrespective of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[tribe]], [[caste]], religion and nationality.\n\n==ULFA according to Government of India==\nThe [[Government of India]] (GOI) has classified it as a terrorist organisation and had banned it under the [[Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]] in 1990. Concurrently, GOI started military offensives against it, named [[Operation Bajrang November 1990]], [[Operation Rhino September 1991]], [[Operation All Clear December 2003]] and [[Operation Rhino 2]] led by the [[Indian Army]]. The anti insurgency operations still continues at present under the Unified Command Structure.\n\n==Major activities==\n\n===Assassinations===\n\nSome of the major assassinations by ULFA include that of Surendra Paul in May 1990, the brother of businessman Lord [[Swraj Paul]], that precipitated a situation leading to the sacking of the [[Government of Assam]] under [[Prafulla Kumar Mahanta]] and the beginning of [[Operation Bajrang]].\n\nOn the ULFA's Army Day on 16 March 2003, an IED explosion under a bus on National Highway No. 7 killed six civilians and wounded approximately 55 others.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\nIn 1991 a Russian engineer, and national of the Soviet Union was kidnapped along with others and killed. In 1997, [[Sanjay Ghose]], a social activist and a relative of a high ranking Indian diplomat, was kidnapped and killed. The highest government officer assassinated by the group was local [[Asom Gana Parishad]] minister [[Nagen Sharma]] in 2000. An unsuccessful assassination attempt was made on AGP Chief Minister [[Prafulla Kumar Mahanta]] in 1997. A [[mass grave]], discovered at a destroyed ULFA camp in Lakhipathar forest, showed evidence of executions committed by ULFA.\n\nULFA continues to attempt ambushes and sporadic attacks on government security forces.\n\nIn 2003, the ULFA was accused of killing labourers from [[Bihar]] in response to an alleged molestation of a [[Mizo people|Mizo]] girl in a train passing through [[Bihar]]. This incident sparked off [[anti-Bihari sentiment]] in [[Assam]] and ULFA saw it as an opportunity to regain its lost ground. The ULFA killed civilians of [[Bihar]]i origin and other outsiders of mainland India.\n\nIn 2003, during a Railways Recruitment Board Examination for Group (D) posts conducted by [[Northeast Frontier Railway zone]] a wing of [[Indian Railways]], a good number of candidates from [[Bihar]] and other states were beaten up and stopped from taking exam by some elements who were seeking 100 percent reservation for the [[Assamese people|Indigenous Assamese people]] non-employed long ahead of the date of the said test.\n\nIn resentment, some hoodlums misbehaved randomly with train passengers from North Eastern Indians states passing through some of the stations like [[Katihar]], [[Jamalpur, Munger|Jamalpur]], [[Kishanganj]] in [[Bihar]].\n\nDuring that period ULFA was already losing its popularity and ground across many pockets in [[Assam]] where it had strongholds. However, ULFA took this situation as an opportunity to fan an opposition against '[[India]]' among people in [[Assam]]. They started killing [[Hindi]]-speaking people mostly having origin in [[Bihar]] in the State.\n\nOn 15 August 2004, an explosion occurred in [[Dhemaji District]] of [[Assam]] in which 13 people died, mainly women and school children. This explosion was carried out by ULFA. The ULFA has obliquely accepted responsibility for the blast.<ref>[http://www.assamtribune.com/aug1704/at05.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022123829/http://www.assamtribune.com/aug1704/at05.html|date=22 October 2004}}</ref> This appears to be the first instance of ULFA admitting to public killings with an incendiary device.\n\nIn January 2007, the ULFA once again struck in Assam killing approximately 62 Hindi-speaking migrant workers mostly from Bihar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiandefencereview.com/idr-new-website/|title=Indian Defence Review New Website|accessdate=28 December 2019}}</ref> ULFA notoriety as a directionless and unpopular organisation increased, as the bomb blast victims also included several indigenous Assamese people.\n\nThe Central Government made a tough response, forcing a dreaded group of ULFA - [[28th Battalion (ULFA)|28 Battalion]] to unilaterally bow down and seek asylum from the government. This particular one-sided ceasefire broke the backbone of ULFA.\n\nOn 15 March 2007, ULFA triggered a blast in [[Guwahati]], injuring six persons as it celebrated its 'army day'.\n\n===Economic subversion===\nThe ULFA has claimed responsibility for bombings of economic targets like [[crude oil]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, [[freight]] trains and government buildings, including 7 August 2005 attack on oil pipelines in Assam.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4129254.stm|title=bombing of oil facilities on August 7, 2005|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref> ULFA carried out a bombing and destruction of a five million-liter petrol reservoir at Digboi refinery in Tinsukia, with an estimated property loss of Rs 200million. On the same day they also damaged a gas pipeline in the oil district of Tinsukia.\n<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n===Recruitment===\nIn the initial years of the ULFA movement (when it used to enjoy widespread public support in both urban and rural areas of Assam among the indigenous Assamese people), cadres were recruited from rural areas as well as from many towns in Lower Assam, Northern and Upper Assam and middle Assam districts. One of the most popular ULFA leader of all time, the late [[Heerak Jyoti Mahanta]] hailed from a place which is just a few kilometres from Guwahati. However, with the elite upper caste Assamese urban middle class becoming increasingly sceptical of ULFA's method of functioning, the ULFA targeted the remote villages and the predominantly backward areas of predominantly marginalised indigenous communities for recruitment. According to intelligence sources, the Paresh Baruah faction of the Ulfa, which have been continuously raising its voice against the ongoing peace process being initiated by the Arabinda Rajkhowa faction, is engaged in a massive recruitment drive in the rural areas of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur and Nalbari districts of Assam. The Ulfa also has strong following among the [[Naga people]] in Assam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinlung.com/2011/06/arunachal-pradesh-becoming-safe-haven.html|title=Arunachal Pradesh Becoming Safe Haven For Militants - Sinlung|publisher=Sinlung.com|accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Political activities===\nAfter 1985 and before it was banned in 1990, ULFA was credited in the media with many public activities. It has continued a public discourse of sorts through the local media (newspapers), occasionally publishing its position on political issues centred around the nationality question. It has participated in public debates with public figures from Assam. During the last two local elections, the ULFA had called for [[boycott]]s. Media reports suggest that it used its forces to intimidate activists and supporters of the then-ruling parties ([[Indian National Congress|Congress]] and AGP respectively).\n\n===Extortion===\nThe ULFA is credited with some [[bank robbery|bank robberies]] during its initial stages. Now it is widely reported to [[extortion|extort]] businessmen, bureaucrats and politicians for collecting funds. In 1997, the Chief Minister of Assam accused [[Tata Tea]] of paying the medical bills of the ULFA cultural secretary [[Pranati Deka]] at a [[Mumbai]] hospital.\n\n===Organised criminal activities===\nThe ULFA is not involved any other organised criminal activities such as drug trafficking and arms trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pulf.htm |title=Peoples United Liberation Front (PULF) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=1 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Other activities===\nThe ULFA is reported to maintain a number of camps in Bangladesh, where members are trained and sheltered away from Indian security forces. In April 2004, police and Coast Guard intercepted unloading at [[Chittagong]] of a massive amount of illegal arms and ammunition, being loaded into 10 trucks and believed intended for ULFA. A total of 50 have been charged with arms smuggling and arms offences, including former high-level Bangladesh political appointees, including Bangladesh National Party ministers and National Security Intelligence military officers, as well as prominent businessmen, and [[Paresh Baruah]], military wing chief of ULFA, then living in Dhaka.<ref name=\"bss2012\"/> He fled the country.

These camps housed combatants and non-combatant families of ULFA members.\n\nThe ULFA maintains close relationships with other separatist organisations like [[National Democratic Front of Bodoland|NDFB]], [[Karabakh Liberation Organization|KLO]] and [[NSCN (Khaplang)]].\n\n==Surrenders==\n{{main article|SULFA}}\nBeginning in 1990, the [[Government of India]] has attempted to wean away members of the ULFA. This occurred due to the death of the ULFA's deputy [[Commander in chief]] [[Heerak Jyoti Mahanta]] on 31 December 1991. He had opposed surrenders, but they began after his death. The group has been meeting more local opposition as residents are tired of the violence and disruption, and some energy has gone out of the movement.\n\nIn 1992 a large section of second-rung leaders and members surrendered to government authorities. These former members were allowed to retain their [[weapons]] to defend against their former colleagues; they were offered [[bank loan]]s without any liabilities to help them re-integrate into society. This loose group, now called SULFA, has become an important element in the armed politics and business of [[Assam]]. Some surrenders have been staged for political and economic reasons by local and national governments.\n\nThe total number of ULFA cadres to have laid down arms has gone up to 8,718. 4,993 cadres surrendered between 1991 and 1998. 3,435 surrendered between 1998 and 2005, when a new policy to deal with the ULFA was unveiled.<ref>[http://www.indianexpress.com/story/234924.html \"ULFA morale hit as more cadres surrender\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515214721/http://www.indianexpress.com/story/234924.html |date=15 May 2008 }}, ''The Indian Express'', 2 November 2007</ref> On 24 January 2012, one of northeast India's biggest surrender ceremonies took place in Assam's main city of Guwahati, when a total of 676 militants laid down their weapons.

With the fall of this government following elections in 2001, the secret killings stopped. Dinesh Barua, the elder brother of [[Paresh Barua]], military wing chief of ULFA in the 2000s, was taken from his house at night by unidentified Assamese men, along with armed military officers. Later his body was found lying near a cremation centre in [[Chabua]]. ULFA's Publicity Secretary, Mithinga Daimary, lost five members of his family during this period.\n\nGovernment investigations into the killings culminated in the report of the \"Saikia Commission\", presented to the Assam Assembly 15 November 2007. The report describes how the killings were organised by [[Prafulla Mahanta]], then the Assam Home Minister. They were executed by the police, with co-operation from the Indian Army. The gunmen were former members of ULFA who had surrendered to the government. They approached their targets at home, at night, knocking on the door and speaking in Assamese to allay suspicion. When the victims answered the door, they were shot or kidnapped to be shot elsewhere.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/16/stories/2007111654701400.htm \"Saikia Commission indicts former Chief Minister Mahanta for 'secret killings'\"], ''The Hindu'', 16 November 2007</ref>\n\n==Negotiations/talks==\nThe ULFA has put forward a set of three preconditions for talks and negotiations with the Indian government. The government has rejected these preconditions. The preconditions are:\n# The talks should be held in a third country.\n# The talks should be held under [[United Nations]] supervision.\n# The agenda of the talks should include the Independence of Assam.\n\nIn 2004, the ULFA dropped the first two preconditions and offered to talk with the government. The Government of India was not ready to negotiate on the issue of Independence. Still some progress was made when the ULFA formed a \"[[People's Consultative Group]]\" in September 2005 to prepare the grounds for an eventual negotiation between the government and ULFA, which the government has welcomed. In a sustained operation launched by Indian Army inside a National Park in Dibru Saikhowa, ULFA lost its hides and camps, important leaders and cadres. The group came to the negotiating table in 2005.\nAccording to the India Times, talks were first held in December 2005 at the residence of the Prime Minister, [[Manmohan Singh]].\nThere were three rounds of peace talks with the 11-member [[People's Consultative Group]] (PCG), headed by noted Assamese writer [[Mamoni Raisom Goswami|Indira Goswami]], leading to a temporary truce in August 2006. However the truce broke down by 23 September of the same year as ULFA continued with its violent activities against civil population mainly tea estates and oil pipelines. It also violated ceasefire as it lobbed grenades on Army columns during the ceasefire period.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://o3.indiatimes.com/palashbiswas/archive/2007/10/20/4793351.aspx | work=The Times of India | title=North East Military Peace Tango | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323122913/http://o3.indiatimes.com/palashbiswas/archive/2007/10/20/4793351.aspx | archivedate=23 March 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Ceasefire by a portion of 28 Battalion of ULFA'''\n{{main article|28th Battalion (ULFA)}}\nSome leaders & cadres of the A and C companies of ULFA declared unilateral ceasefire on 24 Jun'2008 at a press meet held at Amarpur in Tinsukia district. The declared the ceasefire to pressurise the [[top brass]] of ULFA to sit on negotiation table with the Government of India. But the top brass of ULFA expelled the leaders of 28 Battalion led by [[Mrinal Hazarika]] and Jiten Dutta ( who had managed to escape from the cordon of Indian Army in Dibru Saikhowa National Park). The group later renamed as ULFA ( Pro-talk ).\n\nCurrently the 28th Battalion is under commandership of Lt [[Bijoy Chinese]] alias Bijoy Das.<ref>[http://www.assamtimes.org/hot-news/3909.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528214152/http://www.assamtimes.org/hot-news/3909.html|date=28 May 2010}}</ref> All the battalions have now been disbanded and only part of 27 battalion renamed as Kapili Gut remains. There are no commanders other than Paresh Baruah. All the others have been downgraded to staff and workers.\n\n==Renewed Peace Initiative==\nWith the arrest and deportation of top Ulfa leaders by the Bangladesh government to India, the once stalled peace process received a boost when the jailed Ulfa leaders took the initiative in forming a \"Citizen Forum\" comprising intellectuals, writers, journalists, sympathisers and professionals from various other fields that would act as a catalyst in bringing the Government of India and the rebel Ulfa to the negotiating table. In a state level convention held in Guwahati on 24 April 2010, the forum passed a set of resolutions to expedite the peace process between Government and the ULFA. These resolution include sending an 11-member team to Delhi to put pressure on the Centre to hold talk with ULFA at an earlier date. The convention resolved to urge both government and ULFA to come forward for talk without any condition. Moreover, the convention in a resolution demanded immediate release of ULFA leaders for from jail.\nAccording to the Indian Army sources, the total strength of ULFA is around 3,000, while various other sources put the figure ranging from 4,000 to 6,000. A military wing of the ULFA, the [[Sanjukta Mukti Fouj]] (SMF) was formed on 16 March 1996. SMF has three full-fledged battalions: the 7th, 8th and the 709th. The remaining battalions exist only on paper at best they have strengths of a company or so. Their allocated spheres of operation are as follows:\n\n7th Bn (HQ-Sukhini) is responsible for defence of General Headquarters (GHQ).\n\n8th Bn - Nagaon, Morigaon, Karbi Anglong\n9th Bn Golaghat, Jorhat, Sivasagar\n\n11th Bn Kamrup, Nalbari\n\n27th Bn Barpeta, Bongaigaon, Kokrajar\n\n28th Bn Tinsukia, Dibrugarh\n\n709th Bn Kalikhola\n\nIn the past decade nearly 2,500 (approximate) militants, including about 200 women cadres have surrendered to the government.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Insurgency in Northeast India]]\n*[[Enigma Force]]\n*[[People's Consultative Group]]\n*[[Sanjukta Mukti Fouj]]\n*[[List of terrorist organisations in India]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Nath\n  | first = Sunil\n  | title =  Assam: The Secessionist Insurgency and the Freedom of Minds\n  | journal = Faultlines\n  | volume = 13\n  | publisher = South Asia Terrorism Portal\n  | url = http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/faultlines/volume13/Article2.htm\n  | accessdate = 29 December 2007 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027113256/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Congress/7434/ulfa.htm ULFA Archived home page]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080406045824/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/1301D023-2F79-459F-91F7-D2BFA1186382.htm Bloody Tea] - Program on [[Aljazeera]] telecast beginning 30 May 2007.

L\u00fctjens is best known for his actions during [[World War II]] and his command of the [[battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} during its foray into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1941. In its aftermath, the episode entered into naval legend.\n\nBorn in 1889, he entered into the German Imperial Navy ({{Lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}}) in 1907. A diligent and intelligent [[cadet]] he progressed to [[Officer (armed forces)|officer rank]] before the outbreak of war, when he was assigned to a [[Torpedo boat]] Squadron. During [[World War I]] L\u00fctjens operated in the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] and fought several actions with the British [[Royal Navy]]. He ended the conflict as a ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) with the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class (1914) to his credit. After the war he remained in the service of the navy, now renamed the ''[[Reichsmarine]]''. He continued to serve in torpedo boat squadrons eventually becoming a [[Commanding Officer]] in 1925. In the [[Weimar Republic]] era, L\u00fctjens built a reputation as an excellent staff officer.\n\nIn 1935, after the [[Nazi Party]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933, the navy was remodelled again and renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. L\u00fctjens soon became acquainted with [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]; the two Commanders-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in World War II. His capability and friendship led to his promotion to ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) and a sea command at the helm of the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}. In the six years of peace he had risen to the rank of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral), a promotion conferred upon him October 1937.\n\nIn September 1939, World War II began with the [[German invasion of Poland]]. L\u00fctjens received the [[Clasp to the Iron Cross]] 2nd Class (1939) three days later. His command of [[destroyer]] operations in the North Sea over the winter, 1939\u201340, earned him the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class. On 1 January 1940, he was promoted to  ''Vizeadmiral'' (Vice Admiral). In April 1940 he was given temporary command of the entire German surface fleet during the initial landing phase of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasions of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. His actions earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the campaign he was appointed the [[Fleet commander (Kriegsmarine)|fleet commander]] of the German Navy and promoted to Admiral on 1 September 1940. He was involved in the tentative planning for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of the [[United Kingdom]], but the plans were shelved after the [[Battle of Britain]]. German intentions turned to blockade and L\u00fctjens made the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} the centerpiece of his battle fleet; using the latter vessel as his [[flagship]]. In January 1941 he planned and executed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']], an Atlantic raid to support [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking British merchant shipping lanes. The operation was a [[Tactical victory|tactical]] and [[propaganda]] victory. It came to a close in March 1941 when the ships docked in [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German-occupied France]] after sailing some 18,000 miles; a record for a German battle group at the time. His success led him to being chosen for further operations.\n\nIn May 1941, L\u00fctjens commanded a German task force, consisting of the battleship ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, during [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. In a repetition of ''Berlin'', L\u00fctjens was required to break out of their naval base in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]], sail via [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]], and attack merchant shipping. The operation went awry and the task force was soon spotted and engaged near [[Iceland]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk and three other British warships were forced to retreat. The two German ships then separated. Three days later, on 27 May, L\u00fctjens and most of the ship's crew lost their lives when ''Bismarck'' [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|was caught]] and sunk.\n\nIn 1955 the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was remilitarised and entered [[NATO]]. The ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was established the following year. In 1967 this organisation recognised L\u00fctjens and his service by naming the destroyer {{ship|German destroyer|L\u00fctjens|D185|2}} after him.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nJohann G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens was born in [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], on 25 May 1889.

The ship sailed via [[Skagen]], the [[Azores]] and [[Trinidad]] on the east coast of [[South America]], passed the [[Cape Horn]], up the west coast of South, [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle]] and [[North America]] to Vancouver. At [[Callao]] (25 January \u2013 6 February 1935) they joined in the 400-year celebration of Peru. ''Karlsruhe'' returned to Kiel on 15 June 1935, travelling through the [[Panama Canal]] to [[Houston]], [[Charlestown, Saint Kitts and Nevis|Charlestown]] and [[Vigo, Spain]].<ref>Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr, & Steinmetz 1993, v. 5., p. 89.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens first met [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]], future Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in Vigo in June 1935. At that point, D\u00f6nitz had been entrusted with the rebuilding of the U-Boat arm but had spent the summer at sea commanding {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}. After arriving at port, he met with Raeder. Raeder informed D\u00f6nitz that:\n<blockquote>L\u00fctjens is to become chief of the Officer Personnel Branch at Naval Headquarters with the task of forming an officer Corps for the new Navy we are about to build.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1997 [1958], pp. 6\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1936, L\u00fctjens was appointed Chief of Personnel (''Marinepersonalamt'') of the ''Kriegsmarine'', an office which he had served in 1932\u201334, and in 1937, he became ''F\u00fchrer der Torpedoboote'' (Chief of Torpedo Boats), with {{ship|German destroyer|Z1 Leberecht Maass||2}} as his flagship, and was promoted to ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' in October 1937.<ref>Ciupa 1979, p. 46.</ref> While in command of personnel department he did nothing to enforce the [[Nuremberg Laws]] on race in the ''Kriegsmarine''.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 230.</ref> In November 1938, L\u00fctjens was one of only three flag officers, including D\u00f6nitz, who protested in writing to Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the navy, against the anti-Jewish ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' [[pogrom]]s.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 264.</ref>\n\nHis successor at the ''Marinepersonalamt'' [[:de:Conrad Patzig|Conrad Patzig]], described L\u00fctjens as a dedicated naval officer who put his service to the nation ahead of the ruling party. He also described him as a difficult man to know. Austere, rather forbidding, he said little and when he did, confined his remarks to the essentials. Patzig said of him \"one of the ablest officers in the service, very logical and shrewd, incorruptible in his opinions and an engaging personality when you got to know him.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 35\u201336.</ref> Few did.

L\u00fctjens attacked from a range of 14,000 yards south-east of the harbour. The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive manoeuvres and to lay a [[smoke screen]] to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in the superstructure by a {{convert|152|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} shell from the [[Coastal artillery|coast defence]] [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men. L\u00fctjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective. L\u00fctjens ordered the group to [[Pillau]] to refuel and the ''Leberecht Maas'' sailed to Swinem\u00fcnde for repairs.<ref>O'Hara 2004, p. 4.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1939 L\u00fctjens led a raiding sortie into the [[North Sea]]. On board his flagship [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|Z21 ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']], he led six destroyers laden with naval mines. His own ship did not carry any mines and acted as cover. They reached the [[Humber Estuary]] undetected and departed unseen. Within days shipping losses began occurring among British transports in the area. L\u00fctjens did not repeat the operation. He was promoted to Vice Admiral and moved with his staff to the [[German cruiser N\u00fcrnberg|cruiser ''N\u00fcrnberg'']].<ref>Haarr 2013, p. 282.</ref>\n\n===Operation Weser\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0434-05A, G\u00fcnter L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vice Admiral L\u00fctjens in April, 1940]]\nIn April 1940, during the invasion of Denmark and Norway ([[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]), he served as ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral), commanding the distant cover forces in the North Sea\u2014which consisted of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. His superior, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Wilhelm Marschall]], had fallen ill just before the operation, so he assumed command of the [[Narvik]] and [[Trondheim]] landings.<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was to lead ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', with his flag in the latter, on escort operation for a force of 10 destroyers commanded by ''F\u00fchrer der Zerst\u00f6rer'' (Leader of Destroyers) [[Friedrich Bonte]]. The fleet was laden with soldiers belonging to the [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|''3. Gebirgs-Division'']] under the command of [[Eduard Dietl]]. The division was to seize Narvik.  L\u00fctjens briefed his officers aboard ''Gneisenau'' on 6 April in the presence of Raeder. L\u00fctjens had his doubts about the wisdom of the entire operation but he showed no sign of his feelings to his subordinates. L\u00fctjens hoped for bad weather to shield the fleet from Allied aircraft. The skies were clear and the ships were twice attacked by [[RAF Coastal Command]] bombers without result. The British airmen reported their position and surprise was now gone. Nevertheless, L\u00fctjens remained on schedule and delivered the force to Narvik. On two occasions a sailor was swept overboard but L\u00fctjens' operations officer, Heinrich Gerlach, noted: \"No rescue attempts were made. On no account was there to be any interruption of the time schedule.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' mission then was to draw British units away from Narvik and facilitate the landings there and prevent the [[Royal Navy]] from attacking the destroyers and landing craft. During the landing phase, his forces were approached by a Royal Navy task-force led by the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}. The British ship engaged at 05:05 and L\u00fctjens was forced to fight [[Action off Lofoten|an inconclusive battle]] with ''Renown''. L\u00fctjens succeeded in extracting the German vessels without incurring major battle damage. He viewed his operation as a success.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\">Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>O'Hara 2004. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> L\u00fctjens nearly changed his mind during the battle, believing a pitched fight may bring relief to the German destroyer force at Narvik\u2014a force which he had effectively been forced to abandon in the face of enemy sea superiority. But the prospect of running into {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}}, now known by German naval intelligence to be in the vicinity, was too much of a risk. In the resultant [[Battles of Narvik]] 10 German destroyers were sunk and the campaign for the port lasted until June. Bonte was killed when his command ship,  ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'' exploded.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIt may have been possible for him to turn on and sink ''Renown'' by attacking from different directions, using ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', but the accompanying British destroyers were well placed to join the fight had he done so. His Commander-in-Chief, Raeder, endorsed his actions which would have placed him against a clear eastern horizon as opposed to an enemy that was positioned against a darkened western horizon. Action at that time would have given the enemy a clearer silhouette to aim at while obscuring the British ships somewhat. Moreover, if either German ship had been immobilised by ''Renown'' they would have been vulnerable to a torpedo attack by the British destroyers. Under those circumstances, Raeder felt the British would have had a tactical advantage. L\u00fctjens later rendezvoused with the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and reached [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 12 April, having avoided a major fleet action.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\"/>\n\nL\u00fctjens was indirectly involved in another battle. The Trondheim force was led by the heavy cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' who detached the German destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} to search for a man that had been washed over board. In the heavy fog they ran into {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}. ''Glowworm'' outmatched the lighter German vessels and they disengaged and called for help. L\u00fctjens ordered ''Hipper'' to assist. The heavy cruiser sank the ''Glowworm'', but not before the British ship had rammed her larger assailant and caused her considerable damage.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> When L\u00fctjens stepped ashore at Wilhelmshaven, his decision to abandon Bonte's destroyer group at Narvik weighed heavily on his mind.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\">Garrett 1978, p. 44.</ref> In the wake of L\u00fctjens return, he learned Marschall had recovered to assume command.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\"/>\n\n===Commander of the fleet===\nIn June and July 1940, he became Commander of Battleships and the third ''Flottenchef'' (Fleet Commander) of the ''Kriegsmarine'', a position comparable to the British Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]]. His predecessor\u2014''Vizeadmiral'' Wilhelm Marschall\u2014had had repeated differences with Raeder over the extent the ''Flottenchef'' should be bound by orders while operating at sea. Marschall led ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' to intercept Allied naval forces withdrawing from [[Norway]] against orders. On 8 June 1940 he engaged and sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and her escorting [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}. During the battle ''Scharnhorst'' was heavily damaged by a torpedo. Marschall was dismissed by Raeder because the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' deemed the episode unacceptable.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\">Garrett 1978, p. 53.</ref> Raeder viewed the sinkings as \"target practice\" and the damage to ''Scharnhorst'', and consequently ''Gneisenau'', offset this victory in his view.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\nTen days later L\u00fctjens was given command of the fleet on a temporary basis. Raeder regarded L\u00fctjens as a sound tactician, excellent staff officer and a leader with all-important operational and battle experience. After the war Raeder was candid about his decision to elevate L\u00fctjens through the chain of command. Raeder said of his progression, \"He had also experience in staff work, and as my Chief of Personnel he had won by special confidence in years of close association.\"<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 353.</ref> Raeder expressed his confidence that L\u00fctjens displayed wise judgment and was unlikely to act rashly. When at sea, he allowed him to take command of the situation and make operational decisions at his own discretion.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 357.</ref> Although described as reserved and unapproachable toward subordinates, he was held to be \"of manifest integrity and reliability.\"<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 130.</ref> Hitler expressed his gratitude to L\u00fctjens for \"preparing and leading the Navy into action\", and awarded him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 14 June 1940.<ref>Groves 2012, p. 53.</ref>\n\n''Scharnhorst'' had been forced to make for Trondheim in the aftermath of the action for emergency repairs. Flying his flag in ''Gneisenau'', L\u00fctjens took command of his first voyage as ''Flottenchef'' aboard a capital ship. On 20 June 1940 he sailed in company with ''Admiral Hipper'', toward the North Sea in the hope of diverting attention from ''Scharnhorst'' while it made the perilous trek from Norway to Germany. The operation succeeded, but ''Gneisenau'' was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Clyde|N12|6}} and severely damaged.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\n[[File:OperationSealion.svg|thumb|left|Battle plan for Operation Sea Lion.]]\nIn July 1940 Hitler ordered the preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the United Kingdom after the victory [[Battle of France|in France]]. While the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' engaged the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in what became known as the [[Battle of Britain]] to clear the skies the German naval command began planning for an assault in southern England. L\u00fctjens, as fleet commander, was responsible for carrying out sea operations based upon the strategies devised by his superior Saalw\u00e4chter, who commanded Naval Group West. Saalw\u00e4chter answered to the commander-in-chief, Raeder.\n\nL\u00fctjens was to be heavily involved in the planning of the sea landings. The navy wished to land on a narrow front because of its limited resources and L\u00fctjens planned accordingly. He established himself in the fashionable market-town of [[Trouville, Seine-Maritime|Trouville]] near [[Le Havre]]. The enormous logistical effort that required the navy to move personnel command structures and personnel to France meant that his command post did not become fully operational until August 1940. [[Friedrich Ruge]] was appointed to the mine command by L\u00fctjens with the task of clearing British naval minefields and laying German mine zones to impede the operations of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, L\u00fctjens scoured the continent for the 1,800 river barges, 500 tugs, 150 steamships and 1,200 motor boats deemed necessary for the operation. Some 24,000 men were seconded from other services and trained as landing craft crewman.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was handicapped by the lack of firepower in the German navy. He authorised Ruge to organise the landings. The Advanced Detachments (''Vorausabteilungen'') were to storm the beach in [[battalion]]-strength. The following craft would clear mines allowing for artillery coasters and tugs carrying the [[Panzer]] units to follow unhindered. The smaller motor boats would unload engineers to clear obstacles and act as shuttle boats between the larger vessels and the beach. They would rush to and fro delivering army units to land in order to expand the beachhead and allow the flotilla to land its full complement. L\u00fctjens recommended using the old battleships ''Schlesien'' and {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} as fire support to protect the crossing. L\u00fctjens favoured beaching the ships on the [[Varne Bank]] to act as a gun-fire platform. He thought they could best act as strong points to deny passage through the [[Strait of Dover]] to the British. Raeder agreed but the plan was rubbished by technical experts who argued the old ships were too prone to capsizing and their stationary posture was too vulnerable and their armament too weak to do the job effectively.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens continued planning preparations as the Battle of Britain raged. By September he had completed plans to land the entire [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 16th Army]] under [[Ernst Busch (field marshal)|Ernst Busch]] between [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and [[Hastings]]\u2014the site of the [[Battle of Hastings|last successful invasion of England in 1066]]\u2014and the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] between Hastings and [[Worthing]] to the west. L\u00fctjens' opinion on the chances of success are not known. The battles in Norway had left him without any major capital ship. In the event, L\u00fctjens was never tested. The air battle over Britain was lost and by the end of 1940 plans for an invasion were postponed as Hitler turned eastward for a campaign against the [[Soviet Union]]. German naval strategy now turned to thoughts of [[siege]] and destroying Britain's shipping lanes which supplied the country from the overseas and in particularly [[North America]].<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 241\u2013243, 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\n===Operation Berlin===\n''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were readied for action again by the winter. Their task now was to engage Allied [[merchant vessel]]s bringing war materials to Britain. As fleet commander, it would be L\u00fctjens' first operation in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was named [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']]. On 28 December 1940, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on which Admiral L\u00fctjens had raised his flag\u2014left Germany for an Atlantic raid. However, due to weather, L\u00fctjens ordered a return to port: ''Gneisenau'' to Kiel and ''Scharnhorst'' to Gdynia. While repairs were carried out Navy Group West emphasised to him that his primary targets were enemy merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens reiterated his standing orders to his captains: \"our job is to put as many as possible under the water\".<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 1941, the renewed mission was delayed for several days owing to the sighting of British ships near the Norwegian coast and the inability of submarine chasers and destroyers to escort them to the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, pp. 56\u201358.</ref> L\u00fctjens chose to pass between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Unbeknownst to L\u00fctjens, his ships had been spotted sailing past [[Zealand]], Denmark, by British agents. British Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, Admiral [[John Tovey]] was alerted and dispatched three battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers to hunt for the German ships accordingly, hoping to intercept the Germans off southern Iceland. The cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|2}} briefly sighted the German ships on 28 January as L\u00fctjens prepared to break through the Iceland-Faroe gap, and reported their position. The German admiral quickly decided to retire northbound with the intention of passing through the [[Denmark Strait]]. On 30 January L\u00fctjens decided to refuel from the tanker ''Thorn'' off [[Jan Mayen]] island before attempting this breakout route. After refueling, L\u00fctjens sailed, and on 4 February, slipped into the Atlantic. Fortunately for L\u00fctjens, Tovey dismissed the sighting by ''Naiad'' as an [[Mirage|illusion]], and returned to port.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Free in the Atlantic====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1123-500, Kurt-C\u00e4sar Hoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain Hoffmann. A former pupil and companion to L\u00fctjens on ''Berlin''.]]\nL\u00fctjens now had the operational initiative. He had a choice of two potential killing-grounds. To the north lay the HX and SC convoys which sailed between Britain and [[Canada]]. To the south the SL and OG convoys which operated between Britain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Freetown]]. He decided to opt for operations in the north. He used ''Admiral Hipper'', at that moment also loose in the Atlantic, to create a diversion by ordering her to the south. In retrospect it was an error of judgment. L\u00fctjens' orders were to avoid combat on equal terms. He had not realised\u2014and was not to know\u2014that southern convoys were virtually undefended at this point in the war, but on orders of the British [[Admiralty]], all northern convoys had an escort of at least one [[Capital Ship]].<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 56.</ref> German intelligence had warned him that {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}} and {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} were based at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He estimated that they could escort convoys only 1,000 miles east of their base, and so began he search for targets with this in mind.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 8 February, [[B-Dienst]] alerted the German warships of [[convoy HX 106]] which sailed from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] on 31 January. L\u00fctjens planned a pincer movement converging from the north and south. The convoy was escorted by ''Ramillies'' armed with eight [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch]] guns. When the battleship was sighted L\u00fctjens strictly followed the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]]''{{'}}s directive not to engage enemy capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 57.</ref>\n\n[[Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann]], captain of ''Scharnhorst'', attempted to draw off the British battleship, so that ''Gneisenau'' could sink the merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the ''Scharnhorst'' captain was not able to communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which L\u00fctjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now L\u00fctjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, L\u00fctjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since ''Hipper'' was known to be at sea, it was assumed she was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the ''Naiad'' report masked the German ships' presence. Tovey still believed they were still in German ports.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 58.</ref> The disagreement did not adversely damage the two men's good relations.{{efn| Richard Garrett, a naval researcher, interviewed Hoffmann in 1976. Hoffmann stated he respected L\u00fctjens, who had been his gunnery instructor as a sea cadet in 1912.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 57\u201358.</ref>}}\n\nThe ships rendezvoused between Iceland and Canada with the tankers ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' on 15 February. On 22 February, after seven days of fruitless searching some 500 nautical miles east of [[Newfoundland]], German radar picked up five cargo-empty ships from a westbound convoy sailing without escort towards [[United States|American]] ports. The convoy identified the German ships and soon the radio waves were busy with signals sent from the frantic British merchantmen, which tried to disperse. The battleships quickly closed and sank four. A further ship, the 5,500-ton ''Harlesden'', carried a powerful [[wireless]] set but temporarily evaded them. Intent on silencing it, L\u00fctjens dispatched his [[Arado Ar 196]] to locate it. Upon his return, the Arado pilot reported to have found it and claimed to have destroyed the aerial, but took damage from return fire. Its position now known, the German ships closed in and sank ''Harlesden'' at 23:00. The day's haul amounted to around 25,000&nbsp;tons. On a negative note, the chase and action occurred at long range and the expenditure of ammunition was expensive. L\u00fctjens used his radio for the first time since 8 February and commanded the supply ships ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' to meet him near the Azores so he could replenish stocks.<ref>Garratt 1978, p. 60.</ref> On 26 February he unloaded 180 [[prisoners of war]] onto the tankers ''Ermland'' and ''Friedrich Breme''. In the action of 22 February, only 11 Allied sailors had become casualties.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDisappointed with the lack of targets in the north, L\u00fctjens' ships then sailed to the coast of [[West Africa]]. On 3 March 1941 they reached the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. On 5 March he attempted to dispatch his aircraft to find enemy shipping but found it four hours later, the machine having run out of fuel. L\u00fctjens' persistence paid off. At 23:00 on 5 March, he received a wireless message from Germany informing him {{GS|U-124|1940|2}} had spotted two large ships close to their position. The Arado had flown over the submarine, which had been alerted to the possibility German commerce raiders might be in the area. On 7 March, the convoy SL-67, escorted by {{HMS|Malaya}}, was sighted. Once again, L\u00fctjens obeyed his orders and not his instinct. He withdrew, but shadowed the convoy, directing ''U-124'' and {{GS|U-105|1940|2}} onto the enemy. The former sank five and the latter one ship. L\u00fctjens ran into the convoy again as darkness fell, but the Germans turned away to meet with their supply ships, narrowly avoiding a battle with ''Malaya''. On the way the [[Greece|Greek]] ship ''Marathon'' (7,926 tons) was sunk. It was carrying [[coal]] to [[Alexandria]].<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 62\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Escape to France====\nOn 11 March he received a message from Group West. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and ''Hipper'' were to operate in the north, and German intelligence were alerted to the possibility of a British force consisting of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] were on a westerly course from [[Gibraltar]]. L\u00fctjens was required to create a diversion to allow ''Scheer'' safe passage through the Denmark Strait. He decided that the best way to attract British attention was to head for [[Brest, France]], via the HX convoy route. L\u00fctjens decided to employ his entire force, supply ships too, in a search for victims. Stationed 30 miles abreast, they sailed between 39\u00b0N and 46\u00b0W. L\u00fctjens intercepted the Norwegian tanker ''Bianca'' (5,688 tons), the ''Polykarb'' (6,500 tons) and British ''San Casimiro'' (8,000 tons). He managed to capture the ships and his prize crews were ordered to [[Bordeaux]]. Only ''Polykarb'' made it. The others were scuttled by their German crews when approached by HMS ''Renown''. Three more were sunk by the German battleships.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nSupply ships ''Uckermark'' and ''Ermland'' signalled they had sighted another convoy. They acted as shepherds as they rushed at the startled merchantmen and drove them toward the German battleships. On 15 March L\u00fctjens began his attack. ''Empire of Industry'' (formerly German), ''Mangkai'' (formerly the German ''Scheer''), ''Silverfix'', ''Demerton'', ''Grandi'', ''Royal Crown'', ''Sardinian Prince'' and the French ''Myson'' were sunk. Among the company was ''Chilean Reefer''. Only 1,800 tons, the ship made smoke and returned ''Gniesenau''{{'}}s fire. Believing it possibly disguised as an enemy cruiser, or a scout, the Germans withdrew to a safe distance and sank it with the main batteries. It was a small target which took 73 rounds to destroy. HMS ''Rodney'' appeared 15 minutes later and flashed a challenge. In L\u00fctjens' mind, it confirmed his suspicions of the vessel as a scout. L\u00fctjens identified ''Gneisenau'' as \"HMS Emerald\", buying time as he worked up to escape. It worked, and ''Rodney'' stayed to pick up the survivors from the ''Chilean Reefer''.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> After transferring 200 prisoners, he set course for Brest, France. Sighted by an aircraft from {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} on 20 March, Admiral L\u00fctjens managed to evade British warships, and reached Brest at 07:00 on 22 March. The journey of {{convert|17800|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} in 59 days was a record for German capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\nRaeder was pleased with L\u00fctjens. He described his operation in the Atlantic as \"beyond reproach. He invariably judged the situation accurately and he met with deserved success.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 68.</ref> Raeder's glowing endorsement was likely caused by L\u00fctjens' rigid adherence to his commander-in-chief's instructions. The ''Seekriegsleitung'' was more critical. It acknowledged the restrictions placed upon L\u00fctjens but thought L\u00fctjens could have asked for greater freedom of action after the encounter with ''Ramillies''. The staff officers believed Hoffman's tactical assessment of the situation had been correct.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\n===Operation Rhein\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-01-4-25, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|right|''Bismarck''{{'}}s aft upper deck, behind turret \"Caesar\". This is where the living and working quarters of the admiral's staff were located.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 378.</ref>]]\n\nPlans were then made for L\u00fctjens to command [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']], taking all four modern German battleships and battlecruisers\u2014''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on a raid into the Atlantic. For various reasons, ''Tirpitz'' and the two battlecruisers could not be made ready for the operation, so it proceeded with only ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, under the command of [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]. The preparation and operational directives had been prepared by ''Marinegruppenkommando West'', under the command of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' Saalw\u00e4chter and ''Marinegruppenkommando Ost'', under the command of ''Generaladmiral'' [[Rolf Carls]]. On 8 April 1941, L\u00fctjens met with Admiral D\u00f6nitz in [[Paris]]. D\u00f6nitz made the following assessment of the plan:\n<blockquote>I met Admiral L\u00fctjens, the Admiral commanding the fleet, in Paris. I knew L\u00fctjens well and held him in high esteem. During the same years we had been in command of the cruisers ''Karlsruhe'' and ''Emden'' respectively. At the end of our overseas tours of duty we had returned to Germany in company. In the years immediately before the war, while I was senior Officer, submarines, L\u00fctjens had been officer commanding Torpedo Boats. We were often together, both socially and on duty, we held the same views on naval matters and saw eye to eye in most things. At our conference in Paris we defined the support to be given to the ''Bismarck'' by [[U-Boat]]s in the following terms:<br/>\n1. The U-Boats would carry on as usual in their normal positions<br/>\n2. If while the surface ships were at sea any opportunity arose for joint action with U-Boats, every effort should be made to exploit it to the full. For this purpose an experienced U-Boat Officer would be appointed for duty to the ''Bismarck''.<br/>\n3. On the radio frequency used by the U-Boats, the Admiral commanding the fleet would be kept constantly informed of the dispositions of the boats and the intentions of the U-Boat Command.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====L\u00fctjens' view====\nRaeder was anxious to begin the operation during the [[new moon]] on 26 April. His wishes were frustrated by a series of mishaps. ''Prinz Eugen'' was repeatedly delayed from becoming fully operational. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing, a practice torpedo, and a mine detonation delayed her from mid-April until mid-May.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Raeder used this time to consult with his fleet commander. L\u00fctjens travelled to [[Berlin]] on 26 April 1941 to meet with him. For a time, L\u00fctjens tried without success to change Raeder's mind, and to wait until ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were ready. He argued that the German fleet should not be fed \"[[teaspoon]] by teaspoon\" into battle with the enemy.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was, however, encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy's gaining any respite.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf & Wegner 2001, pp. 131\u2013132.</ref> He accepted that the current situation meant that German capital ships must be present in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Although Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised L\u00fctjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 385\u2013386.</ref> Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave L\u00fctjens full [[Mission-type tactics|freedom of action]], since only he was in a position to judge the immediate situation while at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Raeder later wrote, \"It does L\u00fctjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so frankly. I then sought to convince him of the cogency of my arguments....Although L\u00fctjens was perhaps not entirely convinced by my views, our discussion ended in complete understanding.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 78.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens sought advice from several colleagues and friends. First, he spoke with [[Kurt Fricke]], Raeder's chief of operations. When Fricke inquired as to what he would do if approached by overwhelming force: L\u00fctjens replied he would run for home. As far as the Naval Command was concerned, this was his policy. He sought out his friend, Patzig, who had commanded {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, and a man he had known since 1907. Patzig argued he should remain in port. He remarked that it was folly to risk the chief of the fleet in a limited operation with a single capital ship. L\u00fctjens agreed, but feared being labelled a coward if he turned down the command.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50.</ref> His parting words to Patzig were fatalistic:\n<blockquote>Given the uneven relation of forces I am of the opinion that I should have to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined to carry out the assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing this meeting, L\u00fctjens confided to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hans-Erich Voss]], then working at Raeder's headquarters, that \"survival was improbable\", and bade him farewell.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" />{{efn|full quote: \"I want to say goodbye, I will not come back. Given the superiority of the British survival is unlikely\"\u2014''Ich m\u00f6chte mich verabschieden, ich werde nicht wiederkommen. Bei der \u00dcberlegenheit der Briten ist ein \u00dcberleben unwahrscheinlich.''<ref name=\"\u00dcebersch\u00e4r p407\"/>}}\n\nLastly he met with his former commanding officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised L\u00fctjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since the situation in the Atlantic could change at any moment. L\u00fctjens would not hear of it. He refused to diverge from his standing orders. He reminded Marschall that two fleet commanders had already been removed from command\u2014Marschall being one of them\u2014and that he would follow the orders given him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 49\u201350.</ref> What depressed L\u00fctjens's already darkened mood was [[Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck's'' captain, had been told by [[Karl Topp]] of the [[Marineamt]], that several [[Military simulation|war games]] were run to see if ''Tirpitz'' could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lindemann certainly would have passed this information to L\u00fctjens.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 52.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' staff for Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'' was made up of the following officers:<ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\">Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392.</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Rank\n!scope=\"col\" | Role\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Harald Netzbandt]]\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | Chief of Staff\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Emil Melms\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | 2nd Admiral Staff Officer, Artillery Officer of the Fleet, Personnel Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dr. Hans-Releff Riege\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Flottenarzt'' (posthumously ''Admiralarzt'')\n| scope=\"row\" | Doctor with the Fleet Commando\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Helmut Marschall\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Hauptregierungsrat'' of the Reserves\n| scope=\"row\" | Meteorologist\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Paul Ascher\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n''\n| scope=\"row\" | 1st Admiral Staff Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Karl Thannemann\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n'' (Ing.)

L\u00fctjens had informed Lindemann and Brinkmann on 18 May that he intended to sail for the arctic and refuel at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62.</ref> Three days later, in Norwegian waters, L\u00fctjens ordered a fuel stop in a [[Grimstadfjord]] near [[Bergen]]. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision to drop anchor and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 70.</ref>\n\nWhile ''Prinz Eugen'' was refuelled, L\u00fctjens declined to top up the ''Bismarck''. A rupture in one of the fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/> The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. L\u00fctjens knew that the German tanker ''Weissenberg'' was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/>\n\nThe following day, on 22 May, he received a report that four British battleships, perhaps an [[aircraft carrier]], and a strong escort of destroyers were still anchored at [[Scapa Flow]]. Although mistaken, it appears to have influenced L\u00fctjens' decision not to loiter and wait for events to unfold, but to proceed with a breakout immediately which would not permit time for refueling prior to reaching the Atlantic.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 133.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> This faulty intelligence report likely dispelled any doubts L\u00fctjens had about his chosen route.<ref>Ballard 1990, p.. 69.</ref> The move would bring about the first of several disagreements with Captain Lindemann. Lindemann preferred the route south of Iceland, but once again L\u00fctjens and his terse style had prevailed.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 66.</ref>\n\nHe also declined ''Generaladmiral'' Carls' desire for a breakout through the more southerly Faroe Islands-Iceland gap. As usual, he gave no explanation for any change in operational direction. While the ice-flooded regions of northern Iceland and the [[Denmark Strait]] could be easily patrolled by the enemy, as believed by Carls, it offered lower-visibility conditions, giving him much needed cover. Nevertheless, he continued to frustrate his junior officers. Meteorologist Heinz Externbrink suggested increasing speed to keep up with the fast-moving cloud affording him cover. L\u00fctjens declined without comment, and Externbrink vented his anger to [[:de:Burkard Freiherr von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|Burkard von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg]], the most senior officer to survive the operation. Despite his intentions, the British were alerted to the task force's operation by the [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Norwegian Resistance]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 132.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nLindemann remained on edge. As captain, he was privy to the B-Dienst naval intelligence now reaching him on enemy movements. A large contingent of enemy capital ships was congregating at Scapa Flow. His senior medical officer, Dr. Otto Schneider, observed that Lindemann fully understood the dangers his ship faced. But Admiral L\u00fctjens alone could call off the operation. He showed no desire to discuss his intentions with either Captain Lindemann or Brinkmann, which put both of them on edge. L\u00fctjens offered no hint of intentions either to his destroyer escort, which he dismissed near [[Trondheim]], or to ''Generaladmiral'' Carls. Carls openly displayed his displeasure at the lack of communication, believing L\u00fctjens to be hesitant. Not until the evening of 22 May did he share his intention to breach the Denmark Strait with his captains; perhaps encouraged in the knowledge that the British [[Force H]] would now be engaged in the beginning [[Battle of Crete]]. The foul weather gave him the cover he needed. Foregoing the chance of a refuel, he headed due west, north of Iceland.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201378</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens remained unaware that the British were tracking him until 23 May, when his ships encountered heavy cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, amidst the [[Greenland]] ice pack. L\u00fctjens received the identity of the first ship as the latter vessel. He gave the code JOTDORA: permission to fire. Although shots were fired, no serious damage resulted to either side, and the outgunned British cruisers quickly withdrew, though they remained within radar range and continued to shadow the German ships. The shock from the firing of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s heavy guns disabled her search radar, so L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to take the lead. As they passed each other ''Bismarck''{{'}}s electric push-button wheel jammed and it veered toward the German cruiser. The quick thinking of Brinkmann avoided a collision. During a raining squall L\u00fctjens attempted a 180-degree turn to surprise his attackers, but the British radar detected the manoeuvre and withdrew. L\u00fctjens could not shake his pursuers. He believed they possessed a new type of radar as yet unknown to the Germans.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 71\u201372.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 125\u2013133.</ref>\n\n====Tactical command in battle====\n[[File:Absetzman\u00f6ver Bismarck.png|thumb|right|300px|''Bismarck''{{'}}s {{frac|3|4}} clockwise turn on 25 May. L\u00fctjens' tactic was highly successful, shaking free of his pursuers.]]\nIn the early hours of 24 May 1941, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s hydrophones detected two large ships approaching. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]] in his flagship battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} were heading towards them. It began the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. L\u00fctjens was soon informed that the two ships were enemy heavy units by the size of their superstructure, but remained unaware of their identity until they adjusted their attitude. Confronted with enemy combat vessels, L\u00fctjens turned away, to gain time to think and plan a response to his opponents who were clearly attempting to engage him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' first instinct was to attempt to outrun the British ships, scrupulously obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as ''Hood''. Even after ''Hood'' began to fire on the two ships and it became obvious that an engagement was inevitable, L\u00fctjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief [[yeoman]] to signal to ''Prinz Eugen'' to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not ''Bismarck'', much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\nFirst Gunnery Officer [[Adalbert Schneider]], made multiple inquiries to return fire; methodically reporting enemy salvos and asking permission to fire. L\u00fctjens, himself an artillery specialist, waited until the range fell. Moreover, the position of the British placed them at the outer limit of traverse for his main batteries, which were now inclined astern of the ship. L\u00fctjens was also wary of using up heavy shells which were required for raiding operations and a possible future engagement. He could not afford to use up ammunition to register his guns, instead, preferring a closer-range battle. He waited for the optimum moment to fire back.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nSome witnesses testify Captain Lindeman muttered, \"I will not allow my ship to be shot out from under my arse. Open fire!\".<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 78.</ref> Finally L\u00fctjens gave the order to return fire. L\u00fctjens then ordered a turn to port, and [[Crossing the T|crossed Holland's T]], as his opponent turned to bring all the British guns to bear. Shortly before firing, ''Bismarck'' was hit in the forecastle, though ''Prinz Eugen'' had registered hits on ''Hood'' which had started a large series of fires making it easier for the Germans to home in on her position. ''Bismarck'' then targeted ''Hood''.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nL\u00fctjens did not observe the German tactical regulations of the time, to place his weaker cruiser to his battleship's unengaged side and out of range. Instead, he kept her in the line to maximise his firepower even though both German ships were now firing salvos across each other's line-of-fire.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.</ref> Once the odds were reduced, he then ordered her to drop back and use her radar to keep a vigil on the British cruisers, still chasing the German force.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /> Schneider observed the fifth salvo strike ''Hood'' from a range of 17,500 [[yard]]s.<ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\">Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Two splashes were seen. Apparently one or more shells \"bit into\" ''Hood'', seemingly without effect, leading the gunnery officers to believe it was a dud. Moments later ''Hood'' blew up, which caused much excitement on the German ships. L\u00fctjens remained unmoved. The Germans then turned their fire to ''Prince of Wales'', causing seven damaging hits and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] to retreat to a safe distance.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /><ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\" /><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 85.</ref>\n\nLindemann, guided by the tactical situation, wanted to destroy the damaged ship. He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref> L\u00fctjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. L\u00fctjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him ''Hood'' was standing off the coast of [[West Africa]].<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2001, p. 172.</ref> He could no longer be sure of how many more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with ''Prince of Wales'' was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\" /><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 145, 150, 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' tactics proved useful in two respects. After the ''Hood'' battle, he steamed directly at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, he ordered a clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they believed to be in the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 236\u2013239.</ref>\n\nThe move worked and he evaded the British for a short time. L\u00fctjens then broke radio silence, allowing the British a rough idea of his [[latitude]] but not his [[longitude]]. He continued to believe he was being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to [[Paris]] since they were sure he had broken contact. L\u00fctjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for [[France]]. By this time L\u00fctjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Although the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 236.</ref><ref>Jackson 2002, p. 90.</ref>\n\n====Leadership in crisis====\nL\u00fctjens radioed [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Berlin]] and all the naval commands concerning the sinking of ''Hood'' continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that L\u00fctjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final \"Execute!\" order, was unnecessary and risky. In the morning of the 25 May, his 52nd birthday, L\u00fctjens persisted by sending a long message on the ''Hood'' action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.<ref>Winklareth 1998. p. 130.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 167.</ref>\n\nThe enemy, Brinkmann thought, could and would glean important intelligence from the most seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was foolish to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to [[St. Nazaire]] and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention of the extent of the damage incurred by ''Bismarck'' was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue L\u00fctjens with any orders since they had no information on the state of the task force.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 167\u2013169.</ref>\n[[File:Funknachricht L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|L\u00fctjens' final message, informing the German command of his intention to fight to the last against the enemy.]]\nMeanwhile, L\u00fctjens took stock of his predicament. Firstly, he believed that he was shadowed by a force of ships with superior radar. Secondly, the element of surprise had been lost. Thirdly, the battleship was running low of fuel; his decision not to refuel in Norway or the [[Norwegian Sea]] now became relevant. Fourthly, he thought the force was led by the efficient battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, which he thought was leading him into a trap with an enemy fleet alerted to ''Hood''{{'}}s fate. Fifthly, sea water had slowed him by two knots. His ship had lost some electrical power and salt water was threatening to enter fuel lines and shut down two boilers.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 86.</ref> Lindemann argued for a return via the Denmark Strait to Norway. In his view the ship was too fine a vessel to be risked in another unequal struggle. L\u00fctjens rejected his suggestion. It would take him too close to the [[British Isles]] and expose him to the greatest concentration of enemy sea, air and coastal forces. According to survivors, the animosity between Lindemann and L\u00fctjens was now beginning to extend to their respective staffs.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe reasons for L\u00fctjens' decision to make for France instead of making the shorter journey to Norway remain unknown. It can be surmised he thought the ship would be repaired quickly and a French port was closer to his hunting ground which also precluded another tricky break out via the Denmark Strait. Furthermore, he had asked for a concentration of U-boats south of [[Greenland]] to attack his shadowers. The vast ocean also offered an opportunity to lose his pursuers. However, the perilous fuel situation forced him to abandon the U-Boat option and steam directly for France.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 235.</ref> In light of these developments, L\u00fctjens addressed the crew as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Seamen of the battleship ''Bismarck''! You have covered yourself with glory! The sinking of the battle cruiser ''Hood'' has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of [[UK|Great Britain]]. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released ''Prinz Eugen'' at noon yesterday so that she could conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 104.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSurviving crewmembers of ''Bismarck'' state that they received this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of L\u00fctjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and that they may not reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted L\u00fctjens' words to mean the ''Admiral'' did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and ''Luftwaffe'' that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon L\u00fctjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. L\u00fctjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 106.</ref>\n\nA British reconnaissance aircraft sighted ''Bismarck'' in the early morning hours of 26 May by following its [[oil slick]]. At dusk on 26 May, [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' attacked. Although much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but L\u00fctjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage L\u00fctjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer ''Bismarck'' somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to {{convert|7|kn|km/h mph|lk=in|abbr=on}} and effectively left it circling in the water.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 116.</ref>\n\nThroughout the night, she was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}, {{HMS|Sikh|F82|2}}, {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}}, {{HMS|Zulu|F18|2}}, and {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}} designed to wear down the crew. At this point, the Home Fleet and ''Norfolk'' following from the north were joined by HMS ''Rodney'', while Force H and heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} approached from the south, and light cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} from the west. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s low speed and southeasterly heading away from its known pursuers made it very easy for the force to the south to catch up.\n\n==Death==\nL\u00fctjens recognised the gravity of the situation. At 23:58 on 26 May, L\u00fctjens transmitted to ''Group West'', the Naval HQ \"To the ''F\u00fchrer'' of the German ''Reich'', Adolf Hitler. We will fight to the end thinking of you confident as in a rock in the victory of Germany\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\">Jackson 2002, p. 91.</ref> Hitler replied at 01:53 on 27 May: \"I thank you in the name of the whole German nation \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\" Later another message was sent, \"To the crew of the battleship ''Bismarck'': all Germany is with you. What can be done will be done. Your devotion to your duty will strengthen our people in the struggle for their existence \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\"/>\n\nThe mood aboard ''Bismarck'' was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was off duty for some fresh air. He climbed up to the bridge for as long as nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the atmosphere pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of [[Adalbert Schneider]] for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of ''Hood''. L\u00fctjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg's salute. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg also met L\u00fctjens as the Admiral made his way to the bridge. L\u00fctjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for ''Bismarck'' had retreated into their own private worlds.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 121\u2013124.</ref> That morning, on the 27 May 1941, L\u00fctjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, L\u00fctjens included: \"Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the ''F\u00fchrer''\".<ref>Jackson 2002, p. 49.</ref> L\u00fctjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard ''Bismarck'' was doomed.<ref>Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 276.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens had been open to criticism for his sycophantic messages to Hitler and his vow to fight to the last against hopeless odds. The authors of the [[Germany and the Second World War|German official history]] have commented it would be unjust to criticise him for being sympathetic to the National Socialist cause or to mark him as an Admiral who saw operations through to the end regardless of the outcome. L\u00fctjens had remained notably aloof from the regime. This aside, he was also steeped in the German officer traditions in which it was inconceivable to abandon a fully battle-ready ship. After the scuttling of the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]'', Raeder had ordered all capital ships to fight to the last round if crippled. His messages, according to these historians, should be seen in the context of L\u00fctjens fulfilling his duty. It is unknown whether he or Lindemann considered scuttling the ship to save the crew before the last battle.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, Wegner 2001, pp. 137, 139, 230.</ref>\n\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. ''Norfolk'' sighted the ''Bismarck'' at 08:15, and the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire at 08:48. ''Bismarck'' began [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her last stand]] and returned fire at 08:49 against ''Rodney''. {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} fired at ''Bismarck'' soon after and the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' engaged with their main armament. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret ''Dora'' was disabled at 09:24. ''Bismarck'' received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret ''Caesar'' went out of action after a hit at 09:50. Some secondary positions and weapons survived and battled on. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, ''Rodney'' and ''King George V'' had to disengage prior to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking.\n\n{{location map|North Atlantic| label=''Bismarck'' sunk |position=bottom\n|width=150\n|long=-16.12\n|lat=48.10\n|caption=\n}}\nThe Germans were preparing to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] ''Bismarck'' when three torpedoes fired by ''Dorsetshire'' hit the ship's side armour. ''Bismarck'' sank at 10:36 at position {{Coord|48|10|N|16|12|W}}, roughly {{convert|300|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} west of Ouessant ([[Ushant]]). The cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' saved 85 men, and the British destroyer ''Maori'' saved another 25. Five sailors were saved by {{GS|U-74|1940|6}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat]], and the weather observation ship {{ship|German weather ship|Sachsenwald||2}}. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (U-boat Commander-in-Chief) D\u00f6nitz had ordered {{GS|U-556||2}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Herbert Wohlfarth]], to pick up ''Bismarck''{{'}}s [[war diary]]. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the mission be transferred to ''U-74''. ''U-74'' failed to reach Bismarck in time, and the war diary was never retrieved.<ref>Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr and Steinmetz 1990, volume 2 p. 81.</ref> L\u00fctjens was among those who lost their lives \u2013 probably killed when a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo fired by ''Rodney'' destroyed the bridge, killing many senior officers.\n\n==Personal life==\nL\u00fctjens married Margarete Backenk\u00f6hler, daughter of the ''[[Geheimrat|Geheimen]] Sanit\u00e4tsrat'' (\"Privy Counselor on Hygiene\", honorary title given to a distinguished doctor) Dr. Gerhard Backenk\u00f6hler, in the summer of 1929.<ref name=\"Uebersch\u00e4r 2011, p. 408\"/> She was 27 at the time of the wedding and the sister of Otto Backenk\u00f6hler. Admiral Otto Backenk\u00f6hler was L\u00fctjens' chief of staff at the Fleet-Command (24 October 1939 \u2013 31 July 1940). A year later, their first son, Gerhard, was born on 31 August 1930 in [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie|Swinem\u00fcnde]]. The marriage produced a second son, named G\u00fcnther after his father, on 28 August 1932 in Berlin. Their daughter Annemarie was born on 27 August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Less than a month after L\u00fctjens' death, his wife gave birth to their fourth child, Peter.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 380\u2013392.</ref><ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\"/><ref>Rigg and Nicolai 2003, p. 120.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1960 film, ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'', L\u00fctjens (played by [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]]) is portrayed as a stereotypical [[Nazi]], committed to Nazism and crazed in his undaunted belief that the ''Bismarck'' is unsinkable. In reality, L\u00fctjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of anti-Semitic crimes during [[Kristallnacht]]. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler visited ''Bismarck'' before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 32</ref> He was pessimistic of the chances of success of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s mission and realised that it would be a daunting task.<ref>Asmussen, John.

The ship was christened by Gerda L\u00fctjen's, wife of L\u00fctjens oldest son Gerhard, in [[Bath, Maine]] on 11 August 1967, and was decommissioned in 2003.<ref name=\"bismarck-class.dk\">[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/men_involved/luetjens.html Bismarck: A portrait of the Men Involved]</ref> In his christening speech the then [[secretary of state]] at the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Karl Carstens]], stated that L\u00fctjens had set an example of \"unwavering sense of responsibility and devout faithfulness to duty\".<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\">{{Cite web|work=Der Spiegel 35/1967 |title=Mumm haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46211719.html| accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nChoosing the name \"L\u00fctjens\" for the newly commissioned destroyer was not without controversy, but the Minister of Defence [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (CDU)|Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] wanted to break the taboo surrounding the heroes of World War II who were not Nazis but who were not associated with the [[20 July plot]], the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler. The former Inspector of the Navy Ruge had feared that L\u00fctjens was not known well enough and had suggested the names ''Adenauer'', ''Berlin'' and ''Rommel'' instead. Schr\u00f6der however wanted to bridge the gap to former traditions and wanted to name the destroyers after former heroes of the three branches of the [[Wehrmacht]] (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'', ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'').<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/> L\u00fctjens' name had previously been cleared by the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office]] (''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt'' or MGFA), formerly in Freiburg im Breisgau.

Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which had been used to shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross.

L\u00fctjens is best known for his actions during [[World War II]] and his command of the [[battleship]] {{Ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}} during its foray into the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1941. In its aftermath, the episode entered into naval legend.\n\nBorn in 1889, he entered into the German Imperial Navy ({{Lang|de|[[Kaiserliche Marine]]}}) in 1907. A diligent and intelligent [[cadet]] he progressed to [[Officer (armed forces)|officer rank]] before the outbreak of war, when he was assigned to a [[Torpedo boat]] Squadron. During [[World War I]] L\u00fctjens operated in the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] and fought several actions with the British [[Royal Navy]]. He ended the conflict as a ''[[Kapit\u00e4nleutnant]]'' (captain lieutenant) with the [[Iron Cross]] 1st and 2nd class (1914) to his credit. After the war he remained in the service of the navy, now renamed the ''[[Reichsmarine]]''. He continued to serve in torpedo boat squadrons eventually becoming a [[Commanding Officer]] in 1925. In the [[Weimar Republic]] era, L\u00fctjens built a reputation as an excellent staff officer.\n\nIn 1935, after the [[Nazi Party]] came to power under [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1933, the navy was remodelled again and renamed the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. L\u00fctjens soon became acquainted with [[Erich Raeder]] and [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]]; the two Commanders-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' in World War II. His capability and friendship led to his promotion to ''[[Kapit\u00e4n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) and a sea command at the helm of the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Karlsruhe||2}}. In the six years of peace he had risen to the rank of ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' (rear admiral), a promotion conferred upon him October 1937.\n\nIn September 1939, World War II began with the [[German invasion of Poland]]. L\u00fctjens received the [[Clasp to the Iron Cross]] 2nd Class (1939) three days later. His command of [[destroyer]] operations in the North Sea over the winter, 1939\u201340, earned him the Clasp to the Iron Cross 1st Class. On 1 January 1940, he was promoted to  ''Vizeadmiral'' (Vice Admiral). In April 1940 he was given temporary command of the entire German surface fleet during the initial landing phase of [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]], the invasions of [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]]. His actions earned him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]].\n\nIn the aftermath of the campaign he was appointed the [[Fleet commander (Kriegsmarine)|fleet commander]] of the German Navy and promoted to Admiral on 1 September 1940. He was involved in the tentative planning for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the planned invasion of the [[United Kingdom]], but the plans were shelved after the [[Battle of Britain]]. German intentions turned to blockade and L\u00fctjens made the German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} the centerpiece of his battle fleet; using the latter vessel as his [[flagship]]. In January 1941 he planned and executed [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']], an Atlantic raid to support [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] by attacking British merchant shipping lanes. The operation was a [[Tactical victory|tactical]] and [[propaganda]] victory. It came to a close in March 1941 when the ships docked in [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German-occupied France]] after sailing some 18,000 miles; a record for a German battle group at the time. His success led him to being chosen for further operations.\n\nIn May 1941, L\u00fctjens commanded a German task force, consisting of the battleship ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, during [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']]. In a repetition of ''Berlin'', L\u00fctjens was required to break out of their naval base in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)|occupied Poland]], sail via [[German occupation of Norway|occupied Norway]], and attack merchant shipping. The operation went awry and the task force was soon spotted and engaged near [[Iceland]]. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} was sunk and three other British warships were forced to retreat. The two German ships then separated. Three days later, on 27 May, L\u00fctjens and most of the ship's crew lost their lives when ''Bismarck'' [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|was caught]] and sunk.\n\nIn 1955 the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] was remilitarised and entered [[NATO]]. The ''[[Bundesmarine]]'' was established the following year. In 1967 this organisation recognised L\u00fctjens and his service by naming the destroyer {{ship|German destroyer|L\u00fctjens|D185|2}} after him.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Early life==\nJohann G\u00fcnther L\u00fctjens was born in [[Wiesbaden]] in [[Hesse-Nassau]], a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], on 25 May 1889.

The ship sailed via [[Skagen]], the [[Azores]] and [[Trinidad]] on the east coast of [[South America]], passed the [[Cape Horn]], up the west coast of South, [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle]] and [[North America]] to Vancouver. At [[Callao]] (25 January \u2013 6 February 1935) they joined in the 400-year celebration of Peru.

At that point, D\u00f6nitz had been entrusted with the rebuilding of the U-Boat arm but had spent the summer at sea commanding {{ship|German cruiser|Emden||2}}. After arriving at port, he met with Raeder. Raeder informed D\u00f6nitz that:\n<blockquote>L\u00fctjens is to become chief of the Officer Personnel Branch at Naval Headquarters with the task of forming an officer Corps for the new Navy we are about to build.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1997 [1958], pp. 6\u20137.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1936, L\u00fctjens was appointed Chief of Personnel (''Marinepersonalamt'') of the ''Kriegsmarine'', an office which he had served in 1932\u201334, and in 1937, he became ''F\u00fchrer der Torpedoboote'' (Chief of Torpedo Boats), with {{ship|German destroyer|Z1 Leberecht Maass||2}} as his flagship, and was promoted to ''[[Konteradmiral]]'' in October 1937.<ref>Ciupa 1979, p. 46.</ref> While in command of personnel department he did nothing to enforce the [[Nuremberg Laws]] on race in the ''Kriegsmarine''.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 230.</ref> In November 1938, L\u00fctjens was one of only three flag officers, including D\u00f6nitz, who protested in writing to Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the navy, against the anti-Jewish ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' [[pogrom]]s.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 264.</ref>\n\nHis successor at the ''Marinepersonalamt'' [[:de:Conrad Patzig|Conrad Patzig]], described L\u00fctjens as a dedicated naval officer who put his service to the nation ahead of the ruling party. He also described him as a difficult man to know. Austere, rather forbidding, he said little and when he did, confined his remarks to the essentials. Patzig said of him \"one of the ablest officers in the service, very logical and shrewd, incorruptible in his opinions and an engaging personality when you got to know him.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 35\u201336.</ref> Few did.

L\u00fctjens attacked from a range of 14,000 yards south-east of the harbour. The Poles replied effectively and forced the German destroyers to make evasive manoeuvres and to lay a [[smoke screen]] to throw off the aim of the Polish gunners. ''Leberecht Maass'' was hit in the superstructure by a {{convert|152|mm|sp=us|adj=on}} shell from the [[Coastal artillery|coast defence]] [[Artillery battery#Naval usage|battery]] at [[Hel, Poland|Hel]] that killed four crewmen and wounded another four men. L\u00fctjens ordered the action broken off 40 minutes later as the German fire was ineffective. L\u00fctjens ordered the group to [[Pillau]] to refuel and the ''Leberecht Maas'' sailed to Swinem\u00fcnde for repairs.<ref>O'Hara 2004, p. 4.</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 1939 L\u00fctjens led a raiding sortie into the [[North Sea]]. On board his flagship [[German destroyer Z21 Wilhelm Heidkamp|Z21 ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'']], he led six destroyers laden with naval mines. His own ship did not carry any mines and acted as cover. They reached the [[Humber Estuary]] undetected and departed unseen. Within days shipping losses began occurring among British transports in the area. L\u00fctjens did not repeat the operation. He was promoted to Vice Admiral and moved with his staff to the [[German cruiser N\u00fcrnberg|cruiser ''N\u00fcrnberg'']].<ref>Haarr 2013, p. 282.</ref>\n\n===Operation Weser\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101II-MW-0434-05A, G\u00fcnter L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Vice Admiral L\u00fctjens in April, 1940]]\nIn April 1940, during the invasion of Denmark and Norway ([[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]), he served as ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (vice admiral), commanding the distant cover forces in the North Sea\u2014which consisted of {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}. His superior, ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Wilhelm Marschall]], had fallen ill just before the operation, so he assumed command of the [[Narvik]] and [[Trondheim]] landings.<ref>Lunde 2009, pp. 74\u201375.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was to lead ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', with his flag in the latter, on escort operation for a force of 10 destroyers commanded by ''F\u00fchrer der Zerst\u00f6rer'' (Leader of Destroyers) [[Friedrich Bonte]]. The fleet was laden with soldiers belonging to the [[3rd Mountain Division (Wehrmacht)|''3. Gebirgs-Division'']] under the command of [[Eduard Dietl]]. The division was to seize Narvik.  L\u00fctjens briefed his officers aboard ''Gneisenau'' on 6 April in the presence of Raeder. L\u00fctjens had his doubts about the wisdom of the entire operation but he showed no sign of his feelings to his subordinates. L\u00fctjens hoped for bad weather to shield the fleet from Allied aircraft. The skies were clear and the ships were twice attacked by [[RAF Coastal Command]] bombers without result. The British airmen reported their position and surprise was now gone. Nevertheless, L\u00fctjens remained on schedule and delivered the force to Narvik. On two occasions a sailor was swept overboard but L\u00fctjens' operations officer, Heinrich Gerlach, noted: \"No rescue attempts were made. On no account was there to be any interruption of the time schedule.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' mission then was to draw British units away from Narvik and facilitate the landings there and prevent the [[Royal Navy]] from attacking the destroyers and landing craft. During the landing phase, his forces were approached by a Royal Navy task-force led by the [[battlecruiser]] {{HMS|Renown|1916|6}}. The British ship engaged at 05:05 and L\u00fctjens was forced to fight [[Action off Lofoten|an inconclusive battle]] with ''Renown''. L\u00fctjens succeeded in extracting the German vessels without incurring major battle damage. He viewed his operation as a success.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\">Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113.</ref><ref>O'Hara 2004. pp. 20\u201327.</ref> L\u00fctjens nearly changed his mind during the battle, believing a pitched fight may bring relief to the German destroyer force at Narvik\u2014a force which he had effectively been forced to abandon in the face of enemy sea superiority. But the prospect of running into {{HMS|Rodney|29|6}}, now known by German naval intelligence to be in the vicinity, was too much of a risk. In the resultant [[Battles of Narvik]] 10 German destroyers were sunk and the campaign for the port lasted until June. Bonte was killed when his command ship,  ''Wilhelm Heidkamp'' exploded.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIt may have been possible for him to turn on and sink ''Renown'' by attacking from different directions, using ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'', but the accompanying British destroyers were well placed to join the fight had he done so. His Commander-in-Chief, Raeder, endorsed his actions which would have placed him against a clear eastern horizon as opposed to an enemy that was positioned against a darkened western horizon. Action at that time would have given the enemy a clearer silhouette to aim at while obscuring the British ships somewhat. Moreover, if either German ship had been immobilised by ''Renown'' they would have been vulnerable to a torpedo attack by the British destroyers. Under those circumstances, Raeder felt the British would have had a tactical advantage. L\u00fctjens later rendezvoused with the cruiser {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2}} and reached [[Wilhelmshaven]] on 12 April, having avoided a major fleet action.<ref name=\"Lunde 2009, pp. 111\u2013113\"/>\n\nL\u00fctjens was indirectly involved in another battle. The Trondheim force was led by the heavy cruiser ''Admiral Hipper'' who detached the German destroyers {{ship|German destroyer|Z11 Bernd von Arnim||2}} and {{ship|German destroyer|Z18 Hans L\u00fcdemann||2}} to search for a man that had been washed over board. In the heavy fog they ran into {{HMS|Glowworm|H92|6}}. ''Glowworm'' outmatched the lighter German vessels and they disengaged and called for help. L\u00fctjens ordered ''Hipper'' to assist. The heavy cruiser sank the ''Glowworm'', but not before the British ship had rammed her larger assailant and caused her considerable damage.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> When L\u00fctjens stepped ashore at Wilhelmshaven, his decision to abandon Bonte's destroyer group at Narvik weighed heavily on his mind.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\">Garrett 1978, p. 44.</ref> In the wake of L\u00fctjens return, he learned Marschall had recovered to assume command.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 44\"/>\n\n===Commander of the fleet===\nIn June and July 1940, he became Commander of Battleships and the third ''Flottenchef'' (Fleet Commander) of the ''Kriegsmarine'', a position comparable to the British Commander-in-Chief of the [[Home Fleet]]. His predecessor\u2014''Vizeadmiral'' Wilhelm Marschall\u2014had had repeated differences with Raeder over the extent the ''Flottenchef'' should be bound by orders while operating at sea. Marschall led ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' to intercept Allied naval forces withdrawing from [[Norway]] against orders. On 8 June 1940 he engaged and sank the [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Glorious||2}} and her escorting [[destroyer]]s {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}. During the battle ''Scharnhorst'' was heavily damaged by a torpedo. Marschall was dismissed by Raeder because the Commander-in-Chief of the ''Kriegsmarine'' deemed the episode unacceptable.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\">Garrett 1978, p. 53.</ref> Raeder viewed the sinkings as \"target practice\" and the damage to ''Scharnhorst'', and consequently ''Gneisenau'', offset this victory in his view.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\nTen days later L\u00fctjens was given command of the fleet on a temporary basis. Raeder regarded L\u00fctjens as a sound tactician, excellent staff officer and a leader with all-important operational and battle experience. After the war Raeder was candid about his decision to elevate L\u00fctjens through the chain of command. Raeder said of his progression, \"He had also experience in staff work, and as my Chief of Personnel he had won by special confidence in years of close association.\"<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 353.</ref> Raeder expressed his confidence that L\u00fctjens displayed wise judgment and was unlikely to act rashly. When at sea, he allowed him to take command of the situation and make operational decisions at his own discretion.<ref>Raeder 2001 [1957], p. 357.</ref> Although described as reserved and unapproachable toward subordinates, he was held to be \"of manifest integrity and reliability.\"<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 130.</ref> Hitler expressed his gratitude to L\u00fctjens for \"preparing and leading the Navy into action\", and awarded him the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] on 14 June 1940.<ref>Groves 2012, p. 53.</ref>\n\n''Scharnhorst'' had been forced to make for Trondheim in the aftermath of the action for emergency repairs. Flying his flag in ''Gneisenau'', L\u00fctjens took command of his first voyage as ''Flottenchef'' aboard a capital ship. On 20 June 1940 he sailed in company with ''Admiral Hipper'', toward the North Sea in the hope of diverting attention from ''Scharnhorst'' while it made the perilous trek from Norway to Germany. The operation succeeded, but ''Gneisenau'' was torpedoed by the submarine {{HMS|Clyde|N12|6}} and severely damaged.<ref name=\"Garrett 1978, p. 53.\" />\n\n[[File:OperationSealion.svg|thumb|left|Battle plan for Operation Sea Lion.]]\nIn July 1940 Hitler ordered the preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]], the invasion of the United Kingdom after the victory [[Battle of France|in France]]. While the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' engaged the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in what became known as the [[Battle of Britain]] to clear the skies the German naval command began planning for an assault in southern England. L\u00fctjens, as fleet commander, was responsible for carrying out sea operations based upon the strategies devised by his superior Saalw\u00e4chter, who commanded Naval Group West. Saalw\u00e4chter answered to the commander-in-chief, Raeder.\n\nL\u00fctjens was to be heavily involved in the planning of the sea landings. The navy wished to land on a narrow front because of its limited resources and L\u00fctjens planned accordingly. He established himself in the fashionable market-town of [[Trouville, Seine-Maritime|Trouville]] near [[Le Havre]]. The enormous logistical effort that required the navy to move personnel command structures and personnel to France meant that his command post did not become fully operational until August 1940. [[Friedrich Ruge]] was appointed to the mine command by L\u00fctjens with the task of clearing British naval minefields and laying German mine zones to impede the operations of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, L\u00fctjens scoured the continent for the 1,800 river barges, 500 tugs, 150 steamships and 1,200 motor boats deemed necessary for the operation. Some 24,000 men were seconded from other services and trained as landing craft crewman.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was handicapped by the lack of firepower in the German navy. He authorised Ruge to organise the landings. The Advanced Detachments (''Vorausabteilungen'') were to storm the beach in [[battalion]]-strength. The following craft would clear mines allowing for artillery coasters and tugs carrying the [[Panzer]] units to follow unhindered. The smaller motor boats would unload engineers to clear obstacles and act as shuttle boats between the larger vessels and the beach. They would rush to and fro delivering army units to land in order to expand the beachhead and allow the flotilla to land its full complement. L\u00fctjens recommended using the old battleships ''Schlesien'' and {{SMS|Schleswig-Holstein||2}} as fire support to protect the crossing. L\u00fctjens favoured beaching the ships on the [[Varne Bank]] to act as a gun-fire platform. He thought they could best act as strong points to deny passage through the [[Strait of Dover]] to the British. Raeder agreed but the plan was rubbished by technical experts who argued the old ships were too prone to capsizing and their stationary posture was too vulnerable and their armament too weak to do the job effectively.<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens continued planning preparations as the Battle of Britain raged. By September he had completed plans to land the entire [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 16th Army]] under [[Ernst Busch (field marshal)|Ernst Busch]] between [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and [[Hastings]]\u2014the site of the [[Battle of Hastings|last successful invasion of England in 1066]]\u2014and the [[9th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 9th Army]] between Hastings and [[Worthing]] to the west. L\u00fctjens' opinion on the chances of success are not known. The battles in Norway had left him without any major capital ship. In the event, L\u00fctjens was never tested. The air battle over Britain was lost and by the end of 1940 plans for an invasion were postponed as Hitler turned eastward for a campaign against the [[Soviet Union]]. German naval strategy now turned to thoughts of [[siege]] and destroying Britain's shipping lanes which supplied the country from the overseas and in particularly [[North America]].<ref>Ansel 1960, pp. 241\u2013243, 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\n===Operation Berlin===\n''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were readied for action again by the winter. Their task now was to engage Allied [[merchant vessel]]s bringing war materials to Britain. As fleet commander, it would be L\u00fctjens' first operation in the Battle of the Atlantic. It was named [[Operation Berlin (Atlantic)|Operation ''Berlin'']]. On 28 December 1940, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on which Admiral L\u00fctjens had raised his flag\u2014left Germany for an Atlantic raid. However, due to weather, L\u00fctjens ordered a return to port: ''Gneisenau'' to Kiel and ''Scharnhorst'' to Gdynia. While repairs were carried out Navy Group West emphasised to him that his primary targets were enemy merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens reiterated his standing orders to his captains: \"our job is to put as many as possible under the water\".<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 55.</ref>\n\nOn 22 January 1941, the renewed mission was delayed for several days owing to the sighting of British ships near the Norwegian coast and the inability of submarine chasers and destroyers to escort them to the [[Arctic Ocean]].<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, pp. 56\u201358.</ref> L\u00fctjens chose to pass between [[Iceland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Unbeknownst to L\u00fctjens, his ships had been spotted sailing past [[Zealand]], Denmark, by British agents. British Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, Admiral [[John Tovey]] was alerted and dispatched three battleships, eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers to hunt for the German ships accordingly, hoping to intercept the Germans off southern Iceland. The cruiser {{HMS|Naiad|93|2}} briefly sighted the German ships on 28 January as L\u00fctjens prepared to break through the Iceland-Faroe gap, and reported their position. The German admiral quickly decided to retire northbound with the intention of passing through the [[Denmark Strait]]. On 30 January L\u00fctjens decided to refuel from the tanker ''Thorn'' off [[Jan Mayen]] island before attempting this breakout route. After refueling, L\u00fctjens sailed, and on 4 February, slipped into the Atlantic. Fortunately for L\u00fctjens, Tovey dismissed the sighting by ''Naiad'' as an [[Mirage|illusion]], and returned to port.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\n====Free in the Atlantic====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-1123-500, Kurt-C\u00e4sar Hoffmann.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Captain Hoffmann. A former pupil and companion to L\u00fctjens on ''Berlin''.]]\nL\u00fctjens now had the operational initiative. He had a choice of two potential killing-grounds. To the north lay the HX and SC convoys which sailed between Britain and [[Canada]]. To the south the SL and OG convoys which operated between Britain, [[Gibraltar]] and [[Freetown]]. He decided to opt for operations in the north. He used ''Admiral Hipper'', at that moment also loose in the Atlantic, to create a diversion by ordering her to the south. In retrospect it was an error of judgment. L\u00fctjens' orders were to avoid combat on equal terms. He had not realised\u2014and was not to know\u2014that southern convoys were virtually undefended at this point in the war, but on orders of the British [[Admiralty]], all northern convoys had an escort of at least one [[Capital Ship]].<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 56.</ref> German intelligence had warned him that {{HMS|Ramillies|07|2}} and {{HMS|Revenge|06|2}} were based at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]]. He estimated that they could escort convoys only 1,000 miles east of their base, and so began he search for targets with this in mind.<ref>Zetterling & Tamelander 2009, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 8 February, [[B-Dienst]] alerted the German warships of [[convoy HX 106]] which sailed from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] on 31 January. L\u00fctjens planned a pincer movement converging from the north and south. The convoy was escorted by ''Ramillies'' armed with eight [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch]] guns. When the battleship was sighted L\u00fctjens strictly followed the ''[[Seekriegsleitung]]''{{'}}s directive not to engage enemy capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 57.</ref>\n\n[[Kurt-Caesar Hoffmann]], captain of ''Scharnhorst'', attempted to draw off the British battleship, so that ''Gneisenau'' could sink the merchant vessels. L\u00fctjens, however, did not understand Hoffmann's intentions which the ''Scharnhorst'' captain was not able to communicate in detail in such short-order. A heated radio conversation followed in which L\u00fctjens accused him of disobeying orders because he did not turn away immediately. The enemy ship did not leave the convoy and now L\u00fctjens complained the British would be alerted to their position and as a consequence, successful attacks would now be more difficult to execute. In fact, L\u00fctjens' fears were unfounded and luck was once again on his side. The British had sighted only one German ship. Since ''Hipper'' was known to be at sea, it was assumed she was the German vessel lurking around the convoy. Tovey's dismissal of the ''Naiad'' report masked the German ships' presence. Tovey still believed they were still in German ports.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 58.</ref> The disagreement did not adversely damage the two men's good relations.{{efn| Richard Garrett, a naval researcher, interviewed Hoffmann in 1976. Hoffmann stated he respected L\u00fctjens, who had been his gunnery instructor as a sea cadet in 1912.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 57\u201358.</ref>}}\n\nThe ships rendezvoused between Iceland and Canada with the tankers ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' on 15 February. On 22 February, after seven days of fruitless searching some 500 nautical miles east of [[Newfoundland]], German radar picked up five cargo-empty ships from a westbound convoy sailing without escort towards [[United States|American]] ports. The convoy identified the German ships and soon the radio waves were busy with signals sent from the frantic British merchantmen, which tried to disperse. The battleships quickly closed and sank four. A further ship, the 5,500-ton ''Harlesden'', carried a powerful [[wireless]] set but temporarily evaded them. Intent on silencing it, L\u00fctjens dispatched his [[Arado Ar 196]] to locate it. Upon his return, the Arado pilot reported to have found it and claimed to have destroyed the aerial, but took damage from return fire. Its position now known, the German ships closed in and sank ''Harlesden'' at 23:00. The day's haul amounted to around 25,000&nbsp;tons. On a negative note, the chase and action occurred at long range and the expenditure of ammunition was expensive. L\u00fctjens used his radio for the first time since 8 February and commanded the supply ships ''Esso Hamburg'' and ''Schlettstadt'' to meet him near the Azores so he could replenish stocks.<ref>Garratt 1978, p. 60.</ref> On 26 February he unloaded 180 [[prisoners of war]] onto the tankers ''Ermland'' and ''Friedrich Breme''. In the action of 22 February, only 11 Allied sailors had become casualties.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 61.</ref>\n\nDisappointed with the lack of targets in the north, L\u00fctjens' ships then sailed to the coast of [[West Africa]]. On 3 March 1941 they reached the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. On 5 March he attempted to dispatch his aircraft to find enemy shipping but found it four hours later, the machine having run out of fuel. L\u00fctjens' persistence paid off. At 23:00 on 5 March, he received a wireless message from Germany informing him {{GS|U-124|1940|2}} had spotted two large ships close to their position. The Arado had flown over the submarine, which had been alerted to the possibility German commerce raiders might be in the area. On 7 March, the convoy SL-67, escorted by {{HMS|Malaya}}, was sighted. Once again, L\u00fctjens obeyed his orders and not his instinct. He withdrew, but shadowed the convoy, directing ''U-124'' and {{GS|U-105|1940|2}} onto the enemy. The former sank five and the latter one ship. L\u00fctjens ran into the convoy again as darkness fell, but the Germans turned away to meet with their supply ships, narrowly avoiding a battle with ''Malaya''. On the way the [[Greece|Greek]] ship ''Marathon'' (7,926 tons) was sunk. It was carrying [[coal]] to [[Alexandria]].<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 62\u201365.</ref>\n\n====Escape to France====\nOn 11 March he received a message from Group West. {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} and ''Hipper'' were to operate in the north, and German intelligence were alerted to the possibility of a British force consisting of the British [[Mediterranean Fleet]] were on a westerly course from [[Gibraltar]]. L\u00fctjens was required to create a diversion to allow ''Scheer'' safe passage through the Denmark Strait. He decided that the best way to attract British attention was to head for [[Brest, France]], via the HX convoy route. L\u00fctjens decided to employ his entire force, supply ships too, in a search for victims. Stationed 30 miles abreast, they sailed between 39\u00b0N and 46\u00b0W. L\u00fctjens intercepted the Norwegian tanker ''Bianca'' (5,688 tons), the ''Polykarb'' (6,500 tons) and British ''San Casimiro'' (8,000 tons). He managed to capture the ships and his prize crews were ordered to [[Bordeaux]]. Only ''Polykarb'' made it. The others were scuttled by their German crews when approached by HMS ''Renown''. Three more were sunk by the German battleships.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 65\u201367.</ref>\n\nSupply ships ''Uckermark'' and ''Ermland'' signalled they had sighted another convoy. They acted as shepherds as they rushed at the startled merchantmen and drove them toward the German battleships. On 15 March L\u00fctjens began his attack. ''Empire of Industry'' (formerly German), ''Mangkai'' (formerly the German ''Scheer''), ''Silverfix'', ''Demerton'', ''Grandi'', ''Royal Crown'', ''Sardinian Prince'' and the French ''Myson'' were sunk. Among the company was ''Chilean Reefer''. Only 1,800 tons, the ship made smoke and returned ''Gniesenau''{{'}}s fire. Believing it possibly disguised as an enemy cruiser, or a scout, the Germans withdrew to a safe distance and sank it with the main batteries. It was a small target which took 73 rounds to destroy. HMS ''Rodney'' appeared 15 minutes later and flashed a challenge. In L\u00fctjens' mind, it confirmed his suspicions of the vessel as a scout. L\u00fctjens identified ''Gneisenau'' as \"HMS Emerald\", buying time as he worked up to escape. It worked, and ''Rodney'' stayed to pick up the survivors from the ''Chilean Reefer''.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> After transferring 200 prisoners, he set course for Brest, France. Sighted by an aircraft from {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|6}} on 20 March, Admiral L\u00fctjens managed to evade British warships, and reached Brest at 07:00 on 22 March. The journey of {{convert|17800|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} in 59 days was a record for German capital ships.<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 71.</ref>\n\nRaeder was pleased with L\u00fctjens. He described his operation in the Atlantic as \"beyond reproach. He invariably judged the situation accurately and he met with deserved success.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 68.</ref> Raeder's glowing endorsement was likely caused by L\u00fctjens' rigid adherence to his commander-in-chief's instructions. The ''Seekriegsleitung'' was more critical. It acknowledged the restrictions placed upon L\u00fctjens but thought L\u00fctjens could have asked for greater freedom of action after the encounter with ''Ramillies''. The staff officers believed Hoffman's tactical assessment of the situation had been correct.<ref>Garrett 1978, pp. 68\u201369.</ref>\n\n===Operation Rhein\u00fcbung===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 193-01-4-25, Schlachtschiff Bismarck.jpg|thumb|right|''Bismarck''{{'}}s aft upper deck, behind turret \"Caesar\". This is where the living and working quarters of the admiral's staff were located.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 378.</ref>]]\n\nPlans were then made for L\u00fctjens to command [[Operation Rhein\u00fcbung|Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'']], taking all four modern German battleships and battlecruisers\u2014''Bismarck'', {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz||2}}, ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau''\u2014on a raid into the Atlantic. For various reasons, ''Tirpitz'' and the two battlecruisers could not be made ready for the operation, so it proceeded with only ''Bismarck'' and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}}, under the command of [[Helmuth Brinkmann]]. The preparation and operational directives had been prepared by ''Marinegruppenkommando West'', under the command of ''[[Generaladmiral]]'' Saalw\u00e4chter and ''Marinegruppenkommando Ost'', under the command of ''Generaladmiral'' [[Rolf Carls]]. On 8 April 1941, L\u00fctjens met with Admiral D\u00f6nitz in [[Paris]]. D\u00f6nitz made the following assessment of the plan:\n<blockquote>I met Admiral L\u00fctjens, the Admiral commanding the fleet, in Paris. I knew L\u00fctjens well and held him in high esteem. During the same years we had been in command of the cruisers ''Karlsruhe'' and ''Emden'' respectively. At the end of our overseas tours of duty we had returned to Germany in company. In the years immediately before the war, while I was senior Officer, submarines, L\u00fctjens had been officer commanding Torpedo Boats. We were often together, both socially and on duty, we held the same views on naval matters and saw eye to eye in most things. At our conference in Paris we defined the support to be given to the ''Bismarck'' by [[U-Boat]]s in the following terms:<br/>\n1. The U-Boats would carry on as usual in their normal positions<br/>\n2. If while the surface ships were at sea any opportunity arose for joint action with U-Boats, every effort should be made to exploit it to the full. For this purpose an experienced U-Boat Officer would be appointed for duty to the ''Bismarck''.<br/>\n3. On the radio frequency used by the U-Boats, the Admiral commanding the fleet would be kept constantly informed of the dispositions of the boats and the intentions of the U-Boat Command.<ref>D\u00f6nitz 1958 (1997), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====L\u00fctjens' view====\nRaeder was anxious to begin the operation during the [[new moon]] on 26 April. His wishes were frustrated by a series of mishaps. ''Prinz Eugen'' was repeatedly delayed from becoming fully operational. [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) bombing, a practice torpedo, and a mine detonation delayed her from mid-April until mid-May.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 47\u201348.</ref> Raeder used this time to consult with his fleet commander. L\u00fctjens travelled to [[Berlin]] on 26 April 1941 to meet with him. For a time, L\u00fctjens tried without success to change Raeder's mind, and to wait until ''Tirpitz'', ''Scharnhorst'' and ''Gneisenau'' were ready. He argued that the German fleet should not be fed \"[[teaspoon]] by teaspoon\" into battle with the enemy.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens was, however, encouraged by his commander-in-chief to proceed and he eventually decided that an operation should begin as soon as possible to prevent the enemy's gaining any respite.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf & Wegner 2001, pp. 131\u2013132.</ref> He accepted that the current situation meant that German capital ships must be present in the Atlantic.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Although Raeder insisted on the operation, he advised L\u00fctjens to act thoughtfully and carefully without taking too high a risk.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 385\u2013386.</ref> Raeder did, however, admonish his subordinate to one end: if he were brought to battle despite his best efforts, it should be conducted with full force, to the end. He gave L\u00fctjens full [[Mission-type tactics|freedom of action]], since only he was in a position to judge the immediate situation while at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 49\" /> Raeder later wrote, \"It does L\u00fctjens great credit that he did not hesitate to express this view to me so frankly. I then sought to convince him of the cogency of my arguments....Although L\u00fctjens was perhaps not entirely convinced by my views, our discussion ended in complete understanding.\"<ref>Garrett 1978, p. 78.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens sought advice from several colleagues and friends. First, he spoke with [[Kurt Fricke]], Raeder's chief of operations. When Fricke inquired as to what he would do if approached by overwhelming force: L\u00fctjens replied he would run for home. As far as the Naval Command was concerned, this was his policy. He sought out his friend, Patzig, who had commanded {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}}, and a man he had known since 1907. Patzig argued he should remain in port. He remarked that it was folly to risk the chief of the fleet in a limited operation with a single capital ship. L\u00fctjens agreed, but feared being labelled a coward if he turned down the command.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50.</ref> His parting words to Patzig were fatalistic:\n<blockquote>Given the uneven relation of forces I am of the opinion that I should have to sacrifice myself sooner or later. I have closed out my private life and am determined to carry out the assignment given to me honourably, one way or another.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" /></blockquote>\n\nFollowing this meeting, L\u00fctjens confided to ''Vizeadmiral'' [[Hans-Erich Voss]], then working at Raeder's headquarters, that \"survival was improbable\", and bade him farewell.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 50\" />{{efn|full quote: \"I want to say goodbye, I will not come back. Given the superiority of the British survival is unlikely\"\u2014''Ich m\u00f6chte mich verabschieden, ich werde nicht wiederkommen. Bei der \u00dcberlegenheit der Briten ist ein \u00dcberleben unwahrscheinlich.''<ref name=\"\u00dcebersch\u00e4r p407\"/>}}\n\nLastly he met with his former commanding officer in Norway, Marschall. He advised L\u00fctjens not to follow Raeder's orders too closely since the situation in the Atlantic could change at any moment. L\u00fctjens would not hear of it. He refused to diverge from his standing orders. He reminded Marschall that two fleet commanders had already been removed from command\u2014Marschall being one of them\u2014and that he would follow the orders given him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 49\u201350.</ref> What depressed L\u00fctjens's already darkened mood was [[Ernst Lindemann]], ''Bismarck's'' captain, had been told by [[Karl Topp]] of the [[Marineamt]], that several [[Military simulation|war games]] were run to see if ''Tirpitz'' could reach the Atlantic undetected and that at every turn and under every circumstance, the ship was discovered. Lindemann certainly would have passed this information to L\u00fctjens.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 52.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' staff for Operation ''Rhein\u00fcbung'' was made up of the following officers:<ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\">Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392.</ref>\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" | Name\n!scope=\"col\" | Rank\n!scope=\"col\" | Role\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[Harald Netzbandt]]\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | Chief of Staff\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Emil Melms\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Kapit\u00e4n zur See''\n| scope=\"row\" | 2nd Admiral Staff Officer, Artillery Officer of the Fleet, Personnel Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Dr. Hans-Releff Riege\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Flottenarzt'' (posthumously ''Admiralarzt'')\n| scope=\"row\" | Doctor with the Fleet Commando\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Helmut Marschall\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Hauptregierungsrat'' of the Reserves\n| scope=\"row\" | Meteorologist\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Paul Ascher\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n''\n| scope=\"row\" | 1st Admiral Staff Officer\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | Karl Thannemann\n| scope=\"row\" | ''Fregattenkapit\u00e4n'' (Ing.)

L\u00fctjens had informed Lindemann and Brinkmann on 18 May that he intended to sail for the arctic and refuel at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62.</ref> Three days later, in Norwegian waters, L\u00fctjens ordered a fuel stop in a [[Grimstadfjord]] near [[Bergen]]. He did not inform either Lindemann or Brinkmann about the decision to drop anchor and refuel. As was his custom, he offered no explanation for changing his mind.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 70.</ref>\n\nWhile ''Prinz Eugen'' was refuelled, L\u00fctjens declined to top up the ''Bismarck''. A rupture in one of the fuel lines had allowed only an initial influx of 6,000 tons. A further 2,000 tons was to be accepted at sea.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/> The ship had left the Baltic 200 tons short, and had since burned 1,000 tons reaching Norway. L\u00fctjens knew that the German tanker ''Weissenberg'' was waiting for him in the Arctic, only an additional day's sailing away, but farther from prying British eyes.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> It was perhaps his intention to replenish there. In the event he did not refuel during the operation.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 62\"/>\n\nThe following day, on 22 May, he received a report that four British battleships, perhaps an [[aircraft carrier]], and a strong escort of destroyers were still anchored at [[Scapa Flow]]. Although mistaken, it appears to have influenced L\u00fctjens' decision not to loiter and wait for events to unfold, but to proceed with a breakout immediately which would not permit time for refueling prior to reaching the Atlantic.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 133.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> This faulty intelligence report likely dispelled any doubts L\u00fctjens had about his chosen route.<ref>Ballard 1990, p.. 69.</ref> The move would bring about the first of several disagreements with Captain Lindemann. Lindemann preferred the route south of Iceland, but once again L\u00fctjens and his terse style had prevailed.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 66.</ref>\n\nHe also declined ''Generaladmiral'' Carls' desire for a breakout through the more southerly Faroe Islands-Iceland gap. As usual, he gave no explanation for any change in operational direction. While the ice-flooded regions of northern Iceland and the [[Denmark Strait]] could be easily patrolled by the enemy, as believed by Carls, it offered lower-visibility conditions, giving him much needed cover. Nevertheless, he continued to frustrate his junior officers. Meteorologist Heinz Externbrink suggested increasing speed to keep up with the fast-moving cloud affording him cover. L\u00fctjens declined without comment, and Externbrink vented his anger to [[:de:Burkard Freiherr von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg|Burkard von M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg]], the most senior officer to survive the operation. Despite his intentions, the British were alerted to the task force's operation by the [[Sweden|Swedes]], [[Norwegian Resistance]] and [[aerial reconnaissance]].<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, & Wegner 2001, p. 132.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201375.</ref>\n\nLindemann remained on edge. As captain, he was privy to the B-Dienst naval intelligence now reaching him on enemy movements. A large contingent of enemy capital ships was congregating at Scapa Flow. His senior medical officer, Dr. Otto Schneider, observed that Lindemann fully understood the dangers his ship faced. But Admiral L\u00fctjens alone could call off the operation. He showed no desire to discuss his intentions with either Captain Lindemann or Brinkmann, which put both of them on edge. L\u00fctjens offered no hint of intentions either to his destroyer escort, which he dismissed near [[Trondheim]], or to ''Generaladmiral'' Carls. Carls openly displayed his displeasure at the lack of communication, believing L\u00fctjens to be hesitant. Not until the evening of 22 May did he share his intention to breach the Denmark Strait with his captains; perhaps encouraged in the knowledge that the British [[Force H]] would now be engaged in the beginning [[Battle of Crete]]. The foul weather gave him the cover he needed. Foregoing the chance of a refuel, he headed due west, north of Iceland.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 72\u201378</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens remained unaware that the British were tracking him until 23 May, when his ships encountered heavy cruisers {{HMS|Norfolk|78|6}} and {{HMS|Suffolk|55|2}}, amidst the [[Greenland]] ice pack. L\u00fctjens received the identity of the first ship as the latter vessel. He gave the code JOTDORA: permission to fire. Although shots were fired, no serious damage resulted to either side, and the outgunned British cruisers quickly withdrew, though they remained within radar range and continued to shadow the German ships. The shock from the firing of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s heavy guns disabled her search radar, so L\u00fctjens ordered ''Prinz Eugen'' to take the lead. As they passed each other ''Bismarck''{{'}}s electric push-button wheel jammed and it veered toward the German cruiser. The quick thinking of Brinkmann avoided a collision. During a raining squall L\u00fctjens attempted a 180-degree turn to surprise his attackers, but the British radar detected the manoeuvre and withdrew. L\u00fctjens could not shake his pursuers. He believed they possessed a new type of radar as yet unknown to the Germans.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 71\u201372.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 125\u2013133.</ref>\n\n====Tactical command in battle====\n[[File:Absetzman\u00f6ver Bismarck.png|thumb|right|300px|''Bismarck''{{'}}s {{frac|3|4}} clockwise turn on 25 May. L\u00fctjens' tactic was highly successful, shaking free of his pursuers.]]\nIn the early hours of 24 May 1941, ''Prinz Eugen''{{'}}s hydrophones detected two large ships approaching. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Lancelot Holland]] in his flagship battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} and battleship {{HMS|Prince of Wales|53|6}} were heading towards them. It began the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]]. L\u00fctjens was soon informed that the two ships were enemy heavy units by the size of their superstructure, but remained unaware of their identity until they adjusted their attitude. Confronted with enemy combat vessels, L\u00fctjens turned away, to gain time to think and plan a response to his opponents who were clearly attempting to engage him.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 144.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' first instinct was to attempt to outrun the British ships, scrupulously obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as ''Hood''. Even after ''Hood'' began to fire on the two ships and it became obvious that an engagement was inevitable, L\u00fctjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief [[yeoman]] to signal to ''Prinz Eugen'' to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not ''Bismarck'', much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.</ref>\n\nFirst Gunnery Officer [[Adalbert Schneider]], made multiple inquiries to return fire; methodically reporting enemy salvos and asking permission to fire. L\u00fctjens, himself an artillery specialist, waited until the range fell. Moreover, the position of the British placed them at the outer limit of traverse for his main batteries, which were now inclined astern of the ship. L\u00fctjens was also wary of using up heavy shells which were required for raiding operations and a possible future engagement. He could not afford to use up ammunition to register his guns, instead, preferring a closer-range battle. He waited for the optimum moment to fire back.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nSome witnesses testify Captain Lindeman muttered, \"I will not allow my ship to be shot out from under my arse. Open fire!\".<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 78.</ref> Finally L\u00fctjens gave the order to return fire. L\u00fctjens then ordered a turn to port, and [[Crossing the T|crossed Holland's T]], as his opponent turned to bring all the British guns to bear. Shortly before firing, ''Bismarck'' was hit in the forecastle, though ''Prinz Eugen'' had registered hits on ''Hood'' which had started a large series of fires making it easier for the Germans to home in on her position. ''Bismarck'' then targeted ''Hood''.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 148\u2013149.\" />\n\nL\u00fctjens did not observe the German tactical regulations of the time, to place his weaker cruiser to his battleship's unengaged side and out of range. Instead, he kept her in the line to maximise his firepower even though both German ships were now firing salvos across each other's line-of-fire.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.</ref> Once the odds were reduced, he then ordered her to drop back and use her radar to keep a vigil on the British cruisers, still chasing the German force.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /> Schneider observed the fifth salvo strike ''Hood'' from a range of 17,500 [[yard]]s.<ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\">Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.</ref> Two splashes were seen. Apparently one or more shells \"bit into\" ''Hood'', seemingly without effect, leading the gunnery officers to believe it was a dud. Moments later ''Hood'' blew up, which caused much excitement on the German ships. L\u00fctjens remained unmoved. The Germans then turned their fire to ''Prince of Wales'', causing seven damaging hits and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] to retreat to a safe distance.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 153.\" /><ref name=\"Koop and Schmolke 2014, pp. 38\u201339.\" /><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 85.</ref>\n\nLindemann, guided by the tactical situation, wanted to destroy the damaged ship. He estimated a two- to three-hour chase would be enough.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\">Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref> L\u00fctjens, mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary fighting with enemy capital ships, rejected his protests without discussion. L\u00fctjens was suspicious of the intelligence he was receiving, which days earlier had told him ''Hood'' was standing off the coast of [[West Africa]].<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2001, p. 172.</ref> He could no longer be sure of how many more enemy capital ships could be in the area. A time-consuming battle with ''Prince of Wales'' was out of the question, and he proceeded into the vast expanses of the Atlantic, where he could lose his pursuers and have the necessary room to manoeuvre.<ref name=\"Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 166\u2013167\" /><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 145, 150, 224\u2013225.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens' tactics proved useful in two respects. After the ''Hood'' battle, he steamed directly at his pursuers, forcing them away, while his heavy cruiser escaped out of radar range. On 25 May, his 52nd birthday, despite constant action and exhaustion, he ordered a clever manoeuvre. He ordered full speed and then a three-quarter clockwise turn once his pursuers had reached the extremis of their radar range. The British cruisers had been performing zigzags to avoid German U-boats they believed to be in the vicinity. At the outer edge of their port turn, they would be at the limit of their radar's range. This allowed him to escape the enemy radar, steam in the opposite direction, and then once behind them steam across their wake and avoid enemy attempts to regain contact.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 236\u2013239.</ref>\n\nThe move worked and he evaded the British for a short time. L\u00fctjens then broke radio silence, allowing the British a rough idea of his [[latitude]] but not his [[longitude]]. He continued to believe he was being tracked. Naval Group West informed him to send only tactical radio signals and not risk broadcasting long radio messages to [[Paris]] since they were sure he had broken contact. L\u00fctjens, already distrustful of B-Dienst, disregarded the warnings. Fortunately, not until late evening on 25 May, did the British realise he was heading for [[France]]. By this time L\u00fctjens was well ahead of his pursuers. It proved, however, to be a grave error. Although the British made a number of mistakes in locating her, the intercepted message allowed them to send to air strikes against the ship over the next two days.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 236.</ref><ref>Jackson 2002, p. 90.</ref>\n\n====Leadership in crisis====\nL\u00fctjens radioed [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Berlin]] and all the naval commands concerning the sinking of ''Hood'' continually until his message was acknowledged. It was received only at 14:40 in Berlin. Aboard ''Prinz Eugen'' Captain Brinkmann noted that such actions were dangerous. He recorded in the ships' war diary that L\u00fctjens' insistence on radioing every change of course to the shore commands; then confirmed by a final \"Execute!\" order, was unnecessary and risky. In the morning of the 25 May, his 52nd birthday, L\u00fctjens persisted by sending a long message on the ''Hood'' action. It was apparent that he mistakenly believed he was still under surveillance by the British and thus any message could do no harm since his position was known to the enemy.<ref>Winklareth 1998. p. 130.</ref><ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, p. 167.</ref>\n\nThe enemy, Brinkmann thought, could and would glean important intelligence from the most seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was foolish to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to [[St. Nazaire]] and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention of the extent of the damage incurred by ''Bismarck'' was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to pour in through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue L\u00fctjens with any orders since they had no information on the state of the task force.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 167\u2013169.</ref>\n[[File:Funknachricht L\u00fctjens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|L\u00fctjens' final message, informing the German command of his intention to fight to the last against the enemy.]]\nMeanwhile, L\u00fctjens took stock of his predicament. Firstly, he believed that he was shadowed by a force of ships with superior radar. Secondly, the element of surprise had been lost. Thirdly, the battleship was running low of fuel; his decision not to refuel in Norway or the [[Norwegian Sea]] now became relevant. Fourthly, he thought the force was led by the efficient battleship {{HMS|King George V|41|6}}, which he thought was leading him into a trap with an enemy fleet alerted to ''Hood''{{'}}s fate. Fifthly, sea water had slowed him by two knots. His ship had lost some electrical power and salt water was threatening to enter fuel lines and shut down two boilers.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 170\u2013171.</ref><ref>Ballard 1990, p. 86.</ref> Lindemann argued for a return via the Denmark Strait to Norway. In his view the ship was too fine a vessel to be risked in another unequal struggle. L\u00fctjens rejected his suggestion. It would take him too close to the [[British Isles]] and expose him to the greatest concentration of enemy sea, air and coastal forces. According to survivors, the animosity between Lindemann and L\u00fctjens was now beginning to extend to their respective staffs.<ref>Bercuson & Herwig 2002, pp. 171\u2013172.</ref>\n\nThe reasons for L\u00fctjens' decision to make for France instead of making the shorter journey to Norway remain unknown. It can be surmised he thought the ship would be repaired quickly and a French port was closer to his hunting ground which also precluded another tricky break out via the Denmark Strait. Furthermore, he had asked for a concentration of U-boats south of [[Greenland]] to attack his shadowers. The vast ocean also offered an opportunity to lose his pursuers. However, the perilous fuel situation forced him to abandon the U-Boat option and steam directly for France.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf and Wegner 2001, p. 235.</ref> In light of these developments, L\u00fctjens addressed the crew as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Seamen of the battleship ''Bismarck''! You have covered yourself with glory! The sinking of the battle cruiser ''Hood'' has not only military, but psychological value, for she was the pride of [[UK|Great Britain]]. Henceforth the enemy will try to concentrate his forces and bring them into action against us. I therefore released ''Prinz Eugen'' at noon yesterday so that she could conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle. The German people are with you, and we will fight until our gun barrels glow red-hot and the last shell has left the barrels. For us, seamen, the question is victory or death.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 104.</ref></blockquote>\n\nSurviving crewmembers of ''Bismarck'' state that they received this message in shock. Rather than harden the resolve of the German crew, the tone of L\u00fctjens' speech implied the ship was in some difficulty and that they may not reach a friendly port. It depressed the mood about the battleship and created uncertainty among all ranks. They interpreted L\u00fctjens' words to mean the ''Admiral'' did not believe they would survive. Lindemann recognised the damage it caused and tried to present a more optimistic view of the situation. He spoke of the U-boats and ''Luftwaffe'' that were gathering to help them home. The speech, an hour later, only partially succeeded in restoring morale. That afternoon L\u00fctjens received messages of best wishes from Hitler and Raeder. The former was short and curt. L\u00fctjens purportedly stuffed the paper into his pocket without comment.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 106.</ref>\n\nA British reconnaissance aircraft sighted ''Bismarck'' in the early morning hours of 26 May by following its [[oil slick]]. At dusk on 26 May, [[Fairey Swordfish]] torpedo aircraft from HMS ''Ark Royal'' attacked. Although much of the damage was superficial, one torpedo jammed ''Bismarck''{{'}}s rudders and steering gear. Lindemann was sure the damage could be repaired, but L\u00fctjens apparently was quick to accept the worst. As Lindemann and his engineering officers discussed ways to repair the damage L\u00fctjens compiled a note to the German command and people just 30 minutes after the torpedo struck and before the full extent of the damage was known. Divers were put over the side, but reported they could not clear the damage, as the sea was then too rough. The officers also considered using the aircraft hangar doors on board the ship as makeshift rudders but the proposals came to nothing. The crew was still able to steer ''Bismarck'' somewhat by adjusting the revolution speed of her propellers, but it reduced the ship's top speed to {{convert|7|kn|km/h mph|lk=in|abbr=on}} and effectively left it circling in the water.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 116.</ref>\n\nThroughout the night, she was the target of incessant torpedo attacks by {{HMS|Cossack|F03|6}}, {{HMS|Sikh|F82|2}}, {{HMS|Maori|F24|2}}, {{HMS|Zulu|F18|2}}, and {{ORP|Piorun|G65|6}} designed to wear down the crew. At this point, the Home Fleet and ''Norfolk'' following from the north were joined by HMS ''Rodney'', while Force H and heavy cruiser {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} approached from the south, and light cruiser {{HMS|Edinburgh|16|6}} from the west. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s low speed and southeasterly heading away from its known pursuers made it very easy for the force to the south to catch up.\n\n==Death==\nL\u00fctjens recognised the gravity of the situation. At 23:58 on 26 May, L\u00fctjens transmitted to ''Group West'', the Naval HQ \"To the ''F\u00fchrer'' of the German ''Reich'', Adolf Hitler. We will fight to the end thinking of you confident as in a rock in the victory of Germany\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\">Jackson 2002, p. 91.</ref> Hitler replied at 01:53 on 27 May: \"I thank you in the name of the whole German nation \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\" Later another message was sent, \"To the crew of the battleship ''Bismarck'': all Germany is with you. What can be done will be done. Your devotion to your duty will strengthen our people in the struggle for their existence \u2013 Adolf Hitler.\"<ref name=\"Jackson 2002, p. 91\"/>\n\nThe mood aboard ''Bismarck'' was mixed. Seaman Adolf Eich was off duty for some fresh air. He climbed up to the bridge for as long as nobody stopped him. When he got there he found the atmosphere pleasant. Lindemann was shaking the hand of [[Adalbert Schneider]] for his Knight's Cross award bestowed upon him for the destruction of ''Hood''. L\u00fctjens also looked pleased. As the morning wore on the atmosphere changed. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg saw Lindemann wearing a life jacket and watched as the captain ate his breakfast in silence. He did not return M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg's salute. M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg also met L\u00fctjens as the Admiral made his way to the bridge. L\u00fctjens returned his salute as he brushed past but said nothing. To M\u00fcllenheim-Rechberg it seemed as if the two men most responsible for ''Bismarck'' had retreated into their own private worlds.<ref>Ballard 1990, pp. 121\u2013124.</ref> That morning, on the 27 May 1941, L\u00fctjens sent a request for a U-Boat to pick up the ship's war diary. In this last transmission, L\u00fctjens included: \"Ship no longer manoeuvrable. We fight to the last shell. Long live the ''F\u00fchrer''\".<ref>Jackson 2002, p. 49.</ref> L\u00fctjens did not hide their fate from his crew. He ordered the ships stores to be opened and allowed the crew to help themselves. It was a sign to all onboard ''Bismarck'' was doomed.<ref>Bercuson and Herwig 2001, p. 276.</ref>\n\nL\u00fctjens had been open to criticism for his sycophantic messages to Hitler and his vow to fight to the last against hopeless odds. The authors of the [[Germany and the Second World War|German official history]] have commented it would be unjust to criticise him for being sympathetic to the National Socialist cause or to mark him as an Admiral who saw operations through to the end regardless of the outcome. L\u00fctjens had remained notably aloof from the regime. This aside, he was also steeped in the German officer traditions in which it was inconceivable to abandon a fully battle-ready ship. After the scuttling of the ''[[German cruiser Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]'', Raeder had ordered all capital ships to fight to the last round if crippled. His messages, according to these historians, should be seen in the context of L\u00fctjens fulfilling his duty. It is unknown whether he or Lindemann considered scuttling the ship to save the crew before the last battle.<ref>Boog, Rahn, Stumpf, Wegner 2001, pp. 137, 139, 230.</ref>\n\n''Bismarck''{{'}}s alarm sounded for the last time at 08:00 on the morning of 27 May 1941. ''Norfolk'' sighted the ''Bismarck'' at 08:15, and the battleship {{HMS|Rodney|29|2}} opened fire at 08:48. ''Bismarck'' began [[Last battle of the battleship Bismarck|her last stand]] and returned fire at 08:49 against ''Rodney''. {{HMS|King George V|41|2}} fired at ''Bismarck'' soon after and the cruisers ''Norfolk'' and ''Dorsetshire'' engaged with their main armament. ''Bismarck''{{'}}s forward command position was hit at 08:53, and both forward gun turrets were put out of action at 09:02, killing Adalbert Schneider in the main gun director. The after command position was destroyed at 09:18 and turret ''Dora'' was disabled at 09:24. ''Bismarck'' received further heavy hits at 09:40, resulting in a fire amidships, and turret ''Caesar'' went out of action after a hit at 09:50. Some secondary positions and weapons survived and battled on. All weapons fell silent at 10:00. Short of fuel, ''Rodney'' and ''King George V'' had to disengage prior to ''Bismarck''{{'}}s sinking.\n\n{{location map|North Atlantic| label=''Bismarck'' sunk |position=bottom\n|width=150\n|long=-16.12\n|lat=48.10\n|caption=\n}}\nThe Germans were preparing to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] ''Bismarck'' when three torpedoes fired by ''Dorsetshire'' hit the ship's side armour. ''Bismarck'' sank at 10:36 at position {{Coord|48|10|N|16|12|W}}, roughly {{convert|300|nmi|km mi|abbr=on}} west of Ouessant ([[Ushant]]). The cruiser ''Dorsetshire'' saved 85 men, and the British destroyer ''Maori'' saved another 25. Five sailors were saved by {{GS|U-74|1940|6}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat]], and the weather observation ship {{ship|German weather ship|Sachsenwald||2}}. The ''[[Befehlshaber der U-Boote]]'' (U-boat Commander-in-Chief) D\u00f6nitz had ordered {{GS|U-556||2}}, under the command of Captain Lieutenant [[Herbert Wohlfarth]], to pick up ''Bismarck''{{'}}s [[war diary]]. Out of torpedoes and low on fuel, Wohlfarth requested that the mission be transferred to ''U-74''. ''U-74'' failed to reach Bismarck in time, and the war diary was never retrieved.<ref>Hildebrand, R\u00f6hr and Steinmetz 1990, volume 2 p. 81.</ref> L\u00fctjens was among those who lost their lives \u2013 probably killed when a {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} salvo fired by ''Rodney'' destroyed the bridge, killing many senior officers.\n\n==Personal life==\nL\u00fctjens married Margarete Backenk\u00f6hler, daughter of the ''[[Geheimrat|Geheimen]] Sanit\u00e4tsrat'' (\"Privy Counselor on Hygiene\", honorary title given to a distinguished doctor) Dr. Gerhard Backenk\u00f6hler, in the summer of 1929.<ref name=\"Uebersch\u00e4r 2011, p. 408\"/> She was 27 at the time of the wedding and the sister of Otto Backenk\u00f6hler. Admiral Otto Backenk\u00f6hler was L\u00fctjens' chief of staff at the Fleet-Command (24 October 1939 \u2013 31 July 1940). A year later, their first son, Gerhard, was born on 31 August 1930 in [[\u015awinouj\u015bcie|Swinem\u00fcnde]]. The marriage produced a second son, named G\u00fcnther after his father, on 28 August 1932 in Berlin. Their daughter Annemarie was born on 27 August 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Less than a month after L\u00fctjens' death, his wife gave birth to their fourth child, Peter.<ref>Gaack and Carr 2011, pp. 380\u2013392.</ref><ref name=\"Gaack and Carr 2011, p. 392\"/><ref>Rigg and Nicolai 2003, p. 120.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn the 1960 film, ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'', L\u00fctjens (played by [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]]) is portrayed as a stereotypical [[Nazi]], committed to Nazism and crazed in his undaunted belief that the ''Bismarck'' is unsinkable. In reality, L\u00fctjens did not agree with Nazi policies; along with two other navy commanders, he had publicly protested against the brutality of anti-Semitic crimes during [[Kristallnacht]]. He was one of the few officers who refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler visited ''Bismarck'' before its first and final mission, deliberately using instead the traditional naval salute.<ref>Ballard 1990, p. 32</ref> He was pessimistic of the chances of success of ''Bismarck''{{'}}s mission and realised that it would be a daunting task.<ref>Asmussen, John.

The ship was christened by Gerda L\u00fctjens, wife of L\u00fctjens oldest son Gerhard, in [[Bath, Maine]] on 11 August 1967, and was decommissioned in 2003.<ref name=\"bismarck-class.dk\">[http://www.bismarck-class.dk/bismarck/men_involved/luetjens.html Bismarck: A portrait of the Men Involved]</ref> In his christening speech the then [[secretary of state]] at the [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Ministry of Defence]], [[Karl Carstens]], stated that L\u00fctjens had set an example of \"unwavering sense of responsibility and devout faithfulness to duty\".<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\">{{Cite web|work=Der Spiegel 35/1967 |title=Mumm haben|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46211719.html| accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nChoosing the name \"L\u00fctjens\" for the newly commissioned destroyer was not without controversy, but the Minister of Defence [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der (CDU)|Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] wanted to break the taboo surrounding the heroes of World War II who were not Nazis but who were not associated with the [[20 July plot]], the failed assassination of Adolf Hitler. The former Inspector of the Navy Ruge had feared that L\u00fctjens was not known well enough and had suggested the names ''Adenauer'', ''Berlin'' and ''Rommel'' instead. Schr\u00f6der however wanted to bridge the gap to former traditions and wanted to name the destroyers after former heroes of the three branches of the [[Wehrmacht]] (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'', ''Kriegsmarine'' and ''Luftwaffe'').<ref name=\"Der Spiegel 35/1967\"/> L\u00fctjens' name had previously been cleared by the [[German Armed Forces Military History Research Office]] (''Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt'' or MGFA), formerly in Freiburg im Breisgau.

Present at the christening was a Bundeswehr helicopter which had been used to shuttle the official German government visitors around, and it bore the insignia of the Bundeswehr, a variant of the Iron Cross.
