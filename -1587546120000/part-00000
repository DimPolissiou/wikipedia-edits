This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older [[Suspended Swing roller coaster|suspended coaster]], which runs under the track, but ''swings'' via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage. The coaster type's inverted orientation, where the passengers' legs are exposed, distinguishes it from a traditional roller coaster, where the passengers' arms are instead exposed.\n\n[[Image:Inverted coaster car front view.png|left|thumb|200px|B&M style inverted roller coaster car.]]The inverted coaster was pioneered by the Swiss roller coaster designers [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] in the early 1990s. The first installation came at [[Six Flags Great America]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201405/4014/|title=Coaster Tech: An Insider's look at inverted coasters |last=Meyer|first=Russell|work=themeparkinsider.com|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref> [[Batman: The Ride]] opened to much fanfare and was \"cloned\" many times at other parks. The inverted coaster quickly became an industry favorite with custom designs installed nearly every year. The tallest and fastest inverted coaster is [[Wicked Twister]] at [[Cedar Point]] at {{Convert|215|ft}} tall and reaching speeds up to {{Convert|72|mph}}. The longest inverted coaster is [[Banshee (roller coaster)|Banshee]] at [[Kings Island]] which travels along {{Convert|4124|ft}} of track.\n\nOther roller coaster manufacturers followed in the footsteps of Bolliger & Mabillard and began working on their own inverted coaster designs, including [[Vekoma]], [[Intamin]] and other smaller companies. Intamin has few designs classified as inverted coasters, although they do install inverted coaster trains on some of their launched designs. Vekoma, on the other hand, usually mass-produces the same design ([[Vekoma SLC|SLC (689m Standard)]]) with 41 identical coasters \u2013 and a few variations of that design \u2013 installed around the world.<ref>http://rcdb.com/cm7.htm</ref> Also, in recent years, Vekoma has become the first manufacturer to install a family-friendly inverted roller coaster. [[Giovanola]] also has a single inverted coaster operating.\n\nThe [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]] usually include [[vertical loops]], zero gravity rolls, Immelmann loops, cobra rolls, and corkscrews.\n\n== Installations ==\n189 inverted roller coasters have been installed at various theme parks, some of which have been relocated.

This latter attribute is what sets it apart from the older [[Suspended Swing roller coaster|suspended coaster]], which runs under the track, but ''swings'' via a pivoting bar attached to the wheel carriage. The coaster type's inverted orientation, where the passengers' legs are exposed, distinguishes it from a traditional roller coaster, where the passengers' arms are instead exposed.\n\n[[Image:Inverted coaster car front view.png|left|thumb|200px|B&M style inverted roller coaster car.]]The inverted coaster was pioneered by the Swiss roller coaster designers [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] in the early 1990s. The first installation came at [[Six Flags Great America]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201405/4014/|title=Coaster Tech: An Insider's look at inverted coasters |last=Meyer|first=Russell|work=themeparkinsider.com|date=May 12, 2014|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref> [[Batman: The Ride]] opened to much fanfare and was \"cloned\" many times at other parks. The inverted coaster quickly became an industry favorite with custom designs installed nearly every year. The tallest and fastest inverted coaster is [[Wicked Twister]] at [[Cedar Point]] at {{Convert|215|ft}} tall and reaching speeds up to {{Convert|72|mph}}. The longest inverted coaster is [[Banshee (roller coaster)|Banshee]] at [[Kings Island]] which travels along {{Convert|4124|ft}} of track.\n\nOther roller coaster manufacturers followed in the footsteps of Bolliger & Mabillard and began working on their own inverted coaster designs, including [[Vekoma]], [[Intamin]] and other smaller companies. Intamin has few designs classified as inverted coasters, although they do install inverted coaster trains on some of their launched designs. Vekoma, on the other hand, usually mass-produces the same design ([[Vekoma SLC|SLC (689m Standard)]]) with 41 identical coasters \u2013 and a few variations of that design \u2013 installed around the world.<ref>http://rcdb.com/cm7.htm</ref> Also, in recent years, Vekoma has become the first manufacturer to install a family-friendly inverted roller coaster. [[Giovanola]] also has a single inverted coaster operating.\n\nThe [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]] usually include [[vertical loops]], zero gravity rolls, Immelmann loops, cobra rolls, and corkscrews.\n\n== Installations ==\n189 inverted roller coasters have been installed at various theme parks, some of which have been relocated.

Rose is described as having \"given up her physical form to bring [Steven] into the world\" as the first Gem-human hybrid, and her gemstone is embedded in his navel.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=16}} At the beginning of the show's narrative, he is in his early teens, but appears younger due to the interaction of his Gem magic with his aging process. Steven is caring, protective, brave, gentle, forgiving, and eager to help the people he loves with their problems; his optimism is often a source of strength for the other Crystal Gems. His gemstone gives him a wide range of magical abilities; one of the long-term [[story arc]]s of the series is his progress in learning about and mastering these abilities, beginning in the first episode with his first successful attempt to summon his Gem weapon, a pink [[shield]]. Other long-lasting character arcs involving Steven include his anxiety about filling his mother's place in the Crystal Gems and coping with her complex legacy, and his developing friendship with his human best friend Connie.\n\nThe sequel series, ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', focuses on Steven's psychological state in the aftermath of the events of the main series. In ''Future'', Steven wrestles with feelings of purposelessness now that the battles he spent his early adolescence fighting are resolved, and copes with the lasting [[psychological trauma]] from the stress he experienced while fighting them.\n\n===Garnet===\n{{Main|Garnet (Steven Universe)}}\nThe disciplined current leader of the Crystal Gems, Garnet (voiced by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) is quiet, stoic, pragmatic, and described by Steven as \"mysterious\", but over the course of the series she becomes more emotionally open, especially in expressing her love for Steven. According to the writers, her great self-confidence is reflected in the fact that she never asks questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/sdcc2015-steven-universe-roundtable-interview/|publisher=Toonzone|title=SDCC2015: 'Steven Universe' Roundtable Interview|last=Glennon|first=Christopher|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> She possesses red [[garnet]]s in the palms of her hands, from which she summons her Gem weapon, a pair of heavy [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. She also has a [[precognition|precognitive]] ability she refers to as \"future vision\". Garnet has three eyes, over which she wears a [[visor]].\n\nIn the first-season finale \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\", it is revealed that Garnet is a [[#Fusions|fusion]] of two smaller Gems named Ruby and Sapphire. Garnet's existence is thus a personification of Ruby and Sapphire's loving relationship\u2014she describes herself as \"a conversation\" and \"made of love\"\u2014and her personality is a stable blending of Ruby and Sapphire's traits. The character of Garnet has won acclaim from critics as a representation of a [[queer]] relationship.<ref name=MarySue1>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-bomb-recap/|website=The Mary Sue|title=The Great Big Steven Universe Recap; Or, The Femme Smooch Heard 'Round the World|author=Vrai Kaiser|date=March 18, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> Though she is normally stoic, Garnet's strongest emotional displays are often centered around fusion: anger and revulsion at what she perceives as abuses or perversions of fusion, and delight when Steven develops the ability to fuse. The second-season episode \"[[The Answer (Steven Universe)|The Answer]]\", a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing how Ruby and Sapphire met and formed Garnet for the first time, was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|an Emmy Award]] and adapted into a children's book.\n\n====Ruby and Sapphire====\nRuby (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]) and Sapphire (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]])\u2014the two smaller Gems who are the components of Garnet\u2014first appeared in \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe episode)|Jail Break]]\". They have contrasting personalities and abilities: Sapphire is an emotionally reserved Gem who held a high rank on Homeworld, with ice-related powers and the ability to see into the future;{{sfn|Sugar|2016|loc=n.p.}} while Ruby is impulsive and hotheaded, has fire-related abilities, and was a common foot soldier on Homeworld. Garnet's qualities are the result of a \"conversation\" between these two contrasting personalities. Near the end of the fifth season, after a period of questioning the basis of their relationship in the wake of revelations about Rose Quartz's past, Ruby and Sapphire recommit themselves to each other through marriage; critics described the characters' marriage as a milestone of progress in the history of queer representation in children's television.<ref name=\"Polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/7/5/17536202/steven-universe-heart-of-the-crystal-gems-the-question-same-sex-couple |title=Steven Universe honored a relationship and broke ground for LGBTQ culture |first=Petrana |last=Radulovic |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=July 5, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/ |title= ''Steven Universe'' shows a groundbreaking same-sex marriage proposal|last= Romano|first= Nick|date=5 July 2018 |publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Amethyst===\n{{Main|Amethyst (Steven Universe)}}\nAmethyst (voiced by [[Michaela Dietz]]) is the shortest and youngest of the Crystal Gems other than Steven. Her mischievous sense of humor often provides [[comic relief]], and her fun-loving, childish nature bolsters her friendship with Steven. Her [[amethyst]] gemstone, from which she can summon a [[whip]], is located on her chest; she also makes frequent use of [[shapeshifting]] capabilities.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=38\u201341}} She was the last of the Gems created on Earth as part of the Gem Homeworld's \"Kindergarten\" project to convert Earth into a Gem-occupied world, and learns in the second season that she is smaller and weaker than other Gems of her type (the \"Quartz\" warrior caste).  Her rebellious and hedonistic personality covers for deep-seated feelings of inadequacy, resentment, and fear that the other Crystal Gems do not respect her, and a long-term [[character arc]] involves her learning to respect herself and her capabilities.\n\n===Pearl===\n{{Main|Pearl (Steven Universe)}}\nResembling a [[ballerina]] in her slender build, costume, and graceful style of movement, Pearl (voiced by [[Deedee Magno Hall]]) is a short-tempered, precise strategist and technician. Her gemstone is a white [[pearl]] in her forehead from which she can summon a [[spear]] and create holographic images.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=52\u201355}} She is the most motherly and protective toward Steven of the Gems. Pearl harbored a deep romantic devotion to Rose Quartz, leading to lasting [[grief]] over Rose's absence and [[jealousy]] over her relationship with Greg; major character arcs for Pearl include learning how to cope with and move beyond these emotions. On the Gem homeworld, pearls are \"made-to-order\" servants for high-ranking Gems, and the fifth season reveals that Pearl originally served Rose Quartz in Rose's original identity of Pink Diamond. Pearl has learned to move beyond her caste role as a fighter and technician, but still has difficulty learning to feel independent rather than subordinate.  Critical response to Pearl has largely appreciated her portrayal as a complex and sympathetic, yet flawed [[queer]] character.<ref name=\"Pink\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/17/comment-lots-of-childrens-programmes-already-have-lgbt-characters/|title=Comment: Lots of children's programmes already have LGBT characters|last=Payton|first=Naith|date=July 17, 2015|publisher=[[Pink News]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"MarySue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-and-fandom/|title=It's OK to Have Flaws (Except for You): ''Steven Universe'' and Fandom|last=Kaiser|first=Vrai|date=June 11, 2015|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Major supporting characters==\n===Greg Universe===\nSteven's father Greg (voiced by [[Tom Scharpling]]) is a former rock singer who now lives in his van and runs a car wash in Beach City. Although Steven lives with the Gems, Greg remains a constant presence in his life. Though he is often made uncomfortable by Gem magic, Greg is laid-back, accepting, and supportive of Steven's adventures; it is largely from Greg that Steven inherits his optimistic, empathetic temperament.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://player.fm/series/the-steven-universe-podcast/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-ian-jones-quartey-zach-callison-grace-rolek-vol2ep1|title= The Steven Universe Podcast: Steven Universe |publisher=Cartoon Network |host= Mackenzie Atwood|date= 25 January 2018}}</ref> As a young adult, Greg ran away from his controlling family to become a traveling musician; the freedom and lack of structure he gave young Steven was a reaction against his own strict upbringing.\n\n===Connie Maheswaran===\nConnie (voiced by [[Grace Rolek]]) is Steven's best friend. Introduced as an intelligent yet lonely person in the episode \"Bubble Buddies\" early in the first season, she rapidly develops a close relationship with Steven. An avid reader of [[fantasy literature]], she admires what she calls Steven's \"magical destiny\" and is eager to be part of it. Her involvement in Gem adventures gradually increases over the course of the series; she inherits Rose Quartz's sword and is eventually accepted as a member of the Crystal Gems. Long-term character arcs involving Connie include her learning to see herself as Steven's equal despite not having magical abilities of her own, and to push back against her own overprotective parents. Some viewers have interpreted Steven and Connie's relationship as romantic or potentially romantic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pladek|first=Brittany|date=Autumn 2016|title=''Steven Universe'' (review)|journal=Science Fiction Film and Television|volume=9|issue=3|pages=501\u2013504|access-date=March 18, 2020|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/641640/pdf?casa_token=ConHIP3lLrsAAAAA:OWCrgL412rdLMSsG4jMpdP1v06yVZR2a21ZG9GmqDGLlmS1zS5c9IAMPV7gnNkHZlYdwUfFy9tA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ikaiddi|first=Uwana|date=May 19, 2017|title=How Cartoon Network\u2019s 'Steven Universe' Gets Diversity Right|url=https://studybreaks.com/culture/steven-universe/|accessdate=March 18, 2020|website=Study Breaks}}</ref> In ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', Steven proposes marriage to Connie; she turns him down because they are still teenagers, but this does not end their relationship.\n\n===Lars and Sadie===\nAt the beginning of the series, Lars Barriga (voiced by [[Matthew Moy]]) and Sadie Miller (voiced by [[Kate Micucci]]) are teenage employees at the Big Donut, a donut shop that Steven frequently visits. Lars is inconsiderate, irresponsible, and abrasive, but insecure and desperate to be accepted by those he considers to be the \"cool kids\". Sadie is friendly and shy, but has difficulty asserting herself and tends to try and fix Lars' issues for him. Despite Lars's negative attitude, Steven considers Lars to be a close friend, and Sadie [[puppy love|has a crush on him]]. Lars and Sadie's intermittently affectionate and antagonistic relationship is a recurring focus of episodes in which both characters feature. Matthew Moy has stated that Lars is one of his favorite acting roles, and has described his character as a \"complicated fellow\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheMoyWonder/status/619618547291938816|title=The ridiculous screaming.

He's a complicated fellow|author=Matthew Moy|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> According to [[Rebecca Sugar]], Lars and Sadie are based upon characters she created while in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|author=Rebecca Sugar|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|website=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author-link=Rebecca Sugar}}</ref> They appeared in both the [[television pilot|pilot]] episode of ''Steven Universe'' and the first episode of the series proper; they are the only characters other than the Crystal Gems to have speaking roles in those episodes.\n\nLars is prominently featured at the end of season 4 and beginning of season 5, during which he is abducted and taken to the Gem Homeworld with Steven; his character arc in these episodes focuses on him learning to overcome his fear of embarrassing himself and being perceived as inadequate. This storyline culminates when he is killed defending Steven and others from Homeworld security robots and then revived by Steven's healing powers. When revived, Lars's body has turned pink, and he manifests magical properties, including the ability for Steven to teleport to a pocket dimension via his hair. With his newfound confidence, Lars becomes the leader of a band of fugitive Gems and captain of a stolen spaceship. At the same time, Sadie, left behind on Earth, develops the self-confidence to quit her job at the Big Donut and form a [[horror rock]] band with the \"cool kids\", \"Sadie Killer and the Suspects\". The story arc of Lars and Sadie's relationship concludes with their final appearance in ''Steven Universe Future'', which depicts the characters acknowledging that they have grown apart and moved on from each other.\n\n===Rose Quartz===\nThe original leader of the Crystal Gems, Rose Quartz (voiced by [[Susan Egan]]) is Steven's mother, who \"gave up her physical form\" to allow Steven to be born. Her gem is located in her abdomen. Although she appears only in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, her legacy and her absence define the lives and relationships of the other main characters. She led the ancient rebellion against the Gem homeworld, and the Crystal Gems describe her to Steven as loving and seeing beauty in all forms of life. Flashback episodes show the development of her relationship with Greg from infatuation into love and understanding, and eventually her earlier history as well. Steven initially feels great pressure to live up to her example as a compassionate leader, but his relationship with her memory becomes complicated at the end of the third season when he learns of morally questionable actions that she undertook during the war. \"Lion 3: Straight to Video\", the first episode in which she appeared (via a videotaped message to Steven), was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|Emmy Award for short-form animation]].\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[A Single Pale Rose]]\", Rose Quartz is revealed to have originally been [[#Great Diamond Authority|Pink Diamond]], the Gem leader overseeing the Gem colonization of the planet Earth. Originally immature and believing herself undervalued by the other Diamonds, she was made miserable by the strict expectations placed on her by her status as a Diamond. She created the alternate identity of Rose Quartz to alleviate her boredom while running the colonization of Earth, and ended up falling in love with the diversity of the planet's life and the possibilities that came with it. Unable to protect the life on Earth any other way, she used her new alternate identity to lead the rebellion to protect the planet, and eventually faked her own assassination to break free from her former life.\n\n===Lapis Lazuli===\nLapis Lazuli (voiced by [[Jennifer Paz]]) is a Gem who was trapped in a magical mirror on Earth for thousands of years. When the mirror is given to Steven in the first-season episode \u201cMirror Gem\u201d, she befriends him, but initially mistrusts the other Crystal Gems and attacks them when Steven frees her. As the first sentient Gem other than the Crystal Gems to appear in the series, Lapis's appearance sets the stage for deeper plot developments; the show\u2019s writers cite it as \"really the beginning of the show\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joethejohnston.tumblr.com/post/98475763276/um-so-for-obvious-reasons-i-couldnt-post-the|title=joe the johnston|website=joe the johnston}}</ref> In \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\", the first-season finale, she prevents the Homeworld Gem Jasper from attacking the Crystal Gems by [[#Fusions|fusing]] with her and imprisoning themselves at the bottom of the ocean. After being freed in the third season premiere, she forms a close relationship with Peridot and comes to accept living on Earth. Her character arc in her intermittent appearances thereafter involves her slow recovery from the [[psychological trauma]] of having been imprisoned and being part of an abusive fusion, and coping with the fear of being victimized again. Late in the fifth season, she joins the Crystal Gems to fight Blue Diamond. She has powerful [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] control over water and can produce wings made of water from the [[lapis lazuli]] gemstone on her back.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=75}}\n\n===Peridot===\nAt her introduction late in the first season, Peridot (voiced by [[Shelby Rabara]]) is a technician dispatched by the Gem Homeworld to check on remaining Gem installations on Earth; her appearance becomes an ominous sign that the Crystal Gems are under threat from Homeworld. Stranded on Earth after the events of [[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|the first-season finale]], Peridot becomes a recurring antagonist in the first half of the second season before being eventually captured and convinced to ally with the Crystal Gems to defuse the [[#The Cluster|Cluster]]. When the Crystal Gems first encounter her she wears technological \"limb enhancers\", which give her a fearsome and robotic appearance; after she is captured, she loses them and appears much shorter and weaker without them. She plays a prominent role in the last part of the second season, during which her character arc centers around her learning to outgrow Homeworld\u2019s hierarchical, utilitarian mindset and to appreciate the value of friendship, individuality, and life on Earth. She eventually declares herself a member of the Crystal Gems and forms a close relationship with Lapis Lazuli. She is stubborn and self-aggrandizing in demeanor, but demonstrates willingness to learn from her mistakes and to treat others with greater respect and kindness. Her gemstone is a triangular [[peridot]] on her forehead,{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=76}} and she discovers in the third season that she can [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] control metal objects.\n\n===Jasper===\nIntroduced at the end of the first season, Jasper (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]]) is a powerful Quartz warrior serving Homeworld and a renowned veteran of their ancient war against the Crystal Gems. Her gemstone is a yellow [[jasper]] in the place of her nose, and her Gem weapon is a heavy [[helmet]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=77}} A subordinate of Pink Diamond created on Earth, she bears a long-standing grudge against the planet and Rose Quartz for Pink's purported destruction. She is openly contemptuous of those she perceives as weak or defective and is \"determined to never be weak or vulnerable\" herself.<ref>http://www.thewrap.com/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-talks-lgbt-themes-teases-season-3/</ref> Jasper serves as the principal antagonist in the second half of the third season; as a perfectly formed Quartz warrior, she becomes the target of Amethyst's resentment and desire to prove herself. She ends up [[#Fusions|fusing]] with a corrupted Gem monster in an attempt to defeat the Crystal Gems, becomes corrupted herself, and is neutralized and captured, until the corrupted Gems are healed in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the series finale]]. ''Steven Universe Future'' reveals a defeated and resentful Jasper living in self-imposed exile in the woods; she is shattered in a rematch with Steven, and swears loyalty to him after he manages to repair her gemstone.\n\n===Bismuth===\nThe Crystal Gems' weaponsmith during the ancient rebellion, Bismuth (voiced first by [[Uzo Aduba]] and later by Miriam Hyman) is passionately devoted to overthrowing the hierarchical structure of Gem society and grateful to Rose Quartz for showing her that an alternative existed. However, her radicalism led to a dispute with Rose over the use of a weapon designed to permanently destroy enemy Gems, leading Rose to bubble her gem and hide her fate from the other Crystal Gems. In the show's special [[Bismuth (Steven Universe)|hundredth episode]], Steven accidentally frees Bismuth and befriends her, but is later forced to bubble her again when the same conflict repeats itself. Steven later frees Bismuth again in the fifth season so she can attend Ruby and Sapphire's wedding; upon her release, she comes to understand Rose's choices after learning of her true identity as Pink Diamond.\n\nAduba's guest performance in Bismuth's debut episode, and Bismuth's portrayal as a sympathetic character whose complex disagreement with Steven had no easy answers, won praise from critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/100th-episode-steven-universe-means-bismuth-240483|author=Eric Thurm|title=The 100th episode of Steven Universe means \"Bismuth\"|website=The A.V.

The first two Diamonds introduced in the series are the vindictive, impatient, and disdainful Yellow Diamond (voiced by [[Patti LuPone]]) and the depressive and sentimental Blue Diamond (voiced by [[Lisa Hannigan]]). Yellow and Blue, despite their different approaches, are both motivated to destroy Earth by their mutual grief and guilt over [[#Rose Quartz|Pink Diamond]]'s death, before finally learning late in the fifth season that her demise was faked. Yellow and Blue themselves are intimidated by their superior White Diamond (voiced by [[Christine Ebersole]]), a passive-aggressive, condescending,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.themarysue.com/lets-talk-about-white-diamond-in-steven-universe/ |title = Let's Talk About White Diamond in Steven Universe}}</ref> and narcissistic perfectionist who sees all other Gems as flawed reflections of herself and possesses the ability to turn other Gems into colorless puppet thralls she can act through. It is her vision of complete perfection attained through strictly-enforced standards that shaped the Gem empire into its current state, at the cost of making her subjects miserable, including Pink. The Diamonds' relationships are portrayed as those of an abusive and controlling family, and it was this dynamic that would drive Pink away to become Rose Quartz and rebel against and eventually abandon them. In the [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|fifth-season finale]], the Diamonds are eventually persuaded by Steven to attempt to fix their mistakes rather than ignore them or project them onto others.\n\n===Lion===\nLion (animal noises by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is Steven's mysterious pink pet [[lion]] who possesses a variety of magical abilities. Lion provides Steven with connections to Rose Quartz's legacy\u2014he brings Steven and Connie to Rose's secret armory, and a number of Rose's keepsakes are stored in a pocket dimension accessible via his mane, including her sword and a videotaped message to Steven. He is introduced in the episode \"Steven's Lion\" early in the first season, in which he appears mysteriously in the desert and follows Steven home. In season 5, it is implied that Lion was originally an ordinary lion, and, like Lars, developed his magical nature after dying and then being resurrected by Rose Quartz. In the same season, after Lars's resurrection, Lars's hair becomes another portal to the pocket dimension.\n\n===Spinel===\n\nThe antagonist of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', Spinel (voiced by [[Sarah Stiles]]) was created to be Pink Diamond's playmate on Homeworld, but was left behind when Pink took charge of the Gem colonization of Earth. Spinel is furious that Pink abandoned her, made new friends, and ended her life without ever returning for her; in revenge, she tries to kill Steven and destroy life on Earth. Steven manages to convince her to let go of her revenge and live with the Diamonds. She is drawn in a [[rubber hose animation|\"rubber-hose\" style]] characteristic of 1930s animation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/steven-universe-creator-breaks-down-232704870.html|first=Andy|last=Swift|website=Yahoo!

According to critic Sara Goodwin, one of the great strengths of ''Steven Universe'' is the depth of development it gives to its \"normal human being\" characters and how the superpowered characters are affected by them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-importance-of-human-beings-in-steven-universe/|author=Sara Goodwin|title=Connie, Sadie, and the Importance of Human Beings in Steven Universe|website=The Mary Sue|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRecurring human characters include:\n* Buck Dewey (Lamar Abrams), Jenny Pizza ([[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]), and Sour Cream ([[Brian Posehn]]): the \"Cool Kids\", three older teenagers who become friendly with Steven, and whose friendship Lars seeks.

Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Ruby and Sapphire|Ruby]], a squad of five gullible but ruthless Rubies, sent by Yellow Diamond to retrieve Jasper, appear as recurring characters beginning in the third season. Steven nicknames the quintet according to the location of their gems: the rookie Leggy, the cheerful Navy, the violent Army, the veteran Eyeball, and the leader Doc. In the sequel series ''Steven Universe Future'', Eyeball partners with Aquamarine to get revenge on Steven. Yi's performance of their diverse personalities has drawn praise from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-recap-hit-the-diamond/|author=Vrai Kaiser|title=Steven Universe Recap: \"Hit the Diamond\"|website=The Mary Sue|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pearls===\nPearls (all voiced by [[Deedee Magno Hall]]) are a type of Gem who act as servants to high-ranking Gems on Homeworld. Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Pearl|Pearl]], Pearls belonging to the other Diamonds have appeared. The docile and artistic blue Pearl and the prideful yellow Pearl serve as attendants to their respective Diamonds. Another Pearl, later nicknamed \"Volleyball\", preceded Pearl as Pink Diamond's servant before spending millennia under White Diamond's control. She has a scar over her left eye, caused by trauma from accidentally being hit by the force of Pink Diamond's power.\n\n===The Off-Colors===\nA group of fugitive Gems from Homeworld, first appearing in season 5, who lived in hiding underground because they are regarded as defective or do not conform to Homeworld's expectations. They are the Rutile [[Crystal twinning|Twins]] (voiced by [[Ashly Burch]]), a Gem with two conjoined bodies from the waist up; Fluorite (voiced by [[Fisher (band)|Kathy Fisher]]), a huge caterpillar-like [[#Fusions|fusion]] of six Gems; Padparadscha (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]]), a Sapphire whose defective \"future vision\" can only predict the recent past; and Rhodonite (voiced by [[Enuka Okuma]]), an anxious \"star-crossed\" fusion of a Ruby and a Pearl. Under Lars's leadership, they steal a spaceship and flee Homeworld.\n\n===Nephrite===\nNephrite (voiced by [[Aparna Nancherla]]) was an officer of the Homeworld army who was left behind on Earth when the Homeworld Gems abandoned the planet, and became corrupted by the Diamonds' attack. She appears in her corrupted form as Centipeetle (vocal effects by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]), an acid-spitting, [[centipede]]-like monster that the Crystal Gems fight and capture in a bubble in the series premiere \"Gem Glow\". In the first-season episode \"Monster Buddies\", Steven frees her from her bubble, causing her to assume a diminutive form, and befriends her. In the third-season episode \"Monster Reunion\", he partially and temporarily heals her corruption and learns her history. At the end of the fifth season, she and other corrupted Gems are successfully healed with the help of the Diamonds.\n\n===Holly Blue Agate===\nHolly (voiced by [[Christine Pedi]]) is the supervisor of Pink Diamond's human zoo; she is abusive and dismissive to her Quartz subordinates. In the epilogue series ''Steven Universe Future'', the loss of her status and power has left her flustered and confused.\n\n===Aquamarine===\nAquamarine (voiced by [[Della Saba]]) is a Gem sent by Homeworld to capture humans from Earth at the end of the fourth season; she ends up apprehending Steven .<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Zach|title=''Steven Universe'' Finds His Destiny\u2026 By Losing His Self|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/steven-universe-finds-his-destiny-by-losing-his-se.html|accessdate=September 6, 2017|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Her childlike, innocent appearance contrasts with her ruthless and sadistic personality; Steven describes her as \"awful, small, and mean\". In ''Steven Universe Future'', Aquamarine partners with Eyeball Ruby to get revenge on Steven for indirectly ruining their careers. The duo's mutual hate for Steven allows them to fuse into Bluebird Azurite (voiced by [[Larissa Gallagher]]).\n\n===Topaz===\nTopaz (voiced by [[Martha Higareda]]) is a fusion of two Topazes, acting as Aquamarine's enforcer, who imprisons captured humans by fusing around them. Although silent and menacing in her first appearance, she soon reveals a sentimental and sympathetic side.\n\n===The Cluster===\nThe Cluster is an artificial [[#Fusions|fusion]] embedded within the Earth after Homeworld's war against the Crystal Gems to destroy the planet. It is formed of millions of broken Gem shards, their minds shattered and desperate to feel whole. In the episode \"[[Gem Drill]]\", Steven helps its numerous components to find connection among themselves and eventually bubble itself to keep it from destroying Earth. In the episode \"[[Reunited (Steven Universe)|Reunited]]\", when it is reawakened by the Diamonds, it temporarily comes to the surface, takes the form of a giant arm, and fights Yellow Diamond's ship, revealing that it is in control of itself and now intends to protect the Earth.\n\n===Fusions===\nFusion is a process whereby two or more Gems combine their physical forms and minds to create a larger, more powerful individual who possesses all of the powers of their component Gems and more. Fusions are often able to combine their components' Gem weapons into a more powerful weapon. A strong bond between Gems is the primary driving force enabling them to form and maintain fusions. While the Gem Homeworld allows Gems of the same caste to fuse, usually for combat purposes, mixed-Gem fusions are considered offensive, and those that exist usually [[closeted|keep themselves from public knowledge]]. Same-Gem fusions form a larger version of their components' identical forms, but mixed-Gem fusions usually have extra body parts; for example, Garnet has three eyes and Opal has four arms. The concept of fusion is used by the show's writers for thematic purposes as a broad metaphor for a variety of types of intimacy and relationships.\n \nGarnet is listed above as a main character; other fusions involving major characters are listed here in order of appearance.\n\n* Opal (voiced by [[Aimee Mann]]): The fusion of Amethyst and Pearl, who first appears in the first-season episode \"[[Giant Woman]]\" as Steven's introduction to the concept of Gem fusion. Amethyst and Pearl rarely fuse, as their conflicting personalities make it difficult for them to achieve the necessary harmony to fuse. Opal can combine Pearl's spear and Amethyst's whip into a [[bow and arrow|bow]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=80\u201381}}\n* Sugilite (voiced by [[Nicki Minaj]]): The fusion of Garnet and Amethyst, introduced and featured prominently in the first-season episode \"[[Coach Steven]]\". In that episode, Sugilite's behavior is dangerously violent, as Amethyst and Garnet's personalities when fused together become more unrestrained and aggressive, making her unwilling to separate. She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Amethyst's whip into a giant [[flail (weapon)|flail]].\n* Alexandrite (voiced by [[Rita Rani Ahuja]]): The fusion of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, introduced in the first-season episode \"Fusion Cuisine\". She is formidable in battle due to her massive size, six arms, and flame breath, but confused and unstable when she attempts to socialize with Connie's parents. She appears in the mobile video game ''[[Steven Universe: Attack the Light!]]'' as a powerful combined-attack move.\n*[[Stevonnie]] (voiced by [[AJ Michalka]]): The fusion of Steven and Connie, and the first known instance of a human successfully participating in Gem fusion. Introduced in the first-season episode \"[[Alone Together (Steven Universe)|Alone Together]]\", Stevonnie has the appearance of a beautiful teenager of [[androgyny|indeterminate]] or [[nonbinary]] gender. The character has received critical acclaim both as a rare example of a nonbinary character and as a metaphor by which the writers explore themes of puberty and maturation, [[Consent#Sexual activity|consent]], and healthy communication.<ref name=vox>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9347303/steven-universe-cartoon-network-best|author=Caroline Framke|title=Steven Universe is the most delightful, sex-positive show on television|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/steven-universe-guidebook-spills-the-secrets-of-the-cry-1704470546|author=Meredith Woerner|title=Steven Universe Guidebook Spills The Secrets Of The Crystal Gems|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/14/8961119/what-a-childrens-show-can-teach-us-about-sex-and-healthy-relationships|author=Carli Velocci|title=What a children's show can teach us about sex and healthy relationships|website=Polygon|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Malachite (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]] and [[Jennifer Paz]]): The fusion of Jasper and Lapis Lazuli.

Though unstable, Malachite remains fused until eventually defeated by Alexandrite in [[Super Watermelon Island|the third-season premiere]]. In the third-season episode \"Alone at Sea\", in the aftermath of Malachite's separation, Malachite is used as a metaphor for an abusive relationship;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-and-lapis-lazuli-take-fraught-trip-240202|author=Eric Thurm|title=Steven Universe and Lapis Lazuli take a fraught trip through a 'ship|website=[[The A.V.

Her only fully formed appearance was in the flashback episode \u201cWe Need To Talk\u201d, where she took the form of an elegant dancer wearing a leotard and leggings and had no spoken lines. Rose and Pearl's first attempt to fuse, inspired by Garnet, was a turning point in the history of the Crystal Gem rebellion.\n** Rainbow Quartz 2.0 (voiced by Alastair James): The fusion of Pearl and Steven, who uses a parasol created from Pearl's spear and Steven's shield.

She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Pearl's spear into a giant [[sledgehammer]]. A major [[plot arc]] in the second season, advertised as the \"Week of Sardonyx\", deals with Pearl tricking Garnet into fusing for fabricated reasons, and the emotional consequences of that violation.\n* Smoky Quartz (voiced by [[Natasha Lyonne]]): The fusion of Steven and Amethyst. Smoky Quartz first appears in the third-season episode \"Earthlings\", formed during a moment of commiseration between Steven and Amethyst over their shared fears of not being able to live up to their potential. Smoky Quartz has a playful, self-effacing personality, and can combine Steven's shield and Amethyst's whip into a massive [[yo-yo]] that they use in combat.\n* Sunstone (voiced by Shoniqua Shandai): The fusion of Steven and Garnet, described by reviewer Eric Thurm as \"a loose parody of kid-friendly \u201980s action characters\".<ref name=\"thurmchangeyourmind\">{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/a-really-truly-epic-hourlong-steven-universe-nearly-sp-1831937101|title=A really, truly epic hourlong Steven Universe nearly spells the end of everything|first=Eric|last=Thurm|website=TV Club}}</ref> They can attach Steven's shield to Garnet's gauntlets to use as suction cups.\n* Obsidian: The fusion of Steven, Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet, a lava-skinned giant who first appeared in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the fifth-season finale]]. Obsidian can combine their components' weapons into the hilt of a giant sword, producing a blade from the magma in their second mouth. The original form of Obsidian, containing Rose Quartz rather than Steven, was the basis for the design of the Crystal Gems' temple.<ref name=\"thurmchangeyourmind\" />\n* Steg (voiced by [[Ted Leo]]): The fusion of Steven and Greg, appearing in ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''.\n* Mega Pearl (voiced by Deedee Magno Hall): The fusion of Pearl with \"Volleyball\", the pink Pearl who once served Pink Diamond.\n\n===Sentient plants===\n\n====Watermelon Stevens====\nThe Watermelon Stevens are living watermelons shaped like Steven, created in the first-season episode \"Watermelon Steven\" as a result of Steven's ability to create sentient plants. Soon after their creation, they go on a rampage in Beach City; after that, they leave Beach City and form a civilization on the remote Mask Island. They sometimes serve as vessels that Steven can project his mind into.\n\n====Pumpkin====\nPumpkin is a living pumpkin that behaves like a dog.

Rose is described as having \"given up her physical form to bring [Steven] into the world\" as the first Gem-human hybrid, and her gemstone is embedded in his navel.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=16}} At the beginning of the show's narrative, he is in his early teens, but appears younger due to the interaction of his Gem magic with his aging process. Steven is caring, protective, brave, gentle, forgiving, and eager to help the people he loves with their problems; his optimism is often a source of strength for the other Crystal Gems. His gemstone gives him a wide range of magical abilities; one of the long-term [[story arc]]s of the series is his progress in learning about and mastering these abilities, beginning in the first episode with his first successful attempt to summon his Gem weapon, a pink [[shield]]. Other long-lasting character arcs involving Steven include his anxiety about filling his mother's place in the Crystal Gems and coping with her complex legacy, and his developing friendship with his human best friend Connie.\n\nThe sequel series, ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', focuses on Steven's psychological state in the aftermath of the events of the main series. In ''Future'', Steven wrestles with feelings of purposelessness now that the battles he spent his early adolescence fighting are resolved, and copes with the lasting [[psychological trauma]] from the stress he experienced while fighting them.\n\n===Garnet===\n{{Main|Garnet (Steven Universe)}}\nThe disciplined current leader of the Crystal Gems, Garnet (voiced by [[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]) is quiet, stoic, pragmatic, and described by Steven as \"mysterious\", but over the course of the series she becomes more emotionally open, especially in expressing her love for Steven. According to the writers, her great self-confidence is reflected in the fact that she never asks questions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/sdcc2015-steven-universe-roundtable-interview/|publisher=Toonzone|title=SDCC2015: 'Steven Universe' Roundtable Interview|last=Glennon|first=Christopher|date=July 22, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> She possesses red [[garnet]]s in the palms of her hands, from which she summons her Gem weapon, a pair of heavy [[Gauntlet (glove)|gauntlets]]. She also has a [[precognition|precognitive]] ability she refers to as \"future vision\". Garnet has three eyes, over which she wears a [[visor]].\n\nIn the first-season finale \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\", it is revealed that Garnet is a [[#Fusions|fusion]] of two smaller Gems named Ruby and Sapphire. Garnet's existence is thus a personification of Ruby and Sapphire's loving relationship\u2014she describes herself as \"a conversation\" and \"made of love\"\u2014and her personality is a stable blending of Ruby and Sapphire's traits.

The second-season episode \"[[The Answer (Steven Universe)|The Answer]]\", a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] showing how Ruby and Sapphire met and formed Garnet for the first time, was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|an Emmy Award]] and adapted into a children's book.\n\n====Ruby and Sapphire====\nRuby (voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]) and Sapphire (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]])\u2014the two smaller Gems who are the components of Garnet\u2014first appeared in \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe episode)|Jail Break]]\".

Garnet's qualities are the result of a \"conversation\" between these two contrasting personalities. Near the end of the fifth season, after a period of questioning the basis of their relationship in the wake of revelations about Rose Quartz's past, Ruby and Sapphire recommit themselves to each other through marriage; critics described the characters' marriage as a milestone of progress in the history of queer representation in children's television.<ref name=\"Polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2018/7/5/17536202/steven-universe-heart-of-the-crystal-gems-the-question-same-sex-couple |title=Steven Universe honored a relationship and broke ground for LGBTQ culture |first=Petrana |last=Radulovic |work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |date=July 5, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"ew\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/ |title= ''Steven Universe'' shows a groundbreaking same-sex marriage proposal|last= Romano|first= Nick|date=5 July 2018 |publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date= 3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Amethyst===\n{{Main|Amethyst (Steven Universe)}}\nAmethyst (voiced by [[Michaela Dietz]]) is the shortest and youngest of the Crystal Gems other than Steven. Her mischievous sense of humor often provides [[comic relief]], and her fun-loving, childish nature bolsters her friendship with Steven. Her [[amethyst]] gemstone, from which she can summon a [[whip]], is located on her chest; she also makes frequent use of [[shapeshifting]] capabilities.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=38\u201341}} She was the last of the Gems created on Earth as part of the Gem Homeworld's \"Kindergarten\" project to convert Earth into a Gem-occupied world, and learns in the second season that she is smaller and weaker than other Gems of her type (the \"Quartz\" warrior caste).  Her rebellious and hedonistic personality covers for deep-seated feelings of inadequacy, resentment, and fear that the other Crystal Gems do not respect her, and a long-term [[character arc]] involves her learning to respect herself and her capabilities.\n\n===Pearl===\n{{Main|Pearl (Steven Universe)}}\nResembling a [[ballerina]] in her slender build, costume, and graceful style of movement, Pearl (voiced by [[Deedee Magno Hall]]) is a short-tempered, precise strategist and technician. Her gemstone is a white [[pearl]] in her forehead from which she can summon a [[spear]] and create holographic images.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=52\u201355}} She is the most motherly and protective toward Steven of the Gems. Pearl harbored a deep romantic devotion to Rose Quartz, leading to lasting [[grief]] over Rose's absence and [[jealousy]] over her relationship with Greg; major character arcs for Pearl include learning how to cope with and move beyond these emotions. On the Gem homeworld, pearls are \"made-to-order\" servants for high-ranking Gems, and the fifth season reveals that Pearl originally served Rose Quartz in Rose's original identity of Pink Diamond. Pearl has learned to move beyond her caste role as a fighter and technician, but still has difficulty learning to feel independent rather than subordinate.  Critical response to Pearl has largely appreciated her portrayal as a complex and sympathetic, yet flawed [[queer]] character.<ref name=\"Pink\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/07/17/comment-lots-of-childrens-programmes-already-have-lgbt-characters/|title=Comment: Lots of children's programmes already have LGBT characters|last=Payton|first=Naith|date=July 17, 2015|publisher=[[Pink News]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"MarySue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-and-fandom/|title=It's OK to Have Flaws (Except for You): ''Steven Universe'' and Fandom|last=Kaiser|first=Vrai|date=June 11, 2015|publisher=The Mary Sue|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Major supporting characters==\n===Greg Universe===\nSteven's father Greg (voiced by [[Tom Scharpling]]) is a former rock singer who now lives in his van and runs a car wash in Beach City. Although Steven lives with the Gems, Greg remains a constant presence in his life. Though he is often made uncomfortable by Gem magic, Greg is laid-back, accepting, and supportive of Steven's adventures; it is largely from Greg that Steven inherits his optimistic, empathetic temperament.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://player.fm/series/the-steven-universe-podcast/steven-universe-rebecca-sugar-ian-jones-quartey-zach-callison-grace-rolek-vol2ep1|title= The Steven Universe Podcast: Steven Universe |publisher=Cartoon Network |host= Mackenzie Atwood|date= 25 January 2018}}</ref> As a young adult, Greg ran away from his controlling family to become a traveling musician; the freedom and lack of structure he gave young Steven was a reaction against his own strict upbringing.\n\n===Connie Maheswaran===\nConnie (voiced by [[Grace Rolek]]) is Steven's best friend. Introduced as an intelligent yet lonely person in the episode \"Bubble Buddies\" early in the first season, she rapidly develops a close relationship with Steven. An avid reader of [[fantasy literature]], she admires what she calls Steven's \"magical destiny\" and is eager to be part of it. Her involvement in Gem adventures gradually increases over the course of the series; she inherits Rose Quartz's sword and is eventually accepted as a member of the Crystal Gems. Long-term character arcs involving Connie include her learning to see herself as Steven's equal despite not having magical abilities of her own, and to push back against her own overprotective parents. Some viewers have interpreted Steven and Connie's relationship as romantic or potentially romantic.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pladek|first=Brittany|date=Autumn 2016|title=''Steven Universe'' (review)|journal=Science Fiction Film and Television|volume=9|issue=3|pages=501\u2013504|access-date=March 18, 2020|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/641640/pdf?casa_token=ConHIP3lLrsAAAAA:OWCrgL412rdLMSsG4jMpdP1v06yVZR2a21ZG9GmqDGLlmS1zS5c9IAMPV7gnNkHZlYdwUfFy9tA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ikaiddi|first=Uwana|date=May 19, 2017|title=How Cartoon Network\u2019s 'Steven Universe' Gets Diversity Right|url=https://studybreaks.com/culture/steven-universe/|accessdate=March 18, 2020|website=Study Breaks}}</ref> In ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', Steven proposes marriage to Connie; she turns him down because they are still teenagers, but this does not end their relationship.\n\n===Lars and Sadie===\nAt the beginning of the series, Lars Barriga (voiced by [[Matthew Moy]]) and Sadie Miller (voiced by [[Kate Micucci]]) are teenage employees at the Big Donut, a donut shop that Steven frequently visits. Lars is inconsiderate, irresponsible, and abrasive, but insecure and desperate to be accepted by those he considers to be the \"cool kids\". Sadie is friendly and shy, but has difficulty asserting herself and tends to try and fix Lars' issues for him. Despite Lars's negative attitude, Steven considers Lars to be a close friend, and Sadie [[puppy love|has a crush on him]]. Lars and Sadie's intermittently affectionate and antagonistic relationship is a recurring focus of episodes in which both characters feature. Matthew Moy has stated that Lars is one of his favorite acting roles, and has described his character as a \"complicated fellow\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/TheMoyWonder/status/619618547291938816|title=The ridiculous screaming.

He's a complicated fellow|author=Matthew Moy|publisher=[[Twitter]]|date=July 10, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref> According to [[Rebecca Sugar]], Lars and Sadie are based upon characters she created while in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|author=Rebecca Sugar|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|website=[[Reddit]]|accessdate=September 6, 2017|author-link=Rebecca Sugar}}</ref> They appeared in both the [[television pilot|pilot]] episode of ''Steven Universe'' and the first episode of the series proper; they are the only characters other than the Crystal Gems to have speaking roles in those episodes.\n\nLars is prominently featured at the end of season 4 and beginning of season 5, during which he is abducted and taken to the Gem Homeworld with Steven; his character arc in these episodes focuses on him learning to overcome his fear of embarrassing himself and being perceived as inadequate. This storyline culminates when he is killed defending Steven and others from Homeworld security robots and then revived by Steven's healing powers. When revived, Lars's body has turned pink, and he manifests magical properties, including the ability for Steven to teleport to a pocket dimension via his hair. With his newfound confidence, Lars becomes the leader of a band of fugitive Gems and captain of a stolen spaceship. At the same time, Sadie, left behind on Earth, develops the self-confidence to quit her job at the Big Donut and form a [[horror rock]] band with the \"cool kids\", \"Sadie Killer and the Suspects\". The story arc of Lars and Sadie's relationship concludes with their final appearance in ''Steven Universe Future'', which depicts the characters acknowledging that they have grown apart and moved on from each other.\n\n===Rose Quartz===\nThe original leader of the Crystal Gems, Rose Quartz (voiced by [[Susan Egan]]) is Steven's mother, who \"gave up her physical form\" to allow Steven to be born. Her gem is located in her abdomen. Although she appears only in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, her legacy and her absence define the lives and relationships of the other main characters. She led the ancient rebellion against the Gem homeworld, and the Crystal Gems describe her to Steven as loving and seeing beauty in all forms of life. Flashback episodes show the development of her relationship with Greg from infatuation into love and understanding, and eventually her earlier history as well. Steven initially feels great pressure to live up to her example as a compassionate leader, but his relationship with her memory becomes complicated at the end of the third season when he learns of morally questionable actions that she undertook during the war. \"Lion 3: Straight to Video\", the first episode in which she appeared (via a videotaped message to Steven), was nominated for an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-Format Animation|Emmy Award for short-form animation]].\n\nIn the fifth-season episode \"[[A Single Pale Rose]]\", Rose Quartz is revealed to have originally been [[#Great Diamond Authority|Pink Diamond]], the Gem leader overseeing the Gem colonization of the planet Earth. Originally immature and believing herself undervalued by the other Diamonds, she was made miserable by the strict expectations placed on her by her status as a Diamond. She created the alternate identity of Rose Quartz to alleviate her boredom while running the colonization of Earth, and ended up falling in love with the diversity of the planet's life and the possibilities that came with it. Unable to protect the life on Earth any other way, she used her new alternate identity to lead the rebellion to protect the planet, and eventually faked her own assassination to break free from her former life.\n\n===Lapis Lazuli===\nLapis Lazuli (voiced by [[Jennifer Paz]]) is a Gem who was trapped in a magical mirror on Earth for thousands of years. When the mirror is given to Steven in the first-season episode \u201cMirror Gem\u201d, she befriends him, but initially mistrusts the other Crystal Gems and attacks them when Steven frees her. As the first sentient Gem other than the Crystal Gems to appear in the series, Lapis's appearance sets the stage for deeper plot developments; the show\u2019s writers cite it as \"really the beginning of the show\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://joethejohnston.tumblr.com/post/98475763276/um-so-for-obvious-reasons-i-couldnt-post-the|title=joe the johnston|website=joe the johnston}}</ref> In \"[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]\", the first-season finale, she prevents the Homeworld Gem Jasper from attacking the Crystal Gems by [[#Fusions|fusing]] with her and imprisoning themselves at the bottom of the ocean. After being freed in the third season premiere, she forms a close relationship with Peridot and comes to accept living on Earth. Her character arc in her intermittent appearances thereafter involves her slow recovery from the [[psychological trauma]] of having been imprisoned and being part of an abusive fusion, and coping with the fear of being victimized again. Late in the fifth season, she joins the Crystal Gems to fight Blue Diamond. She has powerful [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] control over water and can produce wings made of water from the [[lapis lazuli]] gemstone on her back.{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=75}}\n\n===Peridot===\nAt her introduction late in the first season, Peridot (voiced by [[Shelby Rabara]]) is a technician dispatched by the Gem Homeworld to check on remaining Gem installations on Earth; her appearance becomes an ominous sign that the Crystal Gems are under threat from Homeworld. Stranded on Earth after the events of [[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|the first-season finale]], Peridot becomes a recurring antagonist in the first half of the second season before being eventually captured and convinced to ally with the Crystal Gems to defuse the [[#The Cluster|Cluster]]. When the Crystal Gems first encounter her she wears technological \"limb enhancers\", which give her a fearsome and robotic appearance; after she is captured, she loses them and appears much shorter and weaker without them. She plays a prominent role in the last part of the second season, during which her character arc centers around her learning to outgrow Homeworld\u2019s hierarchical, utilitarian mindset and to appreciate the value of friendship, individuality, and life on Earth. She eventually declares herself a member of the Crystal Gems and forms a close relationship with Lapis Lazuli. She is stubborn and self-aggrandizing in demeanor, but demonstrates willingness to learn from her mistakes and to treat others with greater respect and kindness. Her gemstone is a triangular [[peridot]] on her forehead,{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=76}} and she discovers in the third season that she can [[telekinesis|telekinetically]] control metal objects.\n\n===Jasper===\nIntroduced at the end of the first season, Jasper (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]]) is a powerful Quartz warrior serving Homeworld and a renowned veteran of their ancient war against the Crystal Gems. Her gemstone is a yellow [[jasper]] in the place of her nose, and her Gem weapon is a heavy [[helmet]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|p=77}} A subordinate of Pink Diamond created on Earth, she bears a long-standing grudge against the planet and Rose Quartz for Pink's purported destruction. She is openly contemptuous of those she perceives as weak or defective and is \"determined to never be weak or vulnerable\" herself.<ref>http://www.thewrap.com/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-talks-lgbt-themes-teases-season-3/</ref> Jasper serves as the principal antagonist in the second half of the third season; as a perfectly formed Quartz warrior, she becomes the target of Amethyst's resentment and desire to prove herself. She ends up [[#Fusions|fusing]] with a corrupted Gem monster in an attempt to defeat the Crystal Gems, becomes corrupted herself, and is neutralized and captured, until the corrupted Gems are healed in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the series finale]]. ''Steven Universe Future'' reveals a defeated and resentful Jasper living in self-imposed exile in the woods; she is shattered in a rematch with Steven, and swears loyalty to him after he manages to repair her gemstone.\n\n===Bismuth===\nThe Crystal Gems' weaponsmith during the ancient rebellion, Bismuth (voiced first by [[Uzo Aduba]] and later by Miriam Hyman) is passionately devoted to overthrowing the hierarchical structure of Gem society and grateful to Rose Quartz for showing her that an alternative existed. However, her radicalism led to a dispute with Rose over the use of a weapon designed to permanently destroy enemy Gems, leading Rose to bubble her gem and hide her fate from the other Crystal Gems. In the show's special [[Bismuth (Steven Universe)|hundredth episode]], Steven accidentally frees Bismuth and befriends her, but is later forced to bubble her again when the same conflict repeats itself. Steven later frees Bismuth again in the fifth season so she can attend Ruby and Sapphire's wedding; upon her release, she comes to understand Rose's choices after learning of her true identity as Pink Diamond.\n\nAduba's guest performance in Bismuth's debut episode, and Bismuth's portrayal as a sympathetic character whose complex disagreement with Steven had no easy answers, won praise from critics,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/100th-episode-steven-universe-means-bismuth-240483|author=Eric Thurm|title=The 100th episode of Steven Universe means \"Bismuth\"|website=The A.V.

The first two Diamonds introduced in the series are the vindictive, impatient, and disdainful Yellow Diamond (voiced by [[Patti LuPone]]) and the depressive and sentimental Blue Diamond (voiced by [[Lisa Hannigan]]). Yellow and Blue, despite their different approaches, are both motivated to destroy Earth by their mutual grief and guilt over [[#Rose Quartz|Pink Diamond]]'s death, before finally learning late in the fifth season that her demise was faked. Yellow and Blue themselves are intimidated by their superior White Diamond (voiced by [[Christine Ebersole]]), a passive-aggressive, condescending,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.themarysue.com/lets-talk-about-white-diamond-in-steven-universe/ |title = Let's Talk About White Diamond in Steven Universe}}</ref> and narcissistic perfectionist who sees all other Gems as flawed reflections of herself and possesses the ability to turn other Gems into colorless puppet thralls she can act through. It is her vision of complete perfection attained through strictly-enforced standards that shaped the Gem empire into its current state, at the cost of making her subjects miserable, including Pink. The Diamonds' relationships are portrayed as those of an abusive and controlling family, and it was this dynamic that would drive Pink away to become Rose Quartz and rebel against and eventually abandon them. In the [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|fifth-season finale]], the Diamonds are eventually persuaded by Steven to attempt to fix their mistakes rather than ignore them or project them onto others.\n\n===Lion===\nLion (animal noises by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]) is Steven's mysterious pink pet [[lion]] who possesses a variety of magical abilities. Lion provides Steven with connections to Rose Quartz's legacy\u2014he brings Steven and Connie to Rose's secret armory, and a number of Rose's keepsakes are stored in a pocket dimension accessible via his mane, including her sword and a videotaped message to Steven. He is introduced in the episode \"Steven's Lion\" early in the first season, in which he appears mysteriously in the desert and follows Steven home. In season 5, it is implied that Lion was originally an ordinary lion, and, like Lars, developed his magical nature after dying and then being resurrected by Rose Quartz. In the same season, after Lars's resurrection, Lars's hair becomes another portal to the pocket dimension.\n\n===Spinel===\n\nThe antagonist of ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'', Spinel (voiced by [[Sarah Stiles]]) was created to be Pink Diamond's playmate on Homeworld, but was left behind when Pink took charge of the Gem colonization of Earth. Spinel is furious that Pink abandoned her, made new friends, and ended her life without ever returning for her; in revenge, she tries to kill Steven and destroy life on Earth. Steven manages to convince her to let go of her revenge and live with the Diamonds. She is drawn in a [[rubber hose animation|\"rubber-hose\" style]] characteristic of 1930s animation<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/steven-universe-creator-breaks-down-232704870.html|first=Andy|last=Swift|website=Yahoo!

According to critic Sara Goodwin, one of the great strengths of ''Steven Universe'' is the depth of development it gives to its \"normal human being\" characters and how the superpowered characters are affected by them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/the-importance-of-human-beings-in-steven-universe/|author=Sara Goodwin|title=Connie, Sadie, and the Importance of Human Beings in Steven Universe|website=The Mary Sue|date=August 16, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRecurring human characters include:\n* Buck Dewey (Lamar Abrams), Jenny Pizza ([[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]), and Sour Cream ([[Brian Posehn]]): the \"Cool Kids\", three older teenagers who become friendly with Steven, and whose friendship Lars seeks. They form the band \"Sadie Killer and the Suspects\" with Sadie in Season 5, but go their separate ways to pursue their individual interests in ''Steven Universe Future''. \n* Onion ([[Zach Callison]]): Sour Cream's younger half-brother, whose odd and destructive unsupervised behavior other characters often find disturbing. Onion does not speak, but Zach Callison voices his occasional mumbling noises.\n* Ronaldo Fryman (Zach Steel): A [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]] blogger who occasionally attempts to investigate the paranormal events caused by the Gems. His blog, \"Keep Beach City Weird\", was maintained in-character on [[Tumblr]] by ''Steven Universe'' writers.\n* Peedee Fryman ([[Atticus Shaffer]]): Ronaldo's cynical and world-weary younger brother.\n* Mr. Fryman (Billy Merritt): Ronaldo and Peedee's father, and the proprietor of the French-fry stand \"Beach Citywalk Fries.\"\n* Kiki Pizza ([[Reagan Gomez-Preston]]):  Jenny's hard-working twin sister.\n* Kofi Pizza ([[Godfrey (comedian)|Godfrey]]): Jenny and Kiki's temperamental father, who owns the family's pizza parlor, \"Fish Stew Pizza.\"\n* Nanefua Pizza ([[Toks Olagundoye]]): Kofi's mother. ''Steven Universe'' animator/director [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] based Nanefua on his grandmother, noted Ghanaian stateswoman [[Theodosia Okoh]].<ref>[http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/117553383444/sociologist-gh-designer-of-ghanas-national], IAN JQ dot com, 27 April 2015.</ref> In the fifth season, Nanefua is elected mayor of Beach City.\n* Bill Dewey ([[Joel Hodgson]]): Buck's father, the approval-seeking mayor of Beach City. In the fifth season, after Nanefua Pizza becomes the new mayor of Beach City, he gets a job at the Big Donut.\n* Priyanka Maheswaran ([[Mary Elizabeth McGlynn]]) and Doug Maheswaran ([[Crispin Freeman]]): Connie's strict and overprotective parents.

Vidalia, an artist, is also Sour Cream's mother, and an old friend of Amethyst and Greg; her husband Yellowtail is a fisherman. Like Onion, Yellowtail does not speak intelligibly; Tom Scharpling voices his occasional mumbling noises.\n* Marty ([[Jon Wurster]]): Greg's greedy and manipulative former manager, and Sour Cream's estranged father.\n* Jamie ([[Eugene Cordero]]): A postman and aspiring actor.\n* Barb Miller ([[Kate Flannery]]): Sadie's energetic and strong-willed mother, who works as a postal carrier.\n* Kevin ([[Andrew Kishino]]): An arrogant teenager who makes unwelcome advances on Stevonnie.\n* Andy DeMayo ([[Dave Willis]]): Greg's cousin, a biplane pilot who is initially uncomfortable with Greg and Steven's unconventional lifestyle and regretful of how his family has grown apart. His late parents owned the barn where Lapis and Peridot take up residence.\n* Dante Barriga ([[Matthew Moy]]) and Martha Barriga ([[Nancy Linari]]): Lars's parents.\n\n===Ruby squad===\nRubies (all voiced by [[Charlyne Yi]]) are a variety of Gem who act as foot soldiers and bodyguards on Homeworld. Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Ruby and Sapphire|Ruby]], a squad of five gullible but ruthless Rubies, sent by Yellow Diamond to retrieve Jasper, appear as recurring characters beginning in the third season. Steven nicknames the quintet according to the location of their gems: the rookie Leggy, the cheerful Navy, the violent Army, the veteran Eyeball, and the leader Doc. In the sequel series ''Steven Universe Future'', Eyeball partners with Aquamarine to get revenge on Steven. Yi's performance of their diverse personalities has drawn praise from critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-recap-hit-the-diamond/|author=Vrai Kaiser|title=Steven Universe Recap: \"Hit the Diamond\"|website=The Mary Sue|date=June 3, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Pearls===\nPearls (all voiced by [[Deedee Magno Hall]]) are a type of Gem who act as servants to high-ranking Gems on Homeworld. Aside from the Crystal Gems' [[#Pearl|Pearl]], Pearls belonging to the other Diamonds have appeared. The docile and artistic blue Pearl and the prideful yellow Pearl serve as attendants to their respective Diamonds. Another Pearl, later nicknamed \"Volleyball\", preceded Pearl as Pink Diamond's servant before spending millennia under White Diamond's control. She has a scar over her left eye, caused by trauma from accidentally being hit by the force of Pink Diamond's power.\n\n===The Off-Colors===\nA group of fugitive Gems from Homeworld, first appearing in season 5, who lived in hiding underground because they are regarded as defective or do not conform to Homeworld's expectations. They are the Rutile [[Crystal twinning|Twins]] (voiced by [[Ashly Burch]]), a Gem with two conjoined bodies from the waist up; Fluorite (voiced by [[Fisher (band)|Kathy Fisher]]), a huge caterpillar-like [[#Fusions|fusion]] of six Gems; Padparadscha (voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]]), a Sapphire whose defective \"future vision\" can only predict the recent past; and Rhodonite (voiced by [[Enuka Okuma]]), an anxious \"star-crossed\" fusion of a Ruby and a Pearl. Under Lars's leadership, they steal a spaceship and flee Homeworld.\n\n===Nephrite===\nNephrite (voiced by [[Aparna Nancherla]]) was an officer of the Homeworld army who was left behind on Earth when the Homeworld Gems abandoned the planet, and became corrupted by the Diamonds' attack. She appears in her corrupted form as Centipeetle (vocal effects by [[Dee Bradley Baker]]), an acid-spitting, [[centipede]]-like monster that the Crystal Gems fight and capture in a bubble in the series premiere \"Gem Glow\". In the first-season episode \"Monster Buddies\", Steven frees her from her bubble, causing her to assume a diminutive form, and befriends her. In the third-season episode \"Monster Reunion\", he partially and temporarily heals her corruption and learns her history. At the end of the fifth season, she and other corrupted Gems are successfully healed with the help of the Diamonds.\n\n===Holly Blue Agate===\nHolly (voiced by [[Christine Pedi]]) is the supervisor of Pink Diamond's human zoo; she is abusive and dismissive to her Quartz subordinates. In the epilogue series ''Steven Universe Future'', the loss of her status and power has left her flustered and confused.\n\n===Aquamarine===\nAquamarine (voiced by [[Della Saba]]) is a Gem sent by Homeworld to capture humans from Earth at the end of the fourth season; she ends up apprehending Steven .<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Zach|title=''Steven Universe'' Finds His Destiny\u2026 By Losing His Self|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/05/steven-universe-finds-his-destiny-by-losing-his-se.html|accessdate=September 6, 2017|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Her childlike, innocent appearance contrasts with her ruthless and sadistic personality; Steven describes her as \"awful, small, and mean\". In ''Steven Universe Future'', Aquamarine partners with Eyeball Ruby to get revenge on Steven for indirectly ruining their careers. The duo's mutual hate for Steven allows them to fuse into Bluebird Azurite (voiced by [[Larissa Gallagher]]).\n\n===Topaz===\nTopaz (voiced by [[Martha Higareda]]) is a fusion of two Topazes, acting as Aquamarine's enforcer, who imprisons captured humans by fusing around them. Although silent and menacing in her first appearance, she soon reveals a sentimental and sympathetic side.\n\n===The Cluster===\nThe Cluster is an artificial [[#Fusions|fusion]] embedded within the Earth after Homeworld's war against the Crystal Gems to destroy the planet. It is formed of millions of broken Gem shards, their minds shattered and desperate to feel whole. In the episode \"[[Gem Drill]]\", Steven helps its numerous components to find connection among themselves and eventually bubble itself to keep it from destroying Earth. In the episode \"[[Reunited (Steven Universe)|Reunited]]\", when it is reawakened by the Diamonds, it temporarily comes to the surface, takes the form of a giant arm, and fights Yellow Diamond's ship, revealing that it is in control of itself and now intends to protect the Earth.\n\n===Fusions===\nFusion is a process whereby two or more Gems combine their physical forms and minds to create a larger, more powerful individual who possesses all of the powers of their component Gems and more. Fusions are often able to combine their components' Gem weapons into a more powerful weapon. A strong bond between Gems is the primary driving force enabling them to form and maintain fusions. While the Gem Homeworld allows Gems of the same caste to fuse, usually for combat purposes, mixed-Gem fusions are considered offensive, and those that exist usually [[closeted|keep themselves from public knowledge]]. Same-Gem fusions form a larger version of their components' identical forms, but mixed-Gem fusions usually have extra body parts; for example, Garnet has three eyes and Opal has four arms. The concept of fusion is used by the show's writers for thematic purposes as a broad metaphor for a variety of types of intimacy and relationships.\n \nGarnet is listed above as a main character; other fusions involving major characters are listed here in order of appearance.\n\n* Opal (voiced by [[Aimee Mann]]): The fusion of Amethyst and Pearl, who first appears in the first-season episode \"[[Giant Woman]]\" as Steven's introduction to the concept of Gem fusion. Amethyst and Pearl rarely fuse, as their conflicting personalities make it difficult for them to achieve the necessary harmony to fuse. Opal can combine Pearl's spear and Amethyst's whip into a [[bow and arrow|bow]].{{sfn|Sugar|2015|pp=80\u201381}}\n* Sugilite (voiced by [[Nicki Minaj]]): The fusion of Garnet and Amethyst, introduced and featured prominently in the first-season episode \"[[Coach Steven]]\". In that episode, Sugilite's behavior is dangerously violent, as Amethyst and Garnet's personalities when fused together become more unrestrained and aggressive, making her unwilling to separate. She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Amethyst's whip into a giant [[flail (weapon)|flail]].\n* Alexandrite (voiced by [[Rita Rani Ahuja]]): The fusion of Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, introduced in the first-season episode \"Fusion Cuisine\". She is formidable in battle due to her massive size, six arms, and flame breath, but confused and unstable when she attempts to socialize with Connie's parents. She appears in the mobile video game ''[[Steven Universe: Attack the Light!]]'' as a powerful combined-attack move.\n*[[Stevonnie]] (voiced by [[AJ Michalka]]): The fusion of Steven and Connie, and the first known instance of a human successfully participating in Gem fusion. Introduced in the first-season episode \"[[Alone Together (Steven Universe)|Alone Together]]\", Stevonnie has the appearance of a beautiful teenager of [[androgyny|indeterminate]] or [[nonbinary]] gender. The character has received critical acclaim both as a rare example of a nonbinary character and as a metaphor by which the writers explore themes of puberty and maturation, [[Consent#Sexual activity|consent]], and healthy communication.<ref name=vox>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/9/17/9347303/steven-universe-cartoon-network-best|author=Caroline Framke|title=Steven Universe is the most delightful, sex-positive show on television|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/steven-universe-guidebook-spills-the-secrets-of-the-cry-1704470546|author=Meredith Woerner|title=Steven Universe Guidebook Spills The Secrets Of The Crystal Gems|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/14/8961119/what-a-childrens-show-can-teach-us-about-sex-and-healthy-relationships|author=Carli Velocci|title=What a children's show can teach us about sex and healthy relationships|website=Polygon|date=July 14, 2015|accessdate=September 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Malachite (voiced by [[Kimberly Brooks]] and [[Jennifer Paz]]): The fusion of Jasper and Lapis Lazuli.

Her only fully formed appearance was in the flashback episode \u201cWe Need To Talk\u201d, where she took the form of an elegant dancer wearing a leotard and leggings and had no spoken lines. Rose and Pearl's first attempt to fuse, inspired by Garnet, was a turning point in the history of the Crystal Gem rebellion.\n** Rainbow Quartz 2.0 (voiced by Alastair James): The fusion of Pearl and Steven, who uses a parasol created from Pearl's spear and Steven's shield. Their design and characterization resembles a combination of [[Mary Poppins (character)|Mary Poppins]] and [[Bert (Mary Poppins)|Bert]] from the film ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]''.<ref>{{cite podcast|url=https://player.fm/series/the-steven-universe-podcast/battle-of-heart-and-mind-with-rebecca-sugar-ian-jq-kat-morris-joe-johnston-ben-levin-and-matt-burnett|title= The Steven Universe Podcast: Battle of Heart and Mind|publisher=Cartoon Network |host= Mackenzie Atwood|date= 24 January 2019}}</ref>\n* Sardonyx (voiced by [[Alexia Khadime]]): The fusion of Garnet and Pearl, who has the personality of an elegant and attention-seeking entertainer. She can combine Garnet's gauntlets and Pearl's spear into a giant [[sledgehammer]]. A major [[plot arc]] in the second season, advertised as the \"Week of Sardonyx\", deals with Pearl tricking Garnet into fusing for fabricated reasons, and the emotional consequences of that violation.\n* Smoky Quartz (voiced by [[Natasha Lyonne]]): The fusion of Steven and Amethyst. Smoky Quartz first appears in the third-season episode \"Earthlings\", formed during a moment of commiseration between Steven and Amethyst over their shared fears of not being able to live up to their potential. Smoky Quartz has a playful, self-effacing personality, and can combine Steven's shield and Amethyst's whip into a massive [[yo-yo]] that they use in combat.\n* Sunstone (voiced by Shoniqua Shandai): The fusion of Steven and Garnet, described by reviewer Eric Thurm as \"a loose parody of kid-friendly \u201980s action characters\".<ref name=\"thurmchangeyourmind\">{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/a-really-truly-epic-hourlong-steven-universe-nearly-sp-1831937101|title=A really, truly epic hourlong Steven Universe nearly spells the end of everything|first=Eric|last=Thurm|website=TV Club}}</ref> They can attach Steven's shield to Garnet's gauntlets to use as suction cups.\n* Obsidian: The fusion of Steven, Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet, a lava-skinned giant who first appeared in [[Change Your Mind (Steven Universe)|the fifth-season finale]]. Obsidian can combine their components' weapons into the hilt of a giant sword, producing a blade from the magma in their second mouth. The original form of Obsidian, containing Rose Quartz rather than Steven, was the basis for the design of the Crystal Gems' temple.<ref name=\"thurmchangeyourmind\" />\n* Steg (voiced by [[Ted Leo]]): The fusion of Steven and Greg, appearing in ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''.\n* Mega Pearl (voiced by Deedee Magno Hall): The fusion of Pearl with \"Volleyball\", the pink Pearl who once served Pink Diamond.\n\n===Sentient plants===\n\n====Watermelon Stevens====\nThe Watermelon Stevens are living watermelons shaped like Steven, created in the first-season episode \"Watermelon Steven\" as a result of Steven's ability to create sentient plants. Soon after their creation, they go on a rampage in Beach City; after that, they leave Beach City and form a civilization on the remote Mask Island. They sometimes serve as vessels that Steven can project his mind into.\n\n====Pumpkin====\nPumpkin is a living pumpkin that behaves like a dog.

Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list.

|accessdate=25 January 2020 |work=Vulture |date=18 October 2018}}</ref> The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline. The group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under [[Big Hit Entertainment]] and released their debut single album, ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'' (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] entries ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2]]'' (2015), ''[[The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever]]'' (2016), and ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. ''Wings'' became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single \"[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]\". The band is the first Korean act to top the ''Billboard'' 200 with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018), ''[[Map of the Soul: Persona]]'' (2019) and ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]'' (2020), making BTS the fastest group since [[the Beatles]] to earn four number one albums in less than two years. ''Love Yourself: Answer'' also broke South Korea's [[Gaon Album Chart]]'s all-time monthly record previously set by ''Love Yourself: Tear'' and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States.\n\nHaving sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''Map of the Soul: 7''. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the [[IFPI]]'s Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won [[Billboard Music Award for Top Social Artist|Top Social Artist]] three years in a row and [[Billboard Music Award for Top Duo/Group|Top Duo/Group]] at the [[2019 Billboard Music Awards|26th ''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and ''Time''<nowiki/>'s [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \"[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]\". ''[[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Forbes Korea]]'' named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100|''Forbes'' Celebrity 100]] (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]'s Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their [[Love Yourself World Tour]], BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]]; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] history. ''Billboard'' ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their [[Love Myself (campaign)|Love Myself]] anti-violence campaign in partnership with [[UNICEF]], BTS addressed the [[United Nations]] 73rd [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] and became the youngest ever recipients of the [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]] from the [[President of South Korea]] due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.\n\n==Name==\nThe group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression ''Bangtan Sonyeondan'' ({{korean|hangul=\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8|hanja={{linktext|\u9632\u5f48|\u5c11\u5e74|\u5718}}}}), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\".

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-Entzheim, \u00e9vacuation patients COVID-19 par un h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re de l'arm\u00e9e de terre (NH90 immatriculation EAX) - 3.jpg|thumb|left|France has been transferring COVID-19 patients from overloaded hospitals to ones in other regions via military helicopters, as seen here at [[Strasbourg Airport]].]]\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\n====Contact tracing====\n\n[[Contact tracing]] is an important method

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-Entzheim, \u00e9vacuation patients COVID-19 par un h\u00e9licopt\u00e8re de l'arm\u00e9e de terre (NH90 immatriculation EAX) - 3.jpg|thumb|left|France has been transferring COVID-19 patients from overloaded hospitals to ones in other regions via military helicopters, as seen here at [[Strasbourg Airport]].]]\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
