The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]], who had played with Frank Beard in three mid-1960s bands, became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

According to former stage manager David Blayney in his book \"''Sharp Dressed Men\"'', sound engineer Linden Hudson co-wrote much of the material on the album while serving as a live-in high-tech music teacher to Beard and Gibbons. Despite continued denials by the band, it settled a five-year legal battle with Hudson, paying him $600,000 after he proved he held the copyright to the song \"Thug\".<ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Blayney |title= Sharp Dressed Men |location= New York |publisher= [[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year= 1994 |isbn= 0-7868-8005-8 |pages= 196\u2013203}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Deborah |last= Frost |title= ZZ Top - Bad And Worldwide |location= New York |publisher= Rolling Stone Press |year= 1985 |isbn= 0020029500}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= David |last= Sinclair |title= Tres Hombres: The Story of ZZ Top |publisher= [[Virgin Books|Virgin]] |year= 1986 |isbn= 0-86369-167-6}}</ref>\n\nDespite not selling as many copies as ''Eliminator'', 1985's ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' became the band's highest-charting album,<ref name=\"Afterburner\">{{cite web|title= Afterburner \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

This move did not entirely suit the fan base that ''Eliminator'' and ''Afterburner'' had built up, and while ''Recycler'' did achieve platinum status, it never matched the sales of those albums.

The group consists of founder [[Billy Gibbons]] (guitar, lead vocals), [[Dusty Hill]] (bass, vocals) and [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] (drums, percussion). Initially rooted in [[blues]], ZZ Top's style has evolved throughout their career, with a signature sound based on Gibbons' blues guitar style and Hill and Beard's rhythm section. Their lyrics, often embellished with [[sexual innuendo]], focus on their Texas roots and humor. Popular for their live performances, the group has staged several elaborate tours.\n \nZZ Top formed after the demise of Gibbons' previous band, [[Moving Sidewalks]]. Within a year, they signed with [[London Records]] and released ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971). Subsequent releases, such as their first top-ten album ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' (1973) and the singles \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" and \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\", gained extensive radio airplay. By the mid-1970s, they had become renowned in North America for their live act, highlighted by their performances during the [[Worldwide Texas Tour]] from 1976 to 1977, which made them national stars and was a critical and commercial success.\n \nFollowing a two-year break after facing creative stagnation and exhaustion, ZZ Top reinvented themselves in the late 1970s with a new musical direction and public image. Beginning with their albums [[Deg\u00fcello]] (1979) and [[El Loco]] (1981), they experimented with instruments including [[clavinet]]s, [[saxophone]]s, and [[synthesizer]]s, while Gibbons and Hill grew long beards as part of their image. ZZ Top gained international favor with the records ''[[Eliminator (album)|Eliminator]]'' (1983) and ''[[Afterburner (ZZ Top album)|Afterburner]]'' (1985), which integrated influences from [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[dance-rock]], and established a more mainstream sound. The popularity of their [[Music video|music videos]], including those for \"[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]\", \"[[Sharp Dressed Man]]\", and \"[[Legs (song)|Legs]]\", helped propel them onto the television channel [[MTV]] and made them one of the more prominent artists in [[1980s#Popular_culture|1980s pop culture]]. Their [[Afterburner Tour]] set records for the highest-attended and highest-grossing concert tour of 1986. After additional acclaim with the release of their tenth album ''[[Recycler (album)|Recycler]]'' (1990) and the [[Recycler Tour]], their experimentation continued with the albums ''[[Antenna (ZZ Top album)|Antenna]]'' (1994), ''[[Rhythmeen]]'' (1996), ''[[XXX (ZZ Top album)|XXX]]'' (1999), and ''[[Mescalero (album)|Mescalero]]'' (2003), with mixed successes. The group most recently released ''[[La Futura]]'' (2012) and ''Goin\u2032 50'' (2019), the latter of which is a compilation album commemorating the band's 50th anniversary.\n\nZZ Top has released 15 studio albums and sold an estimated 50 million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|first= Gabriel |last= Falcon |title= ZZ Top: After 50 years they've still got legs |publisher= [[CBS News]] |date= July 21, 2019 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |url= https://www.cbsnews.com/news/zz-top-goin-50-dusty-hill-frank-beard-billy-gibbons/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Peter |last= Blackstock |title= ZZ Top at 50: Billy Gibbons takes us back to the beginning |newspaper= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= May 15, 2019 |accessdate= May 15, 2019 |url= https://www.austin360.com/entertainmentlife/20190515/zz-top-at-50-billy-gibbons-takes-us-back-to-beginning}}</ref> They have won three [[MTV Video Music Awards]], and in 2004, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The band had a little apartment covered with concert posters and he noticed that many performers' names used initials. Gibbons particularly noticed [[B.B. King]] and [[Z. Z. Hill|Z.Z. Hill]] and thought of combining the two into \"ZZ King\", but considered it too similar to the original name. He then figured that \"king is going at the top\" which brought him to \"ZZ Top.\"<ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson \u2013 The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15 |accessdate= September 13, 2015}}</ref>\n\nZZ Top was managed by [[Bill Ham]], a [[Waxahachie, Texas]], native who had befriended Gibbons a year earlier. They released their first single, \"Salt Lick,\"  in 1969, and the B-side contained the song \"Miller's Farm.\" Both songs credited Gibbons as the composer. Immediately after the recording of \"Salt Lick,\" Greig was replaced by bassist Billy Ethridge, a bandmate of [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and Mitchell was replaced by [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]] of [[American Blues]]. Due to lack of interest from the major American record companies, ZZ Top accepted a record deal from [[London Records]], the American affiliate of the British [[Decca Records]] label. Unwilling to sign a recording contract, Ethridge quit the band and [[Dusty Hill]] became his replacement. After Hill moved from Dallas to Houston, ZZ Top signed with London in 1970. They performed their first concert together at the Knights of Columbus Hall in [[Beaumont, Texas]], on February 10, 1970.\n\nIn addition to assuming the role as the band's leader, Gibbons became the main lyricist and musical arranger. With the assistance of Ham and engineer Robin Hood Brians, ''[[ZZ Top's First Album]]'' (1971) was released and exhibited the band's humor, with \"barrelhouse\" rhythms, distorted guitars, double entendres, and innuendo. The music and songs reflected ZZ Top's blues influences. Following their debut album, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Mud]]'' (1972), which produced their first charting single.<ref>{{cite web|first= Matthew |last= Wilkening |title= Revisiting ZZ Top's Second Album, 'Rio Grande Mud' |website= [[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |date= April 4, 2015 |accessdate= June 5, 2019 |url= https://ultimateclassicrock.com/zz-top-rio-grande-mud-turns-40/}}</ref>\n\n===First decade and signature sound (1973\u20131982)===\n[[File:ZZ Top (1976).png|230px|thumb|right|ZZ Top performing live in 1976]]\nZZ Top released ''[[Tres Hombres]]'' in 1973. The album's sound was the result of the propulsive support provided by Hill and Beard, and Gibbons' \"growling\" guitar tone. Dan Erlewine wrote that the album \"brought ZZ Top their first Top Ten record, making them stars in the process.\" The album included the boogie-driven \"[[La Grange (song)|La Grange]]\" (written about the [[Chicken Ranch (Texas)|Chicken Ranch]], a notorious brothel in [[La Grange, Texas]], that also inspired the musical ''[[The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas]]''). On the subsequent tour, the band performed sold-out concerts in the US. ZZ Top recorded the live tracks for their 1975 album, ''[[Fandango!]]'', during this tour. ''Fandango!'' was a top-ten album; its single \"[[Tush (ZZ Top song)|Tush]]\" peaked at number 20 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''[[Tejas (album)|Tejas]]'', released in 1976, was not as successful or as positively received as their previous efforts, although the album went to number 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Tejas \u2013 Awards |publisher= AllMusic.

In group 2, there are [[TRPP]] (\"P\" for polycystic) and [[TRPML]] (\"ML\" for mucolipin). Many of these channels mediate a variety of sensations such as pain, temperature, different kinds of tastes, pressure, and vision. In the body, some TRP channels are thought to behave like microscopic thermometers and used in animals to sense hot or cold.<ref name=\"pmid25053448\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Vriens J, Nilius B, Voets T | title = Peripheral thermosensation in mammals | journal = Nature Reviews.

TRP channels were initially discovered in ''trp''-mutant strain of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila]]''. Later, TRP channels were found in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 [[Cell membrane|membrane]]-spanning [[helix|helices]] with intracellular N- and [[C terminus|C-termini]]. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are expressed throughout the body.\n\n== Families ==\n[[File:TRP Channel Phylogeny.svg|right|thumb|500px|TRP channel groups and families.]]\n\nIn the animal TRP superfamily there are currently 9 proposed families split into two groups, each family containing a number of subfamilies. Group one consists of TRPC, TRPV, TRPVL, TRPA, TRPM, TRPS, and TRPN, while group two contains TRPP and TRPML. There is an additional family labeled TRPY that is not always included in either of these groups. All of these sub-families are similar in that they are molecular sensing, non-selective cation channels that have six transmembrane segments, however, each sub-family is very unique and shares little structural homology with one another. This uniqueness gives rise to the various sensory perception and regulation functions that TRP channels have throughout the body. Group one and group two vary in that both TRPP and TRPML of group two have a much longer extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments. Another differentiating characteristic is that all the group one sub-families either contain a C-terminal, intracellular ankyrin repeat sequence, an N-terminal TRP domain sequence, or both\u2014whereas both group two sub-families have neither.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kadowaki|first=Tatsuhiko|date=2015-04-01|title=Evolutionary dynamics of metazoan TRP channels|journal=Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology|volume=467|issue=10|pages=2043\u20132053|doi=10.1007/s00424-015-1705-5|pmid=25823501|issn=0031-6768}}</ref> Below are members of the sub-families and a brief description of each:\n\n===TRPA===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Family\n!Sub-Family\n!Known Taxa<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=K |last2=Pulver |first2=SR |last3=Panzano |first3=VC |last4=Chang |first4=EC |last5=Griffith |first5=LC |last6=Theobald |first6=DL |last7=Garrity |first7=PA |title=Analysis of Drosophila TRPA1 reveals an ancient origin for human chemical nociception. |journal=Nature |date=25 March 2010 |volume=464 |issue=7288 |pages=597\u2013600 |doi=10.1038/nature08848 |pmid=20237474|pmc=2845738 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..597K }}</ref><ref name=\"Drosophila menthol sensitivity\">{{cite journal |last1=Himmel |first1=NJ |last2=Letcher |first2=JM |last3=Sakurai |first3=A |last4=Gray |first4=TR |last5=Benson |first5=MN |last6=Cox |first6=DN |title=''Drosophila'' menthol sensitivity and the Precambrian origins of transient receptor potential-dependent chemosensation. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The receptors are found in almost all cell types and are largely localized in cell and organelle membranes, modulating ion entry.\n\nMost TRP channels form homo- or heterotetramers when completely functional. The ion selectivity filter, pore, is formed by the complex combination of p-loops in the tetrameric protein, which are situated in the extracellular domain between the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments.

A mutant fly, ''trpl'', was subsequently isolated. Apart from structural differences, the TRP and TRPL channels differ in cation permeability and pharmacological properties.\n \nTRP/TRPL channels are solely responsible for depolarization of insect photoreceptor plasma membrane in response to light. When these channels open, they allow sodium and calcium to enter the cell down the concentration gradient, which depolarizes the membrane. Variations in light intensity affect the total number of open TRP/TRPL channels, and, therefore, the degree of membrane depolarization. These graded voltage responses propagate to photoreceptor [[synapse]]s with second-order retinal [[neuron]]s and further to the brain.\n\nIt is important to note that the mechanism of insect photoreception is dramatically different from that in mammals. Excitation of rhodopsin in mammalian photoreceptors leads to the hyperpolarization of the receptor membrane but not to depolarization as in the insect eye. In ''Drosophila'' and, it is presumed, other insects, a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated signaling cascade links photoexcitation of [[rhodopsin]] to the opening of the TRP/TRPL channels.  Although numerous activators of these channels such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were known for years, a key factor mediating chemical coupling between PLC and TRP/TRPL channels remained a mystery until recently. It was found that breakdown of a lipid product of PLC cascade, diacylglycerol (DAG), by the enzyme [[diacylglycerol lipase]], generates PUFAs that can activate TRP channels, thus initiating membrane depolarization in response to light.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung HT, Tseng-Crank J, Kim E, Mahapatra C, Shino S, Zhou Y, An L, Doerge RW, Pak WL | title = DAG lipase activity is necessary for TRP channel regulation in Drosophila photoreceptors | journal = Neuron | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 884\u201396 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18579079 | pmc = 2459341 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.05.001 }}</ref> This mechanism of TRP channel activation may be well-preserved among other cell types where these channels perform various functions.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nMutations in TRPs have been linked to [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorders, skeletal [[dysplasia]], kidney disorders,<ref name=\"pmid3129667\"/> and may play an important role in cancer.

TRP channels were initially discovered in ''trp''-mutant strain of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila]]''. Later, TRP channels were found in vertebrates where they are ubiquitously expressed in many cell types and tissues. Most TRP channels are composed of 6 [[Cell membrane|membrane]]-spanning [[helix|helices]] with intracellular N- and [[C terminus|C-termini]]. Mammalian TRP channels are activated and regulated by a wide variety of stimuli and are expressed throughout the body.\n\n== Families ==\n[[File:TRP Channel Phylogeny.svg|right|thumb|500px|TRP channel groups and families.]]\n\nIn the animal TRP superfamily there are currently 9 proposed families split into two groups, each family containing a number of subfamilies. Group one consists of TRPC, TRPV, TRPVL, TRPA, TRPM, TRPS, and TRPN, while group two contains TRPP and TRPML. There is an additional family labeled TRPY that is not always included in either of these groups. All of these sub-families are similar in that they are molecular sensing, non-selective cation channels that have six transmembrane segments, however, each sub-family is very unique and shares little structural homology with one another. This uniqueness gives rise to the various sensory perception and regulation functions that TRP channels have throughout the body. Group one and group two vary in that both TRPP and TRPML of group two have a much longer extracellular loop between the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments.

The receptors are found in almost all cell types and are largely localized in cell and organelle membranes, modulating ion entry.\n\nMost TRP channels form homo- or heterotetramers when completely functional. The ion selectivity filter, pore, is formed by the complex combination of p-loops in the tetrameric protein, which are situated in the extracellular domain between the S5 and S6 transmembrane segments.

Shortly following S6 on the C-terminal end, there is a highly conserved TRP domain (except in TRPA) which is involved with gating modulation and channel multimerization. Other C-terminal modifications such as alpha-kinase domains in TRPM7 and M8 have been seen as well in this group.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Group 2 Characteristics ===\nGroup two most distinguishable trait is the long extracellular span between the S1 and S2 transmembrane segments. Members of group two are also lacking in ankryin repeats and a TRP domain. They have been shown, however, to have endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention sequences towards on the C-terminal end illustrating possible interactions with the ER.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Function ==\nTRP channels modulate ion entry driving forces and Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport machinery in the plasma membrane, where most of them are located.

A mutant fly, ''trpl'', was subsequently isolated. Apart from structural differences, the TRP and TRPL channels differ in cation permeability and pharmacological properties.\n \nTRP/TRPL channels are solely responsible for depolarization of insect photoreceptor plasma membrane in response to light. When these channels open, they allow sodium and calcium to enter the cell down the concentration gradient, which depolarizes the membrane. Variations in light intensity affect the total number of open TRP/TRPL channels, and, therefore, the degree of membrane depolarization. These graded voltage responses propagate to photoreceptor [[synapse]]s with second-order retinal [[neuron]]s and further to the brain.\n\nIt is important to note that the mechanism of insect photoreception is dramatically different from that in mammals. Excitation of rhodopsin in mammalian photoreceptors leads to the hyperpolarization of the receptor membrane but not to depolarization as in the insect eye. In ''Drosophila'' and, it is presumed, other insects, a phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated signaling cascade links photoexcitation of [[rhodopsin]] to the opening of the TRP/TRPL channels.  Although numerous activators of these channels such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were known for years, a key factor mediating chemical coupling between PLC and TRP/TRPL channels remained a mystery until recently. It was found that breakdown of a lipid product of PLC cascade, diacylglycerol (DAG), by the enzyme [[diacylglycerol lipase]], generates PUFAs that can activate TRP channels, thus initiating membrane depolarization in response to light.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leung HT, Tseng-Crank J, Kim E, Mahapatra C, Shino S, Zhou Y, An L, Doerge RW, Pak WL | title = DAG lipase activity is necessary for TRP channel regulation in Drosophila photoreceptors | journal = Neuron | volume = 58 | issue = 6 | pages = 884\u201396 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18579079 | pmc = 2459341 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2008.05.001 }}</ref> This mechanism of TRP channel activation may be well-preserved among other cell types where these channels perform various functions.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nMutations in TRPs have been linked to [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disorders, skeletal [[dysplasia]], kidney disorders,<ref name=\"pmid3129667\"/> and may play an important role in cancer.

Her father Bhavani ([[Charan Raj]]) and his henchmen then forcibly take her to the hospital in [[Chennai]]. From her hospital bed, she remembers her past.\n\nSaravanan (Hassan) was a poor boy delivering mutton pieces throughout the city. Ramya, on the other hand, was a rich spoilt brat who is the daughter of the city bigwig Bhavani, a strict yet affectionate father. Saravanan and his three friends - Nethili Murugan ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]), Sodhappal Sodalamuthu ([[Karthik Sabesh]]), and Ganesan (Marks) - were all from Thoothukudi and were working to make ends meet in Chennai. Ramya, who was irritated by Saravanan for no particular reason, makes fun of him and teased him on multiple occasions. She even made Saravanan believe that she was in love with him, and then the heartbroken Saravanan realized that it was all acting. Ramya felt guilty for breaking his heart, so she tried to apologize to Saravanan, but he kept avoiding her. One day, Ramya kissed Saravanan in public and confessed her love for him, and then he fell in love with her as well.\n\nWhen Bhavani got to know of his daughter's love, he decided to arrange his daughter's marriage as soon as possible. Ramya took a bundle of notes and her jewellery and fled from her home. She was still an underage girl, but in seven days, she will reach the legal age of majority and be able to marry Saravanan at the registrar office. The couple, accompanied by the three friends, started travelling by bus from [[Courtallam]] to [[Thiruchendur]]. Bhavani and his henchmen eventually captured the couple in [[Kerala]] with the help of police.\n\nRamya then convinced her father to marry Saravanan.

Her father Bhavani ([[Charan Raj]]) and his henchmen then forcibly take her to the hospital in [[Chennai]]. From her hospital bed, she remembers her past.\n\nSaravanan (Hassan) was a poor boy delivering mutton pieces throughout the city. Ramya, on the other hand, was a rich spoilt brat who is the daughter of the city bigwig Bhavani, a strict yet affectionate father. Saravanan and his three friends - Nethili Murugan ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]), Sodhappal Sodalamuthu ([[Karthik Sabesh]]), and Ganesan (Marks) - were all from Thoothukudi and were working to make ends meet in Chennai. Ramya, who was irritated by Saravanan for no particular reason, makes fun of him and teased him on multiple occasions. She even made Saravanan believe that she was in love with him, and then the heartbroken Saravanan realized that it was all acting. Ramya felt guilty for breaking his heart, so she tried to apologize to Saravanan, but he kept avoiding her. One day, Ramya kissed Saravanan in public and confessed her love for him, and then he fell in love with her as well.\n\nWhen Bhavani got to know of his daughter's love, he decided to arrange his daughter's marriage as soon as possible. Ramya took a bundle of notes and her jewellery and fled from her home. She was still an underage girl, but in seven days, she will reach the legal age of majority and be able to marry Saravanan at the registrar office. The couple, accompanied by the three friends, started travelling by bus from [[Courtallam]] to [[Thiruchendur]]. Bhavani and his henchmen eventually captured the couple in [[Kerala]] with the help of police.\n\nRamya then convinced her father to get married to Saravanan. Bhavani changed his mind for the happiness of his daughter, and he finally accepted for the marriage. In a twist of fate, Bhavani's henchman Kasi ([[Majith]]) killed Saravanan to save his boss's honour. Ramya then jumped into her lover's funeral pyre.

We will refer to the initial and final states of the system as the pre- and post-selected quantum mechanical states. With respect to these state the ''weak value'' of the observable <math>A</math> is defined as:\n\n<math> A_w = \\frac{\\langle\\psi_f|A|\\psi_i\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle}.</math>\n\nNotice that if <math>|\\psi_f\\rangle = |\\psi_i\\rangle</math> then the weak value is equal to the usual [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expected value]] in the initial state <math>\\langle\\psi_i|A|\\psi_i\\rangle</math> or the final state <math>\\langle\\psi_f|A|\\psi_f\\rangle</math>. In general the weak value quantity is a [[complex number]]. The weak value of the observable becomes large when the post-selected state, <math>|\\psi_f\\rangle</math>, approaches being orthogonal to the pre-selected state, <math>|\\psi_i\\rangle</math>, i.e. <math>\\langle\\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle \\ll 1</math>. If <math> A_w </math> is larger than the largest eigenvalue of <math>A</math> or smaller than the smallest eigenvalue of <math>A</math> the weak value is said to be anomalous.\n\nAs an example consider a spin 1/2 particle.<ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\">{{cite journal\n | author = Duck, I.

C. George Sudarshan|Sudarshan]],<ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\"/> (with some notational updates from Kofman et al.<ref name=\"KofmanAshhabNori\"/> )which makes explicit when the approximations used to derive the weak value are valid.\n\nConsider a quantum system that you want to measure by coupling an ancillary (also quantum) measuring device. The observable to be measured on the system is <math> A </math>. The system and ancilla are coupled via the Hamiltonian\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nH = \\gamma A \\otimes p,\n\\end{align}\n</math> where the coupling constant is integrated over an interaction time\n<math> \\gamma = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} g(t) dt \\ll 1 </math> and <math> [q, p] =i </math> is the canonical commutator. The Hamiltonian generates the unitary\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nU= \\exp[-i \\gamma A\\otimes p].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTake the initial state of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{1/4}}\\int dq' \\exp[-q'^2/4\\sigma^2]|q'\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nthe position wavefunction of this state is\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(q) =\\langle q|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-q^2/4\\sigma^2].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by <math> |\\psi_i\\rangle </math> above; the state <math>|\\Psi\\rangle</math>, jointly describing the initial state of the system and ancilla, is given then by:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Psi\\rangle =|\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes |\\Phi\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNext the system and ancilla interact via the unitary <math>U |\\Psi\\rangle</math>. After this one performs a [[Projection-valued measure|projective measurement]] of the projectors <math>\\{ |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |, I- |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |\\}</math> on the system. If we [[Postselection|postselect]] (or [[Conditional probability|condition]]) on getting the outcome <math> |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |</math>, then the (unnormalized) final state of the meter is\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Phi_f \\rangle\n&= \\langle \\psi_f |U |\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes |\\Phi\\rangle\\\\\n&\\approx \\langle \\psi_f |(I\\otimes I -i \\gamma A\\otimes p ) |\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes|\\Phi\\rangle \\quad (I)\\\\\n&= \\langle \\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle (1 -i \\gamma A_w p ) |\\Phi\\rangle\\\\\n&\\approx \\langle \\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle \\exp(-i \\gamma A_w p) |\\Phi\\rangle. \\quad (II)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we use the first order series expansion of <math>U</math> on line (I), and we require that<ref name=\"KofmanAshhabNori\"/><ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\"/>\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{|\\gamma|}{\\sigma} \\left|\\frac{\\langle \\psi_f |A^n |\\psi_i \\rangle}{ \\langle \\psi_f| A |\\psi_i \\rangle }\\right|^{1/(n-1)} \\ll 1, \\quad (n=2,3,...)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOn line (II) we use the approximation that <math>e^{-x}\\approx 1-x</math> for small <math>x</math>.

We will refer to the initial and final states of the system as the pre- and post-selected quantum mechanical states. With respect to these state the ''weak value'' of the observable <math>A</math> is defined as:\n\n<math> A_w = \\frac{\\langle\\psi_f|A|\\psi_i\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle}.</math>\n\nNotice that if <math>|\\psi_f\\rangle = |\\psi_i\\rangle</math> then the weak value is equal to the usual [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expected value]] in the initial state <math>\\langle\\psi_i|A|\\psi_i\\rangle</math> or the final state <math>\\langle\\psi_f|A|\\psi_f\\rangle</math>. In general the weak value quantity is a [[complex number]]. The weak value of the observable becomes large when the post-selected state, <math>|\\psi_f\\rangle</math>, approaches being orthogonal to the pre-selected state, <math>|\\psi_i\\rangle</math>, i.e. <math>\\langle\\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle \\ll 1</math>. If <math> A_w </math> is larger than the largest eigenvalue of <math>A</math> or smaller than the smallest eigenvalue of <math>A</math> the weak value is said to be anomalous.\n\nAs an example consider a spin 1/2 particle.<ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\">{{cite journal\n | author = Duck, I.

George Sudarshan|Sudarshan]],<ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\"/> (with some notational updates from Kofman et al.<ref name=\"KofmanAshhabNori\"/> )which makes explicit when the approximations used to derive the weak value are valid.\n\nConsider a quantum system that you want to measure by coupling an ancillary (also quantum) measuring device. The observable to be measured on the system is <math> A </math>. The system and ancilla are coupled via the Hamiltonian\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nH = \\gamma A \\otimes p,\n\\end{align}\n</math> where the coupling constant is integrated over an interaction time\n<math> \\gamma = \\int_{t_i}^{t_f} g(t) dt \\ll 1 </math> and <math> [q, p] =i </math> is the canonical commutator. The Hamiltonian generates the unitary\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\nU= \\exp[-i \\gamma A\\otimes p].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTake the initial state of the ancilla to have a Gaussian distribution\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{1/4}}\\int dq' \\exp[-q'^2/4\\sigma^2]|q'\\rangle,\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nthe position wavefunction of this state is\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\Phi(q) =\\langle q|\\Phi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{1/4}} \\exp[-q^2/4\\sigma^2].\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by <math> |\\psi_i\\rangle </math> above; the state <math>|\\Psi\\rangle</math>, jointly describing the initial state of the system and ancilla, is given then by:\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Psi\\rangle =|\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes |\\Phi\\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nNext the system and ancilla interact via the unitary <math>U |\\Psi\\rangle</math>. After this one performs a [[Projection-valued measure|projective measurement]] of the projectors <math>\\{ |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |, I- |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |\\}</math> on the system. If we [[Postselection|postselect]] (or [[Conditional probability|condition]]) on getting the outcome <math> |\\psi_f\\rangle\\langle \\psi_f |</math>, then the (unnormalized) final state of the meter is\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n|\\Phi_f \\rangle\n&= \\langle \\psi_f |U |\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes |\\Phi\\rangle\\\\\n&\\approx \\langle \\psi_f |(I\\otimes I -i \\gamma A\\otimes p ) |\\psi_i\\rangle \\otimes|\\Phi\\rangle \\quad (I)\\\\\n&= \\langle \\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle (1 -i \\gamma A_w p ) |\\Phi\\rangle\\\\\n&\\approx \\langle \\psi_f|\\psi_i\\rangle \\exp(-i \\gamma A_w p) |\\Phi\\rangle. \\quad (II)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we use the first order series expansion of <math>U</math> on line (I), and we require that<ref name=\"KofmanAshhabNori\"/><ref name=\"DuckStevensonSudarshan1989\"/>\n\n<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{|\\gamma|}{\\sigma} \\left|\\frac{\\langle \\psi_f |A^n |\\psi_i \\rangle}{ \\langle \\psi_f| A |\\psi_i \\rangle }\\right|^{1/(n-1)} \\ll 1, \\quad (n=2,3,...)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nOn line (II) we use the approximation that <math>e^{-x}\\approx 1-x</math> for small <math>x</math>.

''Shaun the Sheep Movie'' was nominated at the [[88th Academy Awards]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. It was nominated in The [[73rd Golden Globe Awards]], [[BAFTA Awards]] and won in the [[Toronto Film Critics Awards]] for [[Toronto Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film|Best Animated Film]]. It earned five nominations at the [[Annie Awards]] including Best Animated Feature. A stand-alone sequel entitled ''[[A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon]]'' was released on 18 October 2019.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the section must from 400 to 700 words only. Shorten if beyond limit, and please keep this message for new editors. -->\nShaun, a mischievous sheep living with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, is bored with the routine of life on the farm. He concocts a plan to have a day off by tricking the farmer into going back to sleep by [[Counting sheep|counting his sheep]] repeatedly. However, the [[Caravan (towed trailer)|caravan]] in which they put the farmer to bed accidentally rolls away, taking him into the city. Bitzer, the farmer's dog, chases after him.\n\nThe farmer receives a blow to the head and is taken to a hospital, where he is diagnosed with [[amnesia]] before leaving. He wanders into a [[Beauty salon|hair salon]] and, acting on a vague recollection of shearing his sheep, cuts a celebrity's hair. The celebrity loves the result and the farmer gains popularity as a [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] called \"Mr. X\".\n\nMeanwhile, the sheep find life impossible without the farmer, so Shaun sneaks onto a bus to the city; to his surprise, the rest of the flock follow him on another bus. They disguise themselves as people and begin looking for the farmer, but Shaun is captured by Trumper, an overzealous [[Animal control service|animal-control]] worker. Shaun is reunited with Bitzer in the animal lock-up, and with the help of a [[Free-ranging dog|homeless dog]] named Slip, they manage to escape while imprisoning Trumper. They find the farmer, but he does not recognize Shaun, who is heartbroken.\n\nFeeling unwanted, Shaun, Bitzer, and the flock make a makeshift home in an alley. Their spirits are revived when they stumble upon evidence of the farmer's memory loss. They devise a plan which involves putting the farmer to sleep again, returning him to the trailer on a [[pantomime horse]] (really the flock of sheep in an elaborate disguise), and hooking the trailer up to a bus returning to Mossy Bottom. The plan is initially successful, but they are pursued by Trumper (having escaped the lock-up), who is now intent on killing them outright.\n\nAt the farm, the group hides in a shed. The insane Trumper tries to kill them by pushing the shed into a nearby rock [[quarry]], using a tractor. The farmer wakes up, regains his memory, and Trumper is defeated through teamwork. Slip leaves, but is adopted by a bus driver who finds her on the road. The farmer and the animals have a renewed appreciation for each other, and the next day the farmer cancels the day's routine activities for an official day off.\n\n[[Epilogue|Epilogues]] reveal that the animal-control service is turned into an animal-protection centre, Trumper finds work wearing a chicken suit to promote a restaurant, and the farmer sees a news report detailing some of the mayhem he slept through during his rescue from the city.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Omid Djalili 2010 Tribeca TFF Shankbone.jpg\n | width1= 1679 | height1 = 2176\n | alt1 = Omid Djalili\n | image2 = Trumper, Shaun the Sheep Movie, SFFS 2015-1.jpg\n | width2= 2384 | height2 = 1982\n | alt2 = Trumper\n | footer = [[Omid Djalili]] voiced Trumper.\n}}\nSource of character names unless otherwise noted:<ref name=BFIShaunMovie />\n*[[Justin Fletcher]] as Shaun, a sheep who acts as leader of the flock\n**Fletcher also plays Timmy, a lamb who admires Shaun\n*[[John Sparkes]] as The Farmer\n**Sparkes also does Bitzer, a dog who assists the Farmer\n*[[Omid Djalili]] as Trumper, an Animal Containment worker\n*[[Kate Harbour]] as Timmy's mum\n**Harbour also plays Merly, a worker at the hairdressers shop\n*Richard Webber as Shirley, a fat sheep\n*Tim Hands as Slip, a homeless [[dog]] \n*[[Simon Greenall]] as the twins, two sheep\n*[[Emma Tate (actress)|Emma Tate]] as Hazel, a member of the flock\n*Henry Burton as a junior doctor\n**Burton also does an Animal containment visitor\n*Dhimant Vyas as a hospital consultant\n*Sophie Laughton as an Animal containment visitor\n*Nia Medi James as an operatic sheep\n*Sean Connolly as Stylists\n**Connolly also plays the Maitre D, Golfer, Angry Panto Horse and Hospital Characters\n*Stanley Unwin as Bus Station Announcer and Hospital Announcer\n*[[Andy Nyman]] as Nuts,<ref name=BFIShaunMovie /> a sheep with strange eyes\n*Jack Paulson as a celebrity with hair trouble\n*[[Nick Park]] as himself\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Mark Burton and Richard Starzak, Shaun the Sheep Movie, SFFS 2015-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]] and [[Richard Starzak]], directors and writers of the film, at the [[San Francisco Film Society]]]]\nThe film was in development by January 2011, with a plan to release the film in 2013/2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12299286|title=Aardman Animations plan new Shaun the Sheep film|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> Directors Burton and Starzak said they wanted to \"take the sheep out of their comfort zone,\" which resulted in having the story set in a city.<ref name=fmyth>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Luke|title=Interview: Mark Burton and Richard Starzack talk Shaun the Sheep Movie|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/02/interview-mark-burton-and-richard-starzack-talk-shaun-the-sheep-movie/|website=Flickering Myth|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref> In adapting the television shorts to feature length, the directors sought to give the characters \"an emotional life,\" with Burton noting, \"If you get that right, the audience is going to root for those characters [and] laugh more.\"<ref name=fmyth />\n\nThe film, in keeping with the TV shorts, is largely silent.

Shorten if beyond limit, and please keep this message for new editors. -->\nShaun, a mischievous sheep living with his flock at Mossy Bottom Farm, is bored with the routine of life on the farm. He concocts a plan to have a day off by tricking the farmer into going back to sleep by counting his sheep repeatedly. However, the caravan in which they put the farmer to bed accidentally rolls away, taking him into the city. Bitzer, the farmer's dog, chases after him.\n\nThe farmer receives a blow to the head and is taken to a hospital, where he is diagnosed with amnesia before leaving. He wanders into a hair salon and, acting on a vague recollection of shearing his sheep, cuts a celebrity's hair. The celebrity loves the result and the farmer gains popularity as a hair stylist called \"Mr. X\".\n\nMeanwhile, the sheep find life impossible without the farmer, so Shaun sneaks onto a bus to the city; to his surprise, the rest of the flock follow him on another bus. They disguise themselves as people and begin looking for the farmer, but Shaun is captured by Trumper, an overzealous animal-control worker. Shaun is reunited with Bitzer in the animal lock-up, and with the help of a homeless dog named Slip, they manage to escape while imprisoning Trumper. They find the farmer, but he does not recognize Shaun, who is heartbroken.\n\nFeeling unwanted, Shaun, Bitzer, and the flock make a makeshift home in an alley. Their spirits are revived when they stumble upon evidence of the farmer's memory loss. They devise a plan which involves putting the farmer to sleep again, returning him to the trailer on a [[pantomime horse]] (really the flock of sheep in an elaborate disguise), and hooking the trailer up to a bus returning to Mossy Bottom. The plan is initially successful, but they are pursued by Trumper (having escaped the lock-up), who is now intent on killing them outright.\n\nAt the farm, the group hides in a shed. The insane Trumper, using a tractor, tries to push the shed into a nearby rock quarry. The farmer wakes up, regains his memory, and Trumper is defeated through teamwork. Slip leaves, but is adopted by a bus driver who finds her on the road. The farmer and the animals have a renewed appreciation for each other, and the next day the farmer cancels the day's routine activities for an official day off.\n\nEpilogues reveal that the animal-control service is turned into an animal-protection centre, Trumper finds work wearing a chicken suit to promote a restaurant, and the farmer sees a news report detailing some of the mayhem he slept through during his rescue from the city.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 300\n | image1 = Omid Djalili 2010 Tribeca TFF Shankbone.jpg\n | width1= 1679 | height1 = 2176\n | alt1 = Omid Djalili\n | image2 = Trumper, Shaun the Sheep Movie, SFFS 2015-1.jpg\n | width2= 2384 | height2 = 1982\n | alt2 = Trumper\n | footer = [[Omid Djalili]] voiced Trumper.\n}}\nSource of character names unless otherwise noted:<ref name=BFIShaunMovie />\n*[[Justin Fletcher]] as Shaun, a sheep who acts as leader of the flock\n**Fletcher also plays Timmy, a lamb who admires Shaun\n*[[John Sparkes]] as The Farmer\n**Sparkes also does Bitzer, a dog who assists the Farmer\n*[[Omid Djalili]] as Trumper, an Animal Containment worker\n*[[Kate Harbour]] as Timmy's mum\n**Harbour also plays Merly, a worker at the hairdressers shop\n*Richard Webber as Shirley, a fat sheep\n*Tim Hands as Slip, a homeless [[dog]] \n*[[Simon Greenall]] as the twins, two sheep\n*[[Emma Tate (actress)|Emma Tate]] as Hazel, a member of the flock\n*Henry Burton as a junior doctor\n**Burton also does an Animal containment visitor\n*Dhimant Vyas as a hospital consultant\n*Sophie Laughton as an Animal containment visitor\n*Nia Medi James as an operatic sheep\n*Sean Connolly as Stylists\n**Connolly also plays the Maitre D, Golfer, Angry Panto Horse and Hospital Characters\n*Stanley Unwin as Bus Station Announcer and Hospital Announcer\n*[[Andy Nyman]] as Nuts,<ref name=BFIShaunMovie /> a sheep with strange eyes\n*Jack Paulson as a celebrity with hair trouble\n*[[Nick Park]] as himself\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Mark Burton and Richard Starzak, Shaun the Sheep Movie, SFFS 2015-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Burton (writer)|Mark Burton]] and [[Richard Starzak]], directors and writers of the film, at the [[San Francisco Film Society]]]]\nThe film was in development by January 2011, with a plan to release the film in 2013/2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12299286|title=Aardman Animations plan new Shaun the Sheep film|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> Directors Burton and Starzak said they wanted to \"take the sheep out of their comfort zone,\" which resulted in having the story set in a city.<ref name=fmyth>{{cite web|last1=Owen|first1=Luke|title=Interview: Mark Burton and Richard Starzack talk Shaun the Sheep Movie|url=https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2015/02/interview-mark-burton-and-richard-starzack-talk-shaun-the-sheep-movie/|website=Flickering Myth|accessdate=13 November 2017}}</ref> In adapting the television shorts to feature length, the directors sought to give the characters \"an emotional life,\" with Burton noting, \"If you get that right, the audience is going to root for those characters [and] laugh more.\"<ref name=fmyth />\n\nThe film, in keeping with the TV shorts, is largely silent.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.
