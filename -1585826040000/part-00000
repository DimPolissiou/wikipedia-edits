The recorded location data can either be stored within the tracking unit or transmitted to an [[Internet]]-connected device using the [[Cellular Network routing|cellular]] ([[GPRS]] or [[SMS]]), [[radio]], or [[satellite modem]] embedded in the unit. This allows the location to be displayed against a map backdrop either in real time or when analysing the track later, using '''GPS tracking software'''. Data tracking software is available for [[smartphone]]s with GPS capability.<ref name=gcc>{{cite web|title=GPS Cycle Computer v3|url=http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=424423|publisher=Axivo Inc|accessdate=22 April 2014|date=7 September 2008}}</ref>\n==GPS tracking unit architecture==\nA GPS \"track me\" essentially contains a GPS module that receives the [[GPS signal]] and calculates the coordinates. For data loggers, it contains large memory to store the coordinates. Data pushers additionally contain a [[GSM]]/[[GPRS]]/[[CDMA]]/[[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] modem to transmit this information to a central computer either via [[SMS]] or [[GPRS]] in form of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets. Satellite-based GPS tracking units will operate anywhere on the globe using satellite technology such as [[GlobalStar]] or [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]]. They do not require a cellular connection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lonestartracking.com/satellite-gps-trackers-work/ |title=How All Satellite Based GPS Trackers Work |website=lonestartracking.com |access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are three types of GPS trackers, though most [[GPS Phone|GPS-equipped phones]] can work in any of these modes depending on the [[mobile application]]s installed:\n\n===Data loggers===\n[[File:Royaltek rgm-3800 IMGP9822 OSM.jpg|thumb|Typical GPS logger]]\nGPS loggers [[Data logging|log]] the position of the device at regular intervals in its internal memory. GPS loggers may have either a [[memory card]] slot, or internal flash memory card and a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port. Some act as a [[USB flash drive]], which allows [[download]]ing of the track log data for further computer analysis. The track list or [[point of interest]] list may be in [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] or other format.\n\nMost [[digital camera]]s save the time a photo was taken. Provided the camera clock is reasonably accurate or used GPS as its time source, this time can be correlated with GPS log data, to provide an accurate location. This can be added to the [[Exif]] metadata in the picture file. [[List of cameras which provide geotagging|Cameras with a GPS receiver built in]] can directly produce such a [[geotagged photograph]].\n\nIn some [[Private investigator|private investigation]] cases, [[data loggers]] are used to keep track of a target vehicle. The private investigator need not follow the target too closely, and always has a backup source of data.\n\n===Data pushers===\nA data pusher is the most common type of GPS tracking unit, used for [[asset tracking]], [[personal tracking]] and [[vehicle tracking]] systems.\n\nAlso known as a \"GPS beacon\", this kind of device [[Push technology|pushes]] (i.e. \"sends\"), at regular intervals, the position of the device as well as other information like [[speed]] or [[altitude]] to a determined [[Server (computing)|server]], that can store and  analyze the data instantly.\n\nA [[GPS navigation device]] and a mobile phone sit side-by-side in the same box, powered by the same battery. At regular intervals, the phone sends a text message via SMS or GPRS, containing the data from the GPS receiver. Newer GPS-integrated [[smartphone]]s running GPS tracking software can turn the phone into a data pusher (or logger) device. As of 2009, [[open source]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] applications are available for common [[Java ME]] enabled phones, [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], Windows Mobile, and Symbian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Eriadne.org tracking system|url=http://www.eriadne.org/|accessdate=3 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109042536/http://www.eriadne.org/|archivedate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=open-gpstracker A GPS tracking Android App: Build to be extensible and Free|url=http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/|accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Traccar Client - free open source Android tracker|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.traccar.client|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost 21st-century GPS trackers provide data \"push\" technology, enabling sophisticated GPS tracking in business environments, specifically organizations that employ a mobile workforce, such as a commercial fleet. Typical GPS tracking systems used in commercial [[fleet management]] have two core parts: location hardware (or tracking device) and tracking software. This combination is often referred to as an [[Automatic Vehicle Location]] system. The tracking device is most often hardwired installed in the vehicle, connected to the [[CAN-bus]], [[ignition system]] switch, battery. It allows collection of extra data, which is later transferred to the [[GPS tracking server]]. There it is available for viewing, in most cases via a website accessed over the Internet, where fleet activity can be viewed live or historically using digital maps and reports.\n\nGPS tracking systems used in commercial fleets are often configured to transmit location and telemetry input data at a set update rate or when an event (door open/close, auxiliary equipment on/off, [[geofence]] border cross) triggers the unit to transmit data. Live GPS tracking used in commercial fleets generally refers to systems that update regularly at one-minute, two-minute or five-minute intervals while the ignition status is on. Some tracking systems combine timed updates with heading change triggered updates.\n\nGPS tracking solutions such as [[Telematics 2.0]], an [[Internet of Things|IoT]] based [[telematics]] technology for the automotive industry, are being used by mainstream commercial auto insurance companies.\n \nThe applications of trackers of this kind include:\n\n'''Personal GPS'''\n\n* [[Law enforcement]]: an arrested suspect out on bail may have to wear a GPS tracker, usually an [[ankle monitor]], as a bail condition. GPS tracking may also be ordered for persons subject to a [[Domestic Abuse Restraining Order|restraining order]].<ref name=\"wsj27\">{{cite web|title=State budget committee rejects GPS monitoring expansion|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/state-budget-committee-rejects-gps-monitoring-expansion/article_17f6213e-5584-5d90-9e57-81b4f147a89b.html|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|access-date=14 January 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"wislegis27\">{{cite web|title=Wisconsin Legislature 165.94|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/165/94|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|access-date=14 January 2014}}</ref>\n* Race control: in some sports, such as [[gliding]], participants are required to carry a tracker. In particular, this allows race officials to know if the participants are cheating, taking unexpected shortcuts, and how far apart they are.

Some devices allow users to call for assistance, and optionally allow designated carers to locate the user's position, typically within five to ten meters. Their use helps promote independent living and social inclusion for the elderly. Devices often incorporate either one-way or two-way voice communication. Some devices also allow the user to call several phone numbers using pre-programmed speed dial buttons. Trials using GPS personal tracking devices for sufferers of early-stage dementia are underway in several countries. Text and voice communication is usually provided by a connection to [[mobile telephony]], but GPS devices are available that use [[satellite communications]], always available even if out of mobile telephone range.<ref name=\"LiveViewGPS Tracking\"/>\n* Some [[Internet]] [[Web 2.0]] pioneers have created their own personal web pages that show their position constantly, and in real time, on a map within their website. These usually use data push from a GPS enabled cell phone or a personal GPS tracker.\n* Sports: the movements of a rambler, cyclist, etc., can be tracked. Statistics such as instantaneous and average speed, and distance traveled, are logged.<ref name=gcc/>\n* Adventure sports: GPS tracking devices such as the [[SPOT Satellite Messenger]] are available to allow the position of a person to be tracked.

This gives them the advantage of reporting their position and status much more often than battery units which need to conserve  energy to extend their life.

ADS-B is to be superseded by ADS-C, a data puller.\n\n===Data pullers===\nGPS data pullers are also known as \"GPS transponders\". Unlike data pushers that send the position of the devices at regular intervals ([[push technology]]), these devices are always on, and can be queried as often as required ([[pull technology]]). This technology is not in widespread use, but an example of this kind of device is a computer connected to the Internet and running [[gpsd]].\n\nThese can often be used in the case where the location of the tracker will only need to be known occasionally e.g. placed in property that may be stolen, or that does not have a constant source of energy to send data on a regular basis, like freight or containers.\n\nData Pullers are coming into more common usage in the form of devices containing a GPS receiver and a cell phone which, when sent a special [[SMS]] message reply to the message with their location.\n\n===Covert GPS trackers===\nCovert GPS trackers contain the same electronics as regular GPS trackers but are constructed in such a way as to appear to be an everyday object. One use for covert GPS trackers is for power tool protection, these devices can be concealed within power tool boxes and traced if theft occurs.\n\n[[File:Vyncs OBD-GPS-Tracker-Device.png|thumb|An OBD GPS Tracker being inserted into the OBD-II port of a car.]]\n\n===Vehicle OBD GPS trackers===\nOBD GPS trackers plug into the onboard diagnostic (OBD) port of a light or medium duty vehicle. Usually, an OBD GPS tracker draws power from the OBD port itself and contains a built-in antenna along with a GPS module to receive the GPS signal. In addition, OBD trackers communicate with the different vehicle subsystems for receiving vehicle diagnostic and fuel consumption related data. A cellular OBD GPS tracker directly communicates with the cell tower to send the location and other vehicle performance data to the server over a cellular wireless network. Users can view the information using standalone software or a web browser from a desktop/laptop computer or using smartphone apps.\n\n==United States law==\nIn the United States, the use of GPS trackers by government authorities is limited by the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. So police, for example, usually require a [[search warrant]]. While police have placed GPS trackers in vehicles without a warrant, this usage was questioned in court in early 2009.<ref name=\"warrantless-gps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn| first=Thomas| date=March 4, 2009| work=[[InformationWeek]] |accessdate=18 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State of Tennessee PUBLIC CHAPTER NO. 169 HOUSE BILL NO. 457|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41663.pdf|work=fas.org|publisher=State of Tennessee|access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nUse by private citizens is regulated in some states, such as California, where California Penal Code Section 637.7 states: <br/>\n(a) No person or entity in this state shall use an electronic tracking device to determine the location or movement of a person. <br/>\n(b) This section shall not apply when the registered owner, lesser, or lessee of a vehicle has consented to the use of the electronic tracking device with respect to that vehicle.<br/> \n(c) This section shall not apply to the lawful use of an electronic tracking device by a law enforcement agency.<br/> \n(d) As used in this section, \"electronic tracking device\" means any device attached to a vehicle or other movable thing that reveals its location or movement by transmission of electronic signals.<br/> \n(e) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.<br/>\n(f) A violation of this section by a person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation licensed under Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code shall constitute grounds for revocation of the license issued to that person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation, pursuant to the provisions that provide for the revocation of the license as set forth in Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 637.7 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/637.7.html|website=law.onecle.com|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nNote that 637.7 pertains to all electronic tracking devices, and does not differentiate between those that rely on GPS technology or not.

The document \u201cWhat is personal data? \u2013 A quick reference guide\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Detailed_specialist_guides/determining_what_is_personal_data_quick_reference_guide.ashx |title=What is personal data? \u2013 A quick reference guide|website=ICO.ORG.UK|publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> published by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) makes clear that data identifying a living individual is personal data. If a living individual can be identified from the data, with or without additional information that may become available, is personal data.\n\n'''Identifiability'''\n\nAn individual is 'identified' if distinguished from other members of a group. In most cases an individual's name, together with some other information, will be sufficient to identify them, but a person can be identified even if their name is not known. Start by looking at the means available to identify an individual and the extent to which such means are readily available to you.\n\n'''Does the data 'relate to' the identifiable living individual, whether in personal or family life, business or profession?'''\n\nRelates to means: Data which identifies an individual, even without an associated name, may be personal data which is processed to learn or record something about that individual, or the processing of information that affects the individual. Therefore, data may 'relate to' an individual in several different ways.\n\n'''Is the data 'obviously about a particular individual? '''\n\nData 'obviously about' an individual will include their medical history, criminal record, record of work, or their achievements in a sporting activity. Data that is not 'obviously about' a particular individual may include information about their activities. Data such as personal bank statements or itemised telephone bills will be personal data about the individual operating the account or contracting for telephone services. Where data is not 'obviously about' an identifiable individual it may be helpful to consider whether the data is being processed, or could easily be processed, to learn, record or decide something about an identifiable individual. Information may be personal data where the aim, or an incidental consequence, of the processing, is that one learns or records something about an identifiable individual, or the processing could affect an identifiable individual. Data from a Tracker would be to identify the individual or their activities. It is therefore personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nAny individual who wishes to gather personal data must be registered with the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) and have a DPA number. It is a criminal offense to process data and not have a DPA number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/a_brief_guide_to_notification.ashx |title=A brief guide to notification|website=ICO.GOV.UK|publisher=The Information Commissioner's Office|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Trespass'''\n\nIt may be a civil trespass for an individual to deploy a tracker on another's car. But in the OSC's annual inspection, the OSC's Chief Surveillance Commissioner [[Sir Christopher Rose]] stated \"putting an arm into a wheel arch or under the frame of a vehicle is straining the concept of trespass\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6194581/Government-officials-track-cars-and-trespass-on-private-property-report-shows.html |title=Government officials track cars and trespass on private property, report shows|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=September 21, 2009 | accessdate=14 September 2014|}}</ref>\n\nHowever, entering a person's private land to deploy a tracker is clearly a trespass which is a civil tort.\n\n'''Prevention of Harassment Act 1997'''\n\nAt times, the public misinterprets surveillance, in all its forms, as stalking. Whilst there is no specific legislation to address this kind of harassment, a long-term pattern of persistent and repeated efforts at contact with a particular victim is generally considered stalking.\n\nThe [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] created two new offenses of stalking by inserting new sections 2A and 4A into the PHA 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/stalking_and_harassment/ |title=Stalking and Harassment|website=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The new offences which came into force on 25 November 2012, are not retrospective. Section 2A (3) of the PHA 1997 sets out examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking. Examples are: following a person, watching or spying on them, or forcing contact with the victim through any means, including social media.\n\nSuch behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful. In many cases, the conduct might appear innocent (if considered in isolation), but when carried out repeatedly, so as to amount to a course of conduct, it may then cause significant alarm, harassment or distress to the victim.\n\nThe examples given in section 2A (3) are not an exhaustive list but an indication of the types of behavior that may be displayed in a stalking offense.\n\nStalking and harassment of another or others can include a range of offenses such as those under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]; the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]; and the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]].\n\nExamples of the types of conduct often associated with stalking include direct communication; physical following; indirect contact through friends, colleagues, family or technology; or, other intrusions into the victim's privacy. The behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful.\n\nIf the subject of inquiry is aware of the tracking, then this may amount to harassment under the Prevention of Harassment Act 1997. There is a case at the Royal Courts of Justice where a private investigator is being sued under this act for the use of trackers. In December 2011, a Claim was brought against Richmond Day & Wilson Limited (First Defendant) and Bernard Matthews Limited (Second Defendant), Britain's leading Turkey Provider.\n\nThe case relates to the discovery of a tracking device found in August 2011 on a vehicle supposedly connected to Hillside Animal Sanctuary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/animal-campaigner-claims-car-was-bugged-98522 |title=Animal campaigner claims car was bugged by Bernard Matthews|accessdate=14 September 2014|publisher=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror Newspaper]]|date=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000'''\n\nProperty Interference: The Home Office published a document entitled \"Covert Surveillance and Property Interference, Revised Code of Practice, Pursuant to section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-covert-surveillance-and-property-interference | title=Code of practice for covert surveillance and property interference|website=GOV.UK|publisher=GOV.UK}}</ref> where it suggests in Chapter 7, page 61 that;\n\n'''General basis for lawful activity'''\n\n7. 1 Authorizations under section 5 of the 1994 Act or Part III of the 1997 Act should be sought wherever members of the intelligence services, the police, the services police, Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or Office of Fair Trading (OFT), or persons acting on their behalf, conduct entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy that would be otherwise unlawful.\n\n7. 2 For the purposes of this chapter, \"property interference\" shall be taken to include entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy.\n\nExample: The use of a surveillance device for providing information about the location of a vehicle may involve some physical interference with that vehicle as well as subsequent directed surveillance activity. Such an operation could be authorized by a combined authorization for property interference (under Part III of the 1997 Act) and, where appropriate, directed surveillance (under the 2000 Act). In this case, the necessity and proportionality of the property interference element of the authorization would need to be considered by the appropriate authorizing officer separately to the necessity and proportionality of obtaining private information by means of the directed surveillance.\n\nThis can be interpreted to mean that placing a tracker on a vehicle without the consent of the owner is illegal unless you obtain authorization from the Surveillance Commissionaire under the RIPA 2000 laws. Since a member of the public cannot obtain such authorizations, it is therefore illegal property interference.\n\nAnother interpretation is that it is illegal to do so if you are acting under the instruction of a public authority and you do not obtain authorization. The legislation makes no mention of property interference for anyone else.\n\nCurrently, there is no legislation in place that deals with the deployment of trackers in a criminal sense except RIPA 2000 and that RIPA 2000 only applies to those agencies and persons mentioned in it.\n\n==Uses in marketing==\n\nIn August 2010, Brazilian company [[Unilever]] ran an unusual promotion where GPS trackers were placed in boxes of [[Omo (detergent)|Omo]] laundry detergent.

For data loggers, it contains large memory to store the coordinates. Data pushers additionally contain a [[GSM]]/[[GPRS]]/[[CDMA]]/[[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] modem to transmit this information to a central computer either via [[SMS]] or [[GPRS]] in form of [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets. Satellite-based GPS tracking units will operate anywhere on the globe using satellite technology such as [[GlobalStar]] or [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]]. They do not require a cellular connection.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lonestartracking.com/satellite-gps-trackers-work/ |title=How All Satellite Based GPS Trackers Work |website=lonestartracking.com |access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are three types of GPS trackers, though most [[GPS Phone|GPS-equipped phones]] can work in any of these modes depending on the [[mobile application]]s installed:\n\n===Data loggers===\n[[File:Royaltek rgm-3800 IMGP9822 OSM.jpg|thumb|Typical GPS logger]]\nGPS loggers [[Data logging|log]] the position of the device at regular intervals in its internal memory. GPS loggers may have either a [[memory card]] slot, or internal flash memory card and a [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] port. Some act as a [[USB flash drive]], which allows [[download]]ing of the track log data for further computer analysis. The track list or [[point of interest]] list may be in [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]], [[Keyhole Markup Language|KML]], [[National Marine Electronics Association|NMEA]] or other format.\n\nMost [[digital camera]]s save the time a photo was taken. Provided the camera clock is reasonably accurate or used GPS as its time source, this time can be correlated with GPS log data, to provide an accurate location. This can be added to the [[Exif]] metadata in the picture file. [[List of cameras which provide geotagging|Cameras with a GPS receiver built in]] can directly produce such a [[geotagged photograph]].\n\nIn some [[Private investigator|private investigation]] cases, [[data loggers]] are used to keep track of a target vehicle. The private investigator need not follow the target too closely, and always has a backup source of data.\n\n===Data pushers===\nA data pusher is the most common type of GPS tracking unit, used for [[asset tracking]], [[personal tracking]] and [[vehicle tracking]] systems.\n\nAlso known as a \"GPS beacon\", this kind of device [[Push technology|pushes]] (i.e. \"sends\"), at regular intervals, the position of the device as well as other information like [[speed]] or [[altitude]] to a determined [[Server (computing)|server]], that can store and  analyze the data instantly.\n\nA [[GPS navigation device]] and a mobile phone sit side-by-side in the same box, powered by the same battery. At regular intervals, the phone sends a text message via SMS or GPRS, containing the data from the GPS receiver. Newer GPS-integrated [[smartphone]]s running GPS tracking software can turn the phone into a data pusher (or logger) device. As of 2009, [[open source]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] applications are available for common [[Java ME]] enabled phones, [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], Windows Mobile, and Symbian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Eriadne.org tracking system|url=http://www.eriadne.org/|accessdate=3 December 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109042536/http://www.eriadne.org/|archivedate=9 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=open-gpstracker A GPS tracking Android App: Build to be extensible and Free|url=http://code.google.com/p/open-gpstracker/|accessdate=11 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Traccar Client - free open source Android tracker|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.traccar.client|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost 21st-century GPS trackers provide data \"push\" technology, enabling sophisticated GPS tracking in business environments, specifically organizations that employ a mobile workforce, such as a commercial fleet. Typical GPS tracking systems used in commercial [[fleet management]] have two core parts: location hardware (or tracking device) and tracking software. This combination is often referred to as an [[Automatic Vehicle Location]] system. The tracking device is most often hardwired installed in the vehicle, connected to the [[CAN-bus]], [[ignition system]] switch, battery. It allows collection of extra data, which is later transferred to the [[GPS tracking server]]. There it is available for viewing, in most cases via a website accessed over the Internet, where fleet activity can be viewed live or historically using digital maps and reports.\n\nGPS tracking systems used in commercial fleets are often configured to transmit location and telemetry input data at a set update rate or when an event (door open/close, auxiliary equipment on/off, [[geofence]] border cross) triggers the unit to transmit data. Live GPS tracking used in commercial fleets generally refers to systems that update regularly at one-minute, two-minute or five-minute intervals while the ignition status is on. Some tracking systems combine timed updates with heading change triggered updates.\n\nGPS tracking solutions such as [[Telematics 2.0]], an [[Internet of Things|IoT]] based [[telematics]] technology for the automotive industry, are being used by mainstream commercial auto insurance companies.\n \nThe applications of trackers of this kind include:\n\n'''Personal GPS'''\n\n* [[Law enforcement]]: an arrested suspect out on bail may have to wear a GPS tracker, usually an [[ankle monitor]], as a bail condition.

Some devices allow users to call for assistance, and optionally allow designated carers to locate the user's position, typically within five to ten meters. Their use helps promote independent living and social inclusion for the elderly. Devices often incorporate either one-way or two-way voice communication. Some devices also allow the user to call several phone numbers using pre-programmed speed dial buttons. Trials using GPS personal tracking devices for sufferers of early-stage dementia are underway in several countries.

ADS-B is to be superseded by ADS-C, a data puller.\n\n===Data pullers===\nGPS data pullers are also known as \"GPS transponders\". Unlike data pushers that send the position of the devices at regular intervals ([[push technology]]), these devices are always on, and can be queried as often as required ([[pull technology]]). This technology is not in widespread use, but an example of this kind of device is a computer connected to the Internet and running [[gpsd]].\n\nThese can often be used in the case where the location of the tracker will only need to be known occasionally e.g. placed in property that may be stolen, or that does not have a constant source of energy to send data on a regular basis, like freight or containers.\n\nData Pullers are coming into more common usage in the form of devices containing a GPS receiver and a cell phone which, when sent a special [[SMS]] message reply to the message with their location.\n\n===Covert GPS trackers===\nCovert GPS trackers contain the same electronics as regular GPS trackers but are constructed in such a way as to appear to be an everyday object. One use for covert GPS trackers is for power tool protection, these devices can be concealed within power tool boxes and traced if theft occurs.\n\n[[File:Vyncs OBD-GPS-Tracker-Device.png|thumb|An OBD GPS Tracker being inserted into the OBD-II port of a car.]]\n\n===Vehicle OBD GPS trackers===\nOBD GPS trackers plug into the onboard diagnostic (OBD) port of a light or medium duty vehicle. Usually, an OBD GPS tracker draws power from the OBD port itself and contains a built-in antenna along with a GPS module to receive the GPS signal. In addition, OBD trackers communicate with the different vehicle subsystems for receiving vehicle diagnostic and fuel consumption related data. A cellular OBD GPS tracker directly communicates with the cell tower to send the location and other vehicle performance data to the server over a cellular wireless network. Users can view the information using standalone software or a web browser from a desktop/laptop computer or using smartphone apps.\n\n==United States law==\nIn the United States, the use of GPS trackers by government authorities is limited by the [[4th Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. So police, for example, usually require a [[search warrant]]. While police have placed GPS trackers in vehicles without a warrant, this usage was questioned in court in early 2009.<ref name=\"warrantless-gps\">{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/federal/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=215800542|title=Court Asked To Disallow Warrantless GPS Tracking |last=Claburn| first=Thomas| date=March 4, 2009| work=[[InformationWeek]] |accessdate=18 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=State of Tennessee PUBLIC CHAPTER NO. 169 HOUSE BILL NO. 457|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R41663.pdf|work=fas.org|publisher=State of Tennessee|access-date=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nUse by private citizens is regulated in some states, such as California, where California Penal Code Section 637.7 states: <br/>\n(a) No person or entity in this state shall use an electronic tracking device to determine the location or movement of a person. <br/>\n(b) This section shall not apply when the registered owner, lesser, or lessee of a vehicle has consented to the use of the electronic tracking device with respect to that vehicle.<br/> \n(c) This section shall not apply to the lawful use of an electronic tracking device by a law enforcement agency.<br/> \n(d) As used in this section, \"electronic tracking device\" means any device attached to a vehicle or other movable thing that reveals its location or movement by transmission of electronic signals.<br/> \n(e) A violation of this section is a misdemeanor.<br/>\n(f) A violation of this section by a person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation licensed under Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code shall constitute grounds for revocation of the license issued to that person, business, firm, company, association, partnership, or corporation, pursuant to the provisions that provide for the revocation of the license as set forth in Division 3 (commencing with Section 5000) of the Business and Professions Code.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Penal Code Section 637.7 - California Attorney Resources - California Laws|url=http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/637.7.html|website=law.onecle.com|accessdate=25 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nNote that 637.7 pertains to all electronic tracking devices, and does not differentiate between those that rely on GPS technology or not.

The document \u201cWhat is personal data? \u2013 A quick reference guide\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ico.org.uk/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Detailed_specialist_guides/determining_what_is_personal_data_quick_reference_guide.ashx |title=What is personal data? \u2013 A quick reference guide|website=ICO.ORG.UK|publisher=[[Information Commissioner's Office]]|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> published by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) makes clear that data identifying a living individual is personal data. If a living individual can be identified from the data, with or without additional information that may become available, is personal data.\n\n'''Identifiability'''\n\nAn individual is 'identified' if distinguished from other members of a group. In most cases an individual's name, together with some other information, will be sufficient to identify them, but a person can be identified even if their name is not known. Start by looking at the means available to identify an individual and the extent to which such means are readily available to you.\n\n'''Does the data 'relate to' the identifiable living individual, whether in personal or family life, business or profession?'''\n\nRelates to means: Data which identifies an individual, even without an associated name, may be personal data which is processed to learn or record something about that individual, or the processing of information that affects the individual. Therefore, data may 'relate to' an individual in several different ways.\n\n'''Is the data 'obviously about a particular individual? '''\n\nData 'obviously about' an individual will include their medical history, criminal record, record of work, or their achievements in a sporting activity. Data that is not 'obviously about' a particular individual may include information about their activities. Data such as personal bank statements or itemised telephone bills will be personal data about the individual operating the account or contracting for telephone services. Where data is not 'obviously about' an identifiable individual it may be helpful to consider whether the data is being processed, or could easily be processed, to learn, record or decide something about an identifiable individual. Information may be personal data where the aim, or an incidental consequence, of the processing, is that one learns or records something about an identifiable individual, or the processing could affect an identifiable individual. Data from a Tracker would be to identify the individual or their activities. It is therefore personal data within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nAny individual who wishes to gather personal data must be registered with the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] (ICO) and have a DPA number. It is a criminal offense to process data and not have a DPA number.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Data_Protection/Practical_application/a_brief_guide_to_notification.ashx |title=A brief guide to notification|website=ICO.GOV.UK|publisher=The Information Commissioner's Office|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''Trespass'''\n\nIt may be a civil trespass for an individual to deploy a tracker on another's car. But in the OSC's annual inspection, the OSC's Chief Surveillance Commissioner [[Sir Christopher Rose]] stated \"putting an arm into a wheel arch or under the frame of a vehicle is straining the concept of trespass\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/6194581/Government-officials-track-cars-and-trespass-on-private-property-report-shows.html |title=Government officials track cars and trespass on private property, report shows|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=September 21, 2009 | accessdate=14 September 2014|}}</ref>\n\nHowever, entering a person's private land to deploy a tracker is clearly a trespass which is a civil tort.\n\n'''Prevention of Harassment Act 1997'''\n\nAt times, the public misinterprets surveillance, in all its forms, as stalking. Whilst there is no specific legislation to address this kind of harassment, a long-term pattern of persistent and repeated efforts at contact with a particular victim is generally considered stalking.\n\nThe [[Protection of Freedoms Act 2012]] created two new offenses of stalking by inserting new sections 2A and 4A into the PHA 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/s_to_u/stalking_and_harassment/ |title=Stalking and Harassment|website=Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> The new offences which came into force on 25 November 2012, are not retrospective. Section 2A (3) of the PHA 1997 sets out examples of acts or omissions which, in particular circumstances, are ones associated with stalking. Examples are: following a person, watching or spying on them, or forcing contact with the victim through any means, including social media.\n\nSuch behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful. In many cases, the conduct might appear innocent (if considered in isolation), but when carried out repeatedly, so as to amount to a course of conduct, it may then cause significant alarm, harassment or distress to the victim.\n\nThe examples given in section 2A (3) are not an exhaustive list but an indication of the types of behavior that may be displayed in a stalking offense.\n\nStalking and harassment of another or others can include a range of offenses such as those under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997; the [[Offences Against the Person Act 1861]]; the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]; and the [[Malicious Communications Act 1988]].\n\nExamples of the types of conduct often associated with stalking include direct communication; physical following; indirect contact through friends, colleagues, family or technology; or, other intrusions into the victim's privacy. The behavior curtails a victim's freedom, leaving them feeling that they constantly have to be careful.\n\nIf the subject of inquiry is aware of the tracking, then this may amount to harassment under the Prevention of Harassment Act 1997. There is a case at the Royal Courts of Justice where a private investigator is being sued under this act for the use of trackers. In December 2011, a Claim was brought against Richmond Day & Wilson Limited (First Defendant) and Bernard Matthews Limited (Second Defendant), Britain's leading Turkey Provider.\n\nThe case relates to the discovery of a tracking device found in August 2011 on a vehicle supposedly connected to Hillside Animal Sanctuary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/animal-campaigner-claims-car-was-bugged-98522 |title=Animal campaigner claims car was bugged by Bernard Matthews|accessdate=14 September 2014|publisher=[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror Newspaper]]|date=22 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000'''\n\nProperty Interference: The Home Office published a document entitled \"Covert Surveillance and Property Interference, Revised Code of Practice, Pursuant to section 71 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000\" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/code-of-practice-for-covert-surveillance-and-property-interference | title=Code of practice for covert surveillance and property interference|website=GOV.UK|publisher=GOV.UK}}</ref> where it suggests in Chapter 7, page 61 that;\n\n'''General basis for lawful activity'''\n\n7. 1 Authorizations under section 5 of the 1994 Act or Part III of the 1997 Act should be sought wherever members of the intelligence services, the police, the services police, Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) or Office of Fair Trading (OFT), or persons acting on their behalf, conduct entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy that would be otherwise unlawful.\n\n7. 2 For the purposes of this chapter, \"property interference\" shall be taken to include entry on, or interference with, property or with wireless telegraphy.\n\nExample: The use of a surveillance device for providing information about the location of a vehicle may involve some physical interference with that vehicle as well as subsequent directed surveillance activity. Such an operation could be authorized by a combined authorization for property interference (under Part III of the 1997 Act) and, where appropriate, directed surveillance (under the 2000 Act). In this case, the necessity and proportionality of the property interference element of the authorization would need to be considered by the appropriate authorizing officer separately to the necessity and proportionality of obtaining private information by means of the directed surveillance.\n\nThis can be interpreted to mean that placing a tracker on a vehicle without the consent of the owner is illegal unless you obtain authorization from the Surveillance Commissionaire under the RIPA 2000 laws. Since a member of the public cannot obtain such authorizations, it is therefore illegal property interference.\n\nAnother interpretation is that it is illegal to do so if you are acting under the instruction of a public authority and you do not obtain authorization. The legislation makes no mention of property interference for anyone else.\n\nCurrently, there is no legislation in place that deals with the deployment of trackers in a criminal sense except RIPA 2000 and that RIPA 2000 only applies to those agencies and persons mentioned in it.\n\n==Uses in marketing==\n\nIn August 2010, Brazilian company [[Unilever]] ran an unusual promotion where GPS trackers were placed in boxes of [[Omo (detergent)|Omo]] laundry detergent.

In a flashback in \"Wexler v. Goodman\", Kim as a teenager is shown to have become self-reliant due to her mother's alcoholism. In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\"\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''pro bono'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself. Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients. The Mesa Verde bank work remains a source of irritation for Kim, taking her away from the ''pro bono'' work she finds more fulfilling.\n\nEverett Acker is a tenant on land owned by the bank. Kevin, the bank's president, wants Acker to move so the bank can create a call center on the property, but Acker refuses to leave. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses any compromises, so Kim brings in Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker in a lawsuit against the bank. Saul engages in several ruses to delay construction and Kim advises making a deal with Acker, but Kevin refuses to negotiate. Kim attempts to withdraw from the case, claiming a conflict of interest because of Jimmy's involvement, but Kevin insists that she remain. Kim becomes resigned to Acker's eviction, so Jimmy suggests looking for \"dirt\" to use against Kevin, but recommends not doing it. Kim decides to proceed against Kevin and Jimmy agrees.\n\nJimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his home. Sobchak thinks his effort was unsuccessful, but Kim sees something in his photos of Kevin's house that she can use. Rich suggests Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business temporarily, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but Kim angrily refuses. Kim later tells Jimmy she does not want to blackmail Kevin and offers $75,000 for Acker to settle, promising to personally pay the difference between that figure and whatever amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy's demand, so Jimmy threatens Kevin with an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that means cash payments for Acker and the photographer. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions but, after initially suggesting that they separate, proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].\n\nKim and Jimmy marry, enabling him to talk about his cases without having to lie to her. Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Everett Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.

In \"[[The Guy for This]]\", she claims that as a child, her mother frequently moved them from place to place to keep one step ahead of landlords to whom they owed back rent, and never had a place to call home herself. Kim further claims she moved to Albuquerque because of the limited opportunities available in her hometown. Kim worked in the mailroom at Hamlin, Hamlin and McGill (HHM), where Howard Hamlin and Chuck McGill were lead partners.  Chuck's younger brother Jimmy was employed in the mailroom because of Chuck's insistence that he work a legitimate job and rid himself of his [[con artist]] past. With HHM loaning her the money to pay for law school, she completed her education and then joined the firm as an associate.  She soon became one of HHM's top lawyers, and her success inspired Jimmy to secretly attend a distance learning law school and become an attorney.  With Kim's encouragement, Jimmy started a solo practice after HHM decided against hiring him as an associate.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nIn the show's present (2002), Jimmy, angered by how Chuck and Howard have treated him, has run-ins with HHM, including stealing a case from them and placing a billboard ad for his firm that copies Howard's signature look, the HHM colors, and HHM's logo. Kim follows Howard's direction to talk to Jimmy, but finds Jimmy's use of con games interesting; Jimmy, suggests that she should leave HHM and set up a firm with him. The fallout from Jimmy's actions cause Kim to lose some of her standing within HHM. She becomes more disenchanted with HHM after Jimmy brings the firm a potentially multi-million dollar class-action lawsuit against the Sandpiper retirement communities, only for Chuck to use Howard in blocking Jimmy's participation on the case.  When the case grows in size, HHM calls on the services of another firm, Davis & Main, and Kim recommends Jimmy to them due to his familiarity with the case and rapport with the clients. Her recommendation results in Jimmy being offered an associate's position with D&M, which would enable him to continue working on the Sandpiper case.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy is reluctant to take the job at Davis & Main, and hides away at a luxury hotel using an assumed name and stolen credit card. Kim tracks him down and tries to convince him to take the job. Instead, Jimmy brings her in on a con, convincing another hotel patron to pay for an expensive bottle of tequila. The con is a success, and they spend the night together; Kim keeps the elaborate bottle stopper as a memento.\n\nJimmy accepts the Davis & Main job and works with Kim on the Sandpiper lawsuit. Jimmy skirts the law in soliciting Sandpiper residents to join the class, creating the potential for damage to Davis & Main's reputation among its more conservative clients.  Later, he prepares a television advertisement to attract more members for the class, and airs it without getting the approval of his D&M superiors. Kim covers for him at HHM, staining her reputation even further.  Jimmy offers to quit Davis & Main if it will help restore's Kim's reputation, but she insists she reclaim her standing at the firm on her own.  Kim works her law school and professional contacts in the hopes of obtaining a major new client for HHM, and succeeds in convincing a large regional bank, Mesa Verde, to retain HHM as outside counsel.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Reduced to entry-level document review and arguing unwinnable motions in court, Kim's courtroom proficiency draws the attention of Richard Schweikart, a partner at Schweikart & Cokely. Schweikart tells Kim HHM is not appreciative of her talents and offers her a position at his firm. Kim considers the offer while sitting at a bar, and begins talking to a man she recognizes as a potential mark.  She calls Jimmy to join her, and they successfully complete another con, followed by another night together. Kim decides to leave HHM and establish her own solo practice, with Jimmy forming a solo practice in the same office so they can share expenses.  Kim tries to bring Mesa Verde with her, and appears to succeed, but Chuck wins them back to HHM.  Knowing that Kim wants Mesa Verde, Jimmy tampers with important documents in one of Chuck's filings on the bank's behalf.  Inconsistencies in the documents at the state banking board meeting call Chuck's competence into question.  Mesa Verde signs on with Kim, and Chuck becomes obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt, and tells him that if there is any evidence, Chuck will find it. Jimmy realizes the clerk at the copy store where he altered the documents can identify him, so he goes to the store to buy the clerk's silence.\n\n=== Season 3 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck becomes increasingly obsessed with proving Jimmy's sabotage and tricks him into an incriminating statement, which Chuck records. Learning of the recording from Ernesto, Kim counsels Jimmy to wait and see what Chuck intends to do with it, but Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to confront him, enabling Chuck to have Jimmy arrested.  Jimmy faces a bar investigation, and Kim and Jimmy's strategy of exposing Chuck's [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]] as a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] illness discredits his testimony.  Jimmy is suspended from practicing law for a year, but not disbarred.  Chuck's paranoid performance as a witness degrades his professional reputation, and HHM loses standing in Albuquerque's legal community. While Jimmy tries various ways to generate income so Kim and he can keep their shared office, Kim takes on a second client. Rushing to a meeting after little sleep, she crashes her car and breaks her arm.  To save money, Kim and Jimmy break the lease on their office and Kim practices from home, while Jimmy helps her with day-to-day activities because her arm is in a cast during her recovery.  Howard forces Chuck out of HHM, and an increasingly erratic Chuck sets a fire in his home by knocking over a camping lantern, but makes no attempt to leave.\n\n=== Season 4 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nFollowing Chuck's suicide, Kim tries without success to break Jimmy out of his despondent mood.  Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he thinks that his decision to force Chuck's retirement from HHM after their malpractice insurance rates rose led to Chuck's death.  Jimmy conceals his role in causing the rate increase, allows Howard to shoulder the blame, and regains his usual happy-go-lucky demeanor.  Unaware of Jimmy's actions, Kim later berates Howard for mistreating Jimmy. Kim works on Mesa Verde's rapid regional expansion, but is increasingly bored with banking law, so she begins taking ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases, which she finds more interesting and satisfying. After she is reprimanded by Paige for putting her ''pro bono'' work ahead of Mesa Verde's, Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely to hire her as a partner to manage a new banking division, which enables her to handle the Mesa Verde work while continuing to devote time and effort to criminal defense cases.  With her career becoming more successful, she becomes more distant from Jimmy, who works a boring job as a cellular phone store manager while he serves out the suspension of his law license.\n\nBy 2004 Jimmy has a lucrative side business reselling prepaid cellular phones on the street under the alias Saul Goodman, and hires Huell Babineaux as his bodyguard.  Huell has a run-in with a police officer, who arrests him, and Jimmy convinces Kim to defend Huell to keep him from receiving a prison sentence. Finding it impossible to convince the prosecuting attorney to enter into a plea bargain, Kim and Jimmy run a con to fake a show of support for Huell in his hometown.  They keep Huell out of prison, and then engage in a con that enables Kim to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in [[Lubbock, Texas]] with plans for a larger building, saving time and expense by bypassing the city zoning and planning approval processes.  After his suspension is over, Kim helps Jimmy win reinstatement to the bar by faking remorse for Chuck's death.  He promises to do justice to the McGill name, but after winning reinstatement shocks Kim by announcing that he does not intend to practice under his own name. As Kim questions Jimmy about his plan, he tells her \"S'all good, man!\n\n=== Season 5 ===\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nAs he regains his law license, Jimmy tells Kim he realized the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business provides an instant client base for a criminal law practice. He engages in several activities to generate publicity for his new practice, including giving away his remaining cell phones. Kim continues her ''pro bono'' work. In one case, Kim's client does not want to accept a favorable plea bargain, and Jimmy suggests a con to trick him into taking it. Kim refuses, but then runs the con herself. Kim later discusses the issue with Jimmy, and says she wants to succeed without having to lie, so Jimmy agrees not to cross ethical lines when it comes to her clients. The Mesa Verde bank work remains a source of irritation for Kim, taking her away from the ''pro bono'' work she finds more fulfilling.\n\nEverett Acker is a tenant on land owned by the bank. Kevin, the bank's president, wants Acker to move so the bank can create a call center on the property, but Acker refuses to leave. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses any compromises, so Kim brings in Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker in a lawsuit against the bank. Saul engages in several ruses to delay construction and Kim advises making a deal with Acker, but Kevin refuses to negotiate. Kim attempts to withdraw from the case, claiming a conflict of interest because of Jimmy's involvement, but Kevin insists that she remain. Kim becomes resigned to Acker's eviction, so Jimmy suggests looking for \"dirt\" to use against Kevin, but recommends not doing it. Kim decides to proceed against Kevin and Jimmy agrees.\n\nJimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his home. Sobchak thinks his effort was unsuccessful, but Kim sees something in his photos of Kevin's house that she can use. Rich suggests Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business temporarily, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but Kim angrily refuses. Kim later tells Jimmy she does not want to blackmail Kevin and offers $75,000 for Acker to settle, promising to personally pay the difference between that figure and whatever amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by asking for $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy's demand, so Jimmy threatens Kevin with an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which depict Kevin's father Don unfavorably. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that means cash payments for Acker and the photographer. Kim responds furiously to Jimmy's actions but, after initially suggesting that they separate, proposes marriage so that they can enjoy [[spousal privilege]].\n\nKim and Jimmy marry, enabling him to talk about his cases without having to lie to her. Kim and Rich apologize to Kevin for the outcome of Everett Acker's case. He lets them know he will decide whether to retain them, but after they leave, Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office. She points out that Kevin consistently failed to heed their advice and says that whether he retains them or hires new counsel, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by informing Kim and Rich that he will see them at their regular weekly meeting.\n\n== Reception ==\n[[File:Rhea Seehorn by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Rhea Seehorn]] portrays Kim Wexler.]]\nDue to Kim Wexler's popularity in ''Better Call Saul'', creator Vince Gilligan hinted at a possible spin-off about her, he also said that a Wexler spin-off is the most likely to be done, saying, \"If we were to do another spin-off it would be the Kim Wexler show\".<ref name=\"auto\" />\n\nSalon commented on Kim Wexler's role in the fourth season:\n\n{{quote|But that is precisely why Kim has become the low-key heroine of season 4.
