I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in the District of Columbia===\n[[File:2007 04 25 - WWB 44.JPG|left|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carrying I-95/I-495 over the [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]] (2007)]]\nThe Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the Anacostia Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].) Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]]. Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\n===I-495 in Maryland===\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].\n\n[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]\nI-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].\n[[File:2015-12-08 14 07 24 View northeast towards the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Interstate 495) connecting Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia from the south bank of the Potomac River.jpg|left|thumb|American Legion Memorial Bridge carrying the western section of the Beltway over the Potomac River (2015)]]\n\n===I-495 in Virginia===\n{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}\n\nImmediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.\n\nContinuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===\n\nI-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.\n[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]\nRunning due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction. Within the interchange, the Beltway nears the western approach to the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.\n[[File:2016-09-07 12 53 27 \"Welcome to Virginia\" sign along southbound Interstate 95 and the westbound inner loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) as it crosses the Potomac River on the Woodrow Wilson Bridge in Alexandria, Virginia.jpg|left|thumb|Virginia welcome sign on the Inner Loop over the Wilson Bridge.

Finally, beyond this complex interchange, I-95 and I-495 together cross Alexandria's  [[Jones Point Park]] and exit Virginia via the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]].\n\n==History==\nThe idea of building a highway around the Washington suburbs had been discussed at least since 1944, when Fred W.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight.

This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n===Current roadworks===\n[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]\nThe [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.

The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.\n\n==Exit list==\n===Mainline===\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

I-495 is widely known as the '''Capital Beltway''', or simply '''the Beltway''', especially when the context of Washington, D.C., is clear. It is the basis of the phrase \"[[inside the Beltway]]\", used when referring to issues dealing with American [[government]] and [[politics]]. [[Interstate 95|I-95]] utilizes the southern and eastern half of the Capital Beltway to circumnavigate Washington, D.C., and is [[concurrency (road)|cosigned]] with I-495 along that portion.\n\nThis [[loop road|circumferential roadway]] is located not only in the states of Virginia and Maryland, but also crosses briefly through the District of Columbia, near the western end of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]].  The Beltway passes through [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] and [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] in Maryland, and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and the [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] in Virginia.\n\nThe [[Cabin John Parkway]], a short connector between I-495 and the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] near the Potomac River along the Maryland\u2013Virginia border, is considered an Interstate [[highway spur|spur]] (I-495X) by the [[Maryland State Highway Administration]].\n\n==Route description==\nExcept for the westernmost part of Woodrow Wilson Bridge south of downtown Washington (the water below is considered part of the District of Columbia), the Capital Beltway encircles [[Washington, D.C.]], in adjacent [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]]. The two directions of travel, [[clockwise]] and [[counterclockwise]] (looking at a map), have become known respectively as the \"'''Inner Loop'''\" and the \"'''Outer Loop'''\". The route descriptions below follow the direction of the Outer Loop, starting at the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, south of Washington.\n\n[[File:2018-10-31 14 23 17 Signs for Interstate 495 and the Capital Beltway along eastbound U.S. Route 50 (Arlington Boulevard) just west of Virginia State Route 650 (Gallows Road) in Woodburn, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|120px|left|I-495/Capital Beltway signage in Virginia]]\nMost Beltway interchanges provide access to Washington, with [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95]] and [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|I-295]] from the south, [[Interstate 66|I-66]] from the west, and [[U.S. Route 50|US 50]] from both the west and the east among the most frequently used. More scenic routes from the Beltway into the District are offered by the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] along the Virginia side of the Potomac, the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Maryland side of the river, and the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]], approaching Washington from the northeast.\n\nOriginally, the entire Beltway was simply I-495, and [[Interstate 95|I-95]] was planned to serve downtown Washington, D.C., from the south and north, intersecting the Beltway in Virginia and in Maryland.  However, environmental litigation stopped completion of this plan, and the built portion of I-95 inside the Beltway from the south northward into downtown Washington was redesignated [[Interstate 395 (Virginia\u2013District of Columbia)|I-395]] in 1977.  The small built portion from the north was converted into a park-and-ride lot. I-95 was then rerouted (and so signed) along the eastern side of the Beltway, with the I-495 designation left only along the western side.  In 1989, the I-495 designation was returned to the eastern portion as well, with the highway co-signed as I-95 and I-495 along this route.\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in the District of Columbia===\n[[File:2007 04 25 - WWB 44.JPG|left|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] carrying I-95/I-495 over the [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and [[Oxon Hill, Maryland]] (2007)]]\nThe Beltway (here I-95 and I-495 together), four lanes in each direction, travels over the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the [[estuary|tidal]] [[Potomac River]] between [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and [[Prince George's County, Maryland]].

After crossing the Potomac, I-95/I-495 narrows to eight lanes with two local and two express lanes in each direction, and immediately meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 295 (Maryland\u2013District of Columbia)|Interstate 295]], known as the [[Anacostia]] Freeway, a route that serves downtown [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to the north, connecting in Washington to [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Interstate 695]]. This large interchange also connects to National Harbor Boulevard which links the National Harbor with the Beltway and I-295. The highway passes south of [[Oxon Cove Park & Oxon Hill Farm]] and next intersects [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]] (Indian Head Highway) , a major north\u2013south route from southern D.C. to [[Indian Head, Maryland|Indian Head]] in [[Charles County, Maryland]], which also serves the town of Forest Heights to the north at another interconnected interchange.\n\nHeading eastward, the Beltway's (I-95/I-495) local\u2013express lane configuration ends before it interchanges with various local highways, including [[Maryland Route 5|MD 5]] and [[Maryland Route 4|MD 4]] on either side of [[Andrews Air Force Base]], which the Beltway travels near its northern edge. (Both MD 5 and MD 4 extend westward into D.C., and southeastward into [[Southern Maryland]].)  Past the MD 4 interchange, the Beltway turns north through [[Glenarden, Maryland|Glenarden]], interchanging with [[Maryland Route 202|MD 202]].\n\nThe Beltway then interchanges with [[U.S. Route 50 in Maryland|US 50]]/unsigned [[Interstate 595 (Maryland)|I-595]], a major highway from downtown Washington eastward to [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], Maryland, and the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] to Maryland's [[Eastern Shore, Maryland|Eastern Shore]].  Both US 50 and MD 450 (which interchanges with the Beltway slightly northward) provide access to the New Carrollton [[New Carrollton (Washington Metro)|Metro]], [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail, and [[Amtrak]] stations, and the [[New Carrollton, Maryland|New Carrollton]] area.\n[[File:Washington Beltway I-495.jpg|thumb|left|I-495/I-95 Northbound in Maryland, at the Rhode Island Ave. overpass]]\n\nTurning northwest, the Beltway then enters [[Greenbelt Park]], intersecting the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]] (B-W Parkway) in the northeastern edge of the park. Just after the B-W Parkway, I-95/I-495 passes an interchange with [[Maryland Route 201|MD 201]], which connects to the southern terminus of the B-W Parkway at US&nbsp;50 near the D.C. line. Now turned fully west, the Beltway runs through the northern edge of [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], interchanging with the access roadway for the [[Greenbelt, Maryland|Greenbelt]] [[Greenbelt (Washington Metro)|Metro]] and [[MARC Train|MARC]] commuter rail stations, then [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]].\n\nBeyond the US 1 interchange, I-95 separates from I-495 at the College Park Interchange. I-495 continues west, alone, on the Capital Beltway, while I-95 turns northeast towards [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[New York, New York|New York City]], and [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The interchange includes access to a [[Park and Ride]] lot which was originally paved as part of I-95's route within the Beltway.\n\n===I-495 in Maryland===\nContinuing west from the College Park Interchange, I-495 crosses into [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], entering a heavily developed and populated area. Passing underneath [[Maryland Route 212|MD 212]] with no access, the route interchanges with [[Maryland Route 650|MD 650]] near the [[George Washington Cemetery]]. After bisecting [[Northwest Branch Park]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 193|MD 193]] and [[U.S. Route 29 in Maryland|US 29]] south of [[Four Corners, Maryland|Four Corners]]; the two interchanges are little more than 1/2 mile apart. Southbound US 29 is the main route into downtown [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], continuing into Washington.\n\nSqueezing past [[Argyle Park]] and [[Sligo Creek Golf Course]], the Beltway interchanges with [[Maryland Route 97|MD 97]] northwest of Silver Spring, then follows an alignment formerly known as '''Rock Creek Parkway'''.<ref group=lower-alpha>Not the extant parkway in Rock Creek Park within D.C.</ref> The route twists along the alignment, through and around [[Rock Creek Park]], then interchanges with [[Maryland Route 185|MD 185]] near the [[National Naval Medical Center]]. Turning northwest, I-495 soon encounters the southern terminus of [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]], which extends northwestward to meet [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|I-70]] in [[Frederick, Maryland]].\n\n[[File:I495 MD 10 2005 165.JPG|left|thumb|I-270/I-495 split (October 2005)]]\nI-270 and I-495 split at a highly complex Y-junction, with two separate HOV connections to I-270's HOV lanes and separate ramps to and from [[Maryland Route 355|MD 355]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 240|US 240]]). The old Rock Creek Parkway alignment follows I-270 north, while I-495 turns west and enters the only other six-lane segment of the Beltway still in existence; significant levels of traffic exit onto I-270 north, leaving the six-lane segment west of the split adequate.\n[[File:2016-01-22 09 58 00 View west along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at a signed 50 mph left curve west of Exit 36 in North Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|left|Sharp curve on the outer loop of the Beltway at the interchange with I-270 Spur in North Bethesda]]\nInterchanging with Old Georgetown Road ([[Maryland Route 187|MD 187]]), I-495 soon meets the [[Interstate 270 Spur]], the other side of the I-270/I-495 triangle. I-495 joins I-270 Spur at a converging [[Interchange (road)#Full Y interchange|wye]] junction; Inner Loop traffic exits from itself at the southern terminus of I-270 Spur, while Outer Loop traffic crosses the spur and enters it from the right. The two carriageways of I-495 temporarily widen to five lanes each until the [[Maryland Route 190|MD 190]] and [[Cabin John Parkway]] interchanges.  (MD 190 provides access to the northwestern portion of Washington, D.C., and to the [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]] and [[Great Falls, Maryland]] areas of Maryland's [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]], while the Cabin John Parkway extends to the [[Clara Barton Parkway]] along the Potomac River.)\n\nAfter these interchanges, the Beltway then narrows to eight lanes again. Turning sharply to the west, I-495 meets the Clara Barton Parkway along the north side of the [[Potomac River]];  this parkway provides a scenic route eastward into the western part of Washington, and westward toward the Potomac River's [[Great Falls (Potomac River)|Great Falls]].  After this interchange, the Beltway soon crosses the [[Mather Gorge|Potomac Gorge]] into [[Virginia]] over the ten-lane [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]].\n[[File:2015-12-08 14 07 24 View northeast towards the American Legion Memorial Bridge (Interstate 495) connecting Montgomery County, Maryland and Fairfax County, Virginia from the south bank of the Potomac River.jpg|left|thumb|American Legion Memorial Bridge carrying the western section of the Beltway over the Potomac River (2015)]]\n\n===I-495 in Virginia===\n{{See also|Virginia HOT lanes#495 Express Lanes}}\n\nImmediately after crossing into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], Virginia, I-495 encounters the western terminus of the [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]];  the Parkway provides a scenic route to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], Virginia, and downtown Washington.  The Beltway then continues south, next interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 193|VA 193]] south of [[Dranesville District Park]], then reaches the extensive triangle of interchanges between I-495, the [[Dulles Airport Access Road]], [[Virginia State Route 267|VA 267]], and [[Virginia State Route 123|VA 123]]. The eastbound Dulles Access Road here also provides access to I-66 for Outer Loop Beltway traffic.  The former interchange with the toll road (VA 267) is a directional interchange, while the latter is a cloverleaf; the entire complex occurs east of the [[Tysons Corner, Virginia|Tysons Corner]] business district.\n\nNow running south, the Beltway interchanges with [[Virginia State Route 7|VA 7]] (Leesburg Pike) east of Tysons Corner; passing [[Dunn Loring, Virginia|Dunn Loring]] to the east, I-495 soon reaches the complex interchange with [[Interstate 66]], which extends westward to [[I-81]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]] near [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]], Virginia, and eastward to [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] and downtown Washington. In a similar design as the I-270/I-495 interchange, dedicated HOV connections exist between I-495 and I-66, with many reversible and other directional ramps providing the remaining connections. There is no access between the Outer Loop and eastbound I-66 at this interchange. Instead, Outer Loop traffic must use the eastbound [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] exit 3 miles (5&nbsp;km) to the north in order to reach I-66 East.<ref group=lower-alpha>If a driver gets onto westbound I-66 at the Leesburg Pike (SR&nbsp;7) entrance, the only choice for getting to northbound I-495 is to take I-66 west to the Nutley Street exit and then get on I-66 east. A similar situation occurs for going from the [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] at Chain Bridge Road ([[Virginia State Route 123|SR&nbsp;123]]) to southbound I-495, where it is assumed that the driver will know to continue along SR&nbsp;7 or SR&nbsp;123 directly to the Beltway.</ref> There are multiple ramps from I-66 east to the Inner Loop, with one ramp exiting from the left side of I-66 east and the other exiting from the right. The [[Dulles Airport Access Road|Dulles Access Road]] leads to [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], which then changes over to the [[Dulles Greenway]] and ends at [[Leesburg, Virginia|Leesburg]].\n\nSouth of the I-66 interchange, the Beltway crosses under [[U.S. Route 29 in Virginia|US 29]] and [[Virginia State Route 237|VA 237]] with no access, then encounters a large braided interchange between I-495, [[U.S. Route 50 in Virginia|US 50]], and two local roads; the direct interchange between I-495 and US 50 is a full cloverleaf, while the braided local interchanges between I-495, US 50, and the local roads are modified [[SPUI]]s. The entire complex is bounded on the northeast side by Fairview Lake and on the southwest side by an office complex.\n\nContinuing due south, the route then interchanges with Gallows Road, then skirts the eastern edge of [[Mill Creek Park (Virginia)|Mill Creek Park]] before interchanging with [[Virginia State Route 236|VA 236]] southwest of [[Annandale Community Park]]. Running along the eastern edge of [[Wakefield Park (Annandale, Virginia)|Wakefield Park]], the Beltway turns southeast and interchanges with [[State Route 620 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 620]] before turning east near [[Flag Run Park]] and entering [[Springfield, Virginia|Springfield]], meeting the [[Springfield Interchange]] with I-95 southeast of the [[Shirley Industrial Complex]].\n\n===I-95/I-495 concurrency in Virginia===\n\nI-95 joins the Beltway within the [[Springfield Interchange]]. I-495 also meets the southern terminus of [[Interstate 395 (Virginia)|Interstate 395]] within the same massive interchange complex.\n[[File:Capital Beltway from Metro bridge.jpg|thumb|left|I-95/I-495 in Alexandria, seen from the [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Line]] of the [[Washington Metro]]]]\nRunning due east away from the interchange, crossing to the south of [[Backlick Stream Valley Park]], the Beltway (now I-95/I495) interchanges with [[State Route 613 (Fairfax County, Virginia)|VA 613]] a mile east of the Springfield Interchange. Continuing east, the Beltway encounters a diamond interchange with a connector road linking to Eisenhower Avenue, which parallels the Beltway for a short distance. Skirting the northern edges of [[Loftridge Park]] and [[Burgundy Park]] the two routes enter [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and soon reach [[Virginia State Route 241|VA 241]], a direct route into the city, currently under major reconstruction.

The first section of the {{convert|64|mi|km|adj=on}} long Beltway (including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge|Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge]] over the [[Potomac River]]) was opened on December 21, 1961; the highway was completed on August 17, 1964.\n\nOriginally designated I-495, in 1977 the eastern portion of the Beltway was re-designated [[Interstate 95|I-95]] when a proposed alignment of I-95 from [[New York Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|New York Avenue]] in Washington, D.C., through [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] to I-495 was canceled. Motorists never fully adjusted to the two halves of the Beltway having different numbers. According to Ron Shaffer of the ''Washington Post'',\n\n{{quote|There were signs stating that to continue on the Beltway, you had to get off at the next exit, when all you really had to do was keep going straight. Lots of resistance from bureaucrats, but eventually we got dual I-95/I-495 signs on the eastern half of the Beltway.<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062400980.html |work = The Washington Post |title = After 20 Years of Columns, Checking the Rearview Mirror One Last Time |first = Ron |last = Shaffer |date = June 25, 2006 |accessdate = May 5, 2010 |issn = 0190-8286 }}</ref>}}\n\nIn 1989, the I-495 designation was restored to the eastern portion, making it a dual I-95/I-495.<ref>{{AASHTO minutes |year= 1991S}}</ref>\n\nTraveling clockwise, the Beltway is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Inner Loop]]\"; traveling counter-clockwise, it is designated as the \"[[Inner/Outer labeling|Outer Loop]]\". This parlance too has led to its own confusion, with unfamiliar motorists imagining two separate, distinct highway alignments, one some distance inside the other. At entrance ramps to the Beltway and on the on-highway signage, \"Inner Loop\" and \"Outer Loop\" shields are posted in conjunction with the route marker shields, although the terms are not emphasized in signage.\n\nThe Beltway was originally envisioned as primarily a bypass for long-distance eastern seaboard traffic to avoid driving directly through Washington. However, the explosive growth both of housing and business in the Washington suburbs following the Beltway's completion quickly made the Beltway the area's \"main street\" for local traffic as well. Numerous large shopping malls, community colleges, sports and concert stadiums, and corporate employment centers were purposely built adjacent to the Beltway, and these added greatly to the traffic, as has the passenger growth of regional airports accessed by the Beltway. The formerly more affordable price of housing in Southern Maryland versus [[Northern Virginia]], also led tens of thousands of commuters to live in Southern Maryland and commute on the Beltway to Virginia. The newer [[Fairfax County Parkway]] in the 1990s helped ease some traffic on the Virginia beltway; however, various proposals to build another complete [[Washington Outer Beltway|outer beltway]] in the outer suburbs has not gotten off the ground, because local governments in Maryland object to building additional [[Potomac River]] crossings as well as destroying protected \"open space\" and creating [[suburban sprawl|sprawl]].\n\n===College Park Interchange===\n[[File:College Park Interchange.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of the College Park Interchange]]\n[[File:2019-06-03 11 53 32 View north along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway at the split between Interstate 95 North towards Baltimore and Interstate 495 West towards Silver Spring in Beltsville, Prince Georges County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The I-95/I-495 split at College Park, Maryland]]\nThe College Park Interchange is the informal name for the northern interchange between I-95 and I-495 in College Park. The interchange was partially opened, along with the connecting segment of I-95, in 1971, completing I-95 between the Baltimore Beltway and the Capital Beltway. As originally planned, it was designed with the idea that mainline I-95 through traffic would continue straight through the interchange and south into [[Washington D.C.]] as the [[Northeast Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|Northeast Freeway]], joining the [[North Central Freeway (Washington, D.C.)|North Central Freeway]] within D.C. and running south towards the central business district. When the D.C. government canceled its segment of I-95 in 1977, I-95 was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Capital Beltway, which lost its designation as I-495 (this was restored in 1989, forming a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] of I-95 and I-495 on the eastern half). As a result of this rerouting, the interchange was placed under considerable pressure to cater for a traffic flow that it was not designed to handle.\n\nOriginally, travelers from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop had to traverse the one-lane cloverleaf ramp in the southwest quadrant of the interchange; after exiting the ramp, traffic then had to weave through Inner Loop traffic headed for [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]. This unsafe condition was rectified by November 1986, when the flyover from southbound I-95 to the Inner Loop was constructed for I-95 southbound through traffic; the existing one-lane cloverleaf ramp was retained for access to the new C-D lane on the Inner Loop within the US 1 interchange, to segregate through traffic from southbound I-95 and local traffic for US 1. The stump end of the interchange was also modified into its present configuration, and the [[Park and Ride]] was built.\n\n===Traffic congestion===\nDespite numerous widening projects during its history, heavy traffic on the Beltway is a continuing problem. The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]]\u2014where eight lanes were squeezed into six\u2014was particularly onerous, with miles-long backups daily during commuter rush hours and on heavily traveled weekends. Relief for this bottleneck came on May 30, 2008, when the 12-lane replacement bridge opened to traffic in both directions (the six-lane span carrying Outer Loop traffic had opened in June 2006). Two of the lanes on the Wilson are being held in reserve  for future use as bus rapid transit or rail transit.\n\n[[File:2019-05-29 17 54 50 View south along the outer loop of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495) at Exit 57A (Interstate 95 South, Richmond) along the edge of North Springfield and Springfield in Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|left|View south along I-495 approaching the Springfield Interchange in Springfield, Virginia]]\nTwo intersections on the Capital Beltway are ranked in the top 20 on a study of the \"worst bottlenecks in the nation.\" They are the I-495 at [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|I-270]] interchange in [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], ranked third overall, which receives 760,425 cars daily, and the College Park Interchange in [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], ranked 11th, with 340,125 cars. The [[Springfield Interchange]], where [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|I-395]], I-95, and I-495 meet, was previously ranked fifth worst in the nation, but recent improvements have taken it off the top 20. Local commuters refer to the Springfield Interchange as \"The Mixing Bowl,\" although this designation is reserved by highway officials for the even more complicated [[Pentagon road network|interchange]] complex adjacent to [[The Pentagon]] on the original [[Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway]] (currently better-known as [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]]) at [[Virginia State Route 27|State Route 27]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]].\n\nIn April 2005, the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] signed an agreement with two private companies to build [[high-occupancy toll]] lanes on the stretch of the Beltway between Springfield and Georgetown Pike.  Construction began in 2008. Maryland officials are considering such lanes on their segment of the Beltway, as well as other major commuter highways in the state. Locals who disapprove of these projects have nicknamed them \"[[Lexus]] Lanes\" because of the potential high price for using the lanes in exchange for bypassing congestion. These new lanes are one stage of a controversial project to widen the beltway, with the second stage involving widening the beltway to 12 lanes; opponents have called for various alternatives to this project (as well as the controversial [[Maryland Route 200|Intercounty Connector]] project) which would divert many vehicles off the northern beltway. The [[Maryland Transit Administration]]'s proposed [[Purple Line (Maryland)|Purple Line]] light rail transit line is just one example.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |title = The Beltway |publisher = Coalition for Smarter Growth |accessdate = August 24, 2012 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091220004753/http://www.smartergrowth.net/issues/transportation/roads/beltway/index.html |archive-date = December 20, 2009 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Beltway has been improved since it opened. The American Legion Bridge was expanded by two lanes. HOV lanes were added between River Road and the I-270 Spur in Montgomery County, Maryland. The interchange between I-95 and the Beltway in Prince George's County, Maryland was originally designed to be a cloverleaf to allow I-95 to extend southward toward the District of Columbia. After I-95 was realigned onto the Beltway, a flyover ramp was built to allow I-95 through traffic to have two high-speed lanes. The interchange between U.S. Route 50 and I-95/I-495 in Prince George's County, Maryland was upgraded from a simple cloverleaf to a hybrid turbine interchange. In the Beltway's original configuration, I-295 and Indian Head Highway had separate interchanges. As a result, north-south traffic between I-295 and Indian Head Highway was forced to merge onto a congested section of the Beltway for approximately one mile. As a congestion relief measure, I-295 was extended over the Beltway and continued parallel to it so that the two highways were directly connected independent of the beltway. However, these interchanges were redesigned and rebuilt to accommodate the expansion of the Wilson Bridge and the construction of dedicated ramps to National Harbor.\n\nIn January 2018, Maryland State Democratic Sen. [[Joanne C. Benson|Joanne Benson]] of Prince George's County proposed legislation (Senate Bill 55) to increase the speed limit of the Maryland section of the Beltway from 55 to 70&nbsp;mph, in a bid to reduce traffic congestion on the Beltway.<ref>{{Cite news |url = https://wtop.com/dc-transit/2018/01/hit-the-gas-md-lawmaker-wants-to-up-speed-limits-on-i-495-i-270/ |title = Hit the gas: Md. lawmaker wants to up speed limits on Capital Beltway, I-270 |date = January 19, 2018 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WTOP-FM]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en-US }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url = https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Proposal-Boost-Beltway-I-270-Speed-Limits-70-Mph-470205523.html |title = Proposal Would Boost Beltway, I-270 Speed Limits to 70 Mph |location = Washington, DC |publisher = [[WRC-TV]] |access-date = January 22, 2018 |language = en }}</ref>\n\n===Current roadworks===\n[[File:Woodrow wilson bridge june06.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] under reconstruction, June 2006]]\nThe [[Springfield Interchange]] in Virginia completed reconstruction in 2007.  The eight-year, nearly $676 million project worked to eliminate weaving among local and long-distance traffic between I-95, I-395, the Beltway, and [[Virginia State Route 644 (Fairfax County)|State Route 644]].\n\nThe [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] underwent reconstruction in a major project that began in 1999; it now provides express and local lanes for both the Inner and Outer Loops. The new Wilson Bridge is higher and wider than the original 1961 span, which was demolished in 2006. The Outer Loop span opened in June 2006, and the Inner Loop span opened in May 2008.\n\nAlso, in association with the Wilson Bridge project, the [[Virginia State Route 241|Telegraph Road]] and [[U.S. 1]] interchanges (exits 176 and 177) in Alexandria, Virginia were rebuilt. The [[Interstate 295 (Maryland)|I-295]] and [[Maryland Route 210|MD 210]]  interchanges (exits 2 and 3) in Maryland were rebuilt as well. These improvement lasted through 2013.\n\nThe Branch Avenue ([[Maryland Route 5]]) Interchange was also improved.\n\n===Virginia HOT lanes===\n{{main|Virginia HOT lanes}}\n[[File:VA 07 2012 I495 HOT facility 3664.JPG|thumb|300px|495 Express Lanes ([[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|HOT lanes]]) under construction at the I-495 interchange with [[Virginia State Route 123|Route 123]] in [[Tysons Corner]].

Originally, all exits on the Beltway were numbered sequentially in a clockwise direction, starting with exit 1 for US 1 in Alexandria. After the eastern half of the Beltway was renumbered in 1977 as [[Interstate 95]], exits on the Maryland portion were renumbered to the current format, counterclockwise with exit numbers assigned to mileposts.  This caused problems because there were some exits that had the same number in Maryland and Virginia.  Around 2000, this problem was solved by renumbering all of the Virginia exits. The exit numbers between the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]] and the [[Springfield Interchange]]\u2014Interstate 495's intersection with [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] and [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|I-95 in Virginia]]\u2014became a continuation of the Maryland exit numbers from the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] to the [[American Legion Memorial Bridge (Potomac River)|American Legion Memorial Bridge]]. The exit numbers between the [[Springfield Interchange]] and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge became a continuation of the exit numbers of I-95 in Virginia; such exit numbers are much higher than those on the rest of the Beltway, but continue to increase in the counterclockwise direction. The counterclockwise numbering on the Capital Beltway is a rarity, as most similar loop highways, like the [[Interstate 695 (Maryland)|Baltimore Beltway]], have their exit numbers/mileage set in a clockwise arrangement.\n\n==Exit list==\n===Mainline===\nThe Commonwealth of Virginia formerly reset exit numbers at state lines, and numbered them from the counterclockwise end to the clockwise end.{{jcttop|old|state_col=State|old_ref=<ref>{{cite map |author = [[H.M.

It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.\n\nFounded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)\n\nWCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.\n\nWestern Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and growth ===\n\n[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]\n\nWestern was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.\n\nIn 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.\n\n=== WXCI and music publicization ===\n\nIn 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.\n\nIn 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.\n\n=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===\n\n{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}\n\nIn 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.\n\nThe Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.\n\nIn 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRoots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"\n\n=== Significant visitors and lectures ===\nThe university of visited by former President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2005 and by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2012.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n {{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n*[[Ancell School of Business]]\n*Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences\n*School of Visual and Performing Arts\n*School of Professional Studies\n*Division of Graduate Studies\n {{Div col end}}\n\n=== Campus ===\n\nWestern has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.\n\nThe midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-art communication, media, and computer technology.\n\nThe westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.\n\nA major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.\n\nIn April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.\n<ref>[http://www.power-eng.com/news/2013/04/24/fuel-cell-installation-to-provide-clean-power-for-wcsu-science-building.html News - Power Engineering].

The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. \n \nThe \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]].

It consists of four schools and one division: the [[Ancell School of Business]] (which includes the Justice & Law Administration program), the Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the School of Professional Studies, and the Division of Graduate Studies.\n\nFounded in 1903, WCSU is part of the [[Connecticut State University System|Connecticut State University]] (CSU) system, the primary division of the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities (CSCU) system, which also includes [[Eastern Connecticut State University|Eastern]], [[Southern Connecticut State University|Southern]] and [[Central Connecticut State University|Central]] Connecticut state universities; CSCU as a whole consists of those universities in addition to a number of [[community college]]s. Between the four state universities, more than 34,000 students are enrolled, with more than 5,700 students enrolled at WCSU.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/president/facts-figures/|title=Western Facts & Figures - Office of the President|website=www.wcsu.edu}}</ref> (As of the Fall 2016 semester.)\n\nWCSU is home to the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]], which is the result of a partnership between WCSU and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (a private non-profit organization that promotes research, education and wildlife conservation). The university's Westside campus houses the [[Ives Concert Park]], one of the premier performance venues in the area.\n\nWestern Connecticut State University is part of the [[Little East Conference]] and [[New Jersey Athletic Conference]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding and growth ===\n\n[[File:The Gates at Western Connecticut State University.jpg|thumb|The entrance gates of WCSU's Midtown campus, located in downtown Danbury.]]\n\nWestern was founded in 1903 as a [[teachers' college]], training the primary and secondary school educators for Connecticut's [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and surrounding areas. The school's name has changed over the years as it has focused on additional areas of study. First named the '''Danbury Normal School''' (also known as the '''Danbury State Normal School'''), starting in 1937 it was called the '''Danbury State Teachers College''', a name it retained until the late 1950s. The college was renamed '''Danbury State College''' in 1959, then '''Western Connecticut State College''' in 1967, and finally, in 1983, '''Western Connecticut State University'''.<ref>{{citation|first=Ray C.|last=Brown|url=http://collegehistorygarden.blogspot.com/2014/12/connecticut-colleges-that-have-closed.html |title=Connecticut Colleges that have Closed, Merged, Changed Names|date= |accessdate=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In 2011, governance of the university was transferred to the Connecticut State Colleges & Universities system.\n\nIn 1904, 41 students were enrolled in the first classes on campus, the number of enrollments climbing to 362 students by 1912.\n\n=== WXCI and music publicization ===\n\nIn 1968, WCSU's radio station, [[WXCI]] (91.7 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), then going by the [[call sign]] WCST and broadcasting with [[AM broadcasting|AM]] transmission, was established.\n\nIn 1973 WCST was switched from AM to FM transmission, obtained an [[FCC]] license, was renamed WXCI, and went on air under that call sign.\n\nIn the early 1980s, WXCI became one of the first FM stations to focus on [[alternative rock]]. Throughout the 80s the station was instrumental in promoting the work of a number of contemporary bands and musicians: While the station is perhaps best known for popularizing the English band [[Duran Duran]] in the United States, it also helped to familiarize the American audience with other projects and musicians from [[Great Britain]], such as [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Culture Club]], and it popularized among residents of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern U.S.]] the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] punk group [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based [[R.E.M.]], while also providing greater listenership to New York City's [[Talking Heads]]. [[Thurston Moore]], a founding member of [[Sonic Youth]], attended WCSU for a [[Academic quarter (year division)|quarter]] during the fall of 1976, though he left afterward.\n\n=== Jane Goodall Institute and environmental projects ===\n\n{{further|Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies|Jane Goodall Institute|Roots & Shoots}}\n\nIn 1995, the [[Jane Goodall Center for Excellence in Environmental Studies]] (JGC) was founded on campus. The Center is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3) organization]] dedicated to environmental stewardship and conservation, and wildlife education and research, being the result of a partnership between Western and the [[Jane Goodall Institute]] (JGI). Since the Center's founding, its namesake, primatologist Dr. [[Jane Goodall]], has visited Western on at least a dozen occasions to give lectures on the issue of ecology.\n\nThe Center has also hosted a number of seminars and public talks by other environmentalist speakers at the university: Notably, [[Smithsonian]] ethnobotanist [[Mark Plotkin]] and veteran ecologist [[Thomas Lovejoy]] spoke at the university in 1998, and in 2013 ocean conservationist [[Fabien Cousteau]] presented a public seminar on campus.\n\nIn 2005, Western was established by JGI as a \"National Center for University Roots and Shoots\"; this event resulted in the institution of the eponymous student environmental club, a chapter of the international [[Roots & Shoots]] (also known as Jane Goodall's Roots & Shoots), on campus. Roots & Shoots is a subsidiary organization of JGI, and its WCSU chapter is one of only several based in the United States. The club's office, located in the Midtown campus's White Hall, remained the first of its kind between 2005 and 2012; afterwards, the organization's international headquarters was established at JGI's head office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRoots & Shoots serves as, according to the university and the JGC, \"a regional and national office of excellence in training university students, faculty and administrators to develop programs for K-12 and college students in local, regional and global conservation.\"\n\n=== Significant visitors and lectures ===\nThe university of visited by former President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2005 and by the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in 2012.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n=== Schools ===\n {{Div col|colwidth=22em}} \n*[[Ancell School of Business]]\n*Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences\n*School of Visual and Performing Arts\n*School of Professional Studies\n*Division of Graduate Studies\n {{Div col end}}\n\n=== Campus ===\n\nWestern has two campuses, midtown and westside, both located in Danbury. The campuses are three miles (5&nbsp;km) apart and connected by a university shuttle service.\n\nThe midtown campus is the original campus, located on White Street near downtown Danbury and the [[Main Street Historic District (Danbury, Connecticut)|Main Street Historic District]]. It is home to the [https://www.wcsu.edu/sas/ Macricostas School of Arts and Sciences], School of Professional Studies, and most of the university's administration. Dormitories on this campus include Fairfield Hall, Litchfield Hall, and Newbury Hall. The Midtown student center is located on this campus. In 2018, the fully renovated Higgins Hall reopened. Higgins Hall features the MSAS Dean's offices, state-of-the-the art communication, media, and computer technology.\n\nThe westside campus is located on land purchased in 1969 on the outskirts of Danbury. This {{convert|439|acre|km2|adj=on}} lot is home to the [[Ancell School of Business]], the School of Visual and Performing Arts, the Westside Nature Preserve, an amphitheater and three residence halls. Westside also houses athletic facilities, including the William O'Neill Athletic and Convocation Center (completed in 1995), and the Westside Athletic Complex (completed in 2003), as well as an observatory with a 20-inch Ritchy-Chretien telescope and a 20-foot planetarium dome.  On January 23, 2007, the Westside Campus Center was officially opened. This new facility serves as a student center, meeting and banquet facility for the Westside campus. In August 2014, the Westside campus saw the opening of the new Visual and Performing Arts Center, a comprehensive arts building with Theatre Arts, Music and Visual Arts wings.\n\nA major improvement program was started in the mid-1990s to beautify the campus.  Several parking lots became green space, and improvements were made to the landscaping.\n\nIn April 2013, startup of a newly installed [[fuel cell]] power unit for the Science Building on the university's Midtown campus began. The [[PureCell System|PureCell]] System, provided by [[ClearEdge Power]], will support the university to reap significant energy cost savings and enhanced electricity and heating efficiencies.\n<ref>[http://www.power-eng.com/news/2013/04/24/fuel-cell-installation-to-provide-clean-power-for-wcsu-science-building.html News - Power Engineering].

The Visual and Performing Arts Center as well as Centennial Hall also obtained LEED certification. In 2014, WCSU installed four EV (electric vehicle) charging stations, two on each campus. These charging stations are available to both students and the public, free of charge. The university is a participant in EV Connecticut Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions program. \n \nThe \"WestConn at Waterbury\" program is located on the campus of [[Naugatuck Valley Community College]] in [[Waterbury|Waterbury, Connecticut]]. The program offers completion courses for a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in management or a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), as well as a [[Master of Health Administration]] (M.H.A.).<ref>{{cite web|title=Western at Waterbury|url=http://www.wcsu.edu/waterbury/|website=www.wcsu.edu/|publisher=Western Connecticut State University|accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Buildings==\n\n===Midtown Campus===\n {{Div col}}\n*University Hall (Administrative Offices)\n*White Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Warner Hall (Classrooms & Faculty Offices)\n*Ruth A.

[[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.\n\nThe document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].\n\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\n\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].\n\n==Types of links==\n\n===Inline links===\nAn [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.\n\nAn inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software \u2013 e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].\n\n===Anchor===\nAn anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14\u201316), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.\n\n===Fat link===\nA '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].\n\n==Uses in various technologies==\n\n===HTML===\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].\n\nThis is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n      \nThis HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:\n* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)\n* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.\n* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.\n* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).\n* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.\n\n[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.\n\n===XLink: hyperlinks ===\n{{Main article|XLink}}\n\nThe [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.\n\n===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->\n{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}\nWhile [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments\u2014in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.\n[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]\n\nThe syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.\nHyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:\n* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.\n* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.\n* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).\n\nWikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}\nHyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid \u2013 OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces \u2013 Cobalt \u2013 DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.\n\n=== Permalinks ===\n{{Main|Digital preservation}}\nPermalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.\n\nThe scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters\u2019 [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] \u2014   \"#''id attribute''\" \u2014 appended.\n\nWhen linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".\n\n===Link behavior in web browsers===\nA [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.\n\nIn a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.\n\nThe HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:\n* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)\n* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''\n* '''link title'''\n* '''link target'''\n* '''link class''' or '''link id'''\n\nIt uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":\n\n:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>\n\nTo embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:\n\n:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>\n\nIn a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.\n\nWhen the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].\n\nNormally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.\n\nCreation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.\n\nAnother special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]\nThe term \"link\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.\n\nIn a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}\n\nA database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}\n\nWhile hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.\n\nContentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>\n\nIn certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks.

[[Hypertext]] is text with hyperlinks. The text that is linked from is called [[anchor text]]. A software system that is used for viewing and creating hypertext is a ''hypertext system'', and to create a hyperlink is ''to hyperlink'' (or simply ''to link''). A user following hyperlinks is said to ''navigate'' or ''browse'' the hypertext.\n\nThe document containing a hyperlink is known as its source document. For example, in an online reference work such as [[Wikipedia]], or [[Google]], many words and terms in the text are hyperlinked to definitions of those terms. Hyperlinks are often used to implement reference [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] such as tables of contents, [[footnotes]], [[bibliographies]], [[index (publishing)|indexes]], [[letter (message)|letters]] and [[glossaries]].\n\nIn some hypertext, hyperlinks can be bidirectional: they can be followed in two directions, so both ends act as [[HTML element#Anchor|anchors]] and as targets. More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.\n\nThe effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the [[World Wide Web]] most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new [[Tab (interface)|tab]]<ref>See https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tabbrows.htm</ref>). Another possibility is [[transclusion]], for which the link target is a document [[:wikt:fragment|fragment]] that replaces the link anchor within the source document. Not only persons browsing the document follow hyperlinks. These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and gathering all the retrieved documents is known as a Web ''spider'' or [[Web crawler|crawler]].\n\n==Types of links==\n\n===Inline links===\nAn [[Inline linking|inline link]] displays remote content without the need for embedding the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the user selecting the link.\n\nAn inline link may display a modified version of the content; for instance, instead of an image, a [[thumbnail]], [[Image resolution|low resolution]] [[Preview (computing)|preview]], [[Cropping (image)|cropped]] section, or [[magnification|magnified]] section may be shown. The full content is then usually available on demand, as is the case with [[desktop publishing|print publishing]] software \u2013 e.g., with an [[external link]]. This allows for smaller file sizes and quicker response to changes when the full linked content is not needed, as is the case when rearranging a [[page layout]].\n\n===Anchor===\nAn anchor hyperlink is a link bound to a portion of a document<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BoiMpnq5bmUC&pg=PA28&dq=%C2%A0An+anchor+hyperlink+is+a+link+bound+to+a+portion+of+a+document#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0An%20anchor%20hyperlink%20is%20a%20link%20bound%20to%20a%20portion%20of%20a%20document&f=false|title=Multimedia, Hypermedia, and Virtual Reality: Models, Systems, and Application: First International Conference, MHVR'94, Moscow, Russia September (14\u201316), 1996.

For instance, it may also be a ''hot area'' in an image ([[image map]] in HTML), a designated, often irregular part of an image. One way to define it is by a list of coordinates that indicate its boundaries. For example, a [[Politics of Africa|political map of Africa]] may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping [[Skin (computing)|skins]] or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive embedding of links in the various skin elements.\n\n===Fat link===\nA '''fat link''' (also known as a \"one-to-many\" link, an \"extended link\"<ref>\"[http://www.w3.org/TR/xlink/#extended-link XML Linking Language (XLink) Version 1.0]\" accessed 2010-1-27</ref>) or a \"multi-tailed link\" <ref>\"HTML, Web Browsers, and Other Paraphernalia\" accessed 2011-08-15 https://web.archive.org/web/20130704143743/http://people.duke.edu/~mshumate/fiction/htt/tools.html#fatlink</ref> is a [[hyperlink]] which leads to multiple endpoints; the link is a [[multivalued function]].\n\n==Uses in various technologies==\n\n===HTML===\n[[Tim Berners-Lee]] saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any information to any other information over the [[Internet]]. Hyperlinks were therefore integral to the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]. Web pages are written in the hypertext mark-up language [[HTML]].\n\nThis is what a hyperlink to the home page of the [[W3C organization]] could look like in HTML code:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\">\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org\">W3C organization website</a>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n      \nThis HTML code consists of several [[HTML element|tags]]:\n* The hyperlink starts with an anchor opening tag '''<nowiki><a</nowiki>''', and includes a hyperlink reference '''<nowiki>href=\"http://www.w3.org</nowiki>\"''' to the '''URL''' for the page. (Note that the URL is enclosed in quotes.)\n* The [[URL]] is followed by '''>''', marking the end of the anchor opening tag.\n* The words that follow identify what is being linked; this is the only part of the code that is ordinarily visible on the screen when the page is rendered, but when the cursor hovers over the link, many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such as in the lower left-hand corner.\n* Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link already visited).\n* The anchor closing tag ('''<nowiki></a></nowiki>''') terminates the hyperlink code.\n\n[[Webgraph]] is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], formed from [[web page]]s as vertices and hyperlinks, as directed edges.\n\n===XLink: hyperlinks ===\n{{Main article|XLink}}\n\nThe [[W3C]] [[W3C#Recommendations and Certifications|Recommendation]] called '''[[XLink]]''' describes hyperlinks that offer a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These '''extended links''' can be ''multidirectional'', linking from, within, and between XML documents. It can also describe ''simple links'', which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.\n\n===Wikis=== <!-- As of September 2016, this header is linked to by the redirect [[Wikilink]], so please don't change the header without adding the current title as an anchor. Also please leave '''wikilinks''' in bold.   -->\n{{Glossary term|Wikilink|wikilink}}\nWhile [[wiki]]s may use HTML-type hyperlinks, the use of [[wiki markup]], a set of [[lightweight markup language]]s specifically for wikis, provides simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments\u2014in other words, for creating '''wikilinks'''.\n[[File:Wiki-linking.png|thumb|alt=Simple image demonstrating how internal [[MediaWiki]] links work (that is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title: two opening square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two closing square brackets.| How internal [[MediaWiki]] links work when you want to create a link that displays words different from the linked page's title. ]]\n\nThe syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], the [[WikiWikiWeb]] used [[CamelCase]] for this purpose. CamelCase was also used in the early version of [[Wikipedia]] and is still used in some wikis, such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]], and [[PmWiki]]. A common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the term to be wikilinked. For example, the input \"<nowiki>[[zebras]]</nowiki>\" is converted by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a [[zebras]] article.\nHyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:\n* '''Internal wikilinks''' or '''intrawiki links''' lead to pages within the same wiki website.\n* '''[[Interwiki links]]''' are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages of other wikis that are associated with the first.\n* '''External links''' lead to other webpages (those not covered in the above two cases, wiki or not wiki).\n\nWikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that don't yet exist, which are instead shown in [[redlink|red]].<ref>Wikipedia: the missing manual By John Broughton, 2008, {{ISBN|0-596-51516-2}}, [https://archive.org/details/wikipediamissing00brou_0/page/75 p. 75] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207163213/https://books.google.com/books?id=h37N0BvkVSUC&pg=PA75 |date=2018-02-07 }}</ref> Another possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question mark after the wikilinked term.\n\n===Virtual worlds===\n{{main article|Hyperlinks in virtual worlds}}\nHyperlinks are being implemented in various 3D [[virtual world]] networks, including those that use the [[OpenSimulator]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Hypergrid |title=Hypergrid \u2013 OpenSim |publisher=Opensimulator.org |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref> and [[Open Cobalt]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |title=Creating, Saving, and Loading Spaces \u2013 Cobalt \u2013 DukeWiki |publisher=Wiki.duke.edu |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221184439/https://wiki.duke.edu/display/Cobalt/Creating,+Saving,+and+Loading+Spaces |archivedate=2012-12-21 }}</ref> platforms.\n\n=== Permalinks ===\n{{Main|Digital preservation}}\nPermalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many years into the future, yielding hyperlink that are less susceptible to link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are used in order to [[Pointer (computer programming)#Typed pointers and casting|point]] and [[URL redirection#Meaningful, persistent aliases for long or changing URLs|redirect]] readers to the same [[Web page]], blog post or any online digital media<ref name=\"techopedia.com\">{{cite web | url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | title = Definition of Permanent Link (Permalink)  | website = techopedia.com | language = en | access-date = Oct 31, 2018 | archive-url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4900/permanent-link-permalink | archive-date = March 2, 2012| url-status = live}}</ref>.\n\nThe scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in [[BMC Bioinformatics]] analyzed 15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters\u2019 [[Web of Science]] [[Science citation index|citation index]], founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years, and just 62% were archived.<ref>{{cite web | first = Leighton | last = W.

This can refer to a document, e.g. a [[webpage]], or other resource, or to a position in a webpage. The latter is achieved by means of an [[HTML element]] with a \"name\" or \"id\" attribute at that position of the HTML document. The URL of the position is the URL of the webpage with a [[fragment identifier]] \u2014   \"#''id attribute''\" \u2014 appended.\n\nWhen linking to PDF documents from an HTML page the \"''id attribute''\" can be replaced with syntax that references a page number or another element of the PDF, for example, \"#''page=386''\".\n\n===Link behavior in web browsers===\nA [[web browser]] usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way, e.g. in a different [[color]], [[font]] or [[Typeface|style]]. The behavior and style of links can be specified using the [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) language.\n\nIn a graphical user interface, the appearance of a [[computer mouse|mouse]] [[Cursor (user interface)|cursor]] may change into a [[hand]] motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the [[user (computing)|user]] activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file, depending on the [[file type]] and on the browser and its [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]], another program may be activated to open the file.\n\nThe HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of a link:\n* '''link destination''' (\"href\" pointing to a URL)\n* '''[[Anchor text|link label]]'''\n* '''link title'''\n* '''link target'''\n* '''link class''' or '''link id'''\n\nIt uses the [[HTML anchor|HTML element \"a\"]] with the attribute \"href\" (HREF is an abbreviation for \"Hypertext REFerence\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Tim Berners-Lee|url=http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|title=Making a Server (\"HREF\" is for \"hypertext reference\")|publisher=W3.org|accessdate=2012-10-25|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025220948/http://www.w3.org/Provider/ServerWriter.html|archivedate=2012-10-25|author-link=Tim Berners-Lee}}</ref>) and optionally also the attributes \"title\", \"target\", and \"[[Cascading Style Sheets|class]]\" or \"id\":\n\n:<samp>&lt;a href=\"''URL''\" title=\"''link title''\" target=\"''link target''\" class=\"''link class''\"&gt;''link label''&lt;/a&gt;</samp>\n\nTo embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this form:\n\n:<code><nowiki><a href=\"http://example.com/\">Example</a></nowiki></code>\n\nIn a typical web browser, this would display as the underlined word \"Example\" in blue, which when clicked would take the user to the example.com website. This contributes to a clean, easy to read text or document.\n\nWhen the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular [[Window (computing)|window]], but in a special [[Mouse hover|hover box]], which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer|IE]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the [[status bar]].\n\nNormally, a link opens in the current [[framing (World Wide Web)|frame]] or window, but sites that use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special \"target\" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used to refer to the window later in the browsing session.\n\nCreation of new windows is probably the most common use of the \"target\" attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window names \"_blank\" and \"_new\" are usually available, and always cause a new window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes cause many windows to be created even while browsing a single site.\n\nAnother special page name is \"_top\", which causes any frames in the current window to be cleared away so that browsing can continue in the full window.\n\n==History==\n[[File:SRI ARC Engelbart Nov 1969.jpg|thumb|Douglas Engelbart and his team at [[SRI International|SRI]], 1969]]\nThe term \"hyperlink\" was coined in 1965 (or possibly 1964) by [[Ted Nelson]] at the start of [[Project Xanadu]]. Nelson had been inspired by \"[[As We May Think]]\", a popular 1945 essay by [[Vannevar Bush]]. In the essay, Bush described a microfilm-based machine (the [[Memex]]) in which one could link any two pages of information into a \"trail\" of related information, and then scroll back and forth among pages in a trail as if they were on a single microfilm reel.\n\nIn a series of books and articles published from 1964 through 1980, Nelson transposed Bush's concept of automated cross-referencing into the computer context, made it applicable to specific text strings rather than whole pages, generalized it from a local desk-sized machine to a theoretical proprietary worldwide computer network, and advocated the creation of such a network. Though Nelson's Xanadu Corporation was eventually funded by [[Autodesk]] in the 1980s, it never created this proprietary public-access network. Meanwhile, working independently, a team led by [[Douglas Engelbart]] (with [[Jeff Rulifson]] as chief [[programmer]]) was the first to implement the hyperlink concept for scrolling within a single document (1966), and soon after for connecting between paragraphs within separate documents (1968), with [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]]. [[Ben Shneiderman]] working with graduate student Dan Ostroff designed and implemented the highlighted link in the [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/hyperties/ HyperTIES system] in 1983.  HyperTIES was used to produce the world's first electronic journal, the July 1988 Communications of ACM, which was cited as the source for the link concept in [[Tim Berners-Lee]]'s Spring 1989 manifesto for the Web.  In 1988, [[Ben Shneiderman]] and Greg Kearsley used HyperTIES to publish \"Hypertext Hands-On!\", the world's first electronic book.{{cn|date=February 2019|reason=First electronic book is a bold claim.}}\n\nA database program [[HyperCard]] was released in 1987 for the Apple Macintosh that allowed hyperlinking between various pages within a document. In 1990, [[Windows Help]], which was introduced with [[Microsoft Windows 3.0]], had widespread use of hyperlinks to link different pages in a single [[Online help|help file]] together; in addition, it had a visually different kind of hyperlink that caused a popup help message to appear when clicked, usually to give definitions of terms introduced on the help page. The first widely used open protocol that included hyperlinks from any Internet site to any other Internet site was the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]] from 1991. It was soon eclipsed by HTML after the 1993 release of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic browser]] (which could handle Gopher links as well as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text, and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and hyperlinks.\n\n==Legal issues==\n{{Main article|Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing}}\n\nWhile hyperlinking among webpages is an intrinsic feature of the [[World Wide Web|web]], some websites object to being linked by other websites; some have claimed that linking to them is not allowed without permission.\n\nContentious in particular are [[deep linking|deep links]], which do not point to a site's [[home page]] or other entry point designated by the site owner, but to content elsewhere, allowing the user to bypass the site's own designated flow, and ''inline links'', which incorporate the content in question into the pages of the linking site, making it seem part of the linking site's own content unless an explicit attribution is added.<ref>See [[Copyright aspects of hyperlinking and framing#Kelly v. Arriba Soft|''Arriba Soft'' case]]. The Ninth Circuit decision in this case is the first important decision of a US court on linking. In it the Ninth Circuit held the deep linking by Arriba Soft to images on Kelly's website to be legal under the fair use doctrine.</ref>\n\nIn certain [[jurisdiction]]s it is or has been held that hyperlinks are not merely [[reference]]s or [[citations]], but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, [[Karin Spaink]] was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere [[publication]] of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, [[Josephine Ho]] was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in [[Taiwan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |title=The prosecution of Taiwan sexuality researcher and activist Josephine Ho |publisher=Sex.ncu.edu.tw |accessdate=2012-10-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208052339/http://sex.ncu.edu.tw/animal-love/news/2004Jan-Jun/Wang.pdf |archivedate=February 8, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, [[British Telecom]] sued [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy]], claiming that Prodigy infringed its patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) on web hyperlinks.

Therefore, if these fonts are not the same, this bit is simultaneously an additional code point bit.\n#{{note|text_buffer_3}} Attribute bit 0 also enables underline, if certain other attribute bits are set to zero (see [[#Underline|below]]).\n\nColors are assigned in the same way as in 4-bit indexed color graphic modes (see [[Video Graphics Array#Color palette|VGA color palette]]).\n{{anchor|MDA features}}VGA modes have no need for the MDA's reverse and bright attributes because foreground and background colors can be set explicitly.\n\n=== Underline ===\nThe VGA hardware has the ability to enable an [[underline]] on any character that has attribute bit 0 set. However, since this is an MDA-compatible feature,<ref name=\"mda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html |title=Monochrome Display Adapter Notes |website=Seasip.info |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> the attribute bits not used by the MDA must be set to zero or the underline will not be shown.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> This means that only bits 3 (intensity) and 7 (blink) can be set concurrently with bit 0 (underline). With the default VGA palette, setting bit 0 to enable underline will also change the text colour to blue. This means text in only two colors can be underlined (5555FF and 0000AA with the default palette).\n\nDespite all this, the underline is not normally visible in color modes, as the location of the underline defaults to a scanline below the character glyph, rendering it invisible.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> If the underline location is set to a visible scanline (as it is by default when switching to an MDA-compatible monochrome text mode), then the underline will appear.\n\n=== Fonts ===\n[[Image:Norton Utilities 6.01 UI.png|thumb|360px|[[Norton Utilities]] 6.01, an example of advanced [[text user interface|TUI]] which redefines the character set to show tiny graphical [[GUI widget|widget]]s, [[icon (computer)|icon]]s and an arrow pointer in text mode.]]\n[[Image:Codepage-737.png|296px|thumb|right|VGA shows us the [[code page 737]] with Greek letters]]\nScreen fonts used in EGA and VGA are [[monospace font|monospace]] [[raster font]]s containing 256 glyphs. All glyphs in a font are the same size, but this size can be changed. Typically, glyphs are 8 dots wide and 8\u201316 dots high, however the height can be any value up to a maximum of 32. Each row of a glyph is coded in an [[octet (computing)|8 bit byte]], with high bits to the left of the glyph and low bits to the right. Along with several hardware-dependent fonts stored in the adapter's [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the text mode offers 8<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> loadable fonts. Two active font pointers (font&nbsp;A and font&nbsp;B) select two of the available fonts, although they usually point to the same font. When they each point to different fonts, attribute bit 3 (see [[#Text buffer|above]]) acts as a font selection bit instead of as a foreground color bit. On real VGA hardware, this overrides the bit's use for color selection, but on many clones and emulators, the color selection remains&nbsp;\u2014 meaning one font is displayed as normal intensity, and the other as high-intensity. This error can be overcome by changing the palette registers to contain two copies of an 8-color palette.\n\nThere are modes with a character box width of 9 dots (e.g. the default 80\u00d725 mode), however the 9th column is used for spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current background colour.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> An exception to this is in ''Line Graphics Enable'' mode, which causes code points [[Hexadecimal|0x]]C0 to 0xDF inclusive<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those [[box drawing characters]] which must extend all the way to the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0\u20130xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended, as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.\n\n=== Cursor ===\n[[Image:itmouse.png|thumb|320px|Mouse cursor in [[Impulse Tracker]]]]\nThe shape of the cursor is restricted to a [[rectangle]] the full width of the character box, and [[flood fill|filled]] with the foreground color of the character at the cursor's current location. Its height and position may be arbitrary within a character box;.<ref name=\"textcur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/textcur.htm |title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming-Manipulating the Text-mode Cursor |website=Osdever.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> The EGA and many VGA clones allowed a split-box cursor (appearing as two rectangles, one at the top of the character box and one at the bottom), by setting the end of the cursor before the start, however if this is done on the original VGA, the cursor is completely hidden instead.<ref name=\"textcur\"/> The VGA standard does not provide a way to alter the blink rate,<ref name=\"textcur\"/> although common workarounds involve hiding the cursor and using a normal character glyph to provide a so-called software cursor.\n\nA [[computer mouse|mouse]] cursor in TUI (when implemented) is not usually the same thing as a hardware cursor, but a moving rectangle with altered background or a special glyph.\n\nSome text-based interfaces, such as that of [[Impulse Tracker]], went to even greater lengths to provide a smoother and more graphic-looking mouse cursor. This was done by constantly re-generating character glyphs in real-time according to the cursor's on-screen position and the underlying characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n== Access methods ==\n{{Original research|section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere are generally two ways to access VGA text-mode for an application: through the [[Video BIOS]] interface or by directly accessing video [[random access memory|RAM]]<ref name=\"pcmag tutor\" /> and I/O ports. The latter method is considerably faster, and allows quick reading of the text buffer, for which reason it is preferred for advanced TUI programs.\n\nThe VGA text buffer is located at physical memory address 0xB8000.<ref name=\"cyrix\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816220334/http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-date=2015-08-16|author=Cyrix|title=VGA Function Specification GXm/MXi Processors|date=1998-01-16}}</ref> Since this is usually used by [[16-bit]] [[x86]] processes operating in real-mode, it is the first half of memory [[x86 memory segmentation|segment]] 0xB800. The text buffer data can be read and written, and [[bitwise operation]]s can be applied. A part of text buffer memory above the scope of the current mode is accessible, but is not shown.\n\nThe same physical addresses are used in [[protected mode]]. Applications may either have this part of memory mapped to their [[address space]] or access it via the [[operating system]]. When an application (on a modern [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS) does not have control over the [[system console|console]], it accesses a part of system RAM instead of the actual text buffer.\n\nFor computers in the 1980s, very fast manipulation <!-- there were some difficulties when same memory was accessed simultaneously by CPU and character generator, but I can\u2019t remember details --> of the text buffer, with the hardware generating the individual pixels as fast as they could be displayed, was extremely useful for a fast UI. Even on relatively modern hardware, the [[computational overhead|overhead]] of text mode emulation via hardware [[All Points Addressable|APA]] (graphics) modes (in which the program generates individual pixels and stores them into the video buffer) may be noticeable.\n\n== Modes and timings ==\n\n=== Video signal ===\nFrom the monitor's side, there is no difference in input signal in a text mode and an [[All Points Addressable|APA]] mode of the same size. A text mode signal may have the same [[video signal timing|timings]] as [[VESA]] standard modes. The same registers are used on adapter's side to set up these parameters in a text mode as in APA modes. The text mode output signal is essentially the same as in graphic modes, but its source is a text buffer and character generator, not a [[framebuffer]] as in APA.\n\n=== PC common text modes ===\nDepending on the graphics adapter used, a variety of text modes are available on [[IBM PC compatible]] computers. They are listed on the table below:<ref name=\"PC Mag\">{{cite book|last=Roschi|first=Winn L.|title=VGA Compatibles: Gaining on the New Standard|journal=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeosrkjnlM8C&pg=PA177|date=16 February 1988|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=177|issn=0888-8507}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All colored modes have the same design of text attributes. MDA modes have some specific features (see [[#MDA features|above]])&nbsp;\u2014 a text could be emphasized with bright, underline, reverse and blinking attributes.\n\nThe most common text mode used in DOS environments and initial Windows consoles is the default 80 columns by 25 rows, or 80\u00d725, with 16 colors and 8\u00d716 pixels large characters. VGA cards always have a built-in font of this size whereas other sizes may require downloading a differently sized font.<ref name=\"openbsd\">{{Cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/vga.4|date=1999-03-20|title=OpenBSD Programmer's Manual, vga|quote=16 different colors can be displayed at the same time. Characters are 8\u00d716 pixels large, and a font consists of 256 characters.

[[Windows NT 4.0]] displayed its system messages during the boot process in 80\u00d750 text mode.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApzVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|author=Olga Kokoreva|title=Windows XP Registry: A Complete Guide to Customizing and Optimizing Windows XP|quote=On obvious difference between Windows 2000/XP and Windows NT 4.0 is the fact that all system messages that appear during the Windows NT 4.0 boot process are displayed in 80\u00d750 text mode, while Windows 2000 and Windows XP display these messages in VGA mode.}}</ref>\n\nCharacter sizes and graphical resolutions for the extended [[VESA BIOS Extensions|VESA]]-compatible [[Super VGA]] text modes are manufacturer's dependent. Some cards (e.g. [[S3 Graphics|S3]]) supported custom very large text modes, like 132\u00d743 and 132\u00d725.<ref name=\"S3 manual\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413190535/https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-date=2020-04-13|author=S3 Graphics|title=VC963-3D (S3 ViRGE/DX) User Manual|quote=The S3 ViRGE supports 132\u00d743 and 132\u00d725 extended text modes for text applications.

This is particularly useful for [[Computer monitor#Screen size|large]] (\u2265&nbsp;17\") monitors, where the normal 80&times;25 VGA text mode's 720&times;400 pixel resolution is far lower than a typical graphics mode would be. SVGATextMode allows setting of the [[pixel clock]] and higher [[refresh rate]], larger font size, cursor size, etc., and allows a better use of the potential of a video card and monitor. In non-Windows systems, the use of SVGATextMode (or alternative options such as the [[Linux framebuffer]]) to obtain a sharp text is critical for [[LCD monitor]]s of [[1280\u00d71024]] (or higher resolution) because none of so named standard text modes fits to this matrix size. SVGATextMode also allows a fine tuning of video signal timings.\n\nDespite the name of this program, only a few of its supported modes conform to SVGA (i.e. VESA) standards.\n\n== General restrictions ==\nVGA text mode has some hardware-imposed limitations. Because these are too restrictive for modern (post 2000) applications, the hardware text mode on VGA compatible video adapters only has a limited use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Parameter\n !

However, since this is an MDA-compatible feature,<ref name=\"mda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html |title=Monochrome Display Adapter Notes |website=Seasip.info |date=2005-11-06 |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> the attribute bits not used by the MDA must be set to zero or the underline will not be shown.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> This means that only bits 3 (intensity) and 7 (blink) can be set concurrently with bit 0 (underline). With the default VGA palette, setting bit 0 to enable underline will also change the text colour to blue. This means text in only two colors can be underlined (5555FF and 0000AA with the default palette).\n\nDespite all this, the underline is not normally visible in color modes, as the location of the underline defaults to a scanline below the character glyph, rendering it invisible.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> If the underline location is set to a visible scanline (as it is by default when switching to an MDA-compatible monochrome text mode), then the underline will appear.\n\n=== Fonts ===\n[[Image:Norton Utilities 6.01 UI.png|thumb|360px|[[Norton Utilities]] 6.01, an example of advanced [[text user interface|TUI]] which redefines the character set to show tiny graphical [[GUI widget|widget]]s, [[icon (computer)|icon]]s and an arrow pointer in text mode.]]\n[[Image:Codepage-737.png|296px|thumb|right|VGA shows us the [[code page 737]] with Greek letters]]\nScreen fonts used in EGA and VGA are [[monospace font|monospace]] [[raster font]]s containing 256 glyphs. All glyphs in a font are the same size, but this size can be changed. Typically, glyphs are 8 dots wide and 8\u201316 dots high, however the height can be any value up to a maximum of 32. Each row of a glyph is coded in an [[octet (computing)|8 bit byte]], with high bits to the left of the glyph and low bits to the right. Along with several hardware-dependent fonts stored in the adapter's [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the text mode offers 8<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> loadable fonts. Two active font pointers (font&nbsp;A and font&nbsp;B) select two of the available fonts, although they usually point to the same font. When they each point to different fonts, attribute bit 3 (see [[#Text buffer|above]]) acts as a font selection bit instead of as a foreground color bit. On real VGA hardware, this overrides the bit's use for color selection, but on many clones and emulators, the color selection remains&nbsp;\u2014 meaning one font is displayed as normal intensity, and the other as high-intensity. This error can be overcome by changing the palette registers to contain two copies of an 8-color palette.\n\nThere are modes with a character box width of 9 dots (e.g. the default 80\u00d725 mode), however the 9th column is used for spacing between characters, so the content cannot be changed. It is always blank, and drawn with the current background colour.<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> An exception to this is in ''Line Graphics Enable'' mode, which causes code points [[Hexadecimal|0x]]C0 to 0xDF inclusive<ref name=\"vgatext\"/> to have the 8th column repeated as the 9th. These code points cover those [[box drawing characters]] which must extend all the way to the right side of the glyph box. For this reason, placing letter-like characters in code points 0xC0\u20130xDF should be avoided. The box drawing characters from 0xB0 to 0xBF are not extended, as they do not point to the right and so do not require extending.\n\n=== Cursor ===\n[[Image:itmouse.png|thumb|320px|Mouse cursor in [[Impulse Tracker]]]]\nThe shape of the cursor is restricted to a [[rectangle]] the full width of the character box, and [[flood fill|filled]] with the foreground color of the character at the cursor's current location. Its height and position may be arbitrary within a character box;.<ref name=\"textcur\">{{cite web|url=http://www.osdever.net/FreeVGA/vga/textcur.htm |title=VGA/SVGA Video Programming-Manipulating the Text-mode Cursor |website=Osdever.net |date= |accessdate=2016-11-07}}</ref> The EGA and many VGA clones allowed a split-box cursor (appearing as two rectangles, one at the top of the character box and one at the bottom), by setting the end of the cursor before the start, however if this is done on the original VGA, the cursor is completely hidden instead.<ref name=\"textcur\"/> The VGA standard does not provide a way to alter the blink rate,<ref name=\"textcur\"/> although common workarounds involve hiding the cursor and using a normal character glyph to provide a so-called software cursor.\n\nA [[computer mouse|mouse]] cursor in TUI (when implemented) is not usually the same thing as a hardware cursor, but a moving rectangle with altered background or a special glyph.\n\nSome text-based interfaces, such as that of [[Impulse Tracker]], went to even greater lengths to provide a smoother and more graphic-looking mouse cursor. This was done by constantly re-generating character glyphs in real-time according to the cursor's on-screen position and the underlying characters.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n== Access methods ==\n{{Original research|section|date=November 2019}}\n\nThere are generally two ways to access VGA text-mode for an application: through the [[Video BIOS]] interface or by directly accessing video [[random access memory|RAM]]<ref name=\"pcmag tutor\" /> and I/O ports. The latter method is considerably faster, and allows quick reading of the text buffer, for which reason it is preferred for advanced TUI programs.\n\nThe VGA text buffer is located at physical memory address 0xB8000.<ref name=\"cyrix\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816220334/http://www.eyetap.org/cyborgs/manuals/soft_vga.pdf|archive-date=2015-08-16|author=Cyrix|title=VGA Function Specification GXm/MXi Processors|date=1998-01-16}}</ref> Since this is usually used by [[16-bit]] [[x86]] processes operating in real-mode, it is the first half of memory [[x86 memory segmentation|segment]] 0xB800. The text buffer data can be read and written, and [[bitwise operation]]s can be applied. A part of text buffer memory above the scope of the current mode is accessible, but is not shown.\n\nThe same physical addresses are used in [[protected mode]]. Applications may either have this part of memory mapped to their [[address space]] or access it via the [[operating system]]. When an application (on a modern [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] OS) does not have control over the [[system console|console]], it accesses a part of system RAM instead of the actual text buffer.\n\nFor computers in the 1980s, very fast manipulation <!-- there were some difficulties when same memory was accessed simultaneously by CPU and character generator, but I can\u2019t remember details --> of the text buffer, with the hardware generating the individual pixels as fast as they could be displayed, was extremely useful for a fast UI. Even on relatively modern hardware, the [[computational overhead|overhead]] of text mode emulation via hardware [[All Points Addressable|APA]] (graphics) modes (in which the program generates individual pixels and stores them into the video buffer) may be noticeable.\n\n== Modes and timings ==\n\n=== Video signal ===\nFrom the monitor's side, there is no difference in input signal in a text mode and an [[All Points Addressable|APA]] mode of the same size. A text mode signal may have the same [[video signal timing|timings]] as [[VESA]] standard modes. The same registers are used on adapter's side to set up these parameters in a text mode as in APA modes. The text mode output signal is essentially the same as in graphic modes, but its source is a text buffer and character generator, not a [[framebuffer]] as in APA.\n\n=== PC common text modes ===\nDepending on the graphics adapter used, a variety of text modes are available on [[IBM PC compatible]] computers. They are listed on the table below:<ref name=\"PC Mag\">{{cite book|last=Roschi|first=Winn L.|title=VGA Compatibles: Gaining on the New Standard|journal=PC Mag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeosrkjnlM8C&pg=PA177|date=16 February 1988|publisher=Ziff Davis, Inc.|page=177|issn=0888-8507}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

All colored modes have the same design of text attributes. MDA modes have some specific features (see [[#MDA features|above]])&nbsp;\u2014 a text could be emphasized with bright, underline, reverse and blinking attributes.\n\nThe most common text mode used in DOS environments and initial Windows consoles is the default 80 columns by 25 rows, or 80\u00d725, with 16 colors and 8\u00d716 pixels large characters. VGA cards always have a built-in font of this size whereas other sizes may require downloading a differently sized font.<ref name=\"openbsd\">{{Cite web|url=https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/vga.4|date=1999-03-20|title=OpenBSD Programmer's Manual, vga|quote=16 different colors can be displayed at the same time. Characters are 8\u00d716 pixels large, and a font consists of 256 characters. A built-in font of this size is always present on a VGA card.}}</ref> This mode was available on practically all [[IBM]] and compatible personal computers.\n\nTwo other VGA text modes, 80\u00d740 and 80\u00d750, exist but are less common. [[Windows NT 4.0]] displayed its system messages during the boot process in 80\u00d750 text mode.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApzVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|author=Olga Kokoreva|title=Windows XP Registry: A Complete Guide to Customizing and Optimizing Windows XP|quote=On obvious difference between Windows 2000/XP and Windows NT 4.0 is the fact that all system messages that appear during the Windows NT 4.0 boot process are displayed in 80\u00d750 text mode, while Windows 2000 and Windows XP display these messages in VGA mode.}}</ref>\n\nCharacter sizes and graphical resolutions for the extended [[VESA BIOS Extensions|VESA]]-compatible [[Super VGA]] text modes are manufacturer's dependent. Some cards (e.g. [[S3 Graphics|S3]]) supported custom very large text modes, like 132\u00d743 and 132\u00d725.<ref name=\"S3 manual\">{{Cite web|url=https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200413190535/https://web.aub.edu.lb/pub/os/drivers/VGA/S3VIRGE1/375/VC963-3D.TXT|archive-date=2020-04-13|author=S3 Graphics|title=VC963-3D (S3 ViRGE/DX) User Manual|quote=The S3 ViRGE supports 132\u00d743 and 132\u00d725 extended text modes for text applications.

This is particularly useful for [[Computer monitor#Screen size|large]] (\u2265&nbsp;17\") monitors, where the normal 80&times;25 VGA text mode's 720&times;400 pixel resolution is far lower than a typical graphics mode would be. SVGATextMode allows setting of the [[pixel clock]] and higher [[refresh rate]], larger font size, cursor size, etc., and allows a better use of the potential of a video card and monitor. In non-Windows systems, the use of SVGATextMode (or alternative options such as the [[Linux framebuffer]]) to obtain a sharp text is critical for [[LCD monitor]]s of [[1280\u00d71024]] (or higher resolution) because none of so named standard text modes fits to this matrix size. SVGATextMode also allows a fine tuning of video signal timings.\n\nDespite the name of this program, only a few of its supported modes conform to SVGA (i.e. VESA) standards.\n\n== General restrictions ==\nVGA text mode has some hardware-imposed limitations. Because these are too restrictive for modern (post 2000) applications, the hardware text mode on VGA compatible video adapters only has a limited use.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Parameter\n !

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures.

The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the [[Yukon Territory]], despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire.\n\nOne theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal [[instinct]]s. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man.\n\nThe protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story.<ref name=\"story\" />\n\n\"[[Perseverance (virtue)|Perseverance]]\" Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described \u201cHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.\u201d <ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/perseverance-theme.html|title=To Build a Fire Theme of Perseverance|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wisdom and Experience]]\" Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Welsh |first1=James |title=Masterplots II: Short Story Series |journal=Revised Edition |date=2004 |volume=1 |pages=1\u20133 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.unh-proxy01.newhaven.edu:2048/lrc/detail/detail?vid=6&sid=2ee11b99-9eb2-45d3-9942-5949eaec8c5a%40pdc-v-sessmgr03&bdata=JnNpdGU9bHJjLWxpdmU%3d#AN=103331MSS23119240001174&db=lfh |accessdate=16 April 2019}}</ref> Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: \u201cThe dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=\"To Build a Fire\" |date=29 May 1902 |url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/to-build-a-fire/themes.html|title=To Build a Fire Themes|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> \n\nStupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bowen |first1=James |title='To Build a Fire': Epistemology and the White Wilderness |journal=Western American Literature |date=1971 |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=287\u2013289|doi=10.1353/wal.1971.0004 }}</ref> Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going.\n\nSuccumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain.\n\nIndividualism is another common theme London portrays in the story. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commons.lib.jmu.edu/cgi/cview.cgi/jmurj/vol4/iss1/7|title=James Madison University \u2013 Log in |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |website=commons.lib.jmu.edu |url-access=registration |access-date=2018-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==1902 version==\nThe earlier version was first published in ''[[The Youth's Companion]]'' on May 29, 1902.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=London |first=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |url=http://london.sonoma.edu/writings/Uncollected/tobuildafire.html |magazine=Youth's Companion |volume=76 |date=May 29, 1902 |access-date=April 16, 2019 |via=London.Sonoma.edu}} Full text of the first, more juvenile version.</ref> It differs in some details, though the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.\n\n==Films==\n*''[[:fr:Construire un feu (film, 1928)|Construire un feu]]'' (1927\u20131928) is an early short film by [[Claude Autant-Lara]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unifrance.org/film/34430/construire-un-feu |title=Construire un feu |language=fr |website=UNIFRANCE |access-date=2019-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0019787/combined |title=Construire un feu (1930) |website=Internet Movie Database}}</ref> \n*''To Build a Fire'' (1969) was made by [[David Cobham]], with [[Ian Hogg (actor)|Ian Hogg]] as the man and [[Orson Welles]] as the narrator.<ref name=\"Yahoo\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800395257/info |title=To Build a Fire (1969) |website=Yahoo!

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero [[boreal forest]] of the [[Yukon|Yukon Territory]]. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends\u2014ignoring warnings from an older man [an elder from the Sulphur Creek]<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |last1=London |first1=Jack |title=To Build a Fire |date=29 May 1902 Hundesohn|url=https://americanenglish.state.gov/files/ae/resource_files/to-build-a-fire.pdf.}}</ref> about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building one fire and leaving it to venture on in his journey he later on attempts to build another fails, and tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fail both. He slips into [[unconsciousness]] and dies of [[hypothermia]].\n\nThe 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent [[frostbite]] and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person.\n\nThe 1908 \"To Build a Fire\" is an oft-cited example of the [[naturalism (literature)|naturalist movement]] that portrays the conflict of [[Man vs. Nature|man vs. nature]]. It also reflects what London learned in the [[Yukon Territory]].\n\n==1908 version plot==\nAn unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the [[Yukon River]] on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to \u221275&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u221259&nbsp;\u00b0C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large [[husky]] dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\"the boys\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening.\n\nAt half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire\u2014this one under a tree\u2014in order to dry himself. As he pulls twigs from the brush pile around the tree to feed the flames, the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of [[hypothermia]], imagining himself standing with \"the boys\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp.\n\n==Character relationships==\nThe protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek is seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ulicne|first1=Chris|title=The Unmentioned|url=http://blogs.setonhill.edu/ChristopherUlicne/coursework007137.html|website=Stone Hill College|accessdate=5 April 2018}}</ref> The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fleissner|first1=Jennifer|title=\"To Build a Fire\": An Environmentalist Interpretation|url=http://americainclass.org/to-build-a-fire-an-environmentalist-interpretation/|website=America In Class|accessdate=5 April 2018|date=January 2013}}</ref> The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit.

In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the [[Go-Ahead London]] trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nIn October 2009, Go-Ahead completed the purchase of [[East Thames Buses]] from [[Transport for London]] and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.\n\nIn March 2012, [[First London]]'s [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]] garage was purchased. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]] depots in [[Croydon]] and [[Orpington]]  were integrated into London General. On 25 April 2014, the [[Vehicle and Operator Services Agency]] formally increased London General's licence to accommodate the Metrobus buses.<ref>[http://issuu.com/goaheadlondon/docs/bus_talk_-_issue_27_-_april_2014 Go-Ahead London welcomes Metrobus garages into fold] ''[[Bus Talk]]'' issue 27 April 2014</ref><ref>\"Metrobus within Go-Ahead London\" ''The London Bus'' ([[London Omnibus Traction Society]]) issue 598 June 2014 page 7</ref><ref>\"Go-Ahead London\" ''[[Buses Magazine]]'' issue 713 August 2014 page 71</ref> However, as at September 2014, the buses continued to carry Metrobus branding.\n\n==Garages==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2019}}\nLondon General operates 9 bus garages.\n\n===Sutton (A)===\nAs at February 2020, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 80|80]], [[London Buses route 93|93]], [[London Buses route 151|151]], [[London Buses route 154|154]], [[London Buses route 164|164]] (partial Sunday allocation only), [[London Buses route 213|213]].<ref name=Busroutes>[https://www.goaheadlondon.com/routes] Go-Ahead London </ref>\n\n====History====\nOpened by the [[London General Omnibus Company]] in January 1924 at cost of \u00a330,000, Sutton garage had a capacity for 100 buses. During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the [[London Underground|Underground]] to [[Morden]] and major house-building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 Utility [[Daimler Company|Daimlers]] (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] at a yard in [[Colliers Wood]] (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001, including 10 buses subcontracted to [[Surrey County Council]].\n\nSutton also helped when Carshalton garage closed in 1964.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Putney (AF)===\n[[File:AF garage.jpg|thumb|[[London General#Putney (AF)|Putney bus garage]]]]\nAs of March 2020, [[Putney]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 14|14]], [[London Buses route 22|22]], [[London Buses route 74|74]], [[London Buses route 337|337]], [[London Buses route 424|424]], [[London Buses route 430|430]], [[London Buses route 639|639]], [[London Buses route 670|670]], [[London Buses route N22|N22]] and [[London Buses route N74|N74]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nWith its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.\n\n===Merton (AL)===\nAs at February 2020, [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 44|44]], [[London Buses route 57|57]], [[London Buses route 131|131]], [[London Buses route 152|152]], [[London Buses route 163|163]], [[London Buses route 164|164]], [[London Buses route 200|200]], [[London Buses route 219|219]], [[London Buses route 270|270]], [[London Buses route 280|280]], London bus route 718 and [[London Buses route 655|655]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" /> It also runs the [[St. Bede's School]] private bus services 514 and 519, which run between the [[Caterham]] area and the school, on behalf of [[Surrey County Council]].\n\n====History====\nThe garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.\n\nThe garage has become [[Go-Ahead London]]'s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, [[Mitcham]] and the acquisition of the former pub ([[King's Head, Merton]]) next door.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Croydon (C)===\nAs at August 2019, [[Croydon]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 119|119]], [[London Buses route 127|127]], [[London Buses route 202|202]], [[London Buses route 355|355]], [[London Buses route 359|359]], [[London Buses route 403|403]], [[London Buses route 405|405]], [[London Buses route 434|434]], [[London Buses route 455|455]] and [[London Buses route X26|X26]]<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nThe Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house [[London Buses route 127|route 127]] which had been surrendered early by [[Centra (bus company)|Centra]].

In the first few days of operation the garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement program for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. \n\nMore work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead which increased the PVR to 110 buses. In the early 1970s the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell. In 1984 Stockwell was chosen to conduct comparative testing on route 170, consisting of [[MCW Metrobus]]es, [[Leyland Titan (B15)|Leyland Titans]], [[Leyland Olympian]]s, [[Dennis Dominator]]s, and [[Volvo Ailsa]]s.

Harris Bus went into receivership in 2000, and its routes and garage were taken over by London Buses under the guise of East Thames Buses. East Thames Buses remained a subsidiary of London Buses, taking over routes from defunct operators such as [[Durham Travel Services|London Easylink's]] [[London Buses route 42|42]] and [[London Buses route 185|185]] when this company ceased operating in 2002. Following the move to Mandela Way the engineering is now done there, however limited engineering facilities exist at Belvedere.\n\nIn October 2009, East Thames Buses was sold to Go-Ahead London. As a result of the purchase by Go-Ahead some route and allocation movements have taken or are due to take place.\n\nEven though Belvedere was a London General Garage it operated as a satellite of [[London Central]]'s Bexleyheath garage. All of Belvedere's engineering and fleet and staff management was done at or organised by Bexleyheath.\n\nBelvedere Garage closed on 1 December 2017 when the lease expired. Routes 180 and N1 transferred to the recently opened [[London Central#Morden Wharf (MG)|Morden Wharf]] bus garage in Greenwich, while Routes 244 and 669 transferred to Bexleyheath.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline|London General (bus company)|London General}}\n* [http://www.londongeneral.co.uk/ Company website]\n\n{{London bus operators}}\n{{Go-Ahead Bus Companies}}\n\n[[Category:Go-Ahead Group London bus operators]]\n[[Category:1989 establishments in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a bus company|the accent spoken in south-eastern England|Estuary English}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=February 2019}}\n{{unreliable sources|date=February 2019}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2019}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=May 2017}}\n{{Infobox Bus transit\n|name            =\n|logo            = London General logo.png\n|logo_size       = 150\n|image           = London General buses LT60 (LTZ 1060) & E176 (SN61 BHJ, route 11, 13 October 2013.jpg\n|image_size      = 250\n|image_caption   = [[New Routemaster]] & [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] on [[Whitehall]] in October 2013\n|company_slogan  =\n|parent          = [[Go-Ahead Group]]\n|founded         = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1989|4|1}}\n|headquarters    = [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]\n|locale          =\n|service_area    = [[Greater London]]\n|service_type    = Bus services\n|hubs            =\n|stations        =\n|depots          = 10\n|lounge          =\n|fleet           =\n|ridership       =\n|fuel_type       =\n|operator        =\n|ceo             =\n|website         = [http://www.goaheadlondon.com/ www.goaheadlondon.com]}}\n'''London General''' is a bus company operating services in [[Greater London]].

In August 2008, Go-Ahead's London bus operations all adopted the [[Go-Ahead London]] trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo.\n\nIn October 2009, Go-Ahead completed the purchase of [[East Thames Buses]] from [[Transport for London]] and incorporated it into London General. Although Transport for London's normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.\n\nIn March 2012, [[First London]]'s [[Northumberland Park, London|Northumberland Park]] garage was purchased. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]] depots in [[Croydon]] and [[Orpington]]  were integrated into London General.

During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the [[London Underground|Underground]] to [[Morden]] and major house-building projects in the area. Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 Utility [[Daimler Company|Daimlers]] (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] at a yard in [[Colliers Wood]] (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001, including 10 buses subcontracted to [[Surrey County Council]].\n\nSutton also helped when Carshalton garage closed in 1964.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Putney (AF)===\n[[File:AF garage.jpg|thumb|[[London General#Putney (AF)|Putney bus garage]]]]\nAs of March 2020, [[Putney]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 14|14]], [[London Buses route 22|22]], [[London Buses route 74|74]], [[London Buses route 337|337]], [[London Buses route 424|424]], [[London Buses route 430|430]], [[London Buses route 639|639]], [[London Buses route 670|670]], [[London Buses route N22|N22]] and [[London Buses route N74|N74]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nWith its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940 which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was underutilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney in 1963 after the closure of [[Putney Bridge]] garage (F) it started to receive both short and long wheelbase [[AEC Routemaster]]s for its central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005 when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.\n\n===Merton (AL)===\nAs at February 2020, [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 44|44]], [[London Buses route 57|57]], [[London Buses route 131|131]], [[London Buses route 152|152]], [[London Buses route 163|163]], [[London Buses route 164|164]], [[London Buses route 200|200]], [[London Buses route 219|219]], [[London Buses route 270|270]], [[London Buses route 280|280]], London bus route 718 and [[London Buses route 655|655]].<ref name=\"Busroutes\" /> It also runs the [[St. Bede's School]] private bus services 514 and 519, which run between the [[Caterham]] area and the school, on behalf of [[Surrey County Council]].\n\n====History====\nThe garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] was also responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for [[London Buses route 200|route 200]] in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.\n\nThe garage has become [[Go-Ahead London]]'s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, [[Mitcham]] and the acquisition of the former pub ([[King's Head, Merton]]) next door.{{cn|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Croydon (C)===\nAs at August 2019, [[Croydon]] garage operate routes [[London Buses route 119|119]], [[London Buses route 127|127]], [[London Buses route 202|202]], [[London Buses route 355|355]], [[London Buses route 359|359]], [[London Buses route 403|403]], [[London Buses route 405|405]], [[London Buses route 434|434]], [[London Buses route 455|455]] and [[London Buses route X26|X26]]<ref name=\"Busroutes\" />\n\n====History====\nThe Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house [[London Buses route 127|route 127]] which had been surrendered early by [[Centra (bus company)|Centra]].
