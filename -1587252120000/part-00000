G. Wodehouse]], being a sentimental and fanciful young woman to whom [[Bertie Wooster]] periodically finds himself reluctantly engaged.\n\n==Life and character==\n\nThe daughter of [[Sir Watkyn Bassett]] and the cousin of [[List of Jeeves characters#Stiffy Byng|Stephanie \"Stiffy\" Byng]], Madeline has golden hair, a treacly voice, a tinkling, silvery laugh and when she sighs, it sounds \"like the wind going out of a rubber duck\".<ref>Garrison (1991), p. 10.</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 112.</ref> [[Bertie Wooster]] describes her in ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'' as \"a pretty enough girl in a droopy, blonde, saucer-eyed way but not the sort of breath-taker that takes the breath\", though elsewhere he describes her as \"physically in the pin-up class\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 19.</ref><ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1971], ''Much Obliged Jeeves'', chapter 1, p. 9.</ref> He also notes that she is excessively mushy and fanciful, regularly espousing whimsical beliefs about gnomes and stars. She plays piano and is apt to sing folk songs, especially when she is trying to cheer herself up.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 22, p. 186.</ref> She was educated at [[Roedean School|Roedean]]. Madeline enjoys reading [[Christopher Robin]] and [[Winnie the Pooh]] and the works of [[Rosie M. Banks]].<ref>Cawthorne (2013), p. 203.</ref> Inspired by the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] to become a vegetarian, she nonetheless has no knowledge of cooking.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1963], ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 20, p. 171.</ref>\n\nWhile generally calm, she is capable of giving out an angry glare that could match even that of Bertie's [[Aunt Agatha]]. Bertie is surprised to learn this in ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'', when he asks her hypothetically what would happen if [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] ate steak and kidney pie (against her wish for him to be vegetarian). She questions Bertie if Gussie has been doing so. As Bertie states: \"I had never supposed that she had it in her to give anyone a piercing look, but that is what she gave me now. I don't think even Aunt Agatha's eyes have bored more deeply into me.\"<ref>Wodehouse (1963), ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'', chapter 12, p. 115.</ref>\n\nHer first appearance is in ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]''. She meets and befriends Angela Travers and also meets Angela's cousin Bertie Wooster during a stay in [[Cannes]]. She mistakenly believes that Bertie is in love with her and is gazing at her with long, dumb, searching looks. When he tries to tell her subtly that \"someone\" (Gussie Fink-Nottle) has feelings for her, Madeline incorrectly thinks that Bertie is talking about himself.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 114.</ref> To his great relief, she turns him down, as she is in love with Gussie; she assures Bertie that, if ever her engagement to Gussie were to fail, Bertie is the first person she would look to as a replacement fianc\u00e9. Since Bertie's personal code does not allow him to insult her by correcting her misunderstanding or rejecting her offer, he is thereafter under threat of having to marry her if she rejects her first choice.\n\nShe becomes engaged (and disengaged) frequently in the novels, having idealistic standards that sometimes her fianc\u00e9 cannot live up to. She becomes engaged to Bertie and Gussie in ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'' and to Bertie and then back to Gussie in ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]''. Her engagement to Gussie holds during ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'', in which she visits an old friend of hers, Hilda Gudgeon, with whom she was educated at Roedean. Gussie later elopes with Emerald Stoker and Madeline becomes engaged variously to Bertie and [[Roderick Spode]] (Lord Sidcup) in ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves'' and again to Bertie and then back to Spode in ''[[Much Obliged, Jeeves]]''. Ultimately, she is engaged to Spode and appears to be on her way to becoming the next Countess of Sidcup.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 22.</ref>\n\n==Appearances==\nMadeline appears in:\n\n* ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'' (1934)\n* ''[[The Code of the Woosters]]'' (1938)\n* ''[[The Mating Season (novel)|The Mating Season]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]'' (1963)\n* ''[[Much Obliged, Jeeves]]'' (1971)\n\nMadeline is mentioned in:\n\n* ''[[Aunts Aren't Gentlemen]]'' (1974) (ch. 7)\n\n==Quotes==\nMadeline is distinctive for her maudlin and fanciful statements, illustrated by the following examples.<ref>Ring & Jaggard (1999), p. 159.</ref>\n\nDirect speech:\n* \"'Every time a fairy sheds a tear, a wee bit star is born in the Milky Way.'\"<ref name=\"Wodehouse RH\">Wodehouse (2008) [1934], ''Right Ho, Jeeves'', chapter 10, p. 111.</ref>\n* \"'When I was a child, I used to think that rabbits were gnomes, and that if I held my breath and stayed quite still, I should see the fairy queen.'\"<ref name=\"Wodehouse RH\"/>\n* \"'Beautiful smiling flowers, all wet with the morning dew.

History ==\n===Beginnings (2014\u20132018)===\nHarlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from [[Kennington]], with many of them going to Tenison\u2019s School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThe group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|title=Them Pretty New Blocks: Drill Music and Gentrification in South London|website=Crack Magazine|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903022103/https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|archive-date=2019-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|title=Get Familiar With UK Drill, the New Sound Exploding on the Streets of London|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611131706/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|archive-date=2019-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 member AM released the song \"Attempted 1.0\" in 2018.

History ==\n===Beginnings (2014\u20132017)===\nHarlem Spartans started making music in 2014, using a local youth centre as a music studio. Most artists within Harlem Spartans are from [[Kennington]], with many of them going to Tenison\u2019s School in Oval. Musically, like much of UK drill music, their music contains references to their local area, violence, references to beef with other groups, and is often riddled with slang.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThe group is known for its beef with Brixton-based group 410.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|title=Them Pretty New Blocks: Drill Music and Gentrification in South London|website=Crack Magazine|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903022103/https://crackmagazine.net/article/long-reads/them-pretty-new-blocks-drill-music-and-gentrification-in-south-london/|archive-date=2019-09-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|title=Get Familiar With UK Drill, the New Sound Exploding on the Streets of London|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190611131706/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/01/uk-drill-sl-harlem-spartans-67-essay|archive-date=2019-06-11|url-status=live}}</ref> The beef has been expressed through various diss tracks, and has at times escalated to physical violence. 410 member AM released the song \"Attempted 1.0\" in 2018. The song contained many direct references to violence towards Harlem Spartans members. [[Skengdo & AM]], members of 410, were later given a gang injunction from the police that banned them from entering Kennington or mentioning rival gangs in their music.\n\n===Rise to fame and success of Harlem Spartans (2018\u2013present)===\nProminent songs from the group include \"Call Me a Spartan\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> \"Kennington Where It Started\",<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and Loski's songs \"Cool Kid\", \"Hazards\", and \"Forrest Gump\", the latter of which entered the charts. In April of 2018, Loski released his mixtape ''Call Me Loose.''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|title=The Break Presents: Loski - XXL|last=Rathod|first=Nikita|website=XXL Mag|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523214845/https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/10/loski-interview-the-break/|archive-date=2019-05-23|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|title=Drill Artist Loski Is Dripping with Flair|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=2019-01-11|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212162720/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/ev3y4p/loski-boasy-new-video-track-interview-2019|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nCanadian artist [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] has publicly stated he is a 'fan' of Harlem Spartans,<ref name=\"auto5\" /> and has posted Harlem Spartan music lyrics onto his social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|title=Blanco - Return Of Bourne|date=2019-02-01|website=Choice For Music UK Radio|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034430/https://choiceradio.co.uk/blanco-return-of-bourne/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, Drake appeared on-stage alongside Harlem Spartans member Loski.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|title=Loski Arrest Rumours: Rapper Appears In Snapchat Video 'Filmed In Prison Cell'|website=Capital XTRA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191212034419/https://www.capitalxtra.com/news/loski-arrested-harlem-spartans-rumours/|archive-date=2019-12-12|url-status=live}}</ref> Drake credited Loski as an influence for his [[Scorpion (Drake album)|Scorpion]] album.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Members ==\nThe list below includes confirmed members of Harlem Spartans.
